I drove out to see for myself, but when I arrived at these 2 locations, I saw only navigation lights of aircraft so high up that I assume they were airliners. After midnight, I had parked my car 5 miles east of Blue Springs, NE, and observed the sky from 0:15 to 1:30 am. At 0:45, my attention was focused on a bright yellow star (Arcturus), when my peripheral vision alerted me to motion on my left side. I immediately looked left and saw a fairly bright dot of white light above the top of a hill just ahead of me. It dropped behind the hill so quickly that it was visible for less than a second. I waited for 10 minutes to see if it would reappear. When it didn’t, I drove up to the top of the hill, but saw only outdoor lights of 2 nearby farms. The ‘dropping orb’ appeared as a perfectly round dot, unlike any meteor fireball I’ve ever seen. I continued to watch the sky until 1:30 am, but saw nothing else.

"Cylindrical Shaped UFO w/ Bright Reflective Panels Hovers Over Ft.

Walton Beach, Florida On Thursday morning, 23 September 2021, my family and I waded in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico on the shoreline of Fort Walton Beach on Okaloosa Island, Florida, behind the Marriott Fairfield Inn & Suites, where we stayed for our trip to the area.  Fairfield Inn & Suites is located at 540 Santa Rosa Boulevard, in Ft. Walton Beach, Florida.  We had flown into Pensacola International Airport the previous evening, and Thursday morning around 09:00 AM was our first opportunity to walk and explore along the beach behind the hotel, and enjoy the warm Gulf waters and look for shells.  The sky was clear and beautiful, with the Sun shining high and bright in the eastern part of the sky, a prelude to the nice day ahead of us.  Shortly after 10:00 AM local time, Central Standard Time (CST) [11:00 AM EST], we started to head back to the beach access boardwalk, and return to the hotel.  My wife and daughter were ahead of me, as I looked out towards the sky across the Gulf waters.  There were a few other people standing approximately 50-60 feet out beyond the shoreline in the water, when I spotted a faint dark object in the sky above them.  The object appeared to maneuver closer towards the beach.  I have followed military and civil aviation developments since my childhood and recognize a broad variety of fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.  I was therefore naturally curious to see what aircraft might be approaching the area.  Earlier in the morning, I observed different types of aircraft flying above us, and heading southwards over the Gulf of Mexico, and as I came to note during our stay, there was frequent flight traffic overhead in the Fort Walton/Destin area throughout the day.  I knew that just across the Choctawhatchee Bay, northeast of Fort Walton Beach, there was Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), which conducts development and testing of tactical air weapons and armaments for the U.S. Air Force; and to the West was Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola, the hub of naval aviation training and home of the U.S. Navy Blue Angels aerobatic demonstration team.  Further down the eastern coastline, close to Panama City, was Tyndall AFB, which houses the 325th Fighter Wing that! trains all F-22 Raptor pilots, and in the past hosted the Air Force’s biennial William Tell air-to-air weapons competition.  I stopped walking in the sand and stood silently facing the water to see if I could recognize the vehicle in the sky that was approaching us overhead.  I didn’t call out to my wife and daughter, because I assumed this was a conventional aircraft, and that was of no interest to them.  It is also for this reason that I did not immediately pull out my mobile phone from my pocket, to take pictures or a video of the object, as I had already taken pictures of my family while we hunted for sea shells and other things.  As the object approached closer to the beach, I observed it was a cylindrical shaped object, hovering nearly vertical in the sky, at a slight angle tilting forward.  It was black or a dark color, with some panel lines that could be made out in the bright sky.  The vehicle featured shiny longer extensions that protruded at the upper end from either side of its thin tube-shaped body.  These extensions reflected bright in the clear morning sky, almost as if they glowed ! at irregular intervals.  They looked similar to solar panels extending from the sides of a space satellite.  The object made no apparent sound that I could hear, although it appeared to hover above the water at a distance of about 500 feet, and perhaps 700 feet in the air.  As I viewed the shape and configuration of this object, I tried to associate its features with an aircraft, manned or unmanned, that I might be familiar with, so I could clearly reference it.  I did initially think this might be a new type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and perhaps a hovering helicopter drone, similar to what I believe the U.S. Navy experimented with in the past – I think back in the 1990s – to provide a shipborne scout and reconnaissance drone.  That vehicle had a set of coaxial rotor blades aerodynamically integrated into a fairly large curvy, hourglass-shaped body, but which never made it into production.  I could not remember the manufacturer or the designation of that vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicle but could probably be referenced in a past Jane’s All the World’s Aircraft volume.  The object in the sky appeared to have a conceptual resemblance to this past defense project, at first.  I initially thought that, because of the protruding p! anels that, from a distance, and when the vehicle was at a level perspective, appeared to be in the shape of rotating blades, like a conventional helicopter.  In addition to its protruding extensions, the vehicle had several needle-like extensions below the cylindrical body that were angled outwards; maybe antenna or sensors of some kind.  However, since the object made no sound, and there was no downwash from any turning rotor blades onto the surface of the water, it quickly became clear to me that this was not a conventional air vehicle moving in the sky but something else.  Moreover, it appeared to observe the aforementioned people in the water, close to the shoreline.  Had the object made any apparent sound, those people would have turned their heads to the sky to also view what I was seeing from the beach.  But they did not; the 2-3 people in the water were oblivious to the hovering object in the sky that was closing in on them, from what I could tell, and continued to talk and go about their business, uninterrupted.  I called out to wife and daughter that I was observing something in the sky that I wanted them to see.  I did say that I thought it might be a UFO, or unidentified flying object, or some kind of unknown type of UAV.  My wife stopped walking, as she was almost at the beach access ramp, and turned around to walk back towards me, and see what I was watching.  She called out for me to take a video of it, and I reached down into my pocket to grab my phone and activate the video mode.  During this time, I observed how the object came to what was probably its closest point to the beach, possibly around 400 feet within the beach and 500 feet in altitude, and hovered at an angle to “observe” the people in the water.  It rotated slightly around its axis, as the protruding silver-colored panels reflected bright against the sunlight.  The people below took no visible note of the vehicle, from what I could discern.  Judging by the altitude and distance of the object to the people in the water, I roughly estimated the main body of the vehicle to be larger than a 6-foot tall man, possibly around 8-10 feet in height, with the total span across the panels measuring approximately 15-18 feet.  The most peculiar aspect of this encounter was that the object then appeared to “notice” that I had observed its presence, and as I tried to point my cellphone to the sky in its direction, the vehicle took off at great speed out over the water into the Gulf.  It made no sound as it flew out, to quickly put a large distance between it and the shoreline.  By the time I had activated the video camera on my phone and recorded as closely as a I could zoom in onto the object, it was already far out over the water, perhaps at a distance of over 3,000 feet away from the beach.  The video has a creation timestamp of 10:04 AM CST [11:04 AM EST], and has a runtime of 45 seconds. Due to the bright daylight of the morning Sun, it was difficult to make out the object in the sky with my cellphone and focus in on it.  It was also challenging to clearly view anything on the phone screen, let alone see small, faint objects that the camera might acquire.  The only reference point in the sky I had was to note the object’s reflection, so I would not entirely miss recording the event.  As I pointed the lens of my phone camera in the object’s approximate direction, I was able to catch intermittent glimpses of the distant object, as its panels reflected back sunlight in the clear sky, but no details of the vehicle in the video can be discerned.  As the object flew away from the beach, it seems to have also moved east and westwards some degrees across the Gulf sky, since I had trouble locating it while panning my phone around.  The entire encounter lasted approximately three minutes.  To my knowledge, the object did not return during the time that we stayed at Fort Walton Beach, nor did I have any other encounters with unknown types of air vehicles during this trip.  The object I saw on 09/23/21 was not of a design or had features that were anything similar to a conventional aircraft, with no apparent energy source and control surfaces to provide lift, and that would allow it to fly or hover in the manner it displayed.  It appeared to me to be under intelligent control.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,30.438377777777777,-86.6292269005848

Hello I live in west Dearborn Michigan bordering Detroit. I've been watching the skys every night and I kept telling my daughter I would love to spot a ufo one day then it happened! My daughter was screaming telling me come see there's a ufo. When I came outside all I saw was streaks in the sky that are something I've never seen before. First I thought they were clouds but they weren't because it was a clear day with no clouds in the sky. Then I thought it was a jet trail but it couldn't be because they were to many of them on top of each other and some of them were not connected. I told her it's not a ufo because they are not moving then I looked up and saw a black object flying high in the sky around planes and it looked like a mother ship with another smaller object that seemed to hover around the bigger object and maybe even through it. It's definitely not a plane it had no lights or sound. It was the most amazing thing I ever saw. I'm wondering if the s! treaks in the sky had something to do with the unidentified flying objects flying but im everyone I ask tells me you really got something here that's unique.,2021-10-19T00:00:00,42.317738992042436,-83.21002201591511

What we saw: Five extremely bright lights moving (flying ?) in a circular flight pattern which defied normal aircraft flight patterns and maneuvering (to include helicopters). The leader would disappear and circle around to come back in the picture frame on the right. The four kept equal separation/distance apart from one another. The leader would reappear from the right to rejoin the four. Appeared to be helicopters with bright lights when I zoomed in on one of the still pictures- also when the video is run in slow motion.  I've never seen anything like it before during my days of flying Huey's in the Corps and having a commercial pilots license (helicopter and fixed wing). Night formation flying is difficult- as you know- especially when the lead appears to shut off its light(s) and makes a fast turn to the right and returns to the formation on the right of the picture.

I got through the tunnels that go through a hillside on the road traveled. After I exit the tunnels, I had seen something in my rearview mirror. It was pretty bright and caught my attention. It looked like a falling star possibly but had like what looked to be the after effects of fireworks in the sky. Imagine those two things put together and that's what I had seen. I tried to talk myself out of thinking I seen anything abnormal and chalked it up to im sure it was just a glare from the lights of the tunnels I just exited. It was not until my traveling home that I seen this unidentified object in the sky. I hit about the halfway point traveling home from Elko, back to Carlin. The halfway point as I call it is known as the Hunter exit. It is a remote area, not much there. I get past this exit a ways and still before e! ntering the tunnels and I see this light outside my passenger side window. It looked too bright to be a star, moved too fast to be a plane, and it kind of just hovered really closely over the hillside. I was thinking what it could possibly be but nothing seemed to explain it logically. I studied this object while driving along and finally just decided to focus on the road and quit distracting myself for a while then when I looked over once again a ways down the road, itbwas gone. So, it wasn't until I get off the exit to Carlin, I see this light yet again and start to question my sanity. I stopped at the end of the first exit to Carlin and studied this object for a minute. I then continue home and decided I'm going to record this travel because the light was not disappearing and I start to think Whoa, I am really looking at a possible UFO right now. It cant be. I recorded this short travel from the exit to my home because I'm wanting to tell my parents at this point and the! y will think I'm crazy. I have the series of videos. If anythi! ng im ho ping they will tell me what it is or might be. I reach my home and got out of my vehicle and stare at this unidentified light for a while longer before I decided it was weird the thing had not disappeared yet and that they possibly seen me too and ran in my home. I decided to ignore it and hope they didn't come abduct me someday if I pretended nothing ever happened. (HAHAHA) This is really what was crossing my mind though.

Alien walking on the other side of the street.  It notices me looking and runs.  (appearance later explained)  Day 2:  Sunday 3:30 AM.  I hear the gate open and close after hearing noises in the back yard.  I placed my phone recording on the window and record:  5 UFO.  2x metallic black with red glow, cone with dome roof, altitude 70 feet, 30+ minutes stationary.  1x blinking white light in the distance.  2x white streaks of glittery bright light accelerating up at +-60 MPH in between the metallic black UFO and making those metallic black UFO appear silver.  Day 2 and 3 :  Sunday 9:30 PM.  On house cameras with light pole above it a light illuminated figure is walking down my whole driveway.  (5 feet tall, crouch walking with knees very forward, leaning body forward, arms nearly scraping the ground.  I go and shine my light outside and don’t find it. Note:  The alien is only visible here because the light pole is above it and it is a walking light illuminated figure much like seen on day 1, does not trigger a record but I took a picture.  Does not trigger a light sensor either.  Invisibility cloak.  We have this technology on Earth patented.  Day 4:  Tuesday 20:  Rattle on the second fence door (not under a light pole.)  Day 5:  Wednesday 21:  I open both gates.  I leave some pictures:  It’s UFOs (rip black ink), human person with a invisibility cloak shield in front of their legs, and a give take image + a light on the outside table.  Tall darkened light 5 feet+ seen at the table.  I knock on the window and it runs.  Also one of these days I think wednesday there was a flicker of light in the garage in a specific area with the door open it casts a light on the ground as I saw on house camera.  No record trigger.  I brake the hard drive the day before dropping it trying to get better reception because cameras were cutting out.  At a most unfortunate time also.  Day 6:  Thursday 22:  I open the gate and place pictures of human trading and speaking with alien figure, and some technology images.  I notice it move the papers on phone camera recording (doesn’t trigger garage lights sensor) I come outside quietly and wave at it while outside.  It grabs the paper runs into a corner and looks at it more while something is clicking, drops it and runs my way fast past me because there is no light pole and out the fence door, humming sound and red light visible on garage door reflection 20 MPH sideways and slightly up.  Ozone smell. Thursday mid day:  I visit the CPD, file a crazy report but with evidence apparently they contacted NASA.   (I noticeb some suspiciously low flying Boeing “rented?” planes turning pulling some gravity Sunday.)  I also tried many military bases phone calls and only one was somewhat helpful.  NY USAF base that almost scrambled jets until I told then wait wait wait this was a few days ago so they hung up before I could explain that it happens every night.  I took my fathers phone because my sim card is locked as I swapped it to a older less damaged phone.  My drunk father tries drilling out my door lock as I’m making panic calls.  I call CPD because of what my father was doing.  5/6 police arrive they watch the videos they say they contacted NASA already, I get investigated by two from a hospital and they also see the evidence so they say nothing is wrong.  Police stay until 9 ish PM and leave.  I later in the morning notice I have a burn on my arms , none under my shirt, and s! ome foot pain.  I panic thinking it’s radiation after 12 hours of exposure and call non emergency CPD number and chug iodized salt, saying the idiot flew over my head and I have radiation/chemical burns and my foot hurts.  They come and say yeah that is a burn and get me a ambulance to a hospital.  Because I’m talking about aliens and came with CPD they put me on psychiatric watch for 12 hours, deny me iodine tablets, deny me radiation checks, deny me a lawyer call, tell me to shut up when I try to say why they put me there and how it’s a mistake.  It was filthy in there.  They probably don’t follow any sanitary laws.  I need to sue the hospital.  The reason the police came with was so I could give a report of the chemical/radiation I think, or thats why they should have been there because they told me they received word that the other shift told them of the UFO sighting and me when they arrived.  Day 7 Friday 23:  I place a drawing showing UFO flyover person burnt and hurt leg.  I don’t go outside.  Day 8 Saturday 24:  I don’t go outside.  Shortly before sunset there is something in my basement as I’m setting the laundry.  It moves back when I look at the glare 3 feet away but barely saw anything except that one glare on it’s face.  I go up, then I come down whistling and lock the doors.  It was still inside in my basement.  There was also a glare in my room head level walking out I don’t remember if before or after.  Day 9 Sunday AM.  Before sunrise banging on the door on phone video, fence door shuts before this.  I record minutes before I think it came out there were three silver light emitting drone sized cones with dome roof inches from one another above a house and in front of a tree.  Very electric interference in the recording.  Strong ozone smell in my house with doors and windows closed.  I coughed after I inhaled it this time.  I hesitated calling CPD but I did 2 hours after sunrise and the door was unlocked by then.  Also when it was knocking the dog was half barking upstairs (afraid to make noise but barking) I never heard that before form him, and before sunrise.   Note:  They are not hostile.  They don’t steal anything, they come in pairs or more, *so don’t start a war with a species that can easily drop nukes on us from hovering objects by imprisoning one or worse.*  Also note:  Help me sue the hospital because their treatment was horrible and they didn’t bother investigating the reason why the police came with me, and I don’t have money to throw around and bad insurance.  Final note:  Seriously don’t start a war with these things.  I can be the intermediary communication if you want.  I don’t mind them in my house or standing next to me or abducting (I doubt they would.) But if you harm one the others will know.  You don’t want a planetary war.  Anti gravity is real.  The creatures appear almost certainly alien but maybe can be a human pretending but why would anyone do that with this technology demonstrated.  The burn marks could be sunburn, and leg pain could be me running out the window from drunk father. Please inform me before coming.  They become startled VERY easily and come in pairs+.  I can likely arrange some meeting.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,40.862832208588955,-74.14776656441717

They did some kind of scifi twisting and turning at extreme speeds not human in nature or that of an aircraft can perform. It was ""crazy"" looking then they stopped and all started moving again but not moving in unison just the twists were in unison. What was strange also is that when I pause the video when watching it over and over again I can see that the ones that have drifted almost unseen are also twisting and scifi like spinning at the same exact movements as the new ones that are beginning to drift up in the air. Then another 2 or 3 cluster appeared and then another 2 cluster appeared. When the shape of the objects which were all the same when they were not doing the! ""scifi dance"" I have been calling it they all had the same appearance. A glob of light and it looks like attached to the one glob 2 more smaller tiny globs attached to the larger one but NOT CONNECTED. Almost like 3 triangular like globs in one cluster which would equal 1 UFO. 20 UFOs in total. ALl difted up in the same exact direction into the sky but at different paces. ANother strange phenomenon from this same event is that it appeared at the end of the video that one straggler UFO was trying to catch up to the other UFOs it looked like a cute ""baby"" UFO like a child running after its mother and then when it caught up started floating with the others.

These star formatioms move constantly. Then the orbs seem to have somewhat relevance to our house lights for camoflague they are out all day they just blend in and make them selfs look like the environment I have noticed all sorts of weird flying planes which are just ufos in disguise I once saw one chamge from a helocopter to an airplane to a blinking light all along making the various noises these crafts would make but they are silent... They are everywhere here in Oaksboro all the way to charlotte but oakboro I have seen the most. I notice that around sunset they are most active and sunrise they get very active too. Just last night I saw a blue o! rb in a field what looked like a bigfoot holding his hands over the orb I watched this through my telescope. I have seen they can manipulate shadows just like they manipulate the sky. I once saw that a whole field looked like a carnival grounds, I have had so many people watch this with me. There also seems to be some sort of reaction whether or not you are visable to them if they know your watching they are less active. If your hising or inside they are very active. If you mess with them by shining spotlights and flashing lights on a car they will investigate. I also have seen a lot of orbs or lighted objects being shot down from these ships into our atmosphere and to earth. They can make themselfs invisable or light up. A 32 inch sized tv sized orb can dissapear in a blink. They create noise and have some sort of physical being bc they can break branches,the orbs, they arw many colors blue white red orange green. Every night is different but they always come. One form of ! the ufo is there at least all day and night. The clouds seem t! o be sim ulated some days too. I have noticed a entire day of triangle shaped cloud and triangle shaped voids in the clouds with bright lights in the dark gloomy cloud front. Theyre are some that are there everynight and some that just pop up new. I have seen an entire feild lit up with light as the orbs were doing something there. At my house in charlotte I have seen the orbs all in the woods along with in my driveway. They are very sneaky and if u get to close you will get a spider web or water on your face. And head kind of feeling I assume they are trying to communicate to us or just retrieving our knowledge. The orbs seem to go away when you attempt to go after them sometimes. Also they make no noise unless they want to, they can change shapes in binoculars the orbs are pyramid shaped geometric transforming beings with a eye of light they direct. They seem to be investigating us. You can see shadows during the day of triangles and other shapes in trees amd the sky and ground. At! sunrise all the stars will move out and try to do in stealthy but its very noticeable. They do a zigzag maneuver slowly and fastly thinking it will trick us. I feel as if the triangle shaped crafts that are made of 3 star formations dropped the drones to spy on us and the orbs to spy on us to. They dont seem to be maliciously dangerous but they still dont like when you know they are there. They can shoot beams of light out of the orbs.also sometimes you'll see a ""plane"" and its really a triangle shaped ufo that is trying to camouflage themself. They will come all night some nights. I have seen flying car shaped ufos that stopped in mid air Nd dropped down and turmed into red dots. I have seen a car headlights ufo just the headlights not the rest of the car. I feel like these beings have followed me home bc I have noticed a lot more orbs around my house sense being there. These seem to be interdimentional beings. I have seen congregations of apparitions in the woo! ds with my telescope they look like some sort of bluish humano! id alien species I sae these the same night I saw bigfoot in the morning. I also saw that where the bigfoot went to turned into a rock cave sort of place even though there is only trees there. The bigfoot was accompanied by another lizard headed stone bodied type of being.

I started to notice that I could see a small bright light moving quickly across the sky.  I didn’t pay much attention because I thought it had to be the reflection of headlights or my eyes just playing tricks on me.  After about 30 minutes, I realized that it looked to be a star moving side to side and in circles. I started to get concerned thinking maybe someone was outside playing a prank with a Lazer or drone so I woke my boyfriend up to check it out.  Of course, when he tried to see it do anything it stopped moving and he assumed it was a star and went back to bed.  About five minutes later I decided to take a video because I knew no one would believe me unless they saw it for theirselves. At this point it was flickering on and off disappearing completely and showing back up in a different spot. I could see it was pulsating red and blue lights. It started moving in a figure eight motion and then back and forth and then just disappeared. My step dad is also a pilot and the biggest skeptic in the world. I feel like that’s the most credible witness you could ever have and him not being able to explain this just blows my mind. I’ve always been interested in this subject but I never thought I would see something this.

I goto light my cigarette and I look up... & I see a giant triangle formation floating in a circular motion next to the big dippers  spoon. It spun twice , by the time I realized what it was. It had stopped moving & turned a little darker than the night sky. But was still camouflaged. I ran inside.  It scared me because of how large it was. Every morning I see UFOs dark across our skies , but today this was closer than the stars or satellites I end up seeing. Was a little weird.  Thank you for taking the time to read this!",2021-03-02T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

Tramonto Arizona evening Around 7:00 PM Saturday evening 02-06-2021 I went with my father to the grocery store.  We were driving westbound towards highway I-17 on Carefree HWY.  I looked out the drivers side window which would be south and noticed I believe 5 orange fireball like unidentifiable objects. It immediately caught my eye and as we turned left at the intersection we witnessed them changing directions.  Initially they appeared more vertical (although not straight lily vertical but more like a kite but still seemingly together) I noticed about 5 of them. I noticed 2-3 were moving in irregular fashion but still amongst the other and more “up/down” then fully circular. Best way to describe them would be out of position but together.  As we turned left which is South several of the pack I would say 4/5 began to ascend and quickly. When we pulled over I got out of the vehicle to film briefly the 2nd video. The orange fireball seems to hover, probably for 20 seconds maybe 15, and then as it was out of eyesight range in less than 3 seconds likely 2 seconds. I have good eye sight I was able to track it for 1-2 seconds and then it’s as if it hit supersonic speed and was more far than the nearest stars and out of sight. It didn’t burn out, rather it moved so quickly I couldn’t see it almost darting away.  The 4 orange “fireballs” ascended with similar speed but together and the last one stayed behind.  I’ve seen hot air balloons before during the day, and the glow was very much like the fire you’d see that powers a hot air balloon but round - and all of them were similar size. It was a glowing fire not a constant orange but the glow was strong/very defined.  My father retired from the aviation industry and I work in financial services. In Colorado I’ve witnessed similar orange glows which seemed to move across the sky at very high distances - similar to stars in size but I’ve never seen anything this close",2021-03-02T00:00:00,,

And at that take phone out to record this and my phone wouldn't function at all and its never had this issue, but i observed this light for about five or so minutes then suddenly it stop moving side to side and moves across highway above me towards my house and just vanished so with the hair standing up all over i hurry home and just tried not to think about it then went to sleep. 11am later that morning i wake up well rested not even thinking about what i saw earlier in the night, just laying in bed watching tv for about thirty minutes and all of a sudden i get extremely sluggish and drowsy like i been drugged and something was going threw my mind like i was talking to someone briefly don't know exactly what it was about all i can remember is agreeing to and involuntarily nodding my head to not to say anything than i black out for a short moment come too and shockingly i'm having a violent seizure and i feel my arms being restrained.

I couldn’t tell if it was a single object or nine objects together in unison.  There wasn’t a lot of clouds in the sky, a few. So the formation (or object) didn’t stand out like a plane in the sky, but you could definitely see it against the blue sky. The dots were a tad faint, almost like they were glowing, but very lightly. I don’t want to say they were pulsating, but they did come across as glowing.  It had some rotation. Again, not sure if it was a single object in the sky or nine individual objects, but they seemed to move in unison. The rotation was very slow, but it was enough to notice that there was movement.

Then I noticed a plane in the air, but it was flying in a direction I have never seen a plane fly from left to right, and seem like it was flying kind of towards the bright lights in the sky , that was suspended in mid air without moving?

Too warm yellow orange lights dance in dirt across the sky almost every night of the year in a repeatable fashion.,Isleton,CA,2020-01-16T18:20:00,cross,40,"Occurred : 1/16/2020 18:20  (Entered as : 01/16/20 18:20) Reported: 1/16/2020 8:31:40 PM 20:31 Posted: 2/7/2020 Location: Isleton, CA Shape: Cross Duration:40",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/152/S152660.html,"Too warm yellow orange lights dance in dirt across the sky almost every night of the year in a repeatable fashion. The following is a detailed account of my observations of the “craft” in the overhead sky on repeatanle days of any random day of the week on any random week of the year. This report is specific to a single particular date and time, however I have seen the same activity on almost any given day of the year. I have brought numerous friends to the location to verify the veracity of my claims; all have agreed that my statements are accurate.  The following is my eye witness account of events in the night sky above the town of Isleton in California bordering Rio Vista California off of Highway 12. I would imagine that you can share this sighting at any of the locations of Isketon, Rio Vista, Lodi, and up and down Highway 12 between those locations, perhaps all the way to  Suisun City.  My sightings come from the back of my boat which is situated in a marina on the Delta Loop.  Looking out the back of my boat at approximately a 60° angle to the horizon, I can see 2 warm orange lights that are stationary in the sky. On occasion there is a single cool white light usually off to the right of the stationary objects.  It’s not always a guarantee that the third object is present.  These objects appear to be nothing more than airplanes with their usual lighting on them, however I’ve never seen man-made flying craft with such warm orange yellow lighting to it.  These two orange yellow lights will stay at a consistent space apart from each other in a hovering pattern usually completely still. Sometimes they will deviate in there hovering patterns ever so slightly but I cannot tell if that is just cloud cover causing my eyes to trick me or if they are actually moving horizontally. As time goes on eventually these craft will deviate from the covering pattern and fluctuate in altitude significantly going all the way to what is almost the horizon or very near the ground from I can tell at approximately 300 feet above ground. Usually, after about five minutes of this vertical dance, one of the objects, usually the right most object to my position will become stable and again hover. The left most object will then make a rapid travel across the sky in a perfectly straight linear fashion until it has traveled far left out of my sight and is blocked by Marina cover. The remaining craft with it’s warm yellow orange lighting will remain statio! nary for perhaps 60 seconds and then it will travel far left as well, out of sight.  That’s very few minutes has passed, the two objects are back in a group together at the far left but the lighting is very dim and has become more white.  Eventually two warm orange yellow lights will appear exactly where the other two left from. It is unclear to me if the others came back or if these are new ones coming in. The bright white light seems to just stick around and sometimes will move around a bit but and sometimes just flicker and fade out to come back again later.  On some occasions, though not that rare, the two objects dart about the sky in directions of no particular order. It is unlike any human made craft I have ever seen until about six months ago when I was privy to seeing RC style quad colters  fly upwards of 100 mph and able to change directions rapidly. Also similar in-flight pattern to the RC helicopters that are able to perform acrobatic flight patterns. They very much mimic the flight patterns of RC style Quad copters. I am not sure the scale is correct however, due to my not knowing the actual distance Making it challenging to determine scale in the night sky.  When I first saw this, of course I questioned my own sanity in the interpretation of what was going on. I imediately had a friend of mine over to witness this spectacle who was equally as struck by confusion and amazement as was I.  I highly recommend anyone in the area to hang out anywhere on the Delta Loop or in Rio Vista downtown and look to the sky anywhere from 7 PM to 4 AM and you should see exactly what I’ve been reported. It does need to be on a clear night, they don’t seem to exist or non-clear nights.  I’m not aware of any military operations or other rumors or stories going on in this area. However, Travis Air Force Base is nearby and there are stories of strange activity in the Fairfield area as well as Suison City, though I’m not sure if the storytelling has made its way to this more remote area of Solano County.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,38.1642,-121.5935

It’s semi-rural, mostly suburban.  The dogs in the neighborhood had been barking a lot this evening (not unusual, as there are quite a few foxes and occasionally coyotes). I am visiting from New York City and needed to walk my dog down their street because of the activity earlier (dogs barking, coyotes can snack on dogs as small as mine!).  I was on the phone with a friend and it was quite dark on their street (yards have lampposts but no streetlights). The sky can be quite remarkable here as it’s far enough from major light pollution. Tonight the sky was quite mixed with clouds and some stars peeking through with heavier cloud cover to the west.  There are small airports nearby- so I’m used to seeing and hearing small aircraft and larger planes. Mostly all unremarkable- I do believe some folks may also have drones, but it doesn’t track...  I looked west as I was walking the dog after looking up to see Mars overhead (in an area where the clouds were patchy). My eye was drawn west and I saw a red/orange bright light/orb. At first I didn’t pay much attention because, as I said, there are a number of small aircraft consistently out all hours of the day and night in this area. I thought it might be a helicopter, as it was sort of winding and weaving at a relatively consistent altitude about 45’ from the horizon. It was moving in sort of a serpentine fashion. As a New Yorker, I’m very familiar with helicopter flight patterns (and most especially after this summer). The altitude and the brightness of the light (it was an orb) were too bright and also too diffuse for a helicopter. At the size, I would have been able to hear it, even if the wind was in the opposite direction. It wasn’t more than a couple of miles away based on the size (and the altitude).  It weaved back and forth, sometimes appearing to stop. It was a red/orange light- no green visible even as the object appeared to turn and dip. The altitude, like I said, was relatively consistent with some dips.  I ran inside and brought my dad out, we watched it for a few minutes and then went inside to get his star-gazing binoculars (the sky can get dark enough here to enjoy a lot of stars on a clear night). We went through the house and to the back deck with the binoculars. He switched on the porch light and I asked him to turn it off- he did and we looked for the light and it had disappeared. The cloud cover was too high for it to have disappeared through it (high, thick clouds to the west, where we saw it, but not low enough for where this aircraft was to disappear in less than 90 seconds). We went outside immediately (their house is a small ranch).  The object had completely disappeared. I have no good explanation for how it could have moved suddenly that quickly or dropped low enough to be out of eyesight in that minute and a half as we were transitioning through the house. The light was also notable- as I said it was a ruddy sort of light, and quite diffuse. Very weird! Also notable that after the light disappeared, the dogs in the neighborhood seem to have settled down. (Again, probably and very likely unrelated based on the creature activity here)..",2020-12-23T00:00:00,,

Upon arriving home he told me ""whatever you sent to me yesterday crashed my phone when I tried opening it. It won't turn back on."" What I sent to him was video of the craft outside my parents home the previous night….  My husband was already sleeping. I entered our space bedroom to unpack and get ready for bed. I had a feeling to look out the window and right there high up in the sky was a very obvious, round, bright orb that at first was white light but soon changed to blue, flickering between white & blue & green. It was hovering and as I began recording it, it morphed into different shapes; top shaped, disc shaped, then 3 orbs in triangle formation.  Other lights joined it sporadically and flashed on and off at random. Sometimes it disappeared completely only to reappear exactly where it had been hovering. There was a slight, low & dull humming vibration sound in the air as well.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,42.1955,-71.84630000000001

As I scanned the sky I noticed several hairline 'contrails' but not as left by a normal jet. These were rapid, then vanished. I saw about four of these very briefly, just two or three seconds. These lines converged at a similar point, moving at ultra high speed and head South across the Channel.  The next sighting was shortly after. Two White/Silvery objects of undefined shape but NOT round, possibly near rectangular, moving almost side by side. One object slightly larger. The forward object was jinking up and down a tiny bit. The heading distance was South. Altitude unknown, but possibly above 30K Feet. These were visible for around three seconds. They were not 'plant seeds' like dandelion or round airborne seeds which we used to call 'fairy's' in the UK. At a guess, bearing in mind the possible height, these two object could have been travelling at around 2000 mph or thereabouts. Shortly after but higher up, not by much, a brief contrail streak appeared...slightly wriggly looking , perhaps by Vortex, lasted about two seconds then instantly dissolved to nothing. At a guess, the contrail could have been around the height of a normal contrail, perhaps much higher.  Nothing more was seen in that region although I did notice a similar white object drifting West but these were airborne 'Fluff'. The Binoculars were focused to be clear at jet trail height. Any white 'fluff' close too would be blurred away. They were NOT Birds due to the extreme speed. They were not Eye Floaters which I suffer from, but there are not white and do not race South. Unless you were sharp eyed or had Binoculars trained on that section of sky, you would have missed them, even through 7x or 8x Binocs.  These items are a mystery...Unidentified, possibly misidentified but none were birds and nothing we have knowingly flies at that speed.",2021-03-31T00:00:00,,

I saw on the North bound side of I-49 a Convoy featuring two Pickup Trucks traveling side by side.  One of which had a tall pole which I presumed being used for checking Overpass Clearances.  Following the Pick-up trucks, there were Two Louisiana State Police Cruisers.  Following the State Police Cruisers was an 18 wheeler carrying a “Covered” DISK Shaped Object which spanned both Lanes.

This flashlight is special new type that uses a laser to excite the phosphor, and produces an extremely narrow, laser like white beam, that goes for over a mile.  When the beam hit the craft on the right side “wing”, I could then tell it was one solid, grey colored, un-lit object.  The vehicle did not respond to the light and was gone a second or two later.

I spotted a white light I assumed was a plane headed to the airport.  Only one light, no multiple or red lights like a plane.  More like a satellite, but it was cloudy. It was coming over downtown from the east like planes to the airport would.  But, it was moving significantly faster than any jet or helicopter.  Not streaking across the sky, but 4 or 5 times faster than any jet coming in to land. It appeared to change direction headed south, but the freeway I was on has curves, so it may have just been that.  But, it headed south over Windsor, and disappeared over the horizon.

Other than the speed, direction, and being a single white light, it would have been something I've seen hundreds of times on this drive.  But this was definately not that.

I thought it might be the ISS, and when I later went in I confirmed there was indeed a 6 min flyover that I just was lucky enough to catch. The unsettling part was when the ISS was directly over my head, I could see the stars behind it as it past by them, those stars (4 in this case) actually moved and absolutely “bracketed” the ISS as it moved across the sky. Almost like a targeted object in a scope. So the 4 “stars” were positioned at a (12, 3, 6 and 9:00 position) around the moving ISS. MOVING WITH THE ISS, the stars moved with it for almost 20 seconds. There were no clouds in the sky ( I made sure of it after the event), as sometimes moving clouds make stars look like the stars are moving. At the end of the “bracketing “ timeframe, the ISS moving towards the NW sky and I knew I’d lose it soon…but bef! ore the ISS was out of range, the 4 “bracketing stars” each moved outwards at same time from their prospective compass points (12:00 went up, 3:00 went right, etc) to form a larger bracketing diamond. Keep in mind they just looked like stars (same dimness as background stars in night sky), but just after they widened their bracket, the stars randomly moved in all directions and stopped dead in the sky, meanwhile ISS moved on to the horizon and started to dim. One last look at those “stopped” objects and they blinked out 2 at a time. First 2 just disappeared then within 1-2 seconds later, 2nd 2 blinked out. Couldn’t believe what I was watching and I know what I saw was not stars or my sight being weird. Would be interested to know if the ISS or radar picked up anything at that moment, since I know exactly time and area (based on ISS Flyover time and direction.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,,

The camera I used was unable to get a clear image, but it appears to clearly show at least the three corner lights.  The one closest to me was the brightest with the other two being visible, but dimmer.  I tried pointing to it for people driving by, but apparently I was unable to catch their attention to stop and view it.  After I stopped the camera, I tried to reach it with a 5 mA blue laser with no reaction.  I was able to see it periodically for about the next ten minutes, but then it disappeared below the horizon.  The sighting lasted from 17:35 to about 17:55.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,45.4835597,-122.8374352

As I approached my car I looked up just in time to see them vanish simultaneously.  They didn't fly off, they just dissappeared.

Since I was focused on driving, I told my wife to roll her window down to take a closer look. There was no sound and the non-blinking lights were solid white. That's when we noticed it was a single larger craft with multiple lights. They were bright but a soft bright if that makes sense. We briefly lost sight of the craft before turning right on 107th Ave and then briefly saw it again. It would have been heading towards W Deer Valley Rd which is where I see that someone else also reported a similar sighting.

I even tried return home mode and that didn’t work either. The drone was only 100 yards above my head so it was not far and still had great signal.   While I was staring into the sky and I saw what appeared to be a comet or meteor coming out of the the atmosphere on a 45 degree angle.  After it reached the altitude of a plane, it then leveled off and what broke into two separate bright lights and then came back together as one and then it became two separate objects again then flew off into the distance and disappeared out of sight.

I witnessed a white oval shape low in the cloudy night sky move slowly under the cloud clearing then insanely fast across the open clear night sky. It then stopped on a dime and hovered stationary for about five seconds before streaking off out of distance. The way it moved was so odd going from a steady cruise into high speed to stopping instantaneously. Mind you this was close enough to make out its shape & color. Definitely not what people are used to seeing as far as propulsion goes in our century. If Guessing it had to be thirty to fifty feet long. Classic saucer shaped but appeared oval as it moved in a spiraling fashion. Absolutely no sound. Craft had no lights, no wings, no propellers visible but looked like a white oval reflecting a hint of moonlight to make it visible enough to see against the cloudy black night. When it say stationary in one part of the night sky I moved to a clearer vantage point & at that point it turned into nothing but a streak in the sky and ! in a flash was gone. I ran inside to grab my binoculars, returned in less than 30 seconds and waited another ten minutes to see if it’d reappear. It was gone. Left me with a sense of fear as I was alone on a dark country dead end street staring up into the unknown.

It was between 800 and 1000 feet and flew straight over me and my husband. Estimated size, half a football field.

The following agencies were contacted on the sighting; Klamath County Sheriffs Office, Klamath Falls Police, Herald and News Paper, Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base, spoke with Smsgt Shirar... stated they did have aircraft flying, but no reports of any 'unidentified objects'. All agencies were unaware of any stange craft in or around Klamath Falls area.   Via Herald and News, and the Public Affairs officer Kingley Field; ""The 173rd Fighter Wing will conduct night flying operations from March 2-4. Operations will take place between approximately 4-9 p.m. each night. Night flying is part of the course curriculum for F-15C student pilots at Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls.""   There were some night flight operations on the night of 1 March 2021, as I live 45 miles NE from the base and I heard fighter jets in my area.   (Investigators conclusion) The weather that day was in the 50's and clear, so that evening there would have been clear skies and temps dropping to mid 30's. As witness MD stated, the object was triangular in shape, with non - blinking white lights on the corners. Another witness stated 'red' lights were seen. MB also submitted a drawing of object showing its triangle shape with lights on corners. And she was positive this was not a conventional military aircraft, as she was raised on USAF bases and was familiar with most USAF aircraft.   Also noted that the object was 800 to 1000 feet distance over her and her husband flying silent. Estimated size at half a football field. So size estimate at 50 meters or 150 feet in length. She also stated if she held out her thumb at arms length, it was larger than that. From her statement the object was solid, edges of it were sharp and moving silent through the night sky in a SW direction.   As noted by other witness posts on the Klamath Scanner and News Facebook site, some say possibly conventional military aircraft such as the B-2 bomber, which is triangular in shape, others claim they don't know what is was.   Two possibilities here, one-that this was a U.S. military aircraft or two- did an 'unknown object' slip into our airspace undetected? With lots of witnesses on both sides, hard to say at this time.",2021-03-31T00:00:00,42.316047787610614,-121.89806106194689

So as we walked towards it on the side walk I hyper focused on it. I quickly realized it was not an airplane, because it had five white lights across in a very slight U formation. Very bright white lights. My son and husband are always looking at the stars for UFOs, then quickly turning things into IFOs, so I excitedly showed my 5year old. He was excited, but then a little confused when he could not turn it into an IFO. We kept walking towards it, keeping constant eye contact with it. It would slightly swerve up to the right then straighten back up. Slowly moving towards us, but super close to us. I would say it was only over a couple of streets away. I could see how someone might call this a ""saucer"" the way it moved straight towards us, the! n swerve a little to the left this time, then straighten up again. Then as we were about one street away from it, my son telling me, we are too close, it dims the lights. All the lights at once. Then one at a time turns the five front lights all the way off, two of the light spots leaving a green glow. The green glow reminded me of safety lights on our planes and boats. Up to this point we couldn't hear a thing. Here is the point when I thought this UFO might not be Human. It made a sound. A loud SWSHH and a quick 90 degree turn. Not an easy L turn, a quick turn. It was close enough to us that even with its lights off I could see it was now clearly not a saucer. It was the shape simular to an N64 controller. After the quick turn it also changed the position it was in. As if I were to lay flat on my tummy in a plank, then someone lifts my head 45 degrees off the ground and my body lifts with it. Then it slowly creeped away. I was so disappointed that my phone was not on me in the moment. As soon as I got back to my phone I quickly sketched down drawings and notes so I would not forget this event. My guess would be that this UFO was at least as long, and wide, as the length of a school bus. Before my son realized how big it was, he tried to identify it as someone's drone. It was acting like one, in that it was slowly scoping out what was going on in our neighborhood. But it was way too big to be just a drone.",2021-03-31T00:00:00,36.04787185185185,-94.04453777777778

I had just passed the Old Route 21/Schenk Rd exit. The object was glowing very brightly, and initially I thought it was an astronomical object, such as a planet, because the size of the object at that point was too big for a star. I'm relatively knowledgeable in astronomy, and with the time of day, the date, and how sunny it was, I immediately ruled out that possibility.  Furthermore, over the approximately next 15 seconds, the object grew in size to about a dime.  I have no way to know the actual distance or elevation, but it had to be around a mile, and I would estimate it was about 45+ degrees above the horizon (i.e., approximately southeastward from the Jefferson College campus).  The  object was glowing brilliantly with silvery light, and at this point its triangular shape slightly resembled a passenger airliner.  However, it was pointing directly straight up, which I couldn't reconcile since it didn't make sense.  I've had an interest in airplanes and space travel since childhood, and I'm relatively proficient with identifying basic types of aircraft.  I was trying to focus more on the object; however, it was shimmering, and I was in rush hour traffic (speaking of which, given the time of day, there had to be other people that witnessed this object).  At this point I spotted what was most likely a fighter jet (it was moving at high speed at altitude and producing a substantial vapor trail) approaching from the southeast.  I immediately decided to dismiss the glowing object as some type of aircraft, figuring a military exercise must be taking place.  Then I spotted another jet (with vapor trail) approaching from the north.  I realized the two fighter jets were converging on the spot where the unknown flying object was located.  I returned to the object, which had once again shrunk in size to resemble a star. In fact, as I watched, it continued to shrink into a tiny dot, and then disappeared altogether.  This all happened in such a short amount o! f time ( maybe 30 seconds -- plus I was in the midst of rush hour traffic on Hwy 21) that I had not yet considered that the object might be of extraterrestrial origin.  However, immediately contemplating the way it disappeared, I realized it was due to accelerating away at an incredibly high rate of velocity.  The fighter jets looked like they were moving at a snail's pace compared to how fast the UFO had vanished.  Incidentally, I have dream premonitions, and I've been experiencing an unprecedented number of premonitions the past few months.  Furthermore, a few days ago I dreamed about an alien aircraft crashing into the earth.  I could care less whether or not anyone other than my wife believes my account.  I've posted it here because I figure someone else witnessed this event, and they might be inclined to ""google"" it, as I was.",2020-02-25T00:00:00,38.2323,-90.5629

After a couple of minutes I felt somewhat confident that these were not regular aircraft. It was dark and relatively clear out. I noticed t them at first because of where their location and secondly because of their bright greenish glow without typical blinking running lights. My view is looking west over the south of downtown Seattle area toward west Seattle. There are many aircraft in the area because of Sea-Tac, Boeing field, King County airport, and the medical emergency helicopters. The two UFOs caught my attention because they were flying over what I estimate possibly the Bremerton area which is not really part of the local flight path and for their flight pattern. I believe they were meandering in what looked like more northern direction when I first noticed them. Then one or both seemed to change direction and eventually cross paths one above the other as! shown in the video, which is also unusual. I got my camera as soon as determined them to be unusual. I had a trouble getting them in focus. The entire time they flew slowly and they didn’t seem to be on a linear path. They simply disappeared. They looked rather large but it’s difficult to determine their size and their location. Their altitude looked to be at or around the altitude of a helicopter or other low flying aircraft. The closer hill in the video is west Seattle, using that as a reference I would estimate them somewhere in the Bremerton area or possible further west, and their size to be at least the size of a helicopter if not lager. Obviously at this distance and being in a major metro area there were no other qualities to the sighing such as sound, smell, heat, etc. No exhaust was noticeable.  The light they emitted did have a very interesting glow without glare.  The color was at first a pleasant bright off-white and seemed to take on a more green hue.

As I traveled down the road, I thought about how bright they were, then the second light started turning more north, this is when I noticed the green light, obviously an airplane, the reason I am reporting this is because the first light never moved, just remained directly in front as I continued down the highway.  This started at exit 599 and stayed directly in front until I exited the highway onto US-271, I the traveled north to CR757 then home. Arriving around 20:20.

I called my mom to tell her to look outside and I got out of our vehicle to watch it.  My mom told my dad and he got his binoculars out. He said it looked like a strand of lights just hovering.  My husband and I decided to get closer to it. So we headed West again on 47.  We drove all the way to highway 421 and parked in the church parking lot on the left hand side of the road to view it and take some pictures.  We parked where we could see it perfectly.  We took a couple pictures and videos then decided we were done.  Just as we were about to leave I looked up at it and realized it had moved. Not a lot. Just slightly because it was now parti! ally hidden by trees.  It was moving very slow.  I took a small video of it moving and then we decided it was time to go home. Once we were home we looked at our pictures and videos.  The videos show the object glowing bright then getting lighter.  In my pictures the first couple are just a bright spot.

I could tell the size comparison as we have large buzzard birds flying high above and you could tell the object was higher than the birds. No audible sound.

The next night, USO. A friend of mine and I were fishing on Kettle Cove in Sebago Lake just to the north of Ring Island (the most northwestern island in the Dingle Island Chain). Suddenly I saw a glowing, yellow (i can't stress enough...somehow it was a VERY odd hue of yellow like I have never seen before)...A bright banana-yellow object that appeared to be between 2 and 3 meters in diameter traveling against the wind from east to west at around 150 to 200 feet in the air, directly above the north shoreline at a constant speed and altitude. It appeared to be traveling at something over 100 miles per hour....maybe even 200. The object appeared to be round but had a teardrop effect as if it were a rain drop traveling horizontally and made of light/fire....  The second i saw it i said ""Hey, look at that big drone!..."" ...As I was saying this i realized it could not be a drone....being so big and close, it made no or very little sound...if there were any sound and not just my imagination, then it was a barely audible ""whoosh"" like the sound of a light breeze. The air was dead calm that night. The moment i said that, my friend looked up and saw it, and as if on cue, or as if I was ""heard"", it, in a fraction of a second without changing speed or course, brightened and completely vanished. Neither my friend or I could think of anything that it could possibly be.  Here, even if some sort of strange coincidence is what struck us as even more odd...the boat we were on has a very high tech brand new fish finder on board....prior to seeing this object all along that north shore, for the prior 10-15 minutes, the fish finder was lit up like a Christmas tree. THOUSANDS of fish were all congregated along this area....more together than I've ever seen and I grew up on the lake. The screen showed that from surface to the lake floor was PACKED with fish. As if there weren't an inch between each fish...wed been trolling and then decided to cast....I got ONE bite but we never caught even one, which due to the number of fish and lures we were using, we shouldn't have been able to reel in without catching one. A gentleman in a nearby boat confirmed whatever phenomena we were witnessing in the lake on this fish finder....there may be record of this still in the fish finder. The minute the Yellow orb/teardrop was gone, so were the fish. We traveled ba! ck and forth and I think we saw 3 afterwards on the fish finder. I have a feeling that this had to be connected somehow to whatever we'd just seen.  The very next night we were sitting on shore about 200 yards from where we were fishing the night before, and saw 3 yellow lights in the water, (myself, my father, and a different neighbor this time) which we thought was a boat which appeared to be traveling north to South in the water about 30 yards from shore. 2 lights were around 10 feet apart with one about 12 or 13 feet in front...we then realized that this ""boat"" made no sound, and as it passed there were ripples in the water, but not nearly big enough to constitute a boat of the size implied by the arrangement of the lights. It too, suddenly disappeared. None of the three of us could come up with even an idea of what it was. It was traveling between 20 and 25mph. The yellow hue was very similar to what I'd seen the night before in color but these were 3 small (6 inches in diameter maybe) lights.  I believe the 2 events had to be connected. Not to make light but it appears ET was fishing along with us that first night! (With apparent major success!)",2021-08-16T00:00:00,43.9742,-70.5161

Harvard Gulch Trail. Like you would see in crop circles.  The grass was laid down in different angles and patterns and followed E. Harvard Gulch for almost a mile all the way to Sr. DeBoer Park and doesn’t disappear until the Gulch turns to concrete and there was no more grass to lay down. This is not the first time the grass has been altered like this. But this is the longest run of it I have seen. Some areas the grass on both sides is laid down while the stuff in the middle of the gulch was still standing. In some areas the grass on both sides was standing and what was in the middle of the gulch was laid down. There are large areas of 15x20 feet where all the grass was laid down. These laid down grasses seemed to happen on both sides of some of the bridges where it appears what ever did this went under the bridge. It looks like a pattern! made by an airboat when it is running on high grass in water. But NO airboat I have ever been on could have done some of what was laid out here. No airboat could fit under these bridges- several of which have barriers every 4-5 feet across - to stop large debris from getting swept through.  Some areas the pattern jumped up and was like 2 feet high in the air just barely bending some of the bigger plants over. This looks like “crop circle” type stuff. But it is lines and energies drawn into the plants for over almost a whole mile. I have tons of pictures and videos. After about two hours of documenting, it I got overwhelmed with the energy it was putting off and was so dizzy I had to first sit down and then lay down in the grass of someone’s yard. But I am an energy sensitive. It may not have affected someone else as strongly. I don’t know if anyone documents these things here in America. But it seems those visiting are leaving us lots of clues and not all of them are in th! e skies. I would love an “official” UFO researcher person to c! ome docu ment this event.

This is a UFO report for three consecutive-nights, July 22nd, July 23rd, and July 24th, 2021.  At approximately 10:00 PM to 1:00 AM the next morning, each night, I (a licensed pilot) and another witness (a college student), saw the following described single object in the Eastern sky at an estimated 5,000 foot elevation or 30 degrees above the horizon, over the water and New Brunswick, Canada near Eastport, Maine, the furthest East location in the U. S.  The object appeared to have five extremely long spokes like a wheel or the bottom of an office chair, that were lighted up by multiple flashing and solid colored lights of green, red, white, yellow, and blue and possibly other colors as well.  There were many more lights solid and flashing outlining the individual spoke-like structures than a normal aircraft has marking its wingtips and tail with the typical red, green, and white single lights.  It appeared to be stationary at times and also to move at will ! very, very fast by darting and skipping around in the clear full-moon lighted sky wherever it chose to go.  This was obviously not any known aircraft or helicopter, because it was way too fast in its movements and maneuvers.  It continued its patterns randomly for the next three hours until it suddenly and quickly disappeared.  It appeared again as a single object the next two nights at approximately the same time, location, and fashion, due East of Eastport, Maine in again, clear nearly full moonlighted skies.  These times the same two witnesses saw it again plus three others who were notified and alerted of it by the two who previously spotted it the night before.  The other three witnesses thought it was also some kind of UFO, with none of us ever seeing anything like it, and believing that it was not like any known aircraft or helicopter.  It repeated the same skipping around, hovering, and dart-like speeding patterns as the night before, only these times a little further to the South.  The observations were again during moonlighted skies, so it was very clear.  We managed to take a few pictures with a cell phone, but they did not come out very well.  We need a telescope to spot it more clearly, and tonight we are going to look for it again. The fact that the UFO was spotted in the same appropr! iate location at the same approximate times three nights in a row, may merit further investigation as to what it could be, in the event that it may be some kind of border patrol operation between the U. S. and Canada, otherwise we are at a total loss to explain what it was.  The witnesses who saw this single object included two licensed pilots, a college student, and two others actively involved in business.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,44.9207,-67.0155

Three of us were traveling home from a weeklong trip to Florida. We were passing through Arkansas (heading home) and contemplated staying at a hotel in Morrilton, Arkansas, because we were extremely tired from already having driven over 10 hours. At approximately 12:45am, As we pulled into a hotel right off the Interstate I-40, we  looked up in front of our car to notice a strange floating object in the sky. It sounded like a faint  helicopter. But, to our surprise it was not a helicopter. It was about 40 feet long in  length and appeared to be aluminum colored and cigar-shaped… with the front part being a rounded point and the back part being flat. This object did  not have any wings or propellers. Not sure how it was a gradually going by us at  a slow speed in the sky. It was barely higher than the hotels around us, probably around seven stories high. We were quite exhausted but continued to watch it for a minute or two.  This cigar shaped object was traveling northwest to northeast. We never noticed it, but all of a sudden it appeared right in front of us. We were observing through the front windshield of my vehicle. The exterior, again, was a silver aluminum look. It had a revolving spotlight towards the front and some sort of red box underneath the front of the object. The object crossed over Interstate 40 a few blocks down, then floating (almost like a  blimp) in the sky in the same spot while doing a complete 360° turn in place. This activity happened right behind the Hampton Inn hotel.  After having already been in our vehicle (on a very long road trip), we were too tired to think about taking a picture or video. We first just assumed it was helicopters… then, we were trying to figure out what it was when we saw it so closely go over us. After that encounter, we pulled back onto the interstate and drove to the next city to rent a hotel room, instead of staying near that strange encounter in Morrilton.  When we returned to our hometown, about two hours northeast of that location, we discovered that my son‘s best friend had seen the same occurrence in our area the same same night. We were unaware that they were  UFOs that were not sphere shaped or “flying saucers”. We had no idea that other sightings have been reported of the cigar shaped flying object.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,35.1717,-92.7447

What I observed was a triangular shaped aircraft flying on an approximate heading of 090, at a very high speed. The trailing edges of the object were illuminated in a neon green and they appeared to flicker similar to the way an NE-2 neon lamp or high pressure sodium street lamp flickers when you move your eyes as you look at it.  It looked very similar to the triangular shaped highlighters many of us had in school, where each corner of the triangle was a different color marker tip.

One commercial airliner flew closely or at least superimposed near the objects. The first object was seen by itself for several minutes prior to the arrival of the second object. Both objects were equal in size and we’re hard to distinguish apart from a star in size and magnitude however the this occurred during a bright sunny day in El Paso. The objects appear to be rotating or at least moving in a way to cause reflection of the sunlight which would cause them to become greater and lesser in magnitude. No high velocity movements were seen but there was noted hovering or maintaining position for several minutes. At one point one of the objects turned and revealed an elongated cylinder shape with what looked like very small wings. My first assumption was that this was a satellite.

These rectangles were rotating approximately once per second about their mid sections while moving south.   There were brief instances when the entire length of the objects would flash very brightly in the same brilliant green.

I was walking out my front door heading north toward my truck parked in front on the street.. midway approximately 10feet from my truck and 15 feet from my house, I stopped and turned my head around and looked up at the sky above my house. I don't remember why I stopped, perhaps I wanted to see if there were any rain clouds in the sky, but I'm not totally convinced that was the case. The moment I set my eyes on the sky a bright red light appeared at what seemed a very low altitude (maybe 750-1500ft, it appeared close to me rather than far and large) and traversed the sky in a crescent shape-like trajectory for a second or two and disappeared. My vantage point was limited by trees and my house (two-story) so I'm not sure if it reappeared. However my sighting was not obfuscated by trees or anything else; I had a clear view of what little I did see. It definitely-absolutely was not an airplane or drone, there is an airport 8 miles northeast from my home and jet! s often/hourly pass over my home. Also, two international airports are further away, both about 40-45 miles away, one to the southeast and one to the northeast so I have some bearing on altitude. This red light seemed way lower than the jets that fly over to land at the small airport 8miles NE of my house. Since I spontaneously stopped to turn my head to look at the sky behind me, I almost feel as if I was psychic-ly compelled to.. I'm on crutches for a leg injury, when I'm walking I typically try to get to point a to b asap because they are uncomfortable. And if I would have looked a second too early or a second too late I would have missed it if it was indeed some natural meteorological event like ball lightning or perhaps a meteor.. To the best of my knowledge, I've ruled out meteor because it seemed so low in the sky and it's trajectory wasn't a strait streak across the sky.. All the shooting stars I've seen are very high up in the atmosphere and not red like a siren. I! don't know much about ball lightning, but I'm assuming all li! ghtning would appear, I don't know, white or blue... Not red. Also, there was no noise. So I'm left thinking I saw something phenomenal, not quite sure what to make of it. I just find it strange as a skeptic following the UFO story recently, in depth, that I would have a personal sighting days before the DNI report to Congress. And at the time, after the observation, I just turned back around, hopped in my truck, and went on my way like nothing totally bizarre just happened--I was totally calm and reacted nonchalant. I find it strange I wasn't more excited, or went to tell my mother inside, or got my phone out to record in case it reappeared, or went in my back yard to try and get another look (my backyard doesn't have trees so views of the sky are wide in that direction). It's quite extraordinary all things considered and it's almost like I was in a trance. Maybe it was disbelief; I don't know. But, now I think about it very often. Two weeks went by before telling anyone. Now, I've! told family and friends and decided to report after watching Mick West interview Alex Dietrich about the Nimitz encounter. She made a point to report sightings if you have one. Anyway, I'm much more open minded to a more exotic explanation of recent news. That's all. Oh and by the way I'd swear on the bible and take a lie detector test, no problem. I don't know what I saw but I sure saw something weird and it fits with the ""light"" ufo sightings and videos others have documented, so.. There seems to be a pattern. I'm just curious if anyone else in my area saw it that early evening; I live in a very heavily populated suburb. Lastly, this may be totally unimportant, but I have an old flat screen TV in my kitchen that has been turning on by itself multiple (1-3)times a day for the past few months. Anyway, that's it.

Preface: I sent my experience to MUFON as well about ten years ago. I do not know if you share databases. While driving home alone on the Cleveland Highway headed east after an extracurricular event at Gainesville High School, I saw a disc object on the horizon above the trees directly in my line of sight where the Cleveland Highway curved to the left. This was a long time ago, and though the Cleveland Highway still exists, it has changed.  In 1968  it was a 2-lane highway with only several businesses, an elementary school, and Riverbend Baptist Church in view. Today I believe it is a 4-lane, but Riverbend Baptist Church is still there. The church was to my left when I noticed the object. The curve was approximately ¼ mile in front of me. The disc was highly polished silver in color, with no visible seams and no windows. The silver was the more reflective of any object I had ever seen in the air. The disc appeared to be the size of what was a modern commercial jetliner of the time.  I cannot be sure of the size, but a jetliner came to mind for some reason. My perspective could be off because I was in shock.  The object hovered with no wavering or wobbling. It appeared fixed in space. Terrified and alone, I wanted to stop the car but worried that someone was behind me. The speed limit at that time was around 35 miles per hour because of the elementary school that was further east on the right. I slowed down once I saw the object and checked my rearview mirror to see if anyone was behind me. The sun was low in the West. The bright glare in the mirror prevented me from seeing anything behind. The sun reflected off the object, but I could still make out the shape.  It was a disc that had a slight rise in the middle. Now here is where my experience seems to differ from others. A message popped into my head. It was not audible. The message was something like, “Martin Luther King will die today,” or “Martin Luther Kind will be killed today.” I do not remember precisely at this point in my life. When I heard that in my head, I became numb, it was as though time stood still.  Please understand I was three weeks shy of my 17th birthday. I did keep up with politics and was socially concerned as a teen, but honestly, I had not given MLK much thought at that point in my life. I knew he was a social activist for civil rights. He was in the news often. I admired him, but I was only concerned with my social life in high school and rock and roll music that day. I was listening to WQXI- AM, the rock station out of Atlanta at that time. Once the thought registered, my eyes still on the object, I turned the radio dial hoping to get news. Maybe I had heard it earlier that he was dead, and it just had no! t sunk in—my attempt to find a news station while driving and looking ahead failed. It was at that time, and the object disappeared as though shot from a cannon. There was no noise, no sign it had been there. There had been no noise except my radio. Nothing. This event occurred at about 4:30 pm Eastern time. I drove home shaken by what I saw and disturbed by what I believed was a random sick thought. Why would I think such a thing?  Having parked the car in the drive, I entered the house through the carport door into the kitchen area. My mother was there. She knew something had happened because she asked what was wrong. I asked her if she had heard on her radio or TV anything about MLK. She read more than she kept up with news, but she had heard nothing. I sat down at the kitchen table, I think. I told her what I saw. I told her about the thought. Then I asked her, “Do you believe me?” She said she did, but she was my Mom. What could she say? I dropped it. Still, I went into my room in shock, knowing that I would not tell anyone else. The last thing I needed was to be called crazy, misfit, oddball, demented, delusional. I had no proof. I had cheerleading tryouts, tests, and so many social pressures. Maybe I was crazy. That evening my father and I watched TV. The incident kept creeping back into my head, but I focused on the TV. I do not recall what we watched, but at about 9 pm, the show was interrupted by a news bulletin from the network. The desk reporter was on a black phone talking and said that MLK had been shot in Memphis at around 7:30 pm Central Time.  He was dead. The thought wasn’t mine. It had been placed in me. That was the only explanation. I got up and went to my room. I turned on my radio and listened to the breaking news. I had known. I had known but could have done nothing with the knowledge. I cried. The next day before I left for school, Mom and I made eye contact. She blinked and nodded. I couldn’t talk about it. I walked out the door and drove to school. I never mentioned it again until years later when I met my future husband, now ex. When we had young children, we hung out with several other couples with children. I remember sharing my story with one of those couples because they, too, had had an encounter when they were college students in Alabama. I felt safe in sharing. When my kids were in their teens, I told them. They laughed and joked about my being a hippie. I shrugged it off. Why would they believe? I sent my story to MUFON sometime around 2010. Nothing. It is on record. But now that UFPs are acknowledged as something, I am compelled to share with every organization that logs encounters. Many people have seen UFPs. Some believe they were abducted. Only 90% of what I read on the subject is credible, but I know what I know about myself. It’s real. It was in the light of day. I know. I have no way of knowing whether the object communicated to others that day in the area where I was. I have not read of any stories where witnesses shared they were told of a historical event that came to pass. Maybe some have, but I do not know about them. I have no proof that of the message. But I have carried this with me for many decades. Until 2017 I only recalled the incident on the anniversary of MLK’s death. Otherwise, I pushed it back. Now it is with me every day.  I am in the sunset of my life. I am on my last lap. Now you know. Take it for what it is.",,34.31321771217712,-83.80587490774909

Several other vehicles pulled over as well as I got out and looked up at the huge green object go directly overhead very low and very slow lighting up the ground and it quietly headed directly north.  As it passed over I noticed bright orange flames surrounding the object and trailing behind and could swear I could hear a faint flickering sound as well.  The size of the object was larger than a full moon and it's speed comparable to a small airplane and everyone present was pointing and commenting.  After 10 minutes or so it disappeared over the Laguna Mountains to the north leaving all of us in awe of what we had just witnessed.  As I got closer to Yuma I observed a California Highway Patrolman giving someone a citation so I pulled over and waited for him to come speak with him. I explained to him about what I had just seen telling him that it must have been a plane crashing(Although I knew it wasn't an airplane) The officer took down my report and all my information and said he would check it out immediately.  Two weeks later I encountered the same officer on the same road and asked him about the outcome and he said nothing was reported crashing and the nearby Marine Air Station reported nothing on radar that evening as well as Yuma Proving Grounds Army Base.

I was 12 years old and remember enjoying some alone time to listen to music and crank up the volume.  it was close to Christmas and I was out of school for the Christmas break.  It was about 10:00PM when my parents arrived home.  My dad, who had been away in Florida for a week or so, ran up the stairs and looked down the hall to me and said ""Want to see a UFO?""  I was not really sure what he was talking about but he seemed pretty exited so I jumped up and followed him outside to our back deck.  We lived on a pretty high hill and had a great view to the south and east.  We watched as a very brightly lit object moved slowly across the horizon from east to west.  It was going right towards the City of Worcester.  When it arrived over the City it began to move in a pendulum type motion over the City.  Its motion was deliberate wi! th a machine-like perfection.  It did this for quite a while, maybe twenty minutes or so.  Then it straightened out and slowly moved back in the direction it came from. But that's not the whole story.  Because my parents had seen the object at a much closer distance.  While they were driving home on the Mass Pike, they saw the object.  it was next the highway and then crossed over the highway right over them.  My mom described the object as very large, round, with two rows of windows and a red light underneath it.  She also said there was an area were the windows were ""blacked out"", like a door.  And this area was slowly rotating.  Like the craft was slowly rotating as it moved forward.  There was no sound.  She said people were pulling over and stopping on the highway to look at it.  The next day, and for a couple of days after the event, the local newspaper ran a couple of stories.  This is when things got strange. The newspaper, and the FAA, were trying to explain the event as a lighted advertisement for a dog track in Connecticut being towed by an airplane.  People were not happy about this and the newspaper received several complaints, one from my dad.  He said if it was an advertisement it was the worst one he had ever seen because he was underneath it and couldn't read it.  And, according to other witnesses, nobody else could either.  In fact, several of the witnesses specifically reported ""It was not an airplane.""  People also used words like ""traumatic"", ""terrified"", and “we shook"" to describe their feelings.  Not what you would expect from paid advertising for something as benign as a race track.  The dog track also said they were not aware of any advertisement that night.  The question begs, why would anyone advertise something late at night, in December, outdoors – in the cold of central Massachusetts.  This whole idea is ridiculous. There are two sketches of this object.  One in the newspaper and one from my mom.  They look remarkably similar and show no airplane or advertising of any kind.  This event was witnessed by untold hundreds, if not thousands, of people in central Massachusetts.",2021-09-07T00:00:00,42.26863925549915,-71.80715499153976

The object have 3 small lights at each corner, yellow/white in color with a 4th at the center, larger, and red/yellow in color. The sides of the object were pushed inward with the top and bottom creating a type of overhang. The bottom went a bit further down at an angle then the area where the lights are located.

I moved up the block to get a better view, but there was nothing in the trajectory in which the object was moving. 	 My best description of the object is that it was cylindrical, and had a light in front, with almost like a fog in front like it was passing through clouds. It's a pretty clear night, and it looked lower than the cloud line. I can't remember any blinking lights, but I do remember seeing a trail behind it, sort of like a shooting star. I can barely see anything in the sky in Brooklyn, and I've seen my fair share of shooting stars. It was too discernable to be one.  	I'm a pretty skeptical person, but after an hour of thinking about the event, I have no rational explanation for it, other than it being some new type of drone or something I've never seen before. It didn't move like your traditional consumer drone. There's also a missile launch tonight in Florida but this was way too close to the ground and too fast to be a missile, even if it was visible from New York. 	",2021-03-02T00:00:00,,

Our properties are adjacent and are about 10 miles north of Douglas, AZ.  There is a glow from the city lights from Douglas and Agua Prita, but in the area we live it is quite dark with clear views of the stars when the sky is clear.  I would say the formation of lights resembled a chevron based on the lights I saw.  There was a rumbling sound, but it did not sound like military jets to me although my neighbor thought it was just a formation of jets likely from the Tucson area.  He didn't really watch it and only glanced at it while I continued to observe the ""formation"" for several minutes as it flew over the mountains to the east but was still visible for quite some time.  It was at least 8,000 or so feet up based on the summit of the peaks in that range.  The lights were white,! and I did not notice any colors.  As I observed the lights and tried to gather more details, the chevron shape changed a bit as some of the lights moved up, down and sideways in a way that I would not say is consistent with an airplane or helicopter.  It was too fast, angular and fluid for it to be an aircraft that I am aware of.  45 minutes or so later, I was heading to my truck to drive back to my property, and to the NE over the Swiss Helm mountain range, I noticed 6-8 flickering, white lights in a loose horizontal band that were stretched from left to right about 10-15 miles.  They were moving slowly SE toward New Mexico, and they maintained that course for 5 minutes while I watched them.  The lights flickered in and out in an inconsistent manner and they moved slowly up and down while still moving at a consistent speed to the SE.  They were quite a ways in the distance so I don't believe they could have been helicopters as they were too far away to be visible.  There was no weather that evening or cloud layer and the skies were very clear so it is unlikely they were ball lightning.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,31.502214285714285,-109.48432857142856

It did this for several seconds and stopped in the sky again. Again after reviewing the video I noticed other lights around this object in the sky at that time. The ""light"" noticeably begins to glow more around it, you can see the brilliance of the light. The object directly, but very close over me.   I saw different colors and a strange formation underneath the craft as it went overhead. It was Unbelievable. The object continued right in the night sky and flew off into the distance. I put my camera back on the second light that had appeared out of nowhere and it was still there.   In the last few seconds of my video I also captured another unidentified flying object in the sky.

I was driving south on highway 321, somewhere close to, but before the first red light preceding the outskirts of Alcoa. It was sometime between 5:30 and 6am, but closer to 6. It was still very dark but the sky was clear enough in patches that I could see stars. I don’t remember any other traffic around me on the highway at that time, but since the pandemic, at that time of the morning traffic is usually pretty light. From the corner of my right eye, I saw a dark shape moving in the top of my windshield. I leaned forward and saw an aircraft flying very low across the highway, passing directly over my car. If I had to guess, I’d say it was probably only about as high above the ground as the top of a three story building. It was small, maybe the size of a small plane (think a “very light jet” of a size that would accommodate a pilot and possibly a co-pilot, but not passengers.)  It was moving across the highway from my right toward my left, so roughly west to! east. I don’t recall hearing engine sounds, other than my car, but I was driving with windows closed and my heat on low, so I might not have discerned a sound. The craft was triangular in shape, solid, and it appeared black from below. It blocked out the sky and stars in a solid triangle as it passed over. It had three bright white lights — constant, not blinking. One was on the “nose” (The leading point of the triangle) and there was one on either “wing” tip. There may have been a fourth white light in the center of the back of the triangle (like a jet port) but honestly, I only clearly remember the three solid white lights  on each of the tips. I thought it was odd that they were not blinking because I thought plane lights were required to blink. I didn’t take my eyes off it for about 8 seconds as it passed over and moved off to my left, but then I had to look at the road again so as not to go off the pavement. I only looked down at the road for a second, but when I look! ed back, I couldn’t see the craft anymore. 8 seconds sounds fa! st, but I remember thinking at the time it seemed to be going more slowly than it should have been. I can only assume it was some type of military craft. There is an Air National Guard base at McGhee Tyson Airport in Alcoa, and the direction of travel was roughly toward the airport. I didn’t tell anyone for about a week and a half because, even though it still seemed “weird” to me, I just kept thinking it was a military craft, like a stealth plane of some sort. I finally told my husband and he said he didn’t think it sounded like any stealth plane that he had heard of. Based on the proximity of the Air Guard base, it really has to be a military craft, but I’ve never seen anything like it, so I’m reporting it in case anyone else has seen it, or knows what it might have been.",2021-04-23T00:00:00,35.8012,-83.9853

I tried to illustrate the Chevron by positioning a lower-case letter ""o"" to represent each object/light, but this is not an exact count.  Hope the diagram holds together.  I failed to state that the Chevron was not a steep angle.  I also know that in November, some Canadian geese and ducks fly a Pacific route as far as Mexico.  After all, the lights I saw flying in a tight pattern were dim and not bright.  The question is:  Are white ducks/geese reflective enough to glow, high-up in the night sky?  I do not know.  The next night, as a fighter jet flew over my roof, it turned off all its lights, but I could still hear the jet's engines.

I did not see commercial airliner tracking lights, just a solid glowing light. Withing three more seconds, I could see that it was the front light, or the front (glowing) object of a Chevron-shaped (V-shaped) object, or a lot of objects forming a Chevron (V) shape. I was unable to see a fuselage and that is why for all I know, it may have been many objects forming a V-shape. I lurched forward and my eyes must have bugged out of my head cartoon style. Each side of the Chevron appeared to have two rows of lights running parallel. I would say at least six lights per row, so a total of at least 12 lights per side of the Chevron shape. In total, at least 24 lights, or objects. It seemed to travel about the speed of a commercial airliner. But because the lights were quite d! im, I cannot help but think it was much higher than 30,000 feet and therefore, may have been faster? I'm not Dr. Branolvski. Since the object was traveling south, it may have been over the US &/or Pacific Ocean earlier.

We drove down the hill and when we got to the store it was already closed. We were a little taken back because it was supposed to be open.  We elected to go to the gas station for some beer and a pizza.

The attendant said it’s 6:00 in the morning.  We got a pizza and went back up the hill.  We are completely baffled! Where did 7 hours go?

I always look up.at the sky...looking for.stars, watching.aircraft from the airbase, spotting satellites, and identifying.the large number of.drones that are being used in our skies. I pretty much know  what lights are requiired and where they must.be placed on aircraft and drones....my hobby.has.been.all.about identifying these things. I noticed two propeller driven aircraft approach from the west in the flightpath to.the airforce base. I then noticed two lights...some.type of craft with only a simgular light that appeared to be rotating and.changing color very quickly from red to blue to orange, then green and back.to red. They also had the appearance of blinking, but.it was not in a synchronous pattern as one would see in all aircraft. These lights quickly.came.from the east and.then positioned.themselves above and.below where.the.aircraft would pass. As.the.aircraft gr! ew close to.these lights.they both disappeared, only.to reappear after the aircraft had passed. These lights.then moved erratically, hovering at times. Eventuly.both went to an area of the sky that was about five miles east of where.they had been.  The southernmost light divided and became two lights..the southernmost light rapidly.accelerated towards Mexico. The two.lights then proceeded to do a dance...at times.touching..and moving up towards the level where cirrus clouds could.be seen. The last time they.hovered just under the.cloud and one could barely see that.there were apx ten other lights.just above the cloud dancing as well. One light.then disaapeared, the other drifted in a.drunkenly manner towards the northeast.  Nothing else appeared, and it was now 0400. At 6A i went.back outside just in time to see a similar object enter my field of view and quickly head west were when it reached the Tucson Mountains began to follow the crest if.this small range.northward. Upon reaching the location of Wasson Peak (highest point.of the range) it gave a brilliant white flash and dissapeared. I sited one other.odd object during.this.time. The constellation Orion was low.in the Southwestern sky heading.for its.setting.  I noticed what appeared to be a sattelite moving towards the.northeast, i.noticed it when it was passing over an orange colored star, both being perhaps 20 degrees to the north of Bettelguese. As i had been looking at Orion i found it odd that the trajectory of.this.sattelite meant it.had come through.the field if view looking at Orion. I should have seen it there, but did not. I then noticed that this orange star was.moving.very slowly....i checked Orion to see.how.fa! st it was moving towards he horizon.  It was moving much slower.than the.orange star. .Orion also.was moving.in a straight trajectory towards the west. This.star moved in an.erratic pattern towards WSW....not the direction nor speed that all.stars would.be seen as doing.

Hiking up that trail is something that we do every day after 6 PM, after I come home from work with my boyfriend. The trail is up a hill a little ways which gives us a good view of the stars over Little Traverse Bay in Northern Michigan. My dog finished her business and we were trying to hike back down a small hill. I looked in the sky at the stars, just because they are so beautiful and visible where we live, and it’s very clear outside tonight. I noticed one of the stars appeared to be moving at a noticeably rapid speed. It looked much too far away to be a satellite, and did not have any colored lights around it besides the single golden, star-like color that it stayed. I also didn’t think of it as a satellite as it seemed so small, incredibly fast, and it looked as though it was traveling in a specific direction away from the Earth, rather than circli! ng it in orbit. It seemed to be traveling east over Lake Michigan. The weirdest part was, after I looked at it and seemed to “make eye contact” with it, I noticed a very short, bright flash. I know I am not mistaken. It struck me immediately as odd, and something inside me made me feel as though it was flashing “hello” to me. I waved back in sheer and utter confusion (and good humor) as the flying light flew out of sight. I kept getting this feeling that it flashed to me as though to acknowledge the fact that I was blatantly staring at it in utter awe. The best way to picture the flash would to pretend that you were driving behind a car in the dark, and their driving lights flashed on into brake lights for a split second. My dog was acting very strange throughout all this as well. She entangled herself around a tree while sniffing about, and no matter what I could do, she would not go back around this tree to untangle herself. She is a very stubborn Pit-bull Terrier who can! definitely be “bull-headed” (no pun intended) at times. I did! not wan t to look away from the flying object in the sky, and my dog seemed to not want me to look at it, or just pay attention to her. Even when I approached her to untangle her, she would not budge when I tried to untangle her. After I did, she stopped in front of me twice, watching me search the sky for the light. She was probably just aggravated that I wasn’t paying attention to her. She’s a very strange dog with very creepy, color/changing and opalescent eyes when I shine lights into them or record it on video. As I’m typing this, she is spastically walking around our living room whining for no reason whatsoever. I call her an “alien dog” jokingly all the time. There are some pretty outlandish theories about dogs and why they’re here on Earth, which I enjoy alluding to in humorous ways. Anyways... once we finally walked back down the hill, I kept searching the sky in vigilance for the light. I think I saw it one last time before it disappeared out of view into the far, far away! sky. It was quite an interesting little experience; definitely one that I felt the need to share. I have seen strange things in the sky a couple of times before, and unfortunately I did not have my phone on me or I definitely would have tried to record it. I’m sharing it here in hopes that maybe someone else noticed it too, or even saw the flash. Maybe it was a satellite, or a far-away airplane. It just seemed too tiny and far away to be either, plus there were no colored flashing lights besides the single yellow flash that I saw. After I saw the flash, it did not flash again. At least not that I saw. Maybe extraterrestrials in a ship were just passing by, waving, “hello” to my dog and I. One last thing that I would like to mention is the fact that I saw two “stars” directly to the left of where the flashing light traveled by as I was walking inside. They were directly above me, very high in the sky. Even though they were so far away and small, I was still able to notice that the leftmost  one had a small green light it was emitting, while the other on the right looked like a normal satellite with a reddish light accompanying it. I shrugged them off as faraway satellites, and they stayed completely still while I gazed upwards. Then I went inside to tell my boyfriend what I had seen. He has seen inexplicable occurrences in the sky before as well, so it was nice to have an interested listening audience. Hopefully my “sighting” connects to another sighting in the area, and hopefully what was seen can he described similarly to what I saw. Any/all feedback on what I witnessed is extremely encouraged.

I was in my SUV heading out to a convenience store it was about 9:15 pm.  I live in a cul-de-sac, so I had turned out of the circle and was headed straight to a dead end where you have to turn right or left onto another street.  I stopped at the stop sign and right in front of me I saw an orange kind of triangular shape that almost reminded me of a flame.  At first I just watched it, trying to figure out what it was… I’d never seen anything like it.  It wasn’t big, so I doubt it was a UFO.  It was all light, but it wasn’t casting light.  It might have been more like a very vague circle in the center but a peak on the top and a tail trailing it.  It was moving at a slow speed but was constantly moving forward.  I finally thought to grab my phone to take a picture, but the picture turned out terrible.  It went behind a tree, then I could see it again, then it was blocked by a tree. I turned the opposite way of where I intended to drive just to follow it.  I was trying to get a picture, but by the time I got to the last tree it was behind, it was gone.  I kept driving ahead looking for it.  I even went back home and picked up my daughter (26 years old) and drove around looking for it. It was just the strangest thing I’ve ever seen.  It was higher than the top of my SUV, but seemed to be very close.  It didn’t make any noise.  It reminded me of a flickering flame.  It was maybe two foot?  It was not big. I can see it clearly in my mind, but it’s so hard to describe.  An orange, almost triangular, light that reminded me of a flickering candle.  It was solid orange.  I don’t believe in supernatural or anything, but it really reminded me more of an entity than a spacecraft. I am 54 years old, female.  I have a Master’s degree in education.  I’ve taught Middle School ELA for the last 30 years. Most 8th grade, but this year I’m teaching 6th grade.  I’m married.  My husband came here from Macedonia – I met him when he’d been in the US for a year.  We’ve been married 24 years in October.  He is a family physician. I have two daughters – a 26 year old daughter who is currently working toward a Master’s degree in Environmental Science.  My other daughter is an 8th grader. We live in a development and had our house built about 10 years ago. There are a couple of boys that would fly these planes around.  That was the first thing I thought about when I saw this thing.  It wasn’t shaped like a plane, however, or a drone.  It was just a triangular, orange, light.  And, when I left my house and drove down out of the Cul-de-sac, there was no one else outside.  It was dark and a school night. That’s it.  It really bothers me wondering what I saw.  If you do know of something that resembles what I described that could explain it, I would really appreciate it if you’d tell me.  I’m not sure why it bothers me, except that it was so unusual….",2021-10-19T00:00:00,39.6182,-84.2488

I looked up and saw the big dipper (Ursa Major) in the north sky.  In the tail of the constellation I saw what looked like a normal, typical satellite. It was a very bright, single light compared to the other stars in the night sky and it was moving eastward. It was about as bright as Venus appears.  I watched it for about 30 seconds. What alarmed me is that I've seen satellites before and they've always moved at a steady rate and in a straight line. This, however, was not moving in a straight line. While it was moving east, it was also moving up, then down, then up again, then straight east, etc. It was almost like it was moving like a waveform, but it was not a constant pattern. It was more like a heartbeat waveform.  After about 30 seconds, I went to the house and asked my wife if she wanted to see a satellite. I went back outside and it was still there. I viewed it for about 15 more seconds until the time that my wife arrived outside. Upon her arrival, I took my eyes off of the light in the sky. When I looked back up, it was gone. She never witnessed it.  I saw it for a total viewing time of about 45 seconds. The overall time that it was in the sky from when I saw it until it was gone was about 1 total minute (deduct 15 seconds for when I walked away). There was nothing in the way like trees or buildings that would have caused me to not see it any more.

Odd shape, size, and angle (orientation). March 4, 2021 @ 06:05 Calgary, Alberta, Canada  Standing at a bus stop near my residence, which is inner city, I looked up at the morning sky and the moon, then noticed a cylindrical set of lights moving NW to SE. The sky was clear on this morning, as far as I could tell, being able to easily see the moon and stars.  At first I suspected the collection of lights to be a plane. It seemed to be moving oddly though, as I thought to myself it seems like it's coming down and even worried for a second that it was on a trajectory with my neighbourhood. In the next moment, I was puzzled at the shape of the object, the angle of it (orientation), and also the luminosity of it, seemingly surrounded with lights.  It was then that I first considered I should take some pictures/video, and got my phone out. I am not the fastest draw in the west at taking pictures with my phone, and this was very early in the AM as I waited for my bus to go to work. But I collected 4-5 decent pics and one 40 sec video, plus another very short clip. The object continued on its course SE. It became dimmer as it moved away, and then my bus showed up.  The object moved at about the speed of a plane, I would say, certainly not too fast, but a steady pace. The video I shot is shaky because of my trying to line it up and even zoom in; it is not the object dancing around. The object stayed on a fairly even course throughout.  I listened for the sound of a plane, and could not be sure I heard it. Living in the city, there is a lot of ambient noise that sounds like a constant hum, especially early in the morning when there are not much car noises on the street.

My daughter and I were looking at one of the huge power line structures just off the trail. My daughter walked off the trail, toward the structure, while I looked up at the birds sitting on top of it. I believe we were facing south and part of the sky was in view but there were also trees partially blocking the view as well. I saw a bright spherically-shaped object flying right to left at what appeared to be a very fast speed. The object appeared to be emitting a bright white light all around it, yet had a slight silver shimmer to it as if the sun was also partially reflecting off of it. My daughter did not see the object from her vantage point. We walked a few yards down the trail whe! re we could get a good view of the horizon (no trees in the way) but the object was long gone.

I left work later in the night and decided to spend some downtime in a parks empty parking lot. Close to the time I was about to leave I noticed a ball of reddish/orange light that seemed to be one or two neighborhoods away. It was hard to tell what it was because there was no definite shape at first. I also don’t recall how long it had been there seeing as I had been staring at the sky and my phone for 20 mins at that point. It looked too big to be a star and didn’t move at all. I took a short video to catch it at 11:58pm.  Suddenly it began to lift vertically into the sky very slowly, too slowly to catch on camera with shaky hands but visible to me. I took another short video but again the camera wasn’t good enough. I was trying to be rational but a kinda stubby beam the same color seemed to protrude out very slightly from the bottom. It wasn’t the long white beam I thought I’d see in my first encounter but it was apparent.  The object continued to rise into the sky. I had music playing on my phone at less than half volume so I could still hear a pen drop. No sound was ever heard during any of this encounter. It was silent. Then lights began to blink, about 4 green vertical rectangular lights on the right side, and 4 red ones on the left. I took a third and final video of the blinking lights which only appear slightly in my video at 12:00am. When I zoom into the video it looks similar a sun with five/six hoops moving around it like an atom.  At that point it was a lot higher in the sky and began moving toward me at a rate that continues to send chills down my back hours later. I could tell it was fast because the size of the object increased in less than seconds. I immediately started my car, reversed, and sped off. As I was speeding off i FaceTimed my friend to explain what was happening as quickly as I could. When I was turning out of the park, I took a quick glance- but nothing. The sky was empty. The encounter felt like forever, when I looked at the timestamps I really couldn’t believe it was only about 2 mins.

It was like something right out of a movie.  I would have tried to capture it on video, but I really thought it was just a small car, or a couple of snowmobiles, until it took off, and by then it was too late, because it took off too fast.  I live next to a school, which is now closed and abandoned.  On one side of the school is a baseball field and a soccer field.  The soccer field is behind the baseball field, and it is surrounded by bushes and trees.  There is a small hill beyond this area, which leads to where I live.  When I look out my kitchen window, I can see part of the baseball field, as well as some of the bushes and trees which surround the soccer field.  So what happened was I was eating supper at my kitchen table and glancing out my kitchen window every so often while I ate, which is what I usually do.  It was completely dark outside and the light I was eating by in the kitchen was only very dim.  I usually like to eat eat in semi-darkness like this.  Well, I was about halfway through my meal when I noticed three dim lights out my window- two white lights and one red light.  The lights were lined up in a row, which seemed to be curved slightly.  I judged the distance of the object(or objects) to be right about between the baseball field and the soccer field, right behind some of the bushes and trees.  At first I didn’t think much of it because I figured it was either a small car or a couple of snowmobiles, even though I didn’t see any exhaust and I didn’t hear any sound.  Anyway, the object just sat there in front of me, without moving, for about 35 minutes.  I finished eating, all the while keeping an eye on it.  When I was finished eating, I decided to sit and watch it for awhile,  to see what would happen, to see where it would go.  And I was still almost completely convinced it was just a small car, or a couple of snowmobiles, even though I thought it was a strange place for someone to be parking- especially considering that the school has been closed and abandoned for quite a long time now.  It didn’t take long for things to start getting both weird and fascinating.  As I was sitting there in the semi-darkness staring at it, suddenly one of the white lights got really bright, like a really bright flashlight.  Then the light started to rotate!  Shortly after that, the object began moving along the ground towards the bushes, and, therefore, closer to me.  When it reached the bushes, the entire middlle area lit up with bright white light and started to rotate!  Even though it never went completely through the trees to the building where I lived, it came close enough to me so that I thought I saw windows!  The windows were all lit up with bright white light, and they were rotating about the middle!  It continued moving slowly along the trees like this, still without making any sound, and without giving off any exhaust!  I could even see the light reflecting off the trees!  Well, eventually, after about thirty seconds or so, it reached the end of the soccer field.  At that point I expected to see it fly off into the sky, but instead the weirdness continued.  Instead of flying off into the sky,  it appeared to fly right into the trees, but without disturbing the trees at all, except for reflecting bright white light off them.  Then the light went out and it disappeared!  It seemed to just wink out of existence!  Then it was gone.  And everything was completely dark again.  It was the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen in my life- and I’m a 49-year-old disabled male.  I’ve actually been wishing that it would return and make a repeat performance, if for no other reason than so I could capture it on video.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,47.0314,-68.642

About 1.5 miles away after passing the butte formations, my wife and I immediately noticed a glowing orange-red “jelly bean” shaped sphere hovering over the southern end of Merrill Ranch Sun City residential development near the Police and Fire Station. We have a lot of air traffic in the area for PHX and nearby AZA. The AZA air traffic is mainly student pilots flying light aircraft at about 5,000 feet (night and day) right over Merrill Ranch and are easily heard from their engine noise and located with their lighting. So when we saw an aerial object not making any noise and stationary it has a high strangeness to us that cannot be ignored.  The glowing sphere was so out of place due to its very low altitude, color and lack of noise such as a medical helicopter would make from the Hospital or an Army Helicopter from the nearby military reservation. Normally the Army Helicopters would fly much higher, i.e., 3-5,000 feet AGL. As I made a left turn eastbound off Hunt Highway to a side street. My wife reacted with mounting concern because the object was not moving and it seemed to get a little larger as we were closing distance to it.  So I slowed down to about 10 MPH and she rolled down her window and stared at it for about 30-40 seconds looking south and it was silently stationary at 75-100 feet above the roof tops. We noticed that there were a lot of dogs barking in the neighborhood. At the time we thought it was due to coyotes running through the neighborhood, but in hindsight it may be related to the observed object.  At this point she had the only view of it and told me it decreased its color temperature to a dull rusty red color and then just disappeared.  We were 800 feet down range from its position and It seemed to notice that people were observing it. I have had a prior close encounter in November 2020 and this object may be the same one from November. I will report that separate. The weather at Merrill Ranch was clear skies, some low level dust/haze, cool temperatures in the upper 40’s with light and variable winds from the northwest at about 5-15 knots. I am a former U.S. Military Service Member with combat experience and my wife is a career management professional. The event left both of us with an uneasy feeing, that something so quiet could silently creep through a populated residential area virtually undetected.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,33.01631578947368,-111.3677947368421

My girlfriend and I were driving south down 58 and I kept having an impulse to look to my left window as the moon was dazzlingly bright and the night sky full of detail. I decided to slow my car to a halt in the middle of 58 as it was almost 9:00 pm with cars neither ahead or behind me as far as the eye could see. After I stopped my car I killed the lights and turned it off. It was dark ahead, behind, and all around me the only details to be seen were what was illuminated by moonlight. I stepped out and standing as still as I could muster took a 7 second long exposure shot of the night sky which initially I thought nothing of. Two days later while inspecting the photo I noticed 3 red lights in the top left of the frame in what appears to be a round or egg shaped-something in the cloud.

Then out of the corner of my eye I saw another aircraft flying the same path in the space between the two other aircraft but behind. The speed of it did not seem out of the ordinary. This one got my attention. I got up and walked out away from the patio and watched it. What caught my attention was it was orange with no other blinking lights as general aircraft would have. I was trying to see other lights on it and its altitude verses the other aircraft traveling the same path. My initial thought was it was higher than both. Then I saw it slow and seemed to turn north but then stop. I thought only a helicopter can do that but its too high and no other lights can be seen on the aircraft. Now I am wishing I had my camera. It stayed in that position for about 15 to 20 seconds then just faded out. My thoughts where it left the sky in a southern path directly in opposite line with my sight of it.

I stood and watched for about 10 minutes the area where the light faded out to see anything and nothing appeared, it was gone. During the entire time of this sighting, I witnessed no sound from the aircraft. I am only making this report because of these facts, I have never seen anything like this in my 58 years.

The object hovered, moved forward quickly, hovered again, moved forward, and repeated this pattern for several minutes.

I opened his trunk and grabbed his briefcase and at the exact moment this happened I saw something appear out of the corner of my eye. I saw and watched in disbelief as three lights turned on in the night sky and stayed floating there in the same exact fixed spot. By the time the third light had turned on I was running back inside as fast as I could because my gut told me exactly what it was because I had never seen anything do that before even as a little boy who owned a telescope and frequently watched the stars at night with my father and I don’t neighbor. I ran back inside in tears I was so scared and all I could otter out of my mouth was that they were here. We all went back outs! ide as a family and by the time they had calmed me down and I had dragged them back outside the entire neighborhood was basically outside watching what was now five lights in a perfect horizontal formation above the tree line to the south end of my parents neighborhood. The lights stayed in the exact same spot hovering there is more and more helicopters surrounded them. This went on for about an hour and then the lights turned on access information from horizontal to perpendicular. The lights then stayed like that for a while. About an hour after that the lights returned to their original horizontal formation and then turned off in the exact same order that they appeared in.

I saw a extraterrestrial woman that was a illuminating light blue color in my bedroom and became paralyzed for a unknown amount of time,Monroe,LA,2008-08-02T02:30:00,unknown,Uncertain,"Occurred : 8/2/2008 02:30  (Entered as : 08/02/08 2:30) Reported: 8/28/2021 1:42:01 AM 01:42 Posted: 9/7/2021 Location: Monroe, LA Shape: Unknown Duration:Uncertain",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/164/S164458.html,"I saw a extraterrestrial woman that was a illuminating light blue color in my bedroom and became paralyzed for a unknown amount of time I have kept this encounter a secret for sometime from many people due to me not knowing why it happened or understanding exactly what happened. I have only told my family close friends about this encounter. I have no reason to lie about this encounter, and I vow that everything I tell you is the truth. I was about 8 years old when my extra terrestrial encounter occurred. My skin tingles  just from recalling the night that it happened.  I was sleeping with my grandmother on this night, due to my parents being absent drug addicts. I was awoken by something out of this world. When I opened my eyes, the first thing I saw struck me so hard that I became paralyzed, I couldn’t move or speak. I was utterly terrified, awestruck by the beauty, and soothed at the same time. What I saw was a unmistakable human-like woman in some type of dress with a veil over her face. Non of her skin was showing, but I could make out facial features and she was unnaturally beautiful, like nothing you may see in even the most beautiful woman in the world. She was floating a couple inches above the carpet floor and all one color of the lightest shade blue imaginable, and she was illuminating like her body was made of light. She had all the features of a normal human other than the fact that she was glowing.  When I finally came out of the trance-like paralyzed state dang near rolled under my grandmother, woke her up and tried getting her to see what I had seen, but when she finally woke up and rolled over to look at the doorway that I saw the extra terrestrial at it was too late. It’s like the ET disappeared into thin air when I looked away to wake up my grandmother. After I explained to her what I had seen she dismissed it and said I had just had a bad dream but that was definitely impossible. I thought that the house was haunted and barely slept much in that house afterwards, we ended up having to move because of this. My grandparents talked to people about the previous owners and found out that the couple who owned the house before us were the first owners. The man committed suicide in the house and the rest of the woman ended up selling the house years later. So this information rules out anything paranormal, which I don’t really believe too much about the paranormal.  I believe that the ET had not intended on me seeing her because during the paralyzed state I got the feeling of being soothed while being utterly terrified, and I kept forming the word “helped” in my mind. Although, as you can imagine, a 8 year old with this kind of experience will want nothing more than to run to the closest person around, and definitely won’t listen to anything that they are being told. The fact that she was trying to soothe me in some unknown way, and tapping into my mind forming the word “helped” makes me believe that she somehow altered me.  I have always been the kind of person that sleeps on my belly or my side and with the cover pulled up as high as I can get it without it affecting my breathing, and when I woke up and saw the woman I was on my back with the covers barely above my belly. This is the second reason I believe she studied or altered me, but I am not sure if this happened in the bedroom or if I was taken somewhere. The third reason I believe that I was studied or altered is because I had a seizure not too long before of this encounter while at baseball practice, the seizure occurred no more than a year before the encounter. What makes this fact important is that the seizure was determined to be unknown and classified as a granny seizure.  The next few reasons I believe I was altered could be coincidence, but I will explain them anyway because I believe that the are relevant. While I was in high school I was sitting outside scrolling through my phone when I felt a tingling sensation in my body and a vibration from the ground, then about 30 seconds later I heard a boom. What I heard was a electrical power plant that had a explosion exactly 1.45 miles away. I knew exactly what happened as soon as it happened some how, even though our electricity didn’t go out. I went inside and asked my grandparents if they heard it and told them I felt something before it happened. When I was in the 6th grade my house was struck by lightning while I was asleep, I woke up and hollered at my grandmother from my bedroom asking what that was and she said it must’ve been a transformer explosion on a light pole. She went back to sleep but I had a eerie feeling something was wrong so stayed awake on my phone and about 30-45 mins later someone started banging on our door and that’s when I knew I had to get out the house, I ran to my grandmothers bedroom and she had just gotten out of bed. Her room was fairly full of smoke, it wasn’t anymore than 5-10 minutes after we stepped outside and called the fire department that the roof began to cave in. The last reasoning to my belief may or may not have any relevance but it is very unlikely that all of this and more has happened to me without being related to the lightning shaped birthmark I have on my arm.",2021-09-07T00:00:00,32.52765019762846,-92.05586758893281

This is less consequential than most reports, but I’ve had it in my head for a little while and now would like to just put it out there in hopes that it helps build the network towards something bigger.  In 2011, I bought my first house in Tucson, Arizona. It’s possible that this occurred anywhere from November 2011 – May 2012. I was outside at dusk doing some light gardening in my front yard when I saw a little green orb, about the size of a softball from my angle. I would guess it was about 15-20 feet above the ground, so not very far. It was moving in a very bizarre and agile way. I could have sworn it was somehow beckoning me to follow it. I went to get my boyfriend, but he was busy, so instead I leashed up my dog. We followed it up the street, all the while it was moving back and forth, reminding me of a child or dog that’s very excited to get you to see something. At the end of the street though, I was suddenly extremely frightened. I turned around and with my dog literally ran back home. I’ve since seen things like drones that have a little light on them, and this certainly wasn’t that. There was no sound, the light wasn’t attached to anything (it was dusk but still l! ight enough to see that), and it was a much larger, softer green glow, a little bigger than the size of a fist. When I got back inside and was breathing heavily from running, my boyfriend was finally intrigued enough to come out and look. But it was gone. Sadly I didn't have a camera phone at the time.   That’s it!

I am 23 years old now, and was about 20 years old at the time. My one other witness to this event is my roommate (K) at the time, who was about 25.  I remember this day pretty vividly as it sent me into a bit of an obsession for months after this happened. I first assumed that what we saw was military since we are coastal. I will relay what happened as best as I can. I had never considered until recently what we saw that evening could’ve been ET.  About 4:30 / 5 PM - K and I are going to a gas station up the street. We turn right from Pepys Ln, left onto S College, and go to the BP on the right side of the road. This is just barely off of UNCW campus. K goes into buy beer since I am underage, and we set back for the short .3 mi journey home.  We were sober when we left for the gas station, and had been all day. Neither of us have hallucinogenic or delusional mental disorders, and have never seen anything like this. I am driving, and turn left back onto S College, and K and I almost immediately see a rather large aircraft. It was hard to tell at first glance how close it was and the size, but it didn’t take long to realize that it was flying at about the same height as the stoplight we were approaching. It was so low.  I then noticed that it was dark grey/black, the size of a typical sedan, and was spherical with short wings extending from the sides. The shape was honestly hard to decipher because I had never seen any type of craft designed this way, and definitely not this close to the ground.  I remember hearing a low whirring. I think that it may have had two propeller sort of mechanisms underneath the wings. I couldn’t tell if it was big enough to be manned or unmanned. K and I were both yelling at each other to make sure we were seeing the same thing. Without having to say much at all, we were both in awe of what we were seeing, and also terrified.  I needed to get in the right turn lane at the light (S College/Randall) to get us back home. Along that turn lane, vehicles could turn earlier into a Rooms To Go parking lot that was across from where K and I lived. I wanted to try snd keep looking at what we were seeing, so I quickly turned into the RTG lot. It seemed like the craft noticed me, and it made a ~45 degree turn with minimal effort, and immediately went in the direction of Randall Pkwy over the RTG building.  I saw when it turned that it almost went belly up, and I couldn’t tell how it gained momentum so quickly. It moved away from my vehicle at what I would guess 45/50 MPH, after hovering right above S College Rd barely moving for a solid 20-40 seconds.  I was so in shock of what we had seen, as was K, that we agreed to immediately call the non emergency police number to try and make any real sense of it. We were still at this point convinced we had seen some kind of military UAV/drone/etc, but I have done extensive research and have not seen anything remotely similar to what we saw that day.  The police officer I spoke with asked me if I was being held against my will by somebody and if I had taken any drugs (lol). I knew it sounded ridiculous, but we are both clear on what we saw that day, and have not found any answers that point us in the direction of what it could have been.",2021-09-07T00:00:00,34.23837495219885,-77.87846768642447

My camera and my cell phone were in the boat so I didn’t know what exact time it was. The coyotes were howling and the thousands of stars were big and bright as I have ever seen them.  There is no light pollution in the middle of the prairie land. I walked around my truck to relieve myself when I glanced up at the sky and saw a flash of bright light that looked like a comet, a way bigger flash than a shooting star. I said to myself, “cool, a comet,” but I was more interested in receiving my full bladder.  When I finished relieving myself, I again glanced up to see the “comet” only to see that it had turned into a very large, disc-like shape. It resembled the horizontal shape of a frisbee.  Since I didn’t have a photo, I drew what I saw over photos I had taken of the skyline the night before this happened:  Comet looking flash of light: &#65532;  Turned into this shape: &#65532;  I was in awe and I think my jaw had dropped to the ground. The coyotes had stopped howling and there was absolutely no sound from this craft that was hovering just above the skyline. It started slowly to move east and simultaneously lengthen its shape. It moved alongside the reservoir toward Glasgow Montana and Fort Peck Dam. Fourchette Bay is at least 366 miles from Glasgow according to google. When I saw the disc a quarter of a mile atop the hill from our campsite, I’m guessing the spacecraft was at least the length of a football field. The middle of it was filled with a completely bright, white light—as bright as the brightest LED light there is and it had a luminous blue hue surrounding it.  I thought about getting my camera out of the boat but I got scared thinking this thing may see me and snatch me up. I became nervous but not terrified and decided to hide myself behind my truck.  As I watched this thing move laterally and slowly eastward, it lengthen as it moved. Aft! er it moved further away, and I couldn’t tell if it was a mile long, 5 miles long, or a 100 miles long, or how fast it was really going.  I was so in awe I didn’t even think to wake any of my friends. When I told them the next morning of what I had witnessed, they were silent and probably thinking I was nuts!  I really don’t care if anyone believes me.  It has taken me 3 months to digest this experience. I finally found your website and looked at the reports and this report may be the same craft witnessed by 3 more people:  &#65532;  I would like to communicate with them and see their photo, so if there is a way to talk with them it would be through you folks. I know myself well enough to know I don’t have the imagination to make this experience up. My perspective about the reality of our world has changed.  I can no longer look at the sky as I once did.  I now am open more than ever to all possibilities of this reality being more than what our senses tell us…. This was an experience that haunts me everyday and now I want to know more.",2021-09-07T00:00:00,,

Lands metres from me in street. This happened a few months ago, and I've been trying to get my head around it since. Definitely not like anything I've even heard of before. I'd seen weird shit in the sky before but man, was this different.  It was about 6.15pm and I had just left my house to drive to the swimming pools. Daylight savings had recently ended so it was already very dark. I got to the end of my street, about 400m from my house when I saw it.  To give you an idea of what was around me, I was at a small cross shaped intersection. There is a small street about 80m in length, directly across from the road I was on, right next to an apartment building.  Next thing I know, before I turned left, I see what looked like a shooting star (meteorite) flying rapidly across the sky towards the horizon. Now, one of my worst fears has always been seeing a meteor hit earth and kill us all. So my immediate reaction was, ""Holy fuck. That's way too bright and going for way too long to just be a meteorite. This might be the end.""  It travelled across the sky for a good 3 or 4 seconds, almost reaching the horizon (my guess was that it was about a few kilometres high in the sky, and miles away from me.) This is where it blew my mind.  Instead of disappearing over the horizon or hitting the earth, it floated down smoothly and gently, in a sort of arc shape and landed on the footpath, right on the little street in front of me. I felt chills run up my spine and my instincts told me to fucking get out of there.  I turned left and drove away, terrified at the idea of what the hell I just saw. I mean, nothing about it appeared sinister at all. But the sheer nonsensical and unexpected nature of it was enough to make me think it could have been anything (angel/alien/demon).  It looked just like a point of light with a glowing ring around it, no bigger than a basketball. Once it touched the footpath it was obscured by the street lights, and perhaps other objects on the footpath, and somewhat regrettably, I didn't hang around to get a better look.  The rationalist in me kept trying to think, OK maybe it was a drone, maybe it was a fucking firefly. At this point nothing seemed too ridiculous to consider. But none of them made any more sense than the other.  Has anybody else had a similar sighting?  Am I missing something here?  P. S if the admin of this site wants to know the location of this event, I'm happy to disclose. I know for a fact that there is a security camera right where the object landed. I contacted the owner of the building but he seemed uninterested and was not willing to check the footage for me. I think if someone official/credible contacted him, he might be pursuaded to check the cameras. The sooner the better because I don't how long they keep the footage.",2021-09-07T00:00:00,,

The spacing was not exact, but the trajectory appeared to be exact, in order to create the vast single-file line. The movement was roughly North-South or NW-SE and the front leading light of the impossibly long line was about 5:55 and lasted for nearly 10 minutes until tail end of the line crossed over my home on Stanley Mountain.  Military aircraft has formerly been sighted many times since living here adjacent to a canyon between Bear Mountain and Stanley Mountain.

The shape of the object was a half sphere (the top round and the bottom flat). It looked like it was flying forward, causing the object to lean forward which just doesn’t make technical sense to the technology provided today.

As it was dark, I could not discern any form or silhouette between or around the lights, so I don’t know whether this was a solid object or not. About 10 minutes later, another formation of identical description moved parallel to, but slightly east of, the first formation’s apparent path. Both times, the three lights were solid in brightness and white, and neither made any noise. The weather was mostly clear, and there was some light smoke from a bonfire nearby. Only the first formation was observed through this smoke. I have been an amateur astronomer for about a decade, so I can confidently rule out satellites (based on rapid speed across the sky) and airplanes (based on solid lights and no sound).

Healthy adult with good hearing and vision. Time of sighting: 8:07 PM, US Eastern time, 4/4/2021 Duration of sighting: 3 minutes The weather at the time of the sighting was clear. There was very little wind at ground level, no clouds were in the sky, and the sun was setting. I saw a light in the sky off to the East. At first I assumed it was an aircraft, but I noticed it looked a bit odd. There was only a single light, and it seemed to be ""flickering"" the way a reflected fire might. The object  seemed to be at a fairly high altitude, approximately that of a commercial aircraft; higher than a helicopter would typically fly. The object was moving from East to West in what seemed to be a straight line, at a very consistent and somewhat slow speed, compared to a commercial jet. The object didn't  fly directly over me, I was a bit North of its path. As it came closer I realized the illumination on the object was because it was reflecting the setting sun - that it's front surface was apparently reflective. At least, that is my assumption. When the object went past me and I could see the bottom and back of it, I saw no other lights. No running lights of any kind were visible. The bottom and rear sides appeared dark or black. The object did not appear to be large, and I could not make out any detail. It appeared to be a ""simple"" shape such as an oval or sphere. There were no wings, no fins, or other projecting parts visible. The object did not leave any visible wake or contrail behind it. There was no detectable sound from the object at any point during the sighting. The object continued on its straight-line course at the same consistent altitude and speed until it was out of sight over the treeline on the Western horizon.

I’m estimating that the craft was approximately 7-10 thousand feet up and was approaching at a low speed. I watched it for at least 2-3 minutes. It seemed to be on a path that would bring it right over my house, which in near N Dysart Rd and W Jomax Rd. I started to feel like it was actually coming right towards me at one point.

The stars were out now and we could see the big dipper.  This object was brighter than any of the stars visible. We checked the constellation maps and planet Venus was the brightest but it had already set. I kept checking throughout the evening and the object had drifted back to where I first saw it.

It was weird so I did the second best thing and that was grab my phone and start recording. I live out in the country so it’s super dark out here we see all the stars but this was far from a star. This isn’t the first sighting either. I didn’t report the other ones. Anyways in my video when I look at it and zoom it, it’s this circle shape object with an outer ring around it, spinning super fast I mean uncontrollably fast. Almost like lightning fast.

Traveling north in the vehicle I was driving on PA Route 168, at approximately 19:25 hours on Dec. 10th 2020, bordering Raccoon Creek State Park, I witnessed a very bright blue light travel east to west across almost the entire width of the night sky. I can’t describe it as an aircraft because it flew well below where planes usually fly, about where low clouds usually float, and at such a super high rate of speed; way faster than any man-made aircraft. I did not see an actual object; just saw what appeared to be the fiery, sparking, bluish bright tail of some super-sonic object. There may have been a reddish, orangish tip, but the light I saw can be described as the tail of a rocket. The windows were up in the vehicle I was driving and I did not hear any sound, which surprised me, given the fairly low altitude the object traveled. It only took about 3 seconds to travel across almost the entire night sky, and then I suddenly lost sight of it; much like it just disappeared. I actually kind of waited for an explosion or a ‘boom,’ but nothing. After driving about a couple hundred yards from where I last saw it, I pulled off into the Nichol Rd parking lot of the state park and looked back to where the object flew over. To my surprise, there was a distinct line of what appeared to be smoke across the entire width of the clear, starry sky, exactly where this object traveled! Against the night sky, this smokey line it was visible to naked eye, as well as the stars in the sky, however my iphone could not capture this remarkable sight. This was the proof that something of sheer volume and speed had indeed traveled through our atmosphere. Again, the altitude seemed! to be about where clouds are normally seen. I made a couple of calls to friends to report what I had witnessed. I stayed in this parking lot for about an hour; watching the sky and viewing the smokey line. It took an extremely long time for it to start fading away. Even at the half-hour mark, it was still very distinct and visible. It did very slowly start to shorten and fade to the south after about an hour. The only thing I could compare this smokey line to was what one of those “skywriter” crafts leave behind, but they are only seen during the day; their lines fade much faster; and they are flown at extreme high altitudes. This sighting was indeed like nothing I’ve ever seen before. Its shape, behavior, speed, and character was like nothing from this planet. It left behind a distinct travel path which proved its flight through our sky. I just wish I could’ve viewed it longer; I wish I would’ve seen it coming and been ready with a camera; I wish someone else had been with me to share in this strange experience; I wish there were other reports of this and more evidence to prove what exactly this UFO was! Perhaps we’ll never know. I hope that the information I provided here leads to some more proof and discovery.

It was just above the tree line aprox 175ft. in altitude. It passed me and disappeared over the tree line 1\4 mile ahead of me on the left side.  Approx size was 10-15 ft in length and solid black in color (Sky was clear & sunny ).  Shape was round or oval. Now as a drone and R/C pilot for many years I am familiar with judging height and speed of the aircraft I fly. I was traveling at 55mph. The unknown aircraft passed me at at least double my speed. My fastest drone will do 45mph. I know of no drone that surpasses 65mph (small racing drones). So tell me, what has no wings, no props, no vertical stabilizer and no visible form of propulsion. I'll grant you a round disc like a frisbee is an airfoil and will fly. Also it was silent. This was not a parachute or hang glider or any thing I've ever seen .

Completely clear sky, it’s getting dark early now here and I could already see the stars incredibly. At home I had gone into my backyard, while out there I noticed one of my daughters window shades was still open (the roll up shade kind and her curtains were pulled shut)(my wife was putting our daughters to bed), I turned around to head back inside to close it. On my way back inside I noticed a seriously bright light travelling along from west to east. I thought it was a plane as this is a very common route that I see planes fly all the time, Windsor airport is west of here and the Detroit airport is west of that. I went in to close the roll up shade, my wife told me it broke, (the chain had slipped off, so I took maybe 2-3 minutes to get it back on and said good night to my daughters again. Then I went back outside to do what I originally went there to do.  As soon as I went outside I looked up toward the north and that bright light was still travelling along from west to east. I thought that’s weird, the lights are usually only on the front of planes as they head towards me.  I typically look at the sky almost every night, especially when it’s clear and you can see the stars. Over the recent years I’ve seen shooting stars, planets, meteor showers, all different kinds of stages of the moon (blood moons recently, they were reported to be due to forest fire smoke and said to be not true blood moons, buck moon (which that same night I saw it, it was like a blood moon and buck moon), and all sorts of other moon stages), satellites, planes, a drone and even a guy flying a chair with one of those big kite surfing kites over him and a big fan on the back… but until now the craziest thing I saw (only two different times) was that Elon star link system. It was creepy, but even that I could rationalize was something because it floats by consistently and the spacing looked strangely perfect, I looked it up and that’s when I learned about what that is. BUT this is why I’m struggling with what I saw, I’m questioning myself wether this is some kind of space x, ! Elon, space force thing that I don’t know about yet. I’m always looking up at the sky, almost every night with the aspirations to spot a UFO or a shooting star, or anything interesting! I love looking at the stars whenever I can, it humbles me.  It was weird how bright it was and there was no flashing lights(planes usually always have flashing lights, often green and red) I thought maybe something over the lake (possibly a helicopter doing another search and rescue) …but no. It travelled west to east over Lake St.Clair. A few minutes later it just took off super fast to the east, like a shooting star! There was what looked like a mini explosion, what a firework looks like when it takes off, like some sparks shooting away from where it blasted off from. Then it had like a trail of light following it out into the sky and i noticed it curved at the end. It looked just like what a shooting star looks like when they’re hitting the atmosphere and burning up, like an orange burning glow. It looked like the craft went up to the upper atmosphere and then followed the contour of the earth down and around. It happened in a second, which is one of the main reasons I don’t think it was anything from our planet. I’ve  never seen ! anything fly like that before. Also it was silent, no plane noise, no helicopter sound and no boom when it took off either. I kept on checking the sky for several minutes after that and I think I did actually spot a satellite or space junk after that, because there was something else that looked like it was moving way up high, like a lot higher than the UFO light… this one was just black looking and floated by steadily, like a shadow blocking stars, that travelled from south to north.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,42.20014358974359,-82.76166410256411

Saturday night March 6, 8pm. East side of main street, Longmont, CO.   Stepped outside to bring laundry to laundry room at my apt.  Looked up at the stars like I always enjoy doing. Was facing south looking at Orion constellation when I noticed movement in lower left part of my view. I turned eyes toward movement and locked onto very large, wide, V shaped craft moving south. Had single row of lights on belly side of wings of craft. There is no fusalage, it's just a V. Estimated altitude possibly 5000 feet. Hard to tell, but pretty high up.  Wing span 3 times as wide as average passenger jet.  Lights were faded almostly ghostly lit. Similar to a glow in the dark frisbee or football faded brightness.  Hard to see unless you are really focusing on it.  Definitely one single solid object, not multiple objects in V formation.  Smooth gliding movement, no sound at all, no blinking marker lights. I have seen this craft 2 other times in Longmont.  Last time I saw this with ! my son when he was 2. We saw this thing very low to the ground, maybe 500 feet stationary hovering above houses. Then it seemed to react to me pointing at it, and it flew towards us and directly over us. That was my 2nd sighting. I noticed then it was transparent, or cloaked, could see the background stars distort around it's edges as it moved. Similar to the Predator in that movie with Arnold. You see the predator better when it is moving in invisibility cloaking because the background distortion around it's edges. Again seeing this much closer up that time, absolutely no sound, no fire, no afterburners. Very smooth movement like melted ice on a counter top. Very large football field size craft. Was bigger than my entire apt. building. I reported that 2nd sighting to Mufon years ago. funny coincidence or not is last time I saw this was Saturday,March 21, 2015 at 8-8:30pm.  Tonight i saw it much higher up Saturday, March 6, 2021, 8pm.  Same month, Sat. night, same time fram! e. Not sure if that relates to anything. I did not have my pho! ne on me , was not expecting to see it. No pictures no video. Even if I had my phone, I was so distracted by looking at the object, by the time my brain tells me pull out phobe to get on camera, it is out of sight. Plus camera phones might not even pick this up that far up in sky at night. Nobody on Earth can ever debunk sightings I have had or convince me it was misidentification of any known craft. People that have never had a sighting really have no say in the matter at all untill you see something yourself. The notion of needing empirical evidence to prove what I say I saw is nonsense, dumb, neanderthal arrogant thinking. I'm not saying this is alien or not, my sense is this is man made secret military craft. Super stealth surveillance platform with some crazy camaflouge or invisibilty cloaking technology.  People want to debunk my thoughts leaning to man made craft and argue that humans don't have that capability, again arrigant closed minded clueless accusation. Reality exists ! in it's true form regardless of peoples opinions. There is disinformation campaign to convince the public to automatically think exotic ufo sightings are always alien to distract from the reality that the military has technology far advanced than they admit.",2021-03-31T00:00:00,40.1703733197556,-105.08544969450101

I was washing a nectarine in the sink when I looked out our kitchen window. At first I thought there was a garbage bag flying through the air about 200m due east from our flat. Then I noticed that there were 10-20 objects all flying in the same direction. They flew in straight lines from south to north and stayed in a kind of random formation, not moving relative to each other. They were small white/gray spheres. Then I noticed about half of them were either intermittently glinting in the sun or emitting light, I wasn’t sure. All of them looked iridescent green like the back of a fly in the sun, except for one which shone/glinted red. The whole sighting was probably 10 to 20 seconds before they traversed my field of view and/or disappeared behind rooftops and treetops.  I pulled out my camera and managed to take two pictures, in one I captured about 5 objects and in the other only one. I then tried to film them but something went wrong with the recording and although you can hear my voice the image is frozen which is a bit weird. The images are from the last half of the sighting when I got my wits together enough to try to get visual evidence.  It is possible that these were drones but we are close to an international airport so I don’t think it would be any professional drone pilot operating these. Also not clear why there would be so many flying in a random formation. Thus I actually think these were proper UFOs/UAPs – my wife a glowing orb the same section of sky at roughly the same distance in the middle of the night about two years ago for whatever that’s worth.  As for my bona fides I have two engineering degrees and a PhD in neuroscience and don’t consider myself prone to flights of fancy nor was I hallucinating – I was working at the time (unless coding triggers hallucinations). While I don’t have any firm beliefs on what they actually are, I do believe there is ample evidence of UAP generally.

They appeared one by one, about every three minutes, from midnight to 12:18 AM. Five of the objects moved from my east to my west, and one moved from my northwest to my southeast. The first two objects were a little north of me, the second two almost directly overhead, and the last two a little south of my location. The objects first appeared at about a 40 degree angle to ground  position, and appeared about 1/5 the size of an average moon when passing over our position.  They looked like large military helicopter size, but as they steadily moved forward, away and upward, they appeared smaller and smaller, until they disappeared into space on the distant horizon.  It took about three minutes from initial sighting, at what appeared as lower altitude, to disappearance, at what appeared to we extremely high altitude.  It was difficult to estimate altitude, but I first thought the first object was a sheriff's helicopter, at low altitude, coming because of new years gunshots. Upon two of the objects, one by one, disappearance in the eastern sky, I saw four separate blue/white flashes/sparks in the dark sky, near where the objects were last seen. They looked like photo flash bulbs or sparks going off in the sky, roughly the diameter of an average moon.  I have never seen anything like that, and the sparks occurred at a very high altitude. Before the last object traveled from the NW to the SE, I ran in an grabbed my 15X x 70mm Celestron astronomical binoculars.  I was able to focus and view the last object clearly for over 10 seconds, as it was moving away.  It appeared to be reddish orange glowing perfectly spherical plasma (there was a flaming character to it), with a round white halo around it. The halo was six times the size of the ball. The halo reflected white light against some slight feathery clouds that were present. There was no trail, contrail, or exhaust coming from the object. I have worked in aerospace and defense procurement and manufacturing, for over 40 years.  I know what satellites look like in the night sky.  I know what helicopters and jet aircraft look like in the night sky. These objects were UAP, and exibited high strangeness.  I know Sky Harbor tower had to have seen the objects, but, I no longer have any FAA contacts to refer to. I waited for an hour after 12:18 AM to see if there would be further activity, and there was none.  It is worthy of note that my internet search that night found videos of orange/red orbs captured at midnight new years eve 2020 in over 10 US states, and in Autrailia, The Netherlands, The UK, Mexico, and others.  These videos match what we saw, only our sightings seemed much closer at first viewing, when the objects were at low altitude. Oddly, all the internet videos seem to have been taken at midnight their time zone, right when people were watching fireworks displays.  All the objects and descriptions of the objects seem to be very similar.  Very strange phenomenon, indeed.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,33.414035671514114,-111.92091958939265

She pointed toward the moon, which was full and bright in the southeast. We all looked up. At first, we were silent. Then we started saying many things like: I see it! Do you see this? I can't believe it! This is not natural or man-made!  The formation had 40 or more lights. The lights were spread out in a vertical band, ranging from below the moon down toward the horizon. Each light was a separate sparkle made of short, thin, sharp, crisscrossing, radiating lines. Each sparkle was small relative to the overall formation. Four out of five in our group saw different colors among the sparkles. The fifth in our group (me) had coated eyeglasses and did not see the colors. The sparkles did not look like stars. Each sparkle would be in the same spot for about 15 to 30 seconds, then fade. But the approximate number of sparkles in the formation stayed the same for most of the time that we observed it. Then the sparkles started to fade and disappeared entirely over one or two minutes. The overall formation stayed in the same general area but constantly shifted slightly as some sparkles faded in and others faded out. The overall shape of the formation was resembled a geometric kite, with more sparkles at the top closest to the moon, and with fewer sparkles ranging down along a kite tail decorated with knots. The overall shape of the formation, though, was not distinct or familiar, and it did not maintain a consistent shape. The formation was visible for about 10 minutes and then the number of visible sparkles started to fade. Within a minute all of the sparkles were gone. I photographed and filmed some of the event with my iPhone, but the formation does not seem visible on my phone or on my desktop. While we were watching, someone in our group said it was like plankton glowing at night in the sea. Four of us had seen pictures of glowing plankton and agreed there was a similarity.

I was in shock while staring at it, and found myself hyperventilating and unable to move.

In around 45 minutes to an hour, a huge green glowing triangular shaped object comes from the same direction as the first 2, while its red and white lights are turning on and off in a wave formation as it ascends. Not even 20 seconds later, from the opposite direction again, comes another ufo. This one almost appears to be ""broken"", its lights are flickering on and off while it rocks back and forth similar to a boat on rough waters. At this point I could see both of them moving at the same time. All of these ufos disappeared into the horizon, while maintaining their flickering lights.

They did not interact with one another but moved in the same pathway along the highway. This second craft was noticibily smaller. The crafts were cube shaped and casted a shadow on the hillside. They had distinct edges giving shape to a cube. I could see the shadows being created on its surface. It was very far away from me but I could see the lighting on its surface. It stayed at the Same elevation. I thought it was a helicopter or hot air balloon. If it was a hot air balloon it was all black and the first time I had ever seen an all black airballoon.this craft was massive and not afraid of people seeing it.

Upon closer inspection the object, about 300 yards out, was silvery-white and did not vary from its path right at the water surface level.  It was moving about 30 to 40 mph in a straight line. It would move below the water's surface and reappear as the waves had no effect on it. I tried to focus on the shape of the object but could only determine that it was about 18 inches in length and appeared to be somewhat cylinder shaped with two prongs sticking out from the underside. No lights were visible on it. It was ju! st plain odd and did not look like anything else I had ever seen on the water. It showed no wake or water disturbance. It past the ferry as it traveled south with the ferry;  it was going faster than the ferry and then seemed to veer out further west toward a group of fishing boats gathered in one spot. I lost sight of it then.  A few minutes later as I continued to look west another identical object, further out from where I first saw the first one, seemed to join the first one in that general area, both heading south and then a bit westward.

I always like to look at the stars in the morning. This was impossible to miss. In the East-Southeast sky almost directly overhead, there was a long line of ""stars"" moving in a slow manner. The Line was almost perfectly linear. Their brightness was appx. that of nearly the brightest star at this time of morning.  They moved appx the same speed a satellite would, but they were clearly brighter than any satellite would appear this late in the morning.  And somehow we could tell that they were nearer to earth than a moving satellite, although their altitude seemed very high.  There was absolutely NO sound associated with them, and it was very quiet with zero traffic noise, etc.  They moved from northwest to southeast, at constant speed.  Once they got fairly near the horizon they disappeared one by one.  I believe there is no moon or very little moon today, and there was no glow from the sun in the east (too early).  I gotta say, this is my first Definite UFO sighting that can't be written off as something else.  Unless the military has craft that can fly at such extreme altitude without noticeable sound, or there are ""squadrons"" of low earth satellites being produced.  JUST INSANE !

I was driving to my 5am work shift. It was 4:45am and I was the only one on the road. I wasn’t even listening to music because I was trying to get my Apple Music to work and it wasn’t connecting. As I’m driving, a huge spotlight appears on the road above my car and slightly to the left. It quickly moves to the left, then it moves to the right. Then it sees my car and settles on my car and me. It was dead silent. I sped up to get away and it disappeared. I was driving north on 15th Ave before the Ballard bridge in Seattle, Washington. I’m not crazy, there was no streetlights or helicopters above me or anything and the moon wasn’t even visible like it was pitch black, silent, and I was alone. It was about 20 seconds long. I was unsettled all day. The beam of light wasn’t really visible, just the circle of light on the ground. It felt like someone shining a flashlight from above and seeing movement (my car) and settling on it. It also kept pace with being above my car as I moved until it settled on me. It was illuminated inside the car as well. Extremely unsettling.  What is even more unsettling is this was on Wednesday and after work I had an errand to run with a friend that was very memorable for the two of us and we took photos even. That night, I had a dream that was extremely vivid and detailed and it was a complete “re-do” of my Wednesday - I had slept in for my shift at work but still went in, worked a whole shift, had meaningful conversations with people, went home and napped on the couch. I woke up in bed then next day (Thursday) stunned by my dream. I usually do not dream at all. It could be a coincidence, or it could be a possible tampering of my conception of time and try to “replace” that day? I told the friend I went on the errand with about the spotlight as soon as it happened and then about the dream. They confirmed that Wednesday happened just as inexperienced (the spotlight in the morning and then the errand) and that I did not disappear. The photos we took are still on my phone, as is all my messages about the spotligh! t.  I am just so unsettled by the entire occurrence.

It did have a long tail, and streaked through the air, not particularly fast, as has always been the case with other shooting stars I’ve observed in the past. It almost looked like it could’ve been a part of a firework, but no fireworks were observed or recorded in our town, or surrounding towns on this night, and there was no audible noise from fireworks, either. I also did not note it dissipating in brightness, or falling in a pattern that you would expect a firework to do.  It threw me so, that I did not even get a chance to point it out to my husband, until it had disappeared from view. It flew out of my sight, obscured by our barn, but a bit farther in the background where there is a few miles of wetlands and forest brush. My check or local social networking groups yielded no other reports (where everything and anything is typically reported).  I kept an eye out for the remainder of the evening, but did not see anything else. I also did not leave my house to investigate any further.

They were both oval, but so bright that it was difficult to make out the edges. Then the lead one began to fly to the right of the other one and go East while the other stayed on path to North. It then appeared to stop.  The one that turned to the East appeared to flip? It went from a sphere to more of a bell shape. It then rolled until a flat underside appeared, at first, I thought it must be a plane and was mistaken. The bright white glowing lights lessened, and 3 green circular lights lit up solid on the flat side. They did not flash like airplanes. It continued to move East.

I live in community called Eldorado at Santa Fe, which is about 8 miles east of downtown Santa Fe.  It’s a large community with very little light pollution so our visibility is incredible.  That being said you could see an objet to the West Skies in between the Sandia Mountains (Albuquerque) and the Jemez (Los Almos) hovering and moving up and down and side ways.   The light emanating form this very large object was so bright that my son commented on how his eyes were watering from looking at it too long.  This object was in the sky for almost 35 minutes with my own eyes.  I took video of the object cause I was not really sure what my eyes were seeing.  The object seems to make geometric patters at some points and even have different colors that appeared to be flashing.  Some of the light coming from the object seemed to make it look like there might have been more then one object.  I videotaped the object for about four minuets and towards the end of the video around 4:08-4:09 you can see a green flash come from the object.  I went inside for a few minuets then came back out to see if the object was still there and it was but it had moved and also looked as if it had dimmed.

I noticed as it kept going on an upward trend straight up that there were 2 fiery streaks that trailed behind the fireball object. I picked up my phone and started recording video because it was hard to make out and I zoomed in and was able to make out the fireball shape with the trails behind it. I recorded this for 1 min 29 seconds and put my phone down to use my bathroom inside my bedroom and when I came back to look the sky was very grey and cloudy and the object seemed to disappear. I live in an apartment complex and this was seen north ! off my bedroom balcony. I have attached a link to the video I recorded for further investigation and I also noticed after watching the video 44 to 45 seconds in I seen a small metal object to the top right of the fireball but that also disappeared in seconds of recording.

The object appeared to waffle around in a near static location. It was very difficult to understand what I was looking at, as it didn't make sense the more I looked at it. After a couple of minutes of observation, the object began to head South and appeared to gain altitude, as it grew smaller in appearance. I attempted to take a very short video of the object in which you can see the object. However, the quality nor length was solid, as by the time I thought to film it, the object had already began to fade. While the object was staying in one location, it almost appeared that it was having difficulty maintaining flight (it was weird).  I tried to rule out the balloon theory, as the object headed South above highway 75 and according to the Aviation Weather Center, the wind barbs had the wind at 3000ft going at 35 knots from the West at the time of the sighting, which didn't line up with the direction the object was heading.

My husband and I had heard fighter jets buzz over the area this morning before we were out of bed (Not sure the exact time of the flyover, but was certainly before 10:30am). Being that Colorado Springs is not too far, it's routine to have them fly through the area sometimes, so we thought nothing of it. We knew they were fighter jets as we have both Denver International and a regional airport flight paths that go directly over our home everyday, so there is very much a distinct difference in sound when plane types fly over (my husband also has his private pilot's license). My husband had been feeling as if he was coming down with a cold but was hungry, so I got dressed and got one of our dogs ready so I could load up the car and grab lunch for us both. It was right around noon that I stepped outside with one of my dogs to let them go to the bathroom in the backyard before getting in the car. As we were walking into the backyard, the garage door was opening, so by the time our dog finished, we would walk straight out to the car. While in the backyard, I heard the garage door sound stop but I then heard fighter jets flying nearby again (Couldn't make out where they were as our backyard skyview is full of tall trees). I didn't see the jets, so my dog and I walked back into the garage and out to the car. I popped the hatch to my car and had my dog jump in, and I just happened to look up in the sky (west), I saw something just up in the distance that was hovering and also reflecting. I didn't think anything of it as it was in one of the Denver International flight paths that goes overhead of our house out west to the Rocky Mountains. As I noticed that it wasn't white like most of the airliners and not moving at all (just hovering - not going forward or backwards and not going up or down...remained in the same place in the sky and I know that it did because of the trees that it was between from my viewpoint), I tried to look closer with my naked eye. When I realized that it was 100% not an aircraft, I pulled out my phone to see if I could get a video or picture. It was a completely cloudless day, sunny, and an amazing temperature (70s). As I had my phone camera open and looked at my screen, it was so bright and sunny that I couldn't see what was on my screen. Also, because I didn't have any clouds or anything in the background of the sky, I couldn't even tell if I had the object in my phone view, so I just snapped a picture hoping that maybe I had gotten something and gave that up. I did, however, call my husband (did! n't want to lose sight of the object if I went inside and stil! l had my dog in the back hatch) and immediately told him to come out. After I hung up, I grabbed a pair of binoculars that I always keep in the back hatch (along with other roadside items for my camping that I do and anything else should I break down), and immediately looked to find the object. I found it, and I was absolutely jaw-dropped when it came into view. I literally cannot explain what I saw as I don't even have anything that I know of to compare it to. It was close enough that I could see the object in full view in my binoculars but far enough that I couldn't make out fine details. I tried to focus what little ability I had on my binoculars but it didn't help, and I was also very, very excited and curious of what I was seeing that I probably didn't even do it right. But, I could absolutely tell that there were no wings, nothing being emitted from the craft (fumes, heat signatures/flames/waves, nothing that I could see from my distance). As it hovered, it was almost like it ! was slowly rotating and as it rotated (if it was at all), it appeared as if it were both dull and reflective (reflective on only some parts of it and not all...very hard to describe). And there seemed to be what was like a red light on it (I think on the lower (groundward direction), thinner end of the craft) but I couldn't tell if it was like a circular light that we would normally expect to see or if it was a large part of the craft that was simply that color and reflecting or if it was a large part of the craft that was lighting up. It was bright enough to notice but faint enough that I couldn't exactly make it out. The craft itself was almost concave...it wasn't round or circular...it was long though but still looked like it was almost concave. It didn't appear to be completely smooth...it was almost like it was bubbly on some parts? Again...I'm having such a hard time explaining what I saw. I can somewhat make it out in my head but can't put it into words.  My husband was out at this point, and I handed over the binoculars. He saw it and didn't really say anything. He handed back the binoculars to me and walked inside. He didn't really want to look at it anymore and didn't think anything of it.  At this point, my neighbor from directly across the street had seen me looking up frantically and came out with her binoculars. She started talking to me, and the aircraft had already started to slowly move southwest from where I originally saw it. It didn't take but a couple of minutes before it was too far to see anything but the reflections from the object when looking through my binoculars. My neighbor didn't get to see it before it was gone. I never saw or heard any jets after that point in time, but I did see commercial airliners continue on their normal flight paths. There's honestly no way in my mind how the airliners couldn't have picked this up on radar or had not radioed it in or reported this if they were flying near this.  I have a single picture that I thought wouldn't actually show anything at all, but it actually does (just not really anything that you can make out with any details). The phone used was a 2017 Pixel 2 G011A. This was what was used at the time of the sighting and was the best that I had available.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,39.82714549180328,-105.11018401639345

I have a 180-degree view from my balcony and I was trying to capture photos and videos of the amazing lightning strikes with my phone camera.  Helicopters fly around this neighborhood incessantly and while I noticed a bright light headed towards me to my left I assumed it was a helicopter, so I maintained my focus on the lightning strikes in the southeast. I sensed something fly over the balcony awning I was standing beneath. However, I didn't actually “see” this very fast, bright, seemingly triangular object until I scrolled through my images.  Today, on closer inspection, I noted what appears to be a second similarly-shaped light flying at a similar speed in the far background. At first, I assumed this was an airplane flying in front of the storm to make its descent towards Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). LAX is southwest of where I was standing (to the right) in the video and images. I don’t think these are planes or helicopters. They are both moving way too fast. Unfortunately, the TV was on loud in the background and the wind was howling so I turned off the ringer on my phone. I might have picked up sound as well, had I known I would capture these images. I want to be clear that these images are authentic, unedited, and have not been tampered with in any way.

I Seen one small orange Stationary object at 21:45. Shortly after, the object emitted a very large white orb. The object then multiplied. The two large white orbs eventually took off slowly, but erratically. They seemed to have been avoiding aircraft that was present (passenger jet, helicopters, and fighter jets). The orange one, also multiplied, but kept appearing, and reappearing. This event carried on countless times over the course of 3 hours. I have over 30 minutes of compelling video unlike anything i have ever seen or imagined. I also have hours of unprocessed footage on my Go pro that i set up after i slept.  My Room mate is the witness. We were in my bedroom looking out of my window of an apartment. This happened over Aurora Colorado.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,39.68000198902607,-104.7929670781893
