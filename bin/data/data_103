It seemed as if it had picked us up on rader and it was busted. It then went to my right and sort of toward two o'clock.  Then it swooped back toward it's starting point.  As it did, it seemed to spin around and this intense white white white light shines, right into my eyes, and W2's.  But, it doesn't light up around us or the surrounding sky, like a lighthouse would.  As quick as it shined it kept spinning to it's previous pulsating light. It came in circular form in the object.  Like on a belt; from it's left rear, around the front of it, so bright, then to the right and behind.  But only once.  It was like, for the moment the light was right on, it was the only focus. W2 said, ""It was like a photographer, five feet in front of you.  And that's about how long it was there, just a flash.""  It then kept going to the left at a stable speed, keeping a line, until it was gone.  So W2 and I finally come back to the house and are talking about it outside when W3 comes down.  We start telling him about it, and this light starts coming back across the sky, left to right. W2 and W3 saw it turn and head toward the two o'clock direction where it was going to go when we first came upon it. I saw it disaper into the trees. It wasn't too far off.

Prior to this, and for several minutes, I noticed a pattern of whitish-yellow lights in line formation, with slight variations in altitudes, in the relative proximity of South Mountain.  They were visible for at least 40NM. Prior to hearing the radio traffic, I was under the impression I was seeing very bright lights coming from atop the mountain, as I knew there were horseback riding trails in the area.  I can account for seeing five lights as I remember they formed a shallow W-pattern similar to the form of the Chair of Cassiopeia, however this was in the southern sky and appeared below our altitude. ATC radio inquired if we saw the lights, which we acknowledged, and it was overheard that the lights were visible from other aircraft and from the ground. We turned to the north for an approach into Luke AFB and upon completion of that approach, turning toward the south, the lights were no longer visible. In later years, I was informed they were probably flares in the MOA to the south of Phoenix, however, I am familiar with air-dropped illumination flares, and although there are similar characteristics, these did not appear the same. This information is extracted from my log-book. ((NUFORC Note:  Reported by a military navigator.  PD))",2015-02-20T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

News Paper account missing. Early in 1955, my father and I witnessed a large, disk-shaped UFO on a southerly course near twilight.  We were walking to what I think was a spring festival at (then) Lewis school located near the intersection of (then) Chanate Rd and Lewis Rd (now Lomitas Ave and Lewis Rd) in Santa Rosa, California.  The craft was large, probably greater than 200 feet in diameter, and traveling at between 800 and 1000 feet.  It was light colored and had no visible projections, ports, or drive structures on it.  It was absolutely quiet, passing over our shoulders and headed for San Francisco at a slow rate of speed.  The craft had no visible form of propulsion but seemed very steady on it's course. We observed the craft for probably 10 minutes until it passed out of sight on its southerly course over the city. I was 10 years old and my father was 55 years old.  This sighting may have occurred on a Friday evening as I recall a reasonably large newspaper article devoted to the sightings of this object in the Press Democrat on what most likely was a Sunday Paper.  The sightings noted in the article were from people located along a flight path that would take it over Novato, Calif., and on to San Francisco. As a 10 year old, I was especially interested in science.  I subsequently worked briefly at NASA, FRC -Edwards AFB during college and became an engineer in various Mechanical and Electronic fields.  My Father was a Minnesota farm boy who spent a large part of his life in Southern California.  While largely self educated, he was a stable and alert individual, not taken to flights of fantasy.  On a return to Santa Rosa during college, I engaged with the Principal of Lewis school asking for verification of the date/time of the festival but the records had been moved by then and were not available.  Subsequently, on 3 occasions, I reviewed the microfilm of the Press Democrat papers for the year 1955 but was unable to find the article (Front page, bottom, center).  There were a number of missing papers from the microfilm record so I am unable to verify the account.",,38.45256501240695,-122.71790012406949

((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the source of the report to submit separate reports, so that they sort by the date of occurrence.  PD)) Hi!  My name is ((name deleted)).  I Prefer people know my first name.  My UFO encounter consists not of one but 5 different encounters which I believe to be of the same or similar type craft.  I would like to share my story if I would be allowed. My first encounter was when I was 4 years old in Lake Stevens, Washington, in the year 1993. I do not remember the encounter but my mom does.  She, myself, my brother and grandma all witnessed a UFO that night around 10:00 pm at our house.  I was in the living room.  My mom said she looked out of the kitchen window because she noticed a bright light and she said it looked like two car headlights coming towards her, except in the sky above the treeline.  All of a sudden the house filled with blinding white light which lasted for a few seconds.  The power to the house flickered just before the light came.  She stepped onto the porch and she said she saw 1 bright ball of light roughly 200-250 feet in the air above our house.  According to her the size of the craft was at least 3 times the size of our house. It hovered motionless for about 10 seconds before taking off in the blink of an eye in a zigzag pattern.  North to south over the treeline.  It took but a second before it was gone.  The UFO did not make a sound at all. I feel I must add that I had nightmares of 4-5 foot grey beings with big almond shaped eyes when I was around 3 or 4 years old doing things to me like operating or performing surgery on me. Long before I even knew what aliens were or what they looked like. My second encounter that I had I was living in the same house and I was 6 years old. Around the same time as last time if my memory is correct, the house again filled with a brilliant blinding light which lasted  about 5 seconds.  I remember the light did not hurt my eyes but made visibility very bad.  I could however see my window next to my front door just fine and I ran towards the window to see what was up there and I saw a bright white oval or egg shaped craft just above my house at again around 200 feet in the air.  I would say the craft was at least twice the size of our house.  I wouldn't say the UFO was massive but was quite large in size.  I stepped onto my porch only to see it take off in a zigzag pattern at thousands of miles an hour or so it seemed. It was gone in the blink of an eye. A small detail I can add to that is that it seemed like it disappeared and reappeared about a 100 feet away every time and stopped for just a moment before taking off again. The event! occurred over the span of roughly 35-40 seconds.  Again, the event was soon followed by strange dreams of grey beings however being so young I didn't understand that they were not normal dreams. Still to this day I can remember every dream I had of those beings like it was yesterday.  They may be just dreams.  That's all I can say about them but strange quin-cadences nonetheless. My third encounter I will briefly explain because it is almost exactly the same as the previous two. I was living in the same house.  I was 7 years old in 1996. my house filled with light which lasted a few moments.  I stepped onto the porch immediately already knowing what it was.  I however did notice that the craft wasn't as bright as before and I noticed it was made out of a shiny, reflective metal.  It took off in a zigzag again and it was gone.  The power also flickered again just before the light struck like the previous two times and the UFO did not make a peep.  Me, my mom and grandma all saw it. The fourth encounter was again in lake Stevens. I was 11 or 12. I can't remember however It was not at my house.  I was in the back seat of my moms Volvo. We were traveling on a trestle going from the city of Everett to Lake Stevens, Washington.  It's basically a long free way bridge.  We were near the end of the trestle coming to a large hill going into lake Stevens.  I Noticed to our left a large glowing ball of light traveling slowly towards us.  When I noticed it it was about 500 feet or more out and about 300-400 feet off the ground or more. All of a sudden it was upon us. Just a 100 feet or less above our car. It was matching our speed which was 50 miles an hour. It followed us for only a few seconds before it hit our car with a bright beam of light which filled our car with light but did not blind my mom who was driving. It did not hit any other cars near us with this light. At least not that I can remember.  My mom said WOW!, LOOK AT THAT DREW!. She actually pulled over. S! he asked me to grab the camera out of the back seat of the car but I struggled to get the case open for just a few moments before the craft which was still hovering over us distracted my attention and gave up and gave her the case. She never got the case open in time.  The craft actually started descending on us slowly as we were parked.  The craft hovered over our car for about 10 seconds before taking off to the right of us in a mind-boggling speed in a zig-zag pattern.  It traveled in that direction for about 2 seconds and got almost a mile away from us before shooting straight up into space.  It again didn't make a sound.  People had also parked on the side of the trestle next to us.  I didn't notice if anyone was  videotaping it but I remember my mom said for a moment she thought the craft was gonna land on us it got so close and one of the other onlookers had mentioned the same thing. The craft was egg-shaped except was a little more elongated than an egg. It was clearly ma! de out of a very reflective metal and when the craft was hover! ing abov e us the light seemed to dim but I could tell that the light was emanating from inside the craft. We could have probably fit 10  Volvo's in the craft and still had room to spare. I did not have any strange dreams before or after that event. My 5th encounter is the most profound thing that has ever happened to me, even still to this day. I was living in Oregon at the time. I was 15 years of age. I was living with my mom, brother and sister and my moms boyfriend at the time. The house resided on a large steep hill about 15 minutes out of town. The driveway up the hill took about 3 minutes to drive up. The house was primarily surrounded by thick forest. It was around 2:00 A.M. I was sitting on my couch in my living room playing halo 2 on my x box 360 alone. My mom was in her room on her PC and her boyfriend was up late working downstairs in the basement. All of a sudden my x box and TV shut off. The power remained going to the rest of my house. It was just my x box and TV that shut off. For a moment I was confused and angry but for just a moment because immediately after that I noticed a bright light through my window to my left just above my couch. I then peeled the curtain back and saw a bright ball of light just outside my window. It didn't immediately click in my head what it was but just a moment after I peeled the curtain back the house filled with a brilliant white light. The light this time was so bright that I could not see my hands when I held them in front of my face. The light lasted for about 15 seconds. As soon as I saw the craft I screamed out”MOM THE UFO IS BACK” and started running to her room and then the light hit the house. I froze. I could not see anything but light. I yelled out”MOM,The house is filled with light! “Can u see” I asked and she said no. I then realized that the windows were still visible! . Everything in the house was white except my windows. So I walked towards the window and as soon as I got to the window and peeked through it the light stopped, so I stepped out onto my back patio. What I then saw after that I will never forget. What I saw was a glowing metal craft. It was again the same shape as before. Light was strobing through the craft in all colors of the spectrum. Like what oil would look like with sunlight reflecting off of it. It appeared almost as if the light was some sort of force-field around it. The craft remained metal in appearance however the light pulsing through it was also notable. The craft was easily 3 times the size of our house or at least it appeared to be fairly large.  About half the length of a football field or so. It just hovered there above our back patio for about 20 or so seconds. My moms boyfriend had stepped out onto the patio with us for a moment before he ran back inside to get the camera. My mom had turned her head for just a moment to yell out” hurry up or your going to miss out”. During that time I my eyes remained fixed on the object. As the craft hovered there, I witnessed a window open up. A part of the craft had become completely transparent. The “window” quickly moved from the right side of the craft to the left before the window went away and the craft became solid again. What I saw during that short period of time, or what I thought I saw were a dozen or more white or grey skinned beings with arms all held out like they were holding hands and were all looking right at us. The craft then flew up 50 or so feet slowly and then took off at light speed and I'll explain why I use the term “light speed”. The craft traveled in a zig zag pattern like before. Except this time when it moved, it left images of itself behind following all the way back to its original position. I'll try my best to explain this. The craft would disappear and then immediately reappear a few hundred or so feet away leaving behind hundreds of translucent mirror images of itself. and when it reappeared the craft would then catch up with itself. Like the main bad guy from the movie,chronicles of riddick. How the guy could seemingly jump out of his body,travel a little ways and then his body would then catch up with his ...soul or whatever. My apologies for the bad analogy but I find it very hard to describe what I saw. I've never seen anything like it in my life nor have I heard of anything like that before.  What I saw that craft do didn't just defy physics, it defied reality.! The craft seemed to move almost as if the light couldn't keep up with it. In my opinion anyways. My moms boyfriend made it out with the camera but by time he got the camera turned on the craft was already gone. The light the UFO emitted into the house filled every room in our 3 story house. The door to my moms room was closed and her window drapes were down and yet her room became filled with the light too. My moms boyfriend that was working in the basement at the time had no possible means of light to get in there. Basement stairs were shut, there were no windows and the only light that should have been in the basement should have been from his lamp however the basement too became filled with this bright light. Don't ask me how but that's what he said to me. Also another detail to add to this strange event is my x box. I was playing my game before this event took place and my TV and x box shut off on me. Well, when I got back into the living room I noticed my box and TV were on and not only that but my progress had remained in the game. I even died and re-spawned somehow during the x box being” turned off”. I find it funny though because in halo, you play as a space marine guy who kills aliens.  Maybe it wasn't a game they found amusing.  I don't know.   Before I end this story I must add that a few weeks after that event I had a very weird dream.  Several actually but one  in particular  worth noting(in my opinion). In my dream I woke up and walked into my living room.  My living room was pitch black however a bright light was shining through the windows behind me.  And in the corner of my living room the light had shined on something.  I stepped a little closer to see what it was and it moved slowly into the light. It was a 4 to 5 foot being with a elongated skull and big almond-shaped eyes.  It was wearing a silver or metallic-looking suit that was skin tight. It had one blue stripe running down its right arm and a white line around its waist almost like a belt or a seal you would see on a spacesuit except thin like a string. It also had a blue patch on the middle of its chest with a weird symbol on it. I distinctly remember having an overwhelming feeling rush over me. The emotion was love. I felt like a heart-warming sensation come over me and I suddenly got the feeling like this being was very happy or it was very happy to see me. No fear came over me. Just an overwhelming feeling that I remember to this day. It also felt like this being was very fond of me. It just looked at me for a few moments and then I don't remember the rest of the dream and I woke up with my pants soaked. Not sure why. Maybe I sweat in my sleep. I don't know. I'm not claiming I was abducted by aliens. I'm just noting strange quin-cadences.  I have researched UFO's and witness testimony's and anything UFO related honestly and I have yet to hear of any case quite like mine.   I'm posting this to you all in hopes that someone else will read this and post they're story like mine.  Perhaps I'm not the only one with these specific kinds of experiences.  I know I'm supposed to only submit one UFO sighting at a time but I didn't have a sighting to report, I had a story to tell.  My apologies for the lack of visual evidence.  I carry my camera on me at all times at the ready now, just in case. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the source of the report submit one separate report per alleged sighting.

My journey started near Greenway road and 56th street at around 8pm.  It was dark outside on March 13, 1997.  I needed to head out to CompUSA which was located near Scottsdale Road and Shea Blvd.  I was heading north on 56th street and I made a left on Shea Blvd which had me heading east towards Scottsdale road.  As I was driving east on Shea, when I got to about 60th Place, I noticed a couple lights coming around on the east side of the McDowell mountains on my left.  They were higher the peak of the mountain which is 3,900 feet, my estimate would be somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 feet. As I drove to about 64th street, I noticed about 4 lights spaced at what I would estimate about a 1 or 2 blocks apart.  My immediate thoughts were these are some military helicopters because the speed they were travel was way to slow compared to airplanes.  Scottsdale Airpark is right in the same area and I’ve seen hundreds of planes coming in and out of that airport and none ever flown in that formation.  And I would not say commercial airplanes because none have every flown in that direction either. I kept looking out to the left out my window and counted about 7 lights now.  All evenly spaces and was in kind of an arch, like the arch of an old fashion bow.  Totally strange to me because I have never seen any lights like this before, so I was excited to think it was a convoy of military helicopters. When I made it to my destination and got out of my car, I looked up and watched the lights come and pass right over me.  2 of the 7 lights went right over my head.  When they went over, I heard ZERO sounds.  Just a light that sputtered and it was completely black around the lights.   I watched as the 3 light went over and in my head, I said this is really strange because I hear NOTHING.  The lights traveled very slowly.  I waited more than 5 minutes in the parking lot for the first light to travel over and then probably 3 to 5 minutes for the second light. I headed into the store and did my shopping.  Never once did I think of it as a UFO.  I used to watch XFiles at that time and didn’t think of taking a picture.  I was thinking they were silent helicopters that ran about a mile or more in length.   After about 20 to 30 minutes in the store, I came out and the lights were gone. It wasn’t for a day or two later when I heard the news and it made me think different about what I saw.  The strange part, these lights were in northeast Scottsdale.  Not southwest Phoenix like the Phoenix lights were reported and known for. This event, these lights are burned into my memory like it was yesterday.",2015-02-20T00:00:00,33.56413757440476,-111.9050830357143

I was doing some stretching and yoga and laid back and looked up at the clear blue sky.  A star like object caught my eye.  At first I thought it was a jet at very high altitude with the sun's light was reflecting off of it.  However, it was not moving.  It was stationary at very high altitude.  Not flickering, not flashing. no changing color.  Just a star like object stationary for at least 30 min.  During this time I called Tallahasse airport and asked to speak to the tower. After being shuffled around and having to tell my story severaL times, I spoke to the tower and they did not have anything on radar.  I also took approximately 10 photos with my smartphone.   I could not tell if I had got the object in the photos but I did notice while taking them that a contrail was present in my camera screen, but not visible to my naked eye.  I then went in to work, and looked at the photos and saw the pictures did capture the contrail, and a couple did have the star object but only visble on greater magnification, although somewhat fuzzy.  Most interesting are the round shadow like objects captured in the photos but not visible to my naked eye.  I also captured a jet in one photo and it does give one a bit of a perspective.  Could it have been Venus, Jupiter, or Saturn visible at 8:30 am on a bright sunny morning?  I dont know.  I think it was really a object at very high altitute maybe 50-100,000 ft.  There were a couple of jets that went by during the event and this object was higher.  The contrail and round grey shadow objects appear to be at different altitudes.  I dont think they are ghost images or reflections off of something.  I took several photos with them in the photos and they are  in the same location (using the playfort fabric roof as a reference point).

Clear sky with minimal clouds.  I live at the base of two mountains in a valley where this sighting occurred.  Against the blue sky I noticed what appeared to be a plane over the mountain west of my house.  I paid no further attention and went back inside my house.  Approximately two to three minutes later a sound that I cannot describe as I have never heard anything like it before became very loud to the point I had to cover my ears.  The air seemed like it was electrically charged and my body was suffering from the sound.  Almost like standing in front of a bass guitar amp played at loud volume.  The first thing that came to mind was that the plane I had seen was crashing.  I went to my front door, which has a storm door as well entirely made of glass.  The storm door was vibrating so strongly I thought it was going to shatter.   I ran outside afraid that the plane was going to crash into my house and that is when I noticed what can only be described as a cigar shaped UFO, only one end came to a point where the other was rounded like a cigar.  It was approximately seventy five feet off the ground hovering parallel with a stand of trees that runs adjacent to my drive way. These trees are very old and tall, the craft seemed to be able to push the tops of trees out of the way as it continued to move.  It should have definitely made contact with the top of several trees but I could see them being pushed out of the way as if by some invisible force.  The length of the craft was easily two hundred feet at a minimum.  It had the appearance of brushed aluminum.  Even in the broad day light it seemed to emit a yellow/gold light from underneath it.  I watched all of this over the course of several minutes until it drifted away out of sight. It then appeared instantaneously over a mountain approximately a half mile in the distance where it went over the crest and down the other side.  I know that I should have been able to see it ascend the mountain!  But after the trees had blocked my view and it was out of sight for approximately ten seconds when it appeared out of nowhere at the top of said mountain. The moment I came outside of my house the noise and ""vibrations"" stopped. The craft made absolutely no noise and the only sound I heard while watching it was the rustling of the leaves as the UFO moved over them. I live in a wooded area and it is the first time I have ever heard complete silence. No birds or insects made any noise and at this point almost three hours later it is still dead silent.  I could see no windows but there were two spots that almost seemed like they were made of mercury very fluid like. They appeared to ripple as the sun reflected off them.  I have no mental health problems and I am not on any medication.  My nose had started to bleed at some point when I was watching the ufo but I did not notice it until I went inside but by this time my white T-shirt had been covered in quite a bit of blood so it had to be bleeding for several minutes. I have had a terri! ble headache ever since the noises and vibrations. I know I'm jumping around a lot in my text, I'm still shaking from the event and my mind is racing. I know what I saw was not a hallucination or a misidentification.  I could feel the heat radiating from the UFO and had I walked a hundred yards I could have been underneath it.  That is how close it was.  I hope I never see anything like that again.  The whole event happened over five minutes.  However when I went back inside thirty to forty minutes had passed. I had been recording a TV show on DVR that had just come on at 1:30 pm. The program was an hour long and when I had went back inside my house the program was nearly done with maybe fifteen minutes left.",2015-05-22T00:00:00,37.8179,-83.7808

Red, Green, & White flashing lights, hovering in the night sky's. WOW is all I can say!  Last evening I was preparing for bed at 9:48 pm I forgot to shut my Bay Window in the front of the house,  The window is Western sky view.,  I live N.E. of Flint, MI) I can also see the sky's in the area of Lansing Michigan (State Capital), however, I proceeded to the window, and strangely enough, I noticed some lights; Red, Green, & White in nature, simultaneous flashing back & forth, I studied it for a couple of minutes for we have an Airport s.w. of my home in that direction, so I almost brushed it off as a very tall tower for the Airplanes to know where the Airport is located.  However... I've lived in this home for 18 years and NEVER seen this in that area before nor any towers.  So I went to get my camera phone to try and video tape and unfortunately it was way too dark for the camera to pick it up.  This object was hovering & very steadfast!  And did so for approximately 20 minutes.  I then decided at 10:09 to call 911 for I knew after viewing this object, it ""wasn't normal!"" I apologized to the wonderful young lady that answered the call, indicating that I didn't have a ""normal emergency if one at all"" that my call was in reference to. I then explained what I was & continued to see while talking to her, and asked that she step outside to see it for herself & others there, to witness this phenomenon. She politely said that she would send an Officer out and I replied back that it wasn't necessary for any one to come out, that I just wanted her to please view it. I then thanked her, hung up the phone, and approximately 7-8 minutes later an Officer was driving out of my Private Drive, so I opened my Bay Window and asked that he look over to the S.W. sky's to his right, he did and was amazed as I was!!  We had discussed a couple of other things and then he said he was going to drive into the direction that the object is in, by then the object had moved slightly headed toward Lansing Michig! an way, we said good night, he drove away, I... still amazed, ! stood th ere for it seemed like forever and the object was picking up ""ever so slightly"" in speed heading toward the Lansing Area, Lake Michigan is also in that direction. To my amazement, I was satisfied that an Officer had seen it ""trust me!"",  The object was moving out of view into the night sky, mind you still seeing the lights, but not so close any longer, I headed to bed! I then decided to call Channel 12 WJRT News Room and she actually called me CRAZY!  I was ASTOUNDED by her actions to this matter, when in act, she could have just gone outside and witnessed it for herself!  All she could say is ""Do you know how many calls we get on this, are you saying a UFO?"" I NEVER USED THE WORD... ""SHE DID!"" Then I said, well yes I suppose that could be such!""  She replied ""CRAZY!""  I said ""are you calling me crazy?""  She replied ""yes I am!""  I tried to respond to her and she just HUNG UP THE PHONE!  So IF there are that m! any calls about this matter, than what are reporters there for??  To INVESTIGATE! I ""thought so anyway!""",2015-04-30T00:00:00,43.014164735516374,-83.70674685138538

My friend and I were just leaving my house, when I felt compelled to look up.  When I did I instantly saw two black shapes in the sky above my house.  One was much larger than the other.   When we first saw them they were stationary but seemed to have possibly been one craft at some point.  We watched for a moment trying to make sure that it wasn’t something more recognizable.  But it wasn’t moving and they were way too close together to have been human craft.   As soon as we decided it wasn’t anything it should have been, I decided to go back inside to get binoculars and my camera.  In the small amount of time I took to get the camera they had moved a lot more.   My friend who stayed outside to keep his eye on them said it almost seemed like they started moving faster after we began to take notice of them. 	Once I got outside I was trying to get my camera setup and gave the binoculars to my friend who instantly got the best look of it and said, “Oh my God!” aloud as he was looking at it.   I snapped two photos and got some shaky, zoomed in footage of them.  My friend described the hull of the craft to be almost like a liquid state that was consistently transforming as it was moving up.  He said it made edged shapes with points that shifted and changed.   My first thought was Ferro Fluid, but he said that it was only similar to that.  The crafts were black and did not reflect much light at all.  When we first saw them they were lower to the ground and the large one was shaped more triangular while the smaller one was more of a sphere.  They both eventually moved straight up and disappeared.   The photos I took look just like black dots, but when I zoom in it reveals the spiky shapes that are coming off of it.   I have always believed in the existence of Extraterrestrials anyway, but never had a definitively weird enough experience to justify their existence.  But this has me feeling the contrary.

(The diagrams and pictures provided are not from the actual event.  Just images to help with explaining what I saw.  The numbers in the pictures explain the path it took starting with 1.) I am a 30 year old male.  I am in Alabama, vacationing at Gulf Shores.   I was playing volleyball on the beach with my family when I saw a ball of light move through the sky unlike any aircraft I've seen before.  I was facing east around 8 p.m., and there was large storm clouds in that direction heading out to the gulf.  Every five minutes or so there would be heat lightning or flashes of lighting that remained in the clouds.  The lightning never made any sounds.   Just before a volley started in a game, my attention was drawn towards a ball of light that came out of the cloud.  It did not make a sound.  It was the size, brightness, and color of a planet being observed in the night sky.  White in color and bright.  The light emitted was consistent, unblinking.   The object started 200 yards away from me over the pink 7 or 8 story building, it was just below the clouds in height.  It moved towards me to the west for about 100 yards, and was over the tan 7 to 8 story building.  I pointed at it and told everyone to look.  Everyone's attention was to the start of the game.   The object then changed direction back to west a 100 yards over the pink building, to the point I first saw it, and then dropped in elevation to what I'm guessing was about 100 feet.  It immediately increased speed and elevation back into the clouds.   As it was in the clouds, the light it emitted was slightly blurred and then not visible.  This all occurred in about five seconds.  I saw it, paused, said ""hey look at that"", it manueverd away from our position, and was gone.  I began to discuss what I saw with members of my family for about 10 minutes after the event.   At the end of that time, a military jet flew along the beach over our heads very loudly.  This was the only time I heard a military jet during the six days I've been at the beach in Gulf Shores.",2015-06-05T00:00:00,30.250995,-87.68415

I am making this ufo report, in hopes that if others seen it, they might be more like to report what they seen. 	I was walking into where I work, I was walking east, and saw 2 rows of 5 lights moving from north to south, each set of lights was about 2 fingers  widths at arms length, and about 8 fingers width between the 2 separate objects.  It was about 7:20 pm February 26th.  28 years working here, I know the view very well.  I noticed these two lights, but took them to be airplanes, flying toward me.  They looked big, but this is how the mind rationalized what I saw.  As I walked, things didn’t look right.  I stopped and used a distant light pole to see the direction or flight. That’s where things didn’t line up.  I could see 5 lights on each, so if it was a plane, it has to be moving toward me.  Such that I would be seeing headlights of a big plane. But I was due east, and they were going south.  There motion was slow, but not unremarkable for planes at a distance of several miles, at about 4 fingers, at arm's length, above the ground. What happened next, is the thing that puts this into ufo category.  This 1st set of lights, turns near vertical, to about 80 degrees.  Which is nuts for any airplane that big and that low. But even more odd, is that the forward leading light tilted down.  Such that if this were a plane, it would be turning very sharply south.  Because I am thinking it moving toward me” because of the lights”, but it was already moving south before the turn.  What I saw, was the light go out or turn from view, going north not south.  How can a plane, moving south, turn to go north, where the leading light go down to 80 degrees, they didn’t go back to level, just “looked” to turn out of view.  The turn was too sharp, and the tilt was in the wrong direction, the plane were too close to each other, and too low.  This turn was in about 8 finger widths, and I’m being generous.  Then the other set of lights followed, but faster. If a plane was going south, I should not have seen so many lights.  If the plane were moving east “ which it wasn’t” then to turn north, the northern most light tilt down to bank north.  I just can’t see how a normal plane can do what I saw.",2015-03-06T00:00:00,40.189189427312776,-77.2037678414097

On March 28, 2015 at approximately 9am Eastern Standard Time, I was aboard Southwest Airlines flight 2602 from Chicago Midway to Boston Logan.  The plane had started its descent into Boston and because of the weather, we were in the clouds most of the way to the runway.  This sighting occurred roughly 10 minutes before the plane landed. I had a window seat and I kept looking out the window, wondering when I’d be able to see the ground below.  I saw a bright sphere through the clouds, immediately to the left of the plane.  I assumed I was seeing the sun, diluted through the clouds, but realized that it didn’t look quite right. It was in the wrong place in the sky and it was smaller than it should look (between grapefruit and beach ball size). I thought maybe the plane was tilted and I was seeing a bright light from below, something to explain what I was seeing, when I noticed that the light was heading straight toward the plane (I don’t know exactly what speed the object was moving, but it seemed like it was moving at a car’s pace rather than an airplane’s speed).  As soon as I realized this, I got scared and my heart rate began to increase, worried that this object was going to hit the plane. I turned my head momentarily and told myself that this object was not going to hurt the plane. It didn’t even seem solid.  I turned back toward the window and watched as the object passed over the plane probably 1 to 2 feet above the airplane. The best way that I can describe this object is that it looked exactly like the sun looks in the sky on a cloudy day, except that it was smaller.  The object was white and had a soft brightness that didn’t hurt my eyes, rather than a blinding light. It seemed to move at a steady pace and course of direction.  It was a three-dimensional sphere. I was traveling by myself and the two people seated next to me were sleeping.  I didn’t notice if anyone else on the airplane noticed the object or not, meaning I didn’t hear any gasps or anything. I’m a 35-year-old parent and I teach English at a community college.  This is the first time I’ve ever seen something like this where I couldn’t find a logical explanation for what I was seeing.",2015-04-03T00:00:00,,

He said there were three sets of triangular shaped crafts that would fly together then separate into a triangular formation.  That was about 3 months ago.  The most recent was March 16, 2015.  We were walking our dogs around 9 p.m.  I was looking around at the stars, and I always notice this patch in the sky that looks like a greyish blue cluster, I am still not sure what it is, but I see it when the sky is clear.  So I was looking at that then something caught my eye to the right.  I felt like something was there but I didn’t see it within a couple of seconds, so I look back at that grey cluster.  Then I see something again so I look more up and to the right and see a huge grey, black, chevron shaped flying object. It moved quick, but steady.  It did not have any lights.  I looked away and back towards it to see if I was seeing things, or my imagination running wild as usual.  well I wasn't.  I can't give you exact distances but It was low, close to the trees but not close enough to touch the trees. I seen it traveling for about 1 -3 minutes.  I was in shock or something because it seemed like I was standing there for awhile, but it wasn’t there very long.  It disappeared as it went up  further into the atmosphere. I was reading about the lights of ufo's.  It mentioned when the craft is in motion there is no sound and usually low, or no lights at all.  I am trying to figure out why I did not see any lights, when most of the sightings of this craft have lights. After about 2 minutes I met my boyfriend on the porch.  I seen these lights way up in the stars a few nights ago, but my boyfriend said it could just be stars.  Well I am not sure but I was reading about the Chevron shaped craft, and found another type of craft called fireballs.  What I seen was white, and moving very quickly, and shifting in various directions, unlike a plane or star.  The first night I seen them, it was a full moon and the lights were flying towards the moon!  My boyfriend seen it last night, there was only one, and now he thinks they were moving fast, and strange jus like I was telling him the first night I seen them.

Hello. I am contacting you because of a photo that was posted on Facebook by my cousin. In March of 2004, her husband was on a flight returning back to the United States.  I'm not sure where he took the picture or at what time.  It was during the day so I'm guessing it was past noon. In the photo, you can clearly see a huge flying disk-like object. It looks to be black and it looks like it's coming out of the clouds. The photo was taken from the window seat. She posted the photo over a year ago and the thought just occurred to me that it could be an alien craft of some sort. I would love for you to see this photo so please feel free to email me.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2015-03-26T00:00:00,,

The craft flew within 600 feet of us. 2 rows of bright lights one red and one green. My wife and I saw a craft with very bright red and green lights flying from a higher altitude flying erratically making sharp turns very quickly then stop in the sky.  Then we watched it drop very quickly to a lower altitude near the ground then right back up again.   After watching it for a few minutes, it starting flying towards us, and we were preparing to run in the house, when it turned to the left about 600 feet away from us.  As it turned we could hear a sound something like an electric motor but not exactly.   We couldn't see the shape because the lights which were a row of red and a row of green were so bright that you could not see what was above them.  Our house blocked our view when it turned so we ran around to the front of the house and could see that it was about a quarter mile away.   I saw a neighbor in his garage so I called him out to see the UFO.  He came out then pulled out his cell phone and used it to video it as it moved off and disappeared. The area that we think it stopped the first time is about 5 miles from our house.  Once it started towards us it took about 30 seconds before it turned when it was about 600 feet from us and about 300 feet in the air.  I estimate the size of the lights to have been about 30 to 60 feet long and 20 to 30 feet between the lights. We also noticed a large white light in the sky which appeared to move up toward the area where the craft first stopped then stop in the sky.  We forgot about that until we noticed it again when we lost sight of the craft.   I saw it just sitting there in the sky but after taking a ride to see if we could find the red a green lights again the white light was gone.

Since it was late, and my parents had turn my old room into my niece's play room, I took my spot in the living room on the couch which is about 8 foot from the door that leads to the backyard.  (Backyard is surrounded by woods, except for our cow pasture). Ready to go to sleep, I remove my glasses and sank into to the couch.  Immediately, an intense orange glow caught my attention through the close blinds on the door.   I put my glasses back on to get a better look and observed what I thought to be an orange lamp post that I'd never seen in my 24 years between the woods and the cow pasture.  As I watched I could swear I saw moving up-and-down and a little side to side.   For the first 15 minutes I just sat there stunned at what I was observing and then I noticed that it looks like this orange or was touching down in the pasture and sending off some sort of electricity all around it.   Shortly after I noticed a smaller white blue orb hovering higher in the sky but keeping to the right.  I started to believe I was crazy so I pulled out my iPhone to see if I could confirm what I was seeing with my eyes. I not only got pictures but videos, but as I lay on the couch trying to record these orbs I realized suddenly that it was aware I was watching them and every time I focused on one of them it would start to shape shift.   Now frozen in fear nearly an hour later I begin to feel that I needed to hide.  The red orb began to come as close as 20 foot from the back door.  The fear that I felt was more real than anything else I can remember.  So much that I was too terrified to even get up and wake up my parents or my brothers. Next thing I know, it is 6 AM, and I wake up in a cold sweat and find myself in the same spot. I am totally forgotten what I'd seen and videoed.  Shortly after my family woke up and I showed them my videos.  They were shocked and had no explanation.  I remember telling my dad that I watched it for three hours or more, and that I eventually discovered that it met me no harm and went to sleep.   It wasn't for several days that I came out of the fog I was in to realize that I actually have no such memory of thinking that.  To this day I have no explanation.

I laid back at some point and noticed a large White spot in the Sky.  Time was about 08:00. It was cool about 70 degrees and only one wisp of a cloud in the sky near the object.  I thought it to be a weather balloon and noted where it was in relation to the frame of the cabana.  It was at ZENITH in the sky. I went in for a second cup of Joe and grabbed a pair of 7x50 binoculars to view that balloon.  Time then was about 08:15am and the object HAD NOT MOVED...  I adjusted the glasses (German) on a mountain top I knew was 5 miles from home, then I looked at the object...IT WAS A DISC!  My wife looked as well and thought she saw one wing stick out.  The DISC looked to be the size of a half dollar coin from this view with the field glasses. Silvery-white outer color and blue gray towards the center with a very BLACK center.  The view was crystal clear and no fuzzy images at all.  Still it had not moved from zenith. When I went for a third cup I grabbed my Nikon ""Coolpix"" electronic camera.  I had to step away from the frame so the auto focus would allow me to find that Disc.  At infinity the detail was 70% less than the field glasses but I was able to see a little bit of a ring like feature.  Looking again through the glasses I could see in detail a wedge forming in a dark color over the disc.  Thing changed details within the circle but only in color as far as we could tell.  Time was about 08:40am.  At this time I went back under the cabana frame to track any movement, It had moved about 2 degrees from Zenith towards the WEST.  I clicked off several photos and went inside to answered the telephone. With all this the wife and I were not sure that it wasn't a balloon and just Odd that it had not moved.  I PLANNED to call pilots' weather service, and get a ""Winds Aloft"" Report for southern Arizona...I failed to do so. At 09:15 I returned outside and it had not move but another 1 degree West.

After a few hours, it flew straight at me, and I saw it was a space craft. March 8, 2015, I was a passenger on Jet Blue Flight 136 out of Phoenix, AZ, to JFK, NY.  It was a red eye.  We took off about 11:00 pm.  I was looking out my window, facing north, in my window seat.  I saw what looked like red star under the constellation Casseopeia.  Then I saw that it was blinking red and what looked like green lights, so maybe it's an aircraft. I was sorry I had packed my video cam with zoom away.  I surmised it wasn't a plane because it stayed almost stationary, in one spot, for about two hours.  Then it moved very slowly a bit right and left for about a half hour.  Then it gradually moved to the east towards the front of the plane and completely out of my view. About two hours after that, about 3:00am, I looked out the window again and I see it moved back near to where it was originally just below Cassiopeia.  But this time it sat just a little further to the right, toward the East.  I was so surprised it returned.  I'm staring at it again for only moments and the light suddenly appears to get bigger and bigger and whiter.  Then I realized it was soaring towards the plane!  I couldn't believe it!  It was heading directly to where I was sitting, then it slowed down as it approached the plane and glided above it.  I could see the craft!  It was about 30 feet over the plane and I could see detail!  I saw its bottom, front and left side as it flew over me. I was in shock!  Its shape was fairly straight along the edge on its left and right side but front and back slightly rounded . It had some lights on in the front of the craft, but small and uneven number on front right side to left. I remember 2 on the front left and 1 on the right. The ! craft appeared to be a dull off white color.  All the edges were rounded and I didn't see anything that looked like doors or rivets.  From what I could see it was just one piece body. It had 2 obvious huge indentations on it's left side on the bottom, where what looked like these 2 huge white spotlights shown down out from.  They were positioned on the left side bottom of the craft like headlights on a car.  I imagined it had the same type of two big indentation lights on it's right side but I couldn't see that side as it flew over me on a slight angle.  It didn't look very big, it was more like a medium-thin module.  From the little research I've done since I've encountered this, I believe it looks like an antigravity car. I know we were flying about 36,000 feet and it was just after 3 AM in the morning.  But with all of the excitement, I failed to see on the map exactly what state I was flying over when this happen. I have never seen a UFO, space craft or anything like this before.  I asked my Stewardess and the Captain if they saw anything and they said no.  I would love to know if anybody else encountered this type of craft.  I am  now having an artist draw up a sketch of what I  witnessed.",2015-03-26T00:00:00,,

At approximately 6:40pm PST, my family I had just finished eating dinner while sitting outside on the patio.  We were noticing some small birds gathering near my parents' bird feeder, when we then saw 4-5 large egrets fly over the house.  This in and of itself is rather odd, as that is not a bird we typical see in our area of the Coachella valley. I turned towards where the egrets were coming from and noticed a silver sphere/orb rise above the roof line of the neighboring house.  I would estimate this object to be within a mile of our location and no more than 1,000 off the ground.  It appeared to be a perfect metallic sphere, with no visible wings, engine, windows, landing gear, etc.  The object was also completely silent and no other visible planes were in the area at that time.  My mother and I saw the object for about 10-15 seconds before it disappeared behind a small gathering of clouds. We were about 10 miles away from Palm Springs International Airport and regularly see planes flying above and near the house.

Avra Valley, Arizona, Monday April 27, 2015.  Approximately 10:00 to 10:15 pm.   Went into backyard to take dogs out and noticed two objects ""hovering"" at an unknown distance in a westerly direction from my home.  One was just above the desert tree line and the other was a much greater distance vertically above the first. I had watched for several minutes when the higher object started moving at a constant slow rate in a more or less easterly direction.  Still at an unknown distance when it passed by, it appeared to have a central ""white"" lighted ""nose"" with a set of blue or green lights extending from the central nose in a V shape (the V was in a plane more or less parallel to the ground with the vertex at the nose).   It also had another set of lights of shorter length ""above"" the nose in a double V shape (or tripod shape) that were orientated at a steeper vertical angle than the lower longer lights.   These appeared to be red and either green or blue.  I could not distinguish a body or an aerodynamic shape of the object only the linear angled light lines. As it passed my line-of-sight in the distance the central white light went off and only the remaining V sections were lighted.  I listened very carefully as it passed and could not hear any sound at all.  As the object continued along its path I lost sight of it since my two story house blocked my view. I then focused my attention back on the first lower object since it had remained fixed the whole time I observed the other moving object.  At this point approximately 5 to 10 minutes had passed and I went inside to get my wife.  She grabbed her phone (camera) and I grabbed some low power sports binoculars for a possible better look.  I tried to photograph the lower hovering object but it was to far for the camera to pick up any detail and it just looked like a light blob, so I didn't take the shot.  The binoculars were too low mag and I couldn't make out any detail with them either.  So I watched this hovering object with naked eye for another 5 minutes or so.  The object remained just above my tree line but began to move slowly in a more or less westerly direction until I lost sight of it.

Up until the leader stopped and it looked as if it was waiting for the other one to catch up.  Then that one stopped.

I live in Tempe, Arizona, a city in the Phoenix metroplex area.  As you are probably aware, the Super Bowl was hosted here in Phoenix (Glendale, specifically) yesterday evening. It was during this time that this sighting occurred at approximately 7:40 PM Arizona time. I had returned from Tucson earlier that evening with my fiancé and was cleaning up our house.  The game was on the television, but I was not watching it, as I’m not a huge sports fan.  At approximately 7:40 PM, I went outside to the backyard to take some trash out.  On my way over to the trash can, I looked up at the moon which, at the time, was in the upper eastern part of the sky.  It was at this moment that I saw a curious-looking craft heading north some degrees above of the moon. This stood out to me immediately because this craft was not following the flight path which nearly every plane follows on its approach into nearby Sky Harbor Intl. Airport.  Planes flying into Sky Harbor at night typically fly in from east-to-west as our runways run in this orientation.  If a plane does fly over this airspace, its altitude is typically very high as to not disturb the lower traffic.  This craft’s altitude appeared to be relatively low, around 10,000 feet or so and no more than a mile away from me to the East, making it very unusual from the start. As I observed this craft going north-bound, I tried to logically make out what it was. I was looking at it from below.  It had one unblinking white, slightly yellow light on the bottom of it, generally in the middle of the craft.  This light appeared to illuminate other parts of the craft, which had a reddish-orangish tint to it.  I could see what appeared to be actual structure rather than a series of lights. As I stared at this object, transfixed, I tried to logically see it as a plane, thinking that the illuminated areas were perhaps the tail section and/or wings of a Southwest jet, which are commonly painted with orangish colors.  However, this object didn’t fit the description of a jet.  There were no navigation lights, it made no sound, and the shape that I could make out seemed to be triangular in shape.  The illuminated areas seemed to perhaps be the points of this triangle.  The object was slightly smaller than the moon that night, however it didn’t cover as much surface area in the sky as the moon did because of its triangular-looking shape (triangles covering less surface area than circles do). Once I ruled it out as an aircraft, I thought that perhaps I was viewing a large satellite and that the illuminated areas were solar panels.  Many images that I have seen of satellites show their solar panels to be of a rusty orangish color, similar to what I was seeing.  This, too, just did not fit.  At this moment, I noticed that the object was beginning to turn.  It made a smooth 90 degree turn in a sharp arc going from north to west in seconds. It was at this point that I noticed how fast this thing was going and how fast it had made the turn.  A normal jet would have needed much more distance to make such a sharp turn.  I remember thinking that a typical commercial jet would probably have fallen apart turning at such a speed. As it was turning, my view of it changed.  Before turning, I was looking up at it, seeing it from the bottom with one light.  Now, as it was turning (and more north of me at that point) I was seeing it from the side.  It was at this view that I could see two lights (both still unblinking and the same white-yellowish color).  I am not sure if this was actually an additional light on the craft, or if it was part of the same light I saw on the bottom.  Perhaps because of the new view point, I was seeing the bottom and top of the light, split horizontally by the craft itself.  I am not sure. But as soon as it leveled off, I could only see the one light again from the bottom. It was at this moment that I heard the thunderous sound of jet engines behind me from the South.  As soon as I looked above, two military jets zoomed right overhead, heading northwest from the South.  I could tell they were military jets because they were not on the Sky Harbor flight path, they had a distinctly different sound than the commercial jets, and were flying low for that area (approx. 10,000 feet).  They too were turning towards the West in pursuit of the object, but made a much wider turn than the object had.  They each had a sole very bright white blinking strobe light that I remember thinking looked kind of ominous in a way.  They did not appear to have the red and green navigation lights that I see on countless jets flying into Sky Harbor. At first I thought that this could be an escort of some sort, but it was clear that these jets were trying to catch up and pursue this object.  I have seen strange things in the sky before, but seeing jets literally chasing this thing made me realize that I wasn’t “seeing things.”  I was amazed and somewhat frantic and called out to my mother who lives with my fiancé and I (my fiancé had just left the house and was not home to see this).  She ran out and saw the object with the jets in trail as they all zoomed westward, coincidentally heading directly towards the Glendale Stadium where the Super Bowl was being played at the time.  To my estimate, it seemed that the object and the jets had to have flown right over Sky Harbor, which astonished both my mom and I.  At this time we heard what may have been the jet's afterburners because the jet noise became significantly louder once they were flying in a straight line again after they had turned. Although my mother did see the object, she only saw it as a light being chased by the jets.  She did not see any structure or detail like I had seen when it had flown past less than 30 seconds before.  We watched the jets and the object till they were out of view, and it appeared that they had turned slightly south before again continuing west. Some further information:  I am a graphic designer, 28 years old, and have lived in Phoenix (specifically Tempe) for five years.  Both of my parents are licensed pilots, and I practically grew up at the municipal airport in the town where I grew up.  I have spent hundreds of hours flying with my dad in his planes (both single and twin engines) throughout my life.  Although I am no expert, I feel that I am somewhat knowledgable in identifying things in the sky and feel confident that this craft was something truly unusual. I will also add that military aircraft (helicopters and jets) have been flying around the Phoenix area for the past week because of the heightened security surrounding the Super Bowl.  These military aircraft were discussed on the news before the Super Bowl so that all of us citizens would be aware of their presence and purpose in case we saw them flying around that week.  The news media stated there would be two Blackhawk helicopters and two jets patrolling airspace during the Super Bowl. Over the week, everyone in town, including myself, saw and became familiar with the helicopters and jets as they did their rounds.  However, I believe that the jets that I saw were not necessarily related to these aircrafts flying around for security reasons.  Very shortly after the sighting, I actually saw the two patrol jets in formation flying nearby from north to south in the vicinity of Sky Harbor.  These jets had dim, yet visible, red and green navigation lights, along with their white strobes.  The jets that I saw chasing the objects were not the two patrol jets because they were far out to the West at the time when I saw the patrol jets. I got the feeling that the jets I saw pursuing the object may have been scrambled from Luke Air Force Base or other nearby military base. Thank you so much for your time in reading my long report about this event. I wanted to be thorough and cover as much information as I could.  I will be emailing a map with the path of the object and jets based on my observation. I will also try to put an illustration together.

At first I simply thought these were lanterns, but after thinking about out a while I realized there are some real problems that would likely rule out lanterns.  The most significant problem is that the distance they covered in a relatively short amount of time would indicate that they were traveling at a rate of speed comparable to that of an aircraft at landing speed.   The surface level winds are indeed out of the south at the moment which would explain trajectory but not the speed.  Current surface winds are only at 4mph. The lights traveled in north/northwesterly direction for about 3-5 minutes, eventually ending up due east of my location.

I saw an unidentified object on the evening of Sunday (sic.  Saturday), February 28, 2015, in the sky over the Rosewood Community west of Goldsboro, NC.  Estimated position was Latitude: 35.3732178,  Longitude: -78.0755461.  Night was cold (~40 degrees) and partly cloudy. My son also saw the object and agreed that he wasn’t familiar with it.  By the time I got binoculars, the object was obscured by trees, so I never got a closer look. The object consisted of three lights:  two small white lights that flickered rapidly, and a larger orange, or amber, light that pulsated.  I could not make out a shape, just lights.  The object moved very slowly from northeast to southwest.  At times, I wasn't sure it was moving at all.  I kept checking it against fixed stars. It seemed to be moving too slowly to be a conventional aircraft.  It also made no sound.   We saw other aircraft in the air at the same time, but they were obviously conventional aircraft.  The UFO was not. Given our proximity to an Air Force base, I suppose it could have been some type of unconventional aircraft, but I’ve not seen one like it before.  Perhaps it was very, very high, and that’s why it seemed to be moving so slowly and silently. I HAVE seen some kind of experimental aircraft in our skies before.  I’ve seen the glow from jet engines suddenly wink out and the planes go both black and completely silent at night.  I assume it’s some kind of new propulsion system.  I asked somebody who has connections with the base if they fly test flights at night and he just smiled knowingly and said, “No comment.”  So who knows. I am 50ish, male, well-educated, and reasonably sane.  My son is a teenager.  Both of us have good vision and are somewhat skeptical about paranormal stuff.",2015-03-06T00:00:00,35.36705779816514,-77.96448532110091

I tried to record it but couldn't get a good shot, i couldn't get close enough. I continued to watch it, standing still in the same spot, the rest of the sky was clear. I stood for about 2 more minutes when a red, what looked like a comet tail or exhaust tail appearead from the top of the star. There were what resembled a star dust pattern clos! est to the star, it became more solid towards the end. From my perspective it measured maybe 4 inches in length from the main light.  I ran inside and told dan to come out so i would have a witness. He saw the changes in size and light but nothing else. He thinks i hallucinated the rest.

I used to live in the UK near USAF Upper Heyford in the early ’80’s and am quite familiar with different types of aircraft in the night sky.  I also spend time star-gazing so can tell a satellite from a meteor or meteoroid, the space station from a jet, have seen comets, planets, as well as other man-made objects such as Chinese lanterns, Iridium flares, etc. The sky was very clear but no moon and there was supposedly a chance of seeing the Aurora Borealis, which is always a treat in central Pennsylvania, although I am also familiar with this phenomenon having lived for several years in Canada.   I saw no sign of the aurora but while facing west with my house behind me I noticed an object come over the house, heading east to west.  I could not discern its altitude or size but it was high, certainly not a low-flying object.  It appeared in the sky to be the size of a dime (I know that’s of no help in ascertaining actual size but that’s how much of the sky it seemed to cover).   It was the shape of a squat comet, perfectly round at the front with a stubby tail.  It was an electric green and emitted light as if it were phosphorescing.  It was not very bright but clearly visible.  I got the impression that I wasn’t actually seeing the object but rather the result of an object interacting with the atmosphere.  If a disc shaped object were to go through the charged particles that cause the northern lights, this is how I would imagine it would look; I speculate, but I had the distinct impression of there being a disc.  There were no navigation lights evident, and no noise. I watched the ‘thing’ for a couple of seconds (long enough for me to lean forward, peer, and ask myself ‘what the hell is that?’).  It did not shoot across the sky like a meteor.  The speed was more studied, more restrained, I dare say more mechanical.  I was able to view about 60% of the sky before the roof blocked out the rest, and I estimate 10 seconds passed between its appearance and my losing site of it.  Altitude seemed constant and it did not alter its path; I observed no maneuvering. What happened next is why I’m reporting this.  A jet came in from the south moving north at high speed, navigation lights were observed, no engine sound yet discerned.  It was south of the object and altered its course to come in behind it and generally follow it.  I could hear the jet engine now.  I say generally because it was heading slightly more to the north and I remember thinking that the pilot must have lost contact.  By that time the object was barely visible heading away from me.  Then a light came from where the jet and the object were and arced towards the ground.  It was a bright small white light, with a hint of yellow, and to guess, I would say a flare, no way of telling whether it came from the object or the jet.  I lost sight of both.   Right then a second jet came towards me from the west, it had to have been a different jet as in my estimation there wasn’t time for a 180-degree maneuver. It went overhead and passed over my house and on to the east at high speed.  I’m quite sure this was a military craft.  It seemed that the two jets had come at the object from opposite angles of attack; I'm not sure how apt a euphemism that is ... The whole thing left me a bit shaken and I had the urge to get back inside, which is what I did.  I made immediate note of the time on my cell phone that I had left in the kitchen (it read 10.30 p.m. so my best guess at time of observation was as I stated initially, 10:28 p.m.).  I told my story to my wife and drew a sketch of what had occurred.   There is no doubt in my mind that the aircraft were interacting with whatever it was that I saw.",2015-03-20T00:00:00,40.78989046391753,-77.86876108247422

If I had to describe it, I would say a Fog Horn would best imitate it.  At first I thought it was one of my neighbors mowing their lawn and I started to look around my street.  Not a single person was outside of their house. Some houses didn’t even have cars in the driveway.  The horn kept getting louder as I reached the bottom of our driveway and I could hear my dog going ballistic from inside my home.  Around two seconds later I felt my hair stand up and my sweatpants start to cling to my legs as I was about to be struck by lightning.  I didn’t mind that as much as the horn though.  I eventually thought that it could have been a helicopter or a plane flying overhead.  There were only two things wrong with that idea.  The first was that the sound’s “tune” didn’t increase nor decrease as it kept a very low horn like sound.  The second thing that was wrong with my theory was that when I looked up to check to see if it was actually a plane or a helicopter, I saw the actual UFO.  It was not like anything I had ever seen before.  I saw it for a good 4-5 seconds before it disappeared into the atmosphere.  It looked like it was in an Isosceles Triangle shapes and shot straight up into the sky.  I did not see any form of thrusters or propellant as my angle may not have been good enough to see them if there were any.   When I saw it, it sort of hovered over my neighbor’s house at about normal helicopter height and as time continued for the next 4-5 seconds it shot straight up towards the sky and disappeared in an instant.   I ended up being completely scared to death and I sprinted up my driveway and started banging on the door to my house.  At this time my mother who had also heard the loud horn sound, was taking care my dog who was still barking like crazy.  He stopped as soon as I entered the house.  I then told my mother e! verything that I had saw just then and she told me about the h! orn that she had thought to be a neighbor as well.

We were all settled in for an episode of Vice (HBO), when I heard a loud whoosh, but I thought it was part of the soundtrack of Vice.  My wife exclaimed, ""What the hell was that?"" So she's looking out the window behind the couch explaining to me that the sound was coming from outside.  I followed her as she dashed out the front door. I could still hear the trademark military jet-type whooshing sound in the distance.  It's sort of an irregular pulsating whoosh that starts suddenly and ends as suddenly as it started, and then repeats that maybe five or six times afterwards, the sound fading off. So we're standing out front looking at the cloudless sky, and I'm telling her ""You know, sometimes when military jets are sent low over areas they don't usually don't fly over, it means there was a UFO spotted in the area.""  And not 30 seconds later, out of my left eye I see a light-orange-yellow spherical-shaped light moving NNE to SSW high in the SSW sky moving SSW through the constellation Orion.   About a second later, as I'm alerting my wife to what I'm seeing, a second light that looked just like the first light appeared about 3"" at arm's length to the west, moving exactly parallel with the first light.  A second later, the second light faded out, and the first light continued on with its SSW trajectory a couple more seconds and quickly faded out. I've seen probably 100 meteors, including 2 fireballs, 6 or so comets, satellites.  And I've seen some unidentified stuff, too.  But this was by far my most spectacular and unusual sighting.  I'm 58. They moved slower than a meteor but much faster than any jet I've seen at that apparent distance. We both got the sense that the lights were at least 10,000 feet up. They certainly weren't real close. I got a real good look at the lights.  They weren't steady, like light bulbs. Nor did they strobe.  They were distinctly round, but diffuse, and they gave the appearance that they were moving behind a sheet of water, or slightly translucent film with an irregular surface. At the point of fade they were maybe 40% of the diameter of a full Moon. Some years ago when I spent a lot of time during the day at home, quite a few times I'd hear the same identical sound of a military jet overhead or nearby.  They're tremendously loud.  Only once did I catch a glimpse of it.  It was flying north to south towards or maybe past downtown Long Beach, which is due west.  I didn't know about the UFO connection back then.  I wonder if some (all?) of those incidents were UFO related. By far the most unusual ""object"" I've ever seen in the sky. And I kinda-sorta predicted it.  ;) ((ADDENUM FROM WITNESS)) This is a better and more detailed synopsis than the one I submitted to NUFORC a little while ago.    *** On the evening of March 20th, my wife and I had an incredible UFO sighting that I posted about here. Last night we had another UFO sighting.  Same part of the sky - south of Long Beach, CA over the Pacific. At about 10:05 PM, I went outside to sky-gaze as I often do.  It was fairly overcast.  The Moon, which sat high in the WSW sky, was shrouded by the low clouds and cast a diffuse glow.  A couple of minutes later, due south and about 30 degrees above the horizon, another diffuse light appeared behind the clouds.  It was white and looked similar to how the Moon looked, but not as diffuse.  It gradually grew brighter, and as it did, two other similar looking diffuse white circles of light appeared, forming an equilateral triangle.  They were all about a third to half the diameter of a full Moon and two to three finger widths apart at arm's length.  At this point I yelled for my wife, called her on my cell, and knocked on the pane glass living room window to get her attention.  She came running out with her i-phone and saw the triangular formation just before it faded out.  As those three lights faded out, a brighter light appeared in between where the other three lights were, and grew brighter, casting a bright glow against the surrounding clouds.  We could make out a fairly well-defined bright star-like light at the center and the surrounding glow it cast was about three-quarters the diameter of a full Moon.  She managed to catch that final light on video before it faded about 30 seconds later.  All of these lights were perfectly stationary. I stayed out for another hour, but I didn't see any more.

I couldn't have asked for a better mothers day gift!   @ 21:00 I stepped out onto the back porch, which faces west, & saw this very strange ""thing"" in the sky.  It took a moment for my mind to comprehend what my eyes were seeing.  In all my years I have never seen anything that even remotely resembles this craft.  The first thing that was unusual about it was the color of the lights & the multitude of lights.  The lights were so beautiful & vivid, seeming to twinkle rather than blink, ranging in color from red, blue, green, white, & yellow.  The lights also gave away the sheer size of the craft.  I would hate to make an approximation on the size of this craft, other than to say, IT WAS VERY LARGE!  The lights also gave a clue to it's shape, which seemed to be of a saucer/disk shape.   So, now that I was fully aware that I was witnessing something otherworldly, I called for my father & son to come & see it also.  By this time as well, I have made the observations that this craft is neither making any sound nor is it moving.  I proceeded to walk outside & see if I could get a better look.   As soon as I did, from behind the treeline, ANOTHER craft became visible!  I couldn't believe my eyes.  Not one, but TWO, of the most amazing things I've ever seen.  An exact replica, & they mirrored each others movements.  By now, approximately 7 minutes had elapsed & they continued to hover for roughly 3 minutes more before slowly moving, in tandem, westward.  They traveled a good distance before stopping once more to hover & then I watched them as they slowly moved across the sky until thier lights were no longer visible.  The whole time, seeming as though they were perfectly in sync w/one another, they kept the same amount of time to hover, altitude, speed & distance between them.",2015-05-13T00:00:00,28.54022121212121,-80.85438636363637

They were white and fixed in place, so I’m not sure if I saw one big craft or four individual ones.  There is only one tower around that area, and it’s on the right-hand side of the field clearing, while these lights were straight in front of where I was driving.  I have lived in this area for very long and know there are no other towers towards the direction of the lights. I have decided to post this because this isn’t the only time it’s happened in that same area. It happened on April 12th of this year (2015), around 11 pm.  I remember this because I made a post on my facebook about it because I was freaking out.  Around that time, I was coming home from my boyfriend’s house.  Right before I go into the trees that surround the curve before the clearing, I had to slow down and stop for some deer on the road.  At at moment, a star caught my eye.  The star started to glow more brightly and became a green color.  The light then proceeded to get larger as if coming closer and moved to the right in a speed faster than I’ve seen any plane move, and then shoot straight down.  As I came out of the trees, into the clearing, the green light could be seen between some trees, not high up, but not quite on the ground either, it was just eerily floating in place.  I came home, freaked out of my mind, called my boyfriend for some peace of mind since this was my first! abnormal encounter. Today, when I came back after seeing the white, flashing lights, my dad told me that sometimes as he comes into that same clearing, he sees the same green light hovering, and when he turns on the curve up ahead, the green light is gone. There are not many people who live out here in the country, so I’m not sure if there’s any more witnesses to these happenings around this area.",2015-05-13T00:00:00,,

What made this seem so unusual was the large amount of space between the location of each strobe flash as the object traveled from east to west.   A few seconds later, I saw the strobe flash three more times but the distance the object had traveled during the second set of three strobe flashes seemed extreme.  I continued to watch and saw the final three strobe flashes to my far right as they disappeared behind some trees in the yard next to me.

This is a first for me, so not sure where or who to report it to and it may be nothing.   I live in a suburb on the outskirts of Tulsa, OK.  This last Wednesday at about 3:00pm, (I know as my son's bus came during the event) we started hearing the strangest noise we've ever heard over my home.  We ran outside as did many others, when it did not stop like a normal aircraft passing would.  The cloud cover was immense, but we could tell something was overhead.  Not just loud, but you could feel the pressure change.   A bunch of people went outside as this went on several minutes, and felt like it lasted forever.  I wish I could accurately describe the sound and the way it felt.  My dogs did not bark like they normally would, they went and hid.  Cars were stopping and everyone was trying to see what it was.    The only thing I saw, was after this noise had passed from overhead, I saw 2 fighter jets fly by at a very low altitude right over my house, through a small cloud break.  This noise kept going and going.  If it was some aircraft, it would have to be circling around and around for the entire length of time.   Even stranger, after, the news here reported at least 12 power transformers spontaneously erupted in fire causing over 1000 people to lose power.  Maybe a coincidence, but weird.   Nothing was mentioned anywhere about the air event, except on Facebook conversations.  My sister in law heard it at her house about 12 miles south, and this was right over my house going in a northeast direction, so it was that loud.  They went out to see what it was there, and couldn't see anything either.   My other sister in law lives close to my neighborhood, and said she was afraid it was the end of the world and was thinking only about her son at school.  At the grocery store yesterday, I overheard two people talking and one mentioned they thought it could be ""haarp"" related.  I had to look that up to see exactly what it was.   Whatever it was, it was bizarre and even stranger that the transformers blew up and that nothing was mentioned about it from our news sources.    I just wanted to report it somewhere.  Even if it was military maneuvers, it's worth reporting.  Obviously the military was involved somehow as the 2 jets that were following it could be seen.

Similar areas and lakes have been studied to attempt to find a flaw in the satellites images, but none have been found.  All USO's (?), are localized in Lake Titicaca in Peru and no where else on the Planet. Studying all images by year has shown a significant change in the behavior of these USO's.  These objects are much more abundant near the shores, near the northern and  southern areas of the lake and have been pictured over land as well.  2003 shows a drastic decline of these objects in the above areas with 2013 showing even more decline.  I believe this is due to the rise in urban areas and the population in general, as well as advancements in satellite imaging technology.

At 2:30 a.m. on April 23, 2015, I awoke to let my dog inside.  Standing at the kitchen door, I happened to notice a really bright, white “star” in the western sky (located at about 2:00, when facing  south; 10:00 if facing north.)  It did not move forward in the sky at all, so I dismissed it as being a plane.  I looked at it for a few seconds and noticed that it was moving slightly in all directions—right, left, up, and down—in no particular order.  The movement was very subtle, which made me think, at first, that my eyesight was wavering.   The light hovered in the sky at a distance.  From our house, it appeared larger than a pen point; however, it was a good deal smaller than the eraser on the end of a pencil.  It could be seen about a foot to the left of our neighbor’s tree, which is located in her back yard,  I would say, about a 200-foot distance from the west entrance to our house. I studied it for about ten minutes, and because it hovered, in proximity, close to the same place, I decided it probably was not a helicopter.  I woke my husband, telling him, “Come see this.”  He awoke immediately and came to the door.  We analyzed the “light,” and he agreed that it was a little strange, hovering as it was.  He stood and watched it for about ten minutes longer.  The light continued to stay in approximately the same place, hovering but unchanging, so he headed back to bed. I watched the light for a while longer and tried to make out a shape, but could not with my bare eyes.  I attempted to take a photo with my cell phone camera.  The photo showed nothing discernable.  Then, I tried to take a photo with our new, digital camera, but was not familiar enough with the camera yet to get enough light in order to have an image show up.   I watched for a while longer, then went to find some binoculars.  I came back to see the light still hovering in the same spot.  It was pretty fuzzy, and it took me looking around a bit to decide that the “star” was what I had in my sight.  I caught the neighbor’s streetlight (in the front of her house) in the sight and moved to the right, past the back of her house.  Through the binoculars, the light appeared as a perfect sphere that, though fuzzy, was a grayish, mottled ball, rolling forward at a moderate speed with some shadows and contours.   There was a symmetrical dot off-center on the left surface of the ball tha! t made me think that the ball was rolling forward, because it would disappear and appear once more within seconds.   I know that there was visual contrast between the grey of the star and the dot; I think the dot was white, but this is the only detail that I’m not sure about. (I didn’t make note of anything until I sit, writing this.)   I continued to watch for about another twenty-five minutes, until about 3:30.  In that time, I noticed that the “light” had inched its way closer to the neighbor’s tree, (still at a subtle hover and  still at a large distance, but appearing a little smaller).  When it began to slip behind the tree, hindering my view, I went off to bed.  ((NUFORC Note:  Planet, we suspect.  Perhaps Jupiter, which would be in that area of the sky, at the time indicate.

I was in my hot tub just looking at the stars and there appeared a round red fiery light with red flame-like flares coming from the sides of the UFO.  It was traveling in a straight line from the West going East.  It was the most spectacular thing I have ever seen in the sky.  As I watched it travel across the sky, I was wishing I had my camera. To my great surprise, right before the UFO disappeared, another UFO came into view following the same path as the first one.  It was exactly the same, flying the same speed and everything.  I yelled louder and louder for my wife to come outside.  She came outside half dressed to see what I was yelling about.  She saw the UFO and was greatly amazed also. She went back into the house and got her camera and started taking shots of the UFO’s.  I went into the house also and got my camera so I could try and get some shots.  I was able to shoot about 50 shots but only some came out.  I do have some interesting shots even if they are not great.  My wife took about 10 shots and some of hers came out good also. It was very amazing because the UFO’s kept on coming out of the West.  As soon as one got about three-quarter of the way across the sky another one would show up.  There were a total of 9 or 10 UFO’s that flew over my house.  At one point it appeared that one of the UFO’s stopped and the other one that was following started catching up.  One of the craft appeared to be higher in the sky as they got closer to each other.  The closes they got together was about the distance of two moons apart, then they move on and disappeared.  At one time I could see three UFO’s all in a row traveling the same path then one would wink out and the the next one would disappear and so on.  It seems some of the craft had different spacing that others.  They were not all the same distance apart as they traveled across the sky. This happened between 8:30 PM and 9:00 PM on Sunday February 1, 2015, above San Jose, California 95111 USA.  In general the UFO’s were a round shape.  The craft was round and the red fiery like flames were toward the front on both sides and also toward the rear on both sides.   The UFO’s came out of the West (Pacific Ocean), they were traveling almost due East (East Coast)  The first 5 or 6 UFO’s all had a “halo” of red-flame-like-flares coming from the front sides of and the rear sides of the round body of the craft.  All craft followed the same course West to East and also about the same path (a straight line across the sky)  There were no commercial planes in the sky that I could see during this time  The moon was very bright it seemed I almost needed sunglasses  The red glow of the craft got brighter as they came from the West and when they were three-quarters of the way across the sky they were the brightest. When they passed the three-quarters mark they started losing their glow and soon winked out and were gone. It seem they all disappeared in about the same part of the sky My photos were taken with a Nikon D800 with AF-S Nikkor 23-120 mm 1:4 G ED lens about 50 photos  My wife’s photos were taken with a Nikon Coolpix P510 Nikkor 42X Wide Optical Zoom ED V 4.3 - 180mm 1:3-5.9 lens   The craft had different distances between them  As I looked to the South the crafts were traveling West to East below Orion’s Belt and below the moon’s position in the sky I will submit Photos as soon as I figure out how (on February 4th, 2015)",2015-02-06T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

However, we are unable to certify that the report is a sincere portrayal of what was experienced.  PD)) Hi here! I'm new to South Phoenix, Arizona. I recently moved from a small town Indiana about a month ago. I moved in with my boyfriend in a gated community in Scottsdale. I fell in love with Arizona, I've never seen anything like it, honestly. Unfortunately, my boyfriend & I are no longer together so I moved in with a friend in South Phoenix. I can honestly say I'm enjoying myself here a lot more than I was with my ex, ha ha. My beliefs aren't related to the famous biblical forum, but more of believing in the universe. I believe that whatever we think & feel on the inside, is what we attract to us on the outside, known as 'the law of attraction'.  If my religion were to be labeled, it'd be closest to Buddhism. I've seen a few indescribable lights in the sky while driving, or star gazing, etc. I've always believed in extraterrestrials, never doubted.  My parents, and a few of my friends think I'm a little nuts for having an open mind , but I am…why not?  It's currently March 2nd, 2015 -- 11:18pm here in South Phoenix, Arizona.  A few days ago, I had just laid down & was searching for something to watch on Netflix.  I felt like I needed to take a break from family guy, & watch something a little more, well, WAY more different. I came across the movie called ""Dark Skies"", I remembered wanting to see it in theater a few years ago. Anyways, it turns out it was about alien abductions that this family was experiencing. It was a great movie.  Was very believable that something like that could really happen. Remember -- I'm open-minded.  Earlier tonight, I was relaxing on the couch trying to find something to catch my eye on Netflix once again.  I came across an Alien Abduction documentary.  I watched it half way through, and then just lost interest, so I ended up turning it off.  After I turned the tv off, I decided walk to the kitchen to get a nice cold cola from the fridge.  As I walked passed my double door entrance to my backyard, for some odd reason I decided to take a peak out.  Well I did just that, & I saw something for the first time that at first, I didn't even realize that what I was looking at, was for real.  There is a brick fence about 5 1/2 in tall that divides the backyards of our neighborhood.  The street light was stinging onto the back to the neighbors house, & I suddenly noticed a figure, it was a little bigger than the size of a basketball.  But unlike a basketball, the back of the figure went into a cone shape.  It was so still, that I just said to myself ""Oh, well look at that! That thing on the fence looks just like an alien head, ha ha.  ""Well, I end to walking away after about 7-8 seconds, I get my coke, then on my way back to my living room, I decided to peak once again, again, for some odd reason.  Turns out the alien head shaped figure I was looking at, had disappeared.  I'm not asking anyone to believe me, but I know what I saw, & I know for a fact that my roommate was upstairs, sound asleep.  I'm not really frightened by it.  To be honest with you, I think it's kind of cool.  -- New kid from Indiana.",2015-03-06T00:00:00,,

At first, I thought it was a strange light post.  It was right after where they put up new light posts, and i thought the lights were going bad on that one, but then I realized it was off in the woods.  It was a Chevron the size of about 3 fighter jets wide, and it was hovering quietly over a spot. Because I'm kind of telepathic, I tried to drive passed it really fast.  I headed toward Parkersburg on 14 from the Mineral Wells exit, and where the road goes from two lanes to one, I saw a blue and red lights flying too fast for a plane over the terrain. I thought to myself, ""Awesomely patriotic, red and blue.""  Well I could telepathically hear, ""We mean no harm.""  So I went to PIzza Hut to pick up my order in South Parkersburg, and as I was heading home to Mineral Wells, along Rt. 14, I saw it hovering over the hill along side of the road shining its spotlight onto the road near where I saw the blue and red lights minutes earlier. Mind you, this is now west of the interstate and south of its original location.  I think it was looking for me because the telepathy thing.  I was actually quite scared to keep driving, and I tried to keep with a guy in the left lane just to be around people, and he turned off, so I drove as fast as I could into Mineral Wells exit with the people of the gas stations and restaurants with the craft on my left (looking more coned shape by now) hovering next to me, and I pulled into the Wendy's drive thru, and they said they left the area because I was frightened.

At first, it looked as if there were only 6 of light/crafts, but as we stepped out further into our front yard we saw 5 more flying directly over us and our house, 11 craft in total.   6 lights were traveling in a straight line one after another with almost perfect distance between them on the Western horizon headed South with the other 5 lights in the Southeastern part of the sky, these lights were the ones that flew directly over our house and my husband and I, these lights/crafts seemed MUCH closer than the other 6 on the horizon, this group of lights was also traveling South.   The two formations of lights seemed to be traveling to the same point in the sky...  The Southeastern group of lights stopped in the sky and 3 of them formed a perfect triangle while the other 2 made a line below the triangle, in the end, with the formation looking like a key shape or a backwards P.  This group of lights stayed in the sky for at least 3 minutes before one by one they disappeared.   The other 6 lights were traveling in a perfect line for about 1-1.5 minutes.  Then the lights started grouping together in pairs and traveling at the same speed next to each other then stopped and made a square, then a triangle and then a long triangle and stayed in that same formation and spot in the sky for several minutes then one by one they disappeared also.   I was able to snap 2 photos of the crafts flying over our house but for some reason after that my camera would not work for me to take a video.

Tuesday March 3, 2015, 19:00   My friend and I were headed to Beaumont to go play some ice hockey with some friends at the outdoor rink.  It was a perfectly clear evening, not a cloud in the sky and the sun just set so there was still some light.   As we were driving west about 5 minutes from Beaumont I noticed two small but bright yellow lights just above the tree line.  I noticed that both of the lights were in perfect unison which made me question what kind of aircraft they were and if they were maybe military aircraft landing together at the Edmonton International Airport.  I took an aircraft maintenance engineer apprenticeship last year so I understand aircraft and have enjoyed them my whole life, so I noticed that I couldn’t see any navigation lights or strobe lights on what you would see on a normal aircraft.  I scrambled for my cell phone to start videoing it because the reality hit me that I was about to actually see a UFO.  The two lights then continued to come our way and the one of the left started to kind of glimmer and then it changed into a bright red light which started blinking fast and then slowed down to about a blink per second.  Then the yellow light craft of the right turned all of its lights off and my friend and I could both see the silhouette of the ship which slanted at an angle and was not moving and the shape of it looked like a saucer with a little dome on top, but it was pretty thin in design.  Then it re-lit itself up and was glowing yellow again.   As we continued to drive up towards Beaumont it started getting closer to us to the point where we had to look out our right window because they were just in the field beside us about 300 feet up in the air and about 400-500 yards away and they weren’t moving. They were about a half a centimeter in size looking at it and I guessed they were at least 60-80 feet in diameter.  Then they slowly started heading north east towards Edmonton and their speed kept getting faster and faster and the lights were getting closer and closer together because they were moving away so fast, then they merged into the one red blinking one and my friend then called his girlfriend because it was flying over her place and she said she seen it and thought maybe it was a drone or something and her mom said she thought it was a UFO.   Then when we got to the ice rink my friend said they all seen them fly right over the ice rink, my friend also said he thought it was aliens.   Later on my friend and I would confirm with each other that there was a point where we both felt like whatever it was it knew we could see them.   The 5 minutes of footage was filmed on my iPhone 4 in low light conditions so you can see the lights but the quality is quite low.  Funny how that always seems to be the case with UFO videos.

I believed the helicopter was chasing the light because when the light quickly turned south over the bay and disappeared the helicopter turned north and broke off the chase.

Secondly this track is not used by aviation airlines.  There is no land mass south south west of Australia.  Only the great Australian bight.

I hesitate to offer an estimation as i have no real source for my comparison except everyday life. to me it looked  the size of a jetliner maybe 1-5000 feet up.  a comparison for me would be a jetliner taking off and being maybe 30-45second into flight. not that ive seen that exact scenario, but that is the estimation i can give. It looked huge, i could see the edges, i could make the outline, but it appeared as though it was shrouded by clouds. it could be that the craft was huge and flying in the clouds, but there is no way any craft ive seen would look that big being up in the clouds. if this craft was up in the clouds, i couldnt even give you an estimate as to size. i have no comparison, simple as that. if the craft were closer to ground, the size would seem more plausible,barely.  still the shape and silence of the craft wouldn't. but none the less, closer to the ground brings the issue of why was it shrouded by clouds. i wont deny that i have had a fascination with UFOs, airplanes, spacecraft, science in general. which makes this experience even more shaking. I frequent nasa's page, i play computer games where you build aircraft, ive always had a passion for aviation. i COULD NOT explain what i was looking at. even while i was looking at it, trying to think of possible critiques and explanations.",2015-04-03T00:00:00,41.09336991071429,-85.1455725

The light on the left was floating about 200' higher than they one on the right (This is a very rough estimate).  They were bright, big, glowing, white.

As we were facing East we both heard a low noise, as if we were driving underneath an overpass and could hear a car drive above, but not nearly as loud.   I looked in the direction of the noise and saw a perfect equilateral triangle consisting of 3 lights traveling across the sky.  The top light was white, the light to the right (the direction it was traveling) was blue, and the bottom light was also white.   My mother grabbed my arm as soon as she saw it and we watched it moved behind the peak of our neighbors house.  Shortly after we heard the initial noise from the object it was silent, though still right in our sight.  We walked across the law, her still on my arm, asking one another what we could possibly be looking at.   For a brief moment it went behind a grouping of trees that we were unable to see over.   During those couple of seconds it went from 3 lights! to 2, as if it had turned flat.  The blue light was still in the front and one of the white lights right behind it.  It traveled a constant rate of speed during this entire experience. 	We came to a stop as we realized we wouldn’t be able to see it any further and waited for something.  We thought if it were a plane it was definitely about to crash.  So we waited, hoping that we weren’t about to see the sky light up and hear it plummeting to the ground. But there was nothing.  Just as quickly as it came into our view, it was gone. We were absolutely dumbfounded. 	After we waited a few moments for any sign of it we went inside to reiterate the scenario to my grandparents.  Both of whom had been sleeping, but assumed it must be some sort of military drill.  They encouraged us to report it to the police to see if anyone else had seen it. I looked up the number for a non emergency dispatcher and dialed the number for my mother on my phone.  My mother explained to the woman what we had just seen and inquired if there were any military craft practices scheduled.  We were told that there was nothing planned for this evening so she wasn’t sure what we had seen.  She said it was strange because there had been a lot of calls in our town in the last 3 years, none however had came in tonight other than ours.  She gave us the number to the National UFO Reporting Center if we wanted to let them know what we had seen. 	Shortly there after calling and leaving my name and number we received a call back. My mother answered the phone and spoke with a gentleman that asked about what we had witnessed.  During this call we were told that it is against federal aviation law to travel at night with a blue light on your aircraft.  Though I thought since the moment we started watching it that it was no plane, I never thought I would really know for sure, but that bit of information told me everything I needed.  We saw a UFO tonight, there is no doubt in my mind.

At first, I thought it might be a plane either descending toward or flying away from me (since there’s an international airport about 6 miles northeast of where I was driving), but as I continued driving toward it I became more convinced that it was actually a spherical object hovering stationary in the sky, since it had no wings and was staying in place.  It was also too high in the air to have been a helicopter hovering in place, in my opinion. As I continued toward the intersection keeping my eyes on the object I drove past some tall trees to might left, which came between me and the object and caused me to lose sight of it for about 5 seconds.  When I came out the other side of the trees the object had vanished.  This was strange to me because the sky was completely clear of clouds and the sun was well-off to the southwest, so there was nothing for this object to fly behind and the sun could not have obscured my vision. The entire event occurred over approximately 30 seconds. The time of day was 4:33 p.m. EST and the sky was clear.  I continued searching the sky for the object as I continued driving west on Route 20, but I was unable to locate it again.",2015-02-20T00:00:00,42.7051,-73.8994

The formations followed the same path as the previous formation.  He texted me to come outside.  Of the square formation, as they went past, all four lights went from orange to white for about 5 seconds, and back to orange.  After the color change, the bottom two lights disappeared.  The top two lights continued on the same path.  Then the 3 lights in the triangle disappeared, followed by the first 2 lights from the square formation. By the time I was outside, the first seven had vanished.  But when we looked back up, there were another 3 lights in an elongated triangle - they took up about 1/4 of the sky, and they followed the same path, from south to north, of the first 7.  They were bright reddish orange and the impression was of slow steady movement.  They did cover a large percentage of the sky from our vantage point - if I point my fingers at the places where they appeared and disappeared, it's at least 90 degrees.  They covered this distance in probably about 45 seconds.   We could also clearly see the lights of normal airplanes in the sky at this time, and it was obvious they were flying much higher in the sky.

I turned off the radio in the car and rolled down the driver side window in an attempt to hear some sort of sound - although the lights were still moving there was absolutely no sound. I couldn't determine if there was any solid objects behind the lights.  The lights were bright, not blinking and I didn't see any smoke or trail.  At first I guessed the altitude to be around 800-1,000 feet. I stopped the car on the side of the road - by this time the orbs of light were hovering high above my car still moving East and appeared much larger. Slowly they broke off the line formation, the 2 leading lights appeared to be slowing down and circling back around - the pattern was now random.

Roughly one week later this incident, I've decided to openly talk about it, even if I don't feel really comfortable talking about it. I am a 47 year old guy, living by myself.  My house is located in the northern area of Sainte-Brigitte de Laval, a small and calm town located at about 40 kilometers from Quebec City. This is a really calm area without any neighbors.  It's basically a dead end.  The house is surrounded by forest, mainly pines and regular trees.  This is not a suburb.  This is the woods.  The house cannot be seen from the street and there is no street lamps nearby.  To reach my house, I need to take my private access road (less than 100m).  At night, the whole property is pitch black as I hate leaving the exterior security lights on all night long.  Since I had bear issues in the past, I installed four motion detection halogen flood lamps that are pointing at each corner.  I live there alone. My typical weekend night is to watch movies on my laptop computer in my bed.  I also drink a few beers, maybe half a six pack.  I normally start watching the first one at 9 PM. When I feel like watching a second one, I start it right away.  If I don't fall asleep and I feel like it, I'll watch a third one.  But sometimes I'm too tired and fall asleep during a movie. That's what happened the night of the incident. I started the first movie at 10:30.  Nothing unusual.  Did not feel sleepy at all. The movie ended at 12:30. Perfect for a second movie.  I started it right away.  It was a long movie and if I closed my eyes, I would fall asleep almost instantly.  The movie was so boring...  Eventually, I felt asleep for good and woke up during the ending credits.  I tried to rewind the movie back to the moment when I fell asleep.  But I kept falling asleep and waking up. Then I woke up and my laptop has died (forgot to plug it to its power supply).  There was no lights on inside or outside the house so I tried to grab my phone and use it as a flashlight:  couldn't find it. Then I saw what I can describe as a flash of bright yellow and white light outside the window.  My heart started racing because I've never seen lights other than my motion dection lights over there.  Since my bedroom window is looking at my backyard, this could be a city truck or any truck with rotating yellow strobes.  Plus I did not hear any sound.   I approached the window and looked closer.  For a split second, the flash or light came back and all 4 motion detection lights powered up at the same time.  I rapidly checked out every window of every corner of the house but couldn't see anything that was moving.   Needless to say, my heart was beating hard and fast.  I went to check out if all the exterior doors were locked when the motion detection lights turned off.  Checked out the time on the microwave oven, it was 2:30.  I could regain my bed and put my laptop aside. Trying to figure out what could have caused this, I fell asleep again. I was too tired.  Then, it happened. I could describe it exactly like when you stare at the sun or a bright light with your eyes closed.  You can see a reddish-orange glow even when your eyelids are closed. I was awoken by the bright light that was covering my entire home.  My eyes seemed sealed shut but I could see a powerful red-orange glow through the eyelids.   At first, I though that I was dreaming so I did not bother opening my eyes.  Rapidly after, when I began to see dark figures blocking the light for a second or two, I woke up and realized that I was not dreaming and that my entire house was indeed lit by an unknown light source.  I could hear what I can describe as a humming noise that I could not hear with my ears, much like a vibration my head was picking up.  I then opened my eyes and was shocked to realize that there was three short humanoid beings, about 4 foot tall, with big heads, big slanted black eyes, a slit for a mouth and a really thin neck, all surrounding my bed and staring at me.  Their arms, hands and fingers were long and slim.   I was terribly scared, and felt like every hair of my body had risen. I tried not to look at them because their head traumatized me.  I couldn't stop looking at them in fear.  The last thing I remember is hearing a high pitched noise inside my head and then, nothing, gone, it's the morning already.  Looked outside and noticed that snow in my backyard is now lower (at least 1 feet).  My experience induced me great fear but now I know what many people have been through.  I am currently not okay with what happened, so for now I stay in a motel room until I am ready to go back.",2015-02-20T00:00:00,,

I am the river from the UFO, so had a good vantage point. I was watching tv, and something caught my eye in the sky over Quebec..  At first it looked like a star.  I had heard one of the planets was bright last night so figured that was what it was but something moved on the bright light so I continued to watch and it was obvious it was not a star because a red light kept circling the bright white light itself. The object was not moving at all - it stayed in one spot high in the sky in the same location but this red light kept either circling the white light or flashing - hard to tell at the great distance -but  was definitely a red light or two red lights.  I watched this object for at least an hour and then all of a sudden I realized it was moving westward but super slowly.  It also started to sort of bob in the air - up and down in jerky motions but not far down - just a little - kind of comical really.  It would bop a bit then move slightly to the east but it didn't move like a plane or helicopter, just sort of jerky little lines between the bopping. I realized a few minutes later that it in fact was heading north straight into Quebec and as it went deeper into Quebec it seemed to be more red than before.  Within about 20 minutes it was just a little pinprick of a red light and then it was gone. There was no sound at all and it did not move like any aircraft I have ever seen. I woke up early the next morning, today March 6th at 5am and I was stunned to see it again, in the same place over Quebec where I had first seen it.  Again it stayed in one spot for about a half hour and when I returned to the window that half hour later it was totally gone. Now I should report, at this point, that I had another sighting of 2 orange balls in the sky about 2 years ago that I reported to this site as well.  Sorry I don't remember the exact date,  I mention this because both these sightings were in the same general area of the sky over Quebec, Canada. Clearly something is going on that attracts them to that one spot and when I think back that first sighting was around the same time in the evening too, around 7:30pm. I didn't realize that there is a full moon and I guess it was last night as well.  Interesting timing to see something like this.   It was pretty exciting.  I am trying to see if anyone else saw this phenomenon but so far I don't see any other reports.   Hard to believe, it was stunning but you did have to watch for a bit to see the action.",2015-03-06T00:00:00,45.3813825,-75.70850071428572

(Very late at night to be cleaning a pool, but the grand kids had finally gotten to sleep and we wanted it clean for company tomorrow.)  Something caught our attention and we both looked over to the neighbors house.  Traveling just along the tree line, just before their house, we saw an equilateral triangle of lights in the sky.  It seemed to catch our attention at the same time that we heard a dull engine sound, it was brief and only lasted about 2 seconds, as I recall, but deep and not too loud, but the sound was kind of unique and out of place. We watched the lights for approximately 45 seconds move across the sky/tree line traveling at the same speed. It briefly passed behind the neighbors house, when I grabbed my daughter's arm and pulled her across our yard to see it quickly when it reappeared from behind the house. It continued to pass through the sky at the same rate of speed and again we moved across our yard to keep it in view as it passed behind several trees.  When it came from behind the taller trees it appeared to be only two lights now laying horizontally and it was quickly gone behind the trees.  I still had a grip on my daughters arm and the whole time we watched we kept asking each other, ""What is that?  What the hell is that?""  As soon as it was no longer visible I asked her to be quiet, because I expected to hear a crash.  We both thought we were watching a plane about to crash because it would have been flying tilted on it's side and was very low to the tree tops, but it flew too long of a distance, in that position, at a very steady speed and seemed to be moving in a straight line, without any sound, and in hindsight I realized that the lights were in the shape of an equilateral triangle (that is not the case with a plane flying tipped on its side.)  There was no crash. There was no sound. It was just gone. We wanted to call to police, but I wanted to go into the house first and tell my parents what we just witnessed.  They found it very interesting and encouraged a call to the police, just to report it.  I just want to state that we are all very clear headed adults and have never made accusations of any sort to cause concern about ones sanity or need for drama. We are clear on a few of facts:  The object consisted of three lights. That is all we saw, just three lights. They formed an equilateral triangle.  They never wavered. At least one of the lights was blue and we are almost positive that the other two were white, but one may have been red.  There was a strange, low, grumble sound just prior to seeing the object and the sound stopped within a second or two. We watched the object for approximately 1 minute or less. I made a phone call to the non emergency police call center and reported what we witnessed.  The lady I spoke with told me that no military actions were scheduled this evening in this area.  She told me that though she had not had any reports tonight from other witnesses, there had been a larger amount of calls coming in over the past 3 years of UFO sightings in this area.  She gave me the number for the National UFO Reporting Center and I made the call and reported what we had witnessed and was asked to write this report along with my daughter who was to write her own account of the event.  The gentleman that I spoke with informed me that under federal aviation law, no aircraft was allowed to use blue lights while flying at night.  The leading light was BLUE.

I don’t know if what I saw is explainable or not, and I cannot find any news about it, but it was a strange phenomenon to me and I know I wasn’t the only one to see it. I was watching American Idol and during a commercial, I looked out my front window to see someone who had pulled their car over to the side of the road in front of my house.  There isn’t any parking on that side of the street, but the car was left running and this person got out and pointed a camera to the sky and seemed to be taking pictures.  I knew the full moon had come up in the direction he was pointing the camera, but I had been out looking at the moon several times earlier and I didn’t see anything really cool about it or unusual that would cause someone to pull over to the side of the road to take a picture of it. The more I watched this person, the more curious I became.  What on earth was he taking pictures of?  I put on my coat, walked out into the back yard where I knew I could see the moon, and got the surprise of my life.   I don’t even know how to explain what I saw.  It looked like three bright stars dancing around the moon.  They had an orange-ish color to them.  They almost looked like planets, like Mars perhaps. But these things seemed to be moving.  I have to admit my first thought was that we were being attacked.  I didn’t know if they were bombs coming in from overseas or what the heck they were.  A million thoughts were passing through my brain at that point.  Then I thought they had to be planets that just happened to get aligned up there near the moon, but they couldn’t have moved into that position that fast since I had just seen the moon less than an hour before that. Then it became obvious these lights or stars or whatever they were, were moving.  In my back yard I had a limited view, but I knew from my front yard I would have a more expansive view of the sky, so I went around to the front of the house, but by then these lights had moved further away from me and the full moon.  It was just a few seconds after I got to the front yard that they moved out of sight.  It almost looked like they disappeared into clouds.  Even though we have clear skies, it could be clouds had formed where the lights were headed.  Clouds or not, that’s how it appeared to me when they disappeared.  Almost like the moon peering in and out of the clouds when the clouds pass over it. Another reason for going to the front yard was to see if the person who was taking pictures knew what the lights were, but when the lights disappeared seconds after I reached the front yard, the person who had been taking pictures had gotten back into the car and had driven away, so I never got to speak to them. I’ve searched for news on this and I see that other orange lights have been spotted in the skies, but unlike what I’ve been reading, these lights were not low flying objects.  Again, they looked like stars in the sky or planets, but really, really bright and moving.  There were three of them when I saw them, but perhaps other lights had been there and had disappeared by the time I got curious enough to go outside.  I didn’t see any objects, just light.  They were moving together, but appeared to be separate as the distance between the lights varied as they moved.  These lights were right beside a full moon so there was plenty of light in the sky to see an object, but I saw no objects, just bright stars or planets that moved in a strange fashion and then disappeared. Maybe there is a simple explanation, and if so, I apologize for bothering you.  But I have lived on this earth a long time, and I’ve spent a lot of time outdoors looking at the sky, and I have never seen anything like this.  I’ve even lived under a flight path for a major airport and I have watched planes flying at night as they come in to land or take off, but at the same time I could also see planes higher in the sky that would be passing over this airport, obviously not taking off or landing there, but just passing over as they journey to whatever other airport they are going to.  The point is, I’ve seen planes in the skies at night, both low flying and high flying, and these lights were not like any I’ve ever seen on aircraft I’m familiar with.",2015-03-06T00:00:00,46.1933,-123.0548

By a star I mean it would look almost how one would draw a star on a piece of paper like the religious symbol.

I looked at it through a rifle scope and it definitely looked different sligh! tly magnified, but I still cannot put a finger on how I would accurately describe such a thing.

I would hate to speculate, but the only three scenarios I can come up with of what something like this that just sits in the sky and slowly moves back and forth would be are either secret government technology, ET technology, or maybe even some type of inter-dimensional entity or spacecraft.

They were almost zig-zaggy in nature, with weird circling patterns.  This all lasted about 5-10 seconds and they suddenly just disappeared from the sky!  I don't think it was birds because these objects looked like they were much, much higher than commercial airlines fly, and plus, they just didn't look like any bird I know.

I followed it with my eyes and was puzzled by the fact that it moved smoothly along like a high-flying plane, but it seemed to be spherical in shape.  It shone brightly like a plane reflecting light, but the shining was constant.   I rushed around to the front of the house to watch it as it proceeded south, but by the time I got to the front street it had seemingly disappeared from the sky (although I could see the entire area of sky where the object had been headed).   Then I spotted another object of the same kind (my guess is that it was not the same one) far to the east, over the coastline or the Atlantic.  It glided south in the same manner as the first object.   Soon another shining object of the same kind appeared over the northern horizon.  I pointed the objects out to my neighbors, who were now a! rriving in a truck.  For the next half hour we continued watching these spherical objects as they appeared and proceeded southward.  It would take each object about five minutes to pass from our view (disappearing after moving past us and going some distance.

There were no sudden maneuvers or changes in direction, although one or two of the objects veered slightly to the east, heading out toward the ocean.   Some of the objects seemed to disappear (although I cannot say offhand whether that might have been due to the interruption of light reflection). The day was bright and sunny, with only a few thin, cirrus clouds in the sky.   Air force jets leaving white contrails seemed to be tracking the objects, flying due south along the eastern coast of Florida in the general direction of Miami.  The jets would appear from the north and pass silently overhead at high altitude.  We saw 4-5 of these jets.

We tried to take photos with my wife's iphone, but the lens doesn't appear to have captured anything other than blue sky.

I stepped outside on the way to my car in the 7pm darkness on 2/15/15 in Hillsboro, Oregon.  My eyes caught a glimpse of some lights up in the sky as I faced south. I was quickly amazed to observe a cluster of 9–10 glowing orange triangular (isosceles) shaped objects that I would describe as having a burning quality of glowing orange.   The orange glow turned to red glowing at the back end of the object.  I first thought they might be some type of burning debris falling towards the earth.  However, I quickly ruled that out as they were all uniform in shape, size and consistent in their orange glow intensity. Although the size of these crafts could be compared to a private airplane from my viewpoint, they did not look like planes or helicopters as they had no head or tail lights and were absolutely silent as they sailed fairly low above the city rooftops.  I am not a person who goes around looking for UFO’s by any means, but I must admit I was a bit mesmerized by these very unusual glowing objects.   I got in my car quickly and decided I would attempt to follow them, but as I got in and backed up to turn out of the driveway I looked up again and just like that they had all completely vanished.

I was walking outside of my building at work this afternoon and I heard some birds making noises overhead.  I looked up to see what they were and when I did, I saw this small, shiny object in the sky that caught my attention.  I stopped to watch it.  It was similar to what a bright star would look like at night, only this was during the day time.  It was about 1:45 PM, and it was sunny and clear, no clouds. I sat down at a picnic table and watched this “star” looking object.  After a few seconds, it started to glimmer so I figured it must be something metallic.  Since I had no idea what it was and what the size of it was, it was hard for me to judge the altitude of this object.  But if I had to guess, I would say it was between 5 -8,000 feet high.  I started thinking to myself what it could be.  It wasn’t a star because it was moving but it wasn’t moving fast enough to be a satellite.  It was glimmering when the sun would catch it.  It would go from a dull white color to a bright silver color at random intervals.  At one point when it was nearest to my location (it moved away slowly over time) the sun caught it and this silver object appeared to have a silver appendage below it that was shaped like a stubby pencil.  This appendage was also metallic as the sun lit it up and it was pointed straight down from the object.  At this point I started to think it was a weather balloon.  But then I was thinking that most weather balloons are non-metallic and the payload is usually wrapped in Styrofoam or some material that would cushion the instruments during a fall.  The wind was blowing in its normal direction, from the southwest to the northeast which is the typical wind direction for our area.  This object, however, was moving from east to west and eventually headed towards the north.  It was moving very slow.  (In total, I watched the object for at least 45 minutes and it moved only what would be about 10-12 degrees from east to west.)  After about 15 minutes of watching this object, the security guard for our business came along and we started watching it together.  Then a few of our employees came outside to see what we were looking at and they saw it too. After a few minutes, one of the other employees said, “Oh look, there is a second object now…it’s above the other one.”  So I looked up about 5-7 degrees above the initial object and I saw a second object that was very similar.  This second object was also glimmering in the sunlight, except this one had an obvious reddish color to it.  The second object was moving away from the first object in a completely different direction, in a northwest to southeast direction in almost a perfect arc.  It was glimmering pretty regularly almost like it was tumbling and the sun was catching it.  I started to think that maybe this was a satellite but after about 2 minutes, it slowed down.  It had been moving laterally at a pretty good speed and now it was almost stationary.  Like the first object, this second object would also glimmer in the sunlight occasionally with its reddish hue. I stayed there looking at both objects for a few more minutes and I ultimately said to our security guard that I had to get back inside and go back to work.  About three minutes later, the security guard called me to tell me that he could now see what looked like a “tail” on the initial object.  What he described to me sounded like the “appendage” that I had seen earlier.   I had taken a video of the initial object with my phone.  When I got back to my desk, I looked at the video.  Of course the video is blurry and the object has no edge definition since the camera was trying to focus on infinity.  As I write this narrative, the security guard is still outside watching the objects.",2015-02-06T00:00:00,33.741524958402664,-117.86342978369385

I was able to photograph a series of images, on a standard DSLR camera w/ 18-55MM lens so it was hard to catch the details of the craft. After the sighting, and upon inspection of the images, it's clear that the object was shape-shifting from ""Triangle"" to ""V"" to ""Ball of light"". During the course of the migration across the sky there were airplanes, helicopters, birds flying in the shot, but I could not tell how high up the object was. It did pass through the clouds which were all wispy angel-like formations and surprisingly not many chemtrails today!  Also I observed what appeared to be a plasma field surrounding the object that looked like waves of energy that were actually affecting the clouds as it passed through.

Myself and one other person saw a parked spacecraft on the ground with humanoid-type beings walking in the area and on craft decks.,Dillon,SC,1969-04-04T22:30:00,disk,~1 minute,"Occurred : 4/4/1969 22:30  (Entered as : 4/4/1969 22:30) Reported: 4/6/2015 2:34:01 PM 14:34 Posted: 4/8/2015 Location: Dillon, SC Shape: Disk Duration:~1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/118/S118259.html,"Myself and one other person saw a parked spacecraft on the ground with humanoid-type beings walking in the area and on craft decks. It was Friday, April 4th, 1969, just a few days before Easter.  My pal, Charlie, and I - two very bored soldiers - were setting out on a hitchhiking expedition from Fort Bragg, North Carolina to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, with vague hopes of scoring with some partying college coeds taking their Spring Break in the popular seaside town.  Leaving the base with our backpacks and sleeping bags at about sunset, we headed south out of Fayetteville on Interstate 95. Reaching the large rest stop, South of the Border, a few hours later, we stopped at a coffee shop to grab a cup and get our bearings before continuing on.  SoB, as the soldiers called it, was located just across the border in South Carolina outside the town of Dillon.  While drinking our coffees and looking over our map we couldn't help but notice a rather loud group of local rowdies, talking shit and throwing dirty looks our way.  This was the way it was during the rambunctious 1960s. In the area of the South we were in it could be dangerous for hitchhiking strangers, especially blacks, hippies, Yankees and soldiers. Accordingly, Charlie and I took the leering snarls very seriously, finishing up quickly and moving on down the road. Soon, we were walking through downtown Dillon toward route 25, the old Latta highway cutoff toward Myrtle Beach, still 70 miles away.  One good ride would get us there and at the same time get us away from the trouble we both sensed.  And sure enough, it wasn't all that long before two cars showed up with our friends from the coffee shop on board, hootin' and hollerin' as they went by.  As empty as the town was at this time of night (nearly 10 PM) it didn't bother us too much because of the street lights and the occasional traffic on the road.  But, as we reached the edge of town near the cutoff - with the rowdies going by every few minutes and the chances of a ride looking increasingly doubtful - the two of us began looking for an escape hatch.  After the loudmouths passed by us again and drove out of sight we took the opportunity to slip off the road into a dimly lit area behind a vacant, broken-down gas station.  Walking by the left side of the deserted building we followed a w! heel-rutted dirt path up and over a small crest, by now barely able to see more than a few feet in front of us as we passed by trees on the edge of the gas station lot into almost complete darkness. But, as the two of us picked our way carefully down the car path, the whole area suddenly lit up in an aqua-green glow showing a small field no more than a few acres in size.  Now I could see clearly, and what I saw amazed me; there was a three- or four-story high, multi-decked UFO standing on what seemed to be metal legs. In addition, there were beings similar to humans - a head with two eyes, two arms and upright on two legs - but colored green, either an effect of the ambient light or the result of my extreme confusion and fear.  They were walking in the field and on decks which curved around the ship, with the nearest one about 20 feet away.  He/she/it turned our way, and said firmly (I believe telepathically) ""LEAVE!  NOW!""    In spite of the danger that had caused us leave the highway in the first place, both Charlie and myself, like the trained soldiers we were, executed a smart about-face and marched right back toward trouble.  We hiked at a pretty quick route step down the road a few miles without saying a word to, or looking at, each other, hoofing just as fast as we could out of Dillon into some farming and pasturage area. Presently, the rowdies showed up once more in their cars, making it clear we were their targets for this night.  Once again, as the cars went out of sight we left the highway, into a cow pasture this time.  From a spot a few hundred yards off the road we watched them as they returned looking for us.  Eventually, the night settled down the cars were gone and we climbed into our sleeping bags. The next morning we continued on to Myrtle Beach. Here's the best part.  As far as I can recall we had forgotten about the UFO. One day, thirty years later my buddy called up from out of the blue and asked me,  ""Do you remember Dillon?""  I had no idea what he was talking about.  But as soon as he said, ""The UFO,"" the whole experience came back in a flash.

A large chevron shaped aircraft passed slowly by at speeds too low for a winged craft and there were no rotor noises. The craft flew at an altitude of approximately 200-300 feet and had a jet engine sound but with a much lower amplitutude than a commercial or military jet. There were 2 lights pointing in the direction of flight, and the lights were inbound from the tips of the wing. There were 2 red lights flashing/pulsating on each side of the craft. The craft flew past about 100 feet in front of us and we watched it until it was lost in the horizon or tree tops. The craft circled around and made similar passes at least 5 times. It was cloudy and slightly foggy so it was impossible to make out any detail of the craft due to the diffusion or glare caused by its onboard lighting. I have seen the V-22 Osprey and this was definitely not one of them or any type of jet airplane that can hover or fly at low speeds that I've ever seen. It flew nearly overhead and h! ad absolutely no propellor or rotor noise. It sounded like a turbine driven craft.  During the last pass we heard a few smaller higher pitched turbine sounds emanating from the craft which sounded similar to mechanical adjustments being made, similar to when a jetliner sets it flaps. My estimate is that the size of the craft was in the neighborhood of  150 ft long by 200-250 ft wide, and the body/fuselage appeard to be somewhat bulky as if it could carry large cargo. We did manage to take pictures and will transfer them to the PC in the morning. My impression was that the craft was military and not extraterrestrial.

I immediately drove back the direction I came to Skamokawa Vista Park to get a better view of it.  It was then going towards Jim Crow Mountain/ Jim Crow Point, which sticks out in the Lower Columbia.  It stayed there many minutes. It was about 200 ft high, and the main object was about '75 ft. in diameter.  It was round White light--so bright it lit up the Columbia river from its glow!   I looked through binoculars at it.  It was changing shape.  With the naked eye it sometimes went to a dull orange color.  It was absolutely silent.  There were other lights flying around short after it disappeared (at 7:55 pm) far down river and Jim Crow Pt obscured it.   The other lights were blinking red and white. and smaller.  You'd think that these were maybe airplanes, BUT when looking at them in binocs they have several other multi colored lights blinking on them also!  These other lights were going more North and South and going back over the woods of Wahkiakum County. This is very rural area.  Not many people outside...or seem to look in the air.

I was driving on the 134 fwy Westbound coming up towards the Hollywood Way, Burbank, CA, overpass.  As I was looking through the Studio side of Burbank, where the Disney building is, I saw the non-reflective deep black triangle hanging diagonally, further on over the 134, not as far as Cahuenga Blvd, but well beyond Pass Ave.   In the sky it was at about an angle of 9 o'clock.  It seemed to be stationary.  It was rotating around its lengthwise axis, but remaining mostly diagonal.  From my perception it was of a 2:5 ratio triangle at first, but it turned gradually into a diagonal black line as it rotated.  I passed under a second freeway overpass (Pass Avenue, Burbank over the 134 fwy), so it was much further away than the half mile or so that I traveled, and also I have some memory of how much larger the craft became as I approached, which was not much.   While I was coming up from under the Pass Ave overpass I saw what looked like the moon, in the western sky, very faint.  I don't know if this was the moon, but I was thinking how strange and wispy it looked if it was.  It's funny that when you see one unusual object, other objects become suspect even when they are not. I never heard any sound from the object, but I must have been pretty far away. When I first saw the object it was 3/5 the size of the sun in the sky, and it grew to about the size of the sun or bigger, apparently due to my getting closer; so it did get slightly larger. So assuming the object was not growing or shrinking this should indicate how big the actual craft is. This is why I didn't have the sense that it was giant, but it did seem to be larger than 30 feet long. Over the course of 45 seconds its angle changed such that it was getting quite thin, but I still could see it.  In another 30 seconds it got too thin to see, and as this happened it appeared to begin to move northward, towards North Hollywood. Obama is speaking nearby today, and arrived at the Burbank Airport here, so this could have been some sort of military drone craft, but it would be interesting to hear about it, since it appeared to be quite a bit larger than a small plane at least. What was so unusual was how black and non-reflective it was, giving the impression of a very high tech finish.  Also, it was quite strange the way it hung at such a weird diagonal angle, before rotating out of view.  How long I saw it for is hard to say; but I'm guessing between 1 and 2 minutes.",2015-03-13T00:00:00,34.151642662632376,-118.31696066565809

Streetlights in the area   Description:  A triangular craft was seen floating above the quiet residential area immediately to the east of Drove Road Swindon for a short period of time before moving away, in a manner inconsistent with a sighting of any conventional craft. The craft was seen to be floating perfectly still and in complete silence very close to Drove Road at a low altitude above houses.  It is difficult to estimate the altitude of the craft but it was perhaps ~50ft from the ground, and certainly what would legally constitute ‘low flying’. The craft was very close to the observer and so it could be seen with great clarity.  It was very conspicuous and easy to observe.  It was clearly not any form of conventional aircraft or any other known object. The planform of the craft was a perfect triangle in shape and was larger in area than any one of the houses over which it loitered although it did not appear as large in area as two such houses.  At each of the vertices of the visible underside were very large, powerful circular lights (one at each vertex).  The character of the light was very similar to that of the surrounding street lights. I.E. a bright flame yellow hue.  There was a subtle difference of colour between the light and that of the street lights.  Namely, it was of a slightly more brilliant character: less burnt and slightly more saturated. The craft itself was of a dark or black colour and with no noticeable surface features.  It was not possible to make out the texture of the surface. There were no signs of landing gear or wheels or indeed any other protrusions.  The triangle was perhaps a bit broader in the axis of motion.  At the centre of the underside, seemingly fixed directly to the bottom of the craft, was a pulsing red light far smaller than the others. This appeared to be very similar in character and frequency if not identical to a standard red anti-collision beacon of the sort used commonly in aviation.  The craft loitered perfectly still without any movement or instability and in complete silence over a quiet residential area for an observed period of approximately 3-4 minutes although it was already in-situ when first sighted and so may have been there for a while.  It could not have been present for more than 15-20 min as the area was traversed in the opposite direction using the same route approximat! ely this length of time prior to the start of the observation window.  It was obvious during the observation that the area immediately underneath the craft must have been very brightly illuminated by the powerful lights.  Anyone beneath the craft would have been dazzled/blinded.  The planform seemed to be entirely parallel to the ground while it was stationary. After about 3-4 minutes, it moved off without any noticeable acceleration. It moved very slowly – perhaps no more than 15mph based on comparisons with moving traffic on Drove Road. Interestingly, it moved with one of the vertices leading, as though that were the nose of the craft. No fins or signs of a tail could be seen. It remained horizontal as it moved away and no instabilities/roll/etc were visible.  Almost immediately after beginning to move, the large lights were all switched off.  The lights continued to glow and hence remained visible for the duration of the 30-40 seconds it took for the craft to attain diminished visibility to the observer.  The afterglow was very distinctive and allowed the craft to remain visible for much longer than would otherwise have been the case.  Perhaps a qualified lighting expert might be able to identify the type of light involved: the glow was a burnt dim orange-yellow hue and faded very slowly.  This also gave the impression that the lights were more powerful than had originally been thought. Slight concentric grooves were apparent within the lights as with powerful search lights and floodlights perhaps. The craft was moving in a straight line of constant altitude towards the portion of Queen’s Drive near to the Magic Roundabout.  However, before reaching that position the craft banked to the right at a very steep angle (nearly vertical) giving an excellent view of the craft from below, something that would not be seen in conventional aviation.",2015-04-08T00:00:00,,

As I was in route to my house, in the small town of Angleton, TX, just south of Houston.  I took the turn on North ridge headed west, when in the sky panning into view as if surveying, I see a small UFO come into view.  It would have been coming from the south headed north.  I immediately thought omg they have drones monitoring us in Angleton?  The UFO definitely had a green light and seemed to be centered in the middle of the little craft.  I could totally see this was a flying object flying approximately 30­40 feet above tree level.  There were definitely what appeared to be white head lights for surveillance or to see in general. There were also other colored lights, I definitely recall seeing red on either side of the craft.  Although, I couldn't make out the material of the UFO, I can say the craft did not have wings like a plane. The UFO came in and slowed down, I thought it was coming towards or watching me.  I could see it HOVERING back and forth as I sped down Lorraine Street towards it.  I then turned down the radio and rolled down the windows as it begins to rock back and forth then continues on north bound.  Very, very low flying and NO sound that I could hear.  There is no doubt it was not a plane and definitely not commercial, might it have been a drone?  It was small about 10­20 ft in diameter at the biggest, I believe it seemed small light weight because the way it hovered. I got a really good idea of how it turned and maneuvered. Of course, this was the first and only night I can remember being without my phone! Almost as if the spacecraft knew I couldn’t film it!  I proceed to see more and if it wasn't a threat. However, it didn't let me get to close before zipping away. The craft seemed to me to be surveying, or doing surveillance in the neighborhood perhaps looking for something?  Or only letting me getting a juicy view!  I saw the object for about 20 seconds, so I definitely got a good feel of the crafts intentions:  Seemingly non­ violent but it had orders and it was doing it’s job.

I was standing outside in my back yard listening to loud music in my headphones when I heard a vibration.  I removed my headphones to get a better grasp on the location and looked and saw 2 helicopters of unknown color flying super low with only marker lights on. In front of the helicopters were 2 detached glowing lights of no particular origin.  The lights were being followed at a fast past by the choppers, and when my vision became obstructed, I lost one of the lights.  By this time, because of the low altitude, I could feel the vibrations from the choppers propellers and hear the loud engines of the choppers but could not hear any noise from the lights. As I watched the other light, unblinking by this time because of my suspicions, the light vanished into thin air, leaving the choppers to chase a wild goose.   The other witness is someone I met in the direction the lights were going. I walked up the street and saw police on the block, so I asked if they saw th! e choppers.  They said yes. I asked if they had seen what the choppers were following, and they said no, so I told them my story, which they proceeded to laugh at because of the date and the insaneness of the story.  A little further up the road, I saw a group of people standing so I asked them the same questions. Immediately after the second question, one man said, ""Yes, the light!  It just vanished!""  He hadn't wanted to say anything about it to the others because he feared he would sound crazy.

I am a new listener to Coast to Coast which is what caused me to be conscious enough to even look up to begin with. These two ""globes"" were white in color.  They were travelling in a southerly direction. At first, they were travelling side by side, going somewhat quickly across the sky.  The one on the right was travelling a pace behind the other.  It then sped up and crossed over the other one and took its place on the left side.  They both continued til out of sight.

The weather this morning was beautiful.  Light wispy clouds.  Blue skies.  54 degrees.  No rain. Just perfect weather.  The highway was dry—I was driving 75/80 MPH.  I estimate there were 30-40 vehicles on the road in front of us.   I first noticed these two objects at approximately 9:45 a.m.  We were just north of Georgetown, Texas, and we had just passed Exit 268.  We exited the highway a few minutes later at Exit 275—stopping at the Flying J Travel Plaza to get gas.  The time stamp on the gas receipt is 9:55.   The two cigar shaped objects crossed the highway in front of us at an elevation of approximately 1000 feet.  They were perfectly in-line with one another—approximately 3000 feet apart.  It’s like they were flying on a stretched out wire—perfectly in-line with one another.  They were identical in size, shape, and color.  The shape and color of these two objects was contrasted against the blue sky.  They were shiny—a bright white.  There were no discernable wings, tails, landing gear, propellers, jet engines, windows, or lights.  They were two cylindrical cigar-shaped objects with rounded nose and tails.  I believe the objects were approximately two-three miles ahead of us when I first saw them.   They crossed above the highway traveling east.  They were in my field of view for 5-seconds and traveling very high rate of speed.  I pointed and asked my wife to look out her passenger window to see if she could see what I was watching.   She watched the two objects for another approximate 20 seconds until the topography to the east blocked the view.  She says the objects did not alter their course, configuration, elevation, speed—remaining quickly traveling to east at a high rate of speed until they were no longer visible from our vantage point.",2015-02-20T00:00:00,,

I stared at it for about 20 minutes and it appeared to be hovering in place. A plane passed nearby, and this looked nothing like the plane whatsoever.  I've also seen helicopters, chinese lanterns, swamp gas and the northern lights before.  This was nothing at all like any of those.  I was staring and staring, totally mesmerized.  I decided to run inside for a minute to grab my phone.  I doubted that I could get a good picture as the object was so far away and it was very dark, but I was going to try.  I also tweeted out to people on twitter about it, to see if anyone else in my city could see the bright light and if they knew what it might be.  When I came back out, I was watching it for maybe 30 seconds and then the light went red.  About 30 seconds later, it became a very bright white light, and then TOOK OFF.  It took off FAST. Way faster than I had just seen the plane go.  And I mean, WAY, WAYYYYYY faster.  It almost seemed at this point as if there were multiple white lights, or kind of like if the object was round and had a bunch of white lights on the bottom in a circle, or if the lights were all around it on the side, and like those lights were rotating extremely fast while the object took off both vertically and horizontally.  The lights faded very fast though as the object took off.  I looked at the stars again, and they were all just as visible as before.  The entire incident took about 30-40 minutes.  I think I'm the only one in my city (relatively small) who happened to be outside in the cold weather and looking up at this exact time.

Not having any luck with seeing the ""famous"" Marfa Lights, we were about to go back to our hotel in Alpine.  One member of our group then turning back north to walk to the car noticed something flying from North to South just to the East of us. The were no stars out as it was cloudy, windy and cold.  As the craft got even with us, we noticed it had three white lights that formed a perfect equallateral triangle. These white lights never blinked.  Directly in the middle of the three white lights was a red blinking light. It blinked about once a second.  The craft proceeded south below the cloud deck.  After about 5 minutes it turned right to the West and began to speed up. It then finally turned back North where it appeared to disappear into the clouds. There was absolutely NO sound produced by the aircraft as it flew over.  I have a IPhone app that tracks commercial flights and none were in our area.  The other odd thing about the craft is that it seemed to move in a very straight line (ie no movements due to wind) except for when it turned and made no sounds. I live in the landing path of a major international airport and see planes land both day and night all the time. I have never seen anything like what we saw this night.",2015-04-08T00:00:00,30.1828,-104.38849999999998

I started observing the sky once we arrived and I saw what I believe to be an airplane NW of my location.  The plane looked very far away.  It was below Orion's Belt but above the horizon line. This is not the object in question. I was almost constantly staring at the sky/stars since we arrived, when at about 10:01pm I suddenly noticed to the left of the airplane that a bright red glowing ball of light was just suddenly there in the sky.  If I had a ruler in my hand at arms length it would have been about a foot away from the airplane and to the left of it, at the same elevation.  I did not witness it enter my field of view by crossing the horizon line or anything else; there was no red light in the sky, then I look left, and when I look to my right again it was suddenly there. It did not have any flashing lights on it, it was rather a single ball of red glowing light that once I noticed it seemed to be moving down the coast line NW to SE at a brisk-to-moderate pace through the sky.  As for its elevation in the sky, it was also above the horizon line but below Orion's Belt. The object was at first moving in a straight line and I thought it was some odd airplane that I had never seen before; one that only had on one bright light.  About halfway through my sighting it began a very slow and gradual slope upwards, although kept to its general direction of movement.  I started thinking to myself, that I have never witnessed quite such a light in the sky before; I have worked at two airport's in times past.  I said to my self, ""If it disappears suddenly, only then do I know I have never seen anything like this before.""   About 15 seconds after completing that thought, the objects light started to pulsate slightly and dim until it just vanished in the middle of the sky.  The time from which it began to dim/pulsate to when it vanished was about 10 seconds.  The entire duration from when I first noticed the object till it vanished was about one min 45 seconds.  I find it odd that the object never made a sound as it seemed to come closer to us.  The entire event was eerily silent. Once the object vanished I knew I was looking at something I had never seen before in person and it is my interpretation that the ball of light was a UFO.",2015-04-08T00:00:00,,

On Thursday, February 19, 2015 I was driving from Kennewick, WA, to Vancouver, WA, on the Oregon Interstate 84 West that runs along the Columbia River.  At 11:55 a.m., I was approximately 1/4 mile from the green Gilliam Co. road sign.  The weather was clear with some sun and high white and dark rolling clouds. A train came up along side of me on the raised tracks to the north of the Interstate.  On the north side of the train track, setting lower, is the Columbia River bed and river.  I looked over at the train as it passed me, wondering how fast it was traveling as I was driving approximately 68-69 m.p.h..  I noticed the back few train cars were flat trailers, faded pinkish in color, with some flat product wrapped in white and bright yellow plastic, and a little bit of the plastic was flapping in the wind.  I did not notice any other cars around me on the Interstate at the time. As the train got approximately three car lengths ahead of me, I heard a very loud rumble. The sound was not like a train track sound, but more like a very close jet rumble.  I had my two front car windows, and my back passenger window, down approximately 3"" each, because of the outside mild temperatures.  I was shocked by the sound and was trying to figure out why I was hearing, what I thought must have been the train sound, even though I knew it sounded odd, after it had already passed me. I glanced back at the train to the left and caught something out of the corner of my eye to the right that made a downward fishhook motion from above the river water, as if it had descended and leveled.  I looked directly out my passenger window and parallel with me was a small domed craft, what appeared to be hovering, but it also stayed parallel with me as I continued to drive.  It was approximately 10-15 feet above the Columbia River water, well below the Interstate and train track.  There were no boats in the water and this was an obvious aircraft with an obvious shape, above the water.   I glanced back again at the last train car that was now ahead of me on the track and back to the craft for size comparison, and the craft appeared to be slightly larger than half a train car. The craft shape was slightly domed on top and was symmetrical. It appeared to be directly facing me as it stayed parallel with me.  On the end of the dome, on the left and right, were small extensions that looked like downward wing tips.   The underbelly was slightly domed, but not as much as the top part.  In the center of the side wall facing me, was a smooth small protruding cone, or rounded tip of some kind, with a perfect black circle on the end.  Above this cone, was a shape that resembled a bell dome, or what came to mind at the time was the shape of a WWII German soldier hard hat, with a slight curl on the end and small brim at the top.  The center of the bell looked flat, which looked like a cockpit window of sorts, but there was no glass reflection or difference in color from the rest of the craft.  The overall color was a dry flat blended, almost swirled, grayish green, very similar in color to that of the river, but the river was shiny and glossy, and this was an obviou! s flat color, and again, obviously shaped and raised above the water. This entire event was only a matter of seconds, approximately 12, but felt slow motion at the same time as I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The craft, while appearing to stay even with me while I continued to drive, and the train out of immediate view now, made a 1/4 slow even circular turn to the right and paused for a second.  As it did this, I did not see the profile of the cone or brim that was on the front. It appeared a smooth, almost fluid, transition.  There were no shapes or markings on this side, only the same grayish green color.  The craft then very quickly made a 3/4 right turn, bringing it full circle, and it shot upward, heading northwest toward the Washington side of the Columbia River, in a steep, just slightly angled, climb, well above the mountain on the Washington side of the river.  As it made its final turn before heading upward, I heard a loud brief swoosh sound. The craft appeared to turn black once it moved away from the water. In a matter of 2-3 seconds, it disappeared in to the white rolling clouds above.  There were no visible lights on the craft, no jet trail, no heat or fume waves visible.  Nothing. I drove to the next small town of Arlington, OR, and pulled in to their park.  My heart was racing and I felt nauseous.  I think I was in shock from what I had just seen.   I texted my immediate family members and told them what had happened at 12:20 p.m.  At 1:17 p.m., I sketched a picture of what I saw. To my credibility, I am a ((50's)) year old mother, and grandmother who holds a ((deleted)) Degree in ((deleted--arts and sciences)), and two ((deleted)) Degrees with ((deleted--honors)).

Sipped some coffee, lit a cigarette and checked back on the airplane as it got close enough to see it was whitish silvery and absent of wings, but yet still too far away to be sure of anything.  It was traveling due south and cigar shaped with no noise.   As after about 10 seconds, it got close enough to be sure their were no wings.  It flew into the clouds to the south after about 15 to 20 seconds of being visible in the sky.   It was almost about the size lengthwise of a full moon and I can't really decipher how high it was besides saying it was the height of a low flying plane.  The finish of the object looked like a high polished nickel or aluminum with a white hue to it.   No camera on my persons as the thought came across to take a photo or video, but I remember being glad and at ease that I was not trying to document it besides seeing it.  It actually gave me joy and relaxed as I stared at it and felt ""odd"" or hypnotized is for lack of a better way to describe my experience.   In conclusion, cigar object was visible from north sky for 15 to 20 seconds, as it flew into cloud cover to the south in the area code of 53144 at 7:30 a.m. on 03/13/2015.",2015-03-13T00:00:00,42.58091583333333,-87.85322791666667

We were looking at the rising moon in the East and noticed how clear and warm it was in comparison to the previous weekends.   We first saw a group of 13 red objects coming from the North West and they appeared to by flying in several formations. The first few flew in a configuration that looked like the constellation Sagittarius with two vertical V shaped formations of 3 objects following this constellation resembling formation. Since we live in the landing patterns for Philadelphia International Airport we are quite familiar with the heights, speeds and sounds of approaching, circling and departing aircraft.  There were no sounds associated with these objects and they seemed to fly past us at about 4-6k ft at about 400 mph.  About twice the speed we would normally see landing aircraft and about the height you would anticipate a plane to be landing at PIA.  The objects were about twice the size of a passenger jet at this height.  They all seemed to be identical.  My cousin seemed to think they were V-shaped but all I saw was an oval Red Light. The objects were bright Red in all the groups.  The second group followed the first after an interval of about 10 seconds.  They were heading on the same course, Northwest to Southeast toward the rising full moon.  The second group was a group of 9 objects flying almost at the same heights and speed as the first group.  I had my cell phone and began taking video and stills.  Surprising but the Video did not capture the objects, but my stills did.  The second group flew with the first 6 objects flying in a half moon shape followed by 3 in a vertical line.  At this point I called my wife outside and she did not know what to make out of them. When we thought they were gone another group of 3 following the same course, height and speed flew by, followed by another group of 3, then a few seconds later another group of 3.  All were Red and all followed the same course.  These were flying in a triangle, isosceles, with the two creating the base flying East and one tailing the other two.  As they flew towards the rising moon they all disappeared climbing out of site, as they flew East.  However, they all were climbing through the area of our vision, but seemed to be starting at a lower altitude from the West and climbing going East until they faded out of view. We have never seen anything like this especially with no associated sounds or flashing lights.  Observers were an electrical engineer(male), tax accountant (female) and kindergarten teacher (female). Previously all skeptical on UFO's. Someone else had to see these with the amount of objects in the sky. We look forward to hearing if anyone else saw these.",2015-04-08T00:00:00,40.2262,-75.2931

It is also in an Fight Service Station advisory zone, so we would have immediately been advised of a traffic conflict if it was on radar. It could have been in the distance, but it seemed very close (maybe 300 - 500m away).  I have seen falling stars before, as well as really unusual falling stars that delineate slightly due to naturally occurring conditions.  It DID not look that way.  The orange was so deeply intense, and unlike anything I have ever seen before. I'm trying to find a rational answer to what we saw.",2015-04-08T00:00:00,48.456685618166524,-123.38397199327164

It is NOT a star, due to the fact that it does in fact MOVE in the sky and it is NOT a planet due to the fact that it is constantly blinking and changing colors. With that said, it looks like a star to the unenlightened layman viewer just casually glancing at the sky.  It rises in the Eastern sky, and here in Northern Colorado, it is almost always visible (clouds/chemhaze/pollution/weather permitting) by 11pm and usually earlier shortly after nightfall. I watch this thing religiously, and make sure to hold very still and look with both eyes directly at it for long enough to observe it move. It usually moves in a space in the sky no larger than a dime held at arms length, and maintains it's usual position. My father and I have, on one occasion, observed it being in one position and two hours later being in a position some 15-20 degrees North of that position.  This is anomalous movement and activity. The color changing on it is PHENOMENAL.  Mostly what you can pick up is red, white, blue, and green, but it is in fact flashing everything in between when obsevered closely. I will speculate in the following paragraphs, but on pure observation you have a point of light that changes colors, sways and darts around, and sometimes does more DRAMATIC movements which will cause the hair on my neck to stand up from seeing something so incredible. I have become VERY familiar with this sign in the sky, and do my best to show anyone whose path I cross while it is visible. SPECULATION: My fear is that it is a grand deceptive technology put up there [like a rave/concert lightshow on a screen swinging from some servo arm on a weird disinformation satellite] by Government/Shadow[pseudo] Government agencies as a grand deception--or what the hardcore fundamental Christians would call ""false"" signs to mislead. What I believe, however, is that it is in fact an intelligently controlled craft of some sort [or possibly a portal/wormhole], though I have seen what looks like short bursts of light emanate from it and believe the possibility that it could be this GREAT DREADNOUGHT class mothership which is bristling with powerful technologies that make the world powers shudder from their helplessness. I believe it is benevolent, and here to show those of YOU / US who care to focus and witness it, that the galactic cavalry is here and things on Earth are changing drastically. Meanwhile, the chemhaze and trailing is almost non-stop, in what I believe an effort to control the skies and what is and isn't seen by surface dwelling earth citizens. I did not mean to make this into a science fiction story, the sighting is REAL and the craft is there for anyone to see, perhaps in low earth orbit. I am actively watching the skies for further revelations of the truth and open my mind to any influence I might receive. My name is ((name deleted)), and I believe.

Let the dog out into the back yard from our deck, and saw a red blinking light to the northeast, traveling from southeast due north.  The light was probably 1-1.5 of a miles away and approximately 300 feet in elevation.  As the Coeur d’ Alene airport is another mile north I figured it was a plane headed for the airport, although I’ve never seen a plane or helicopter approach from that direction. No white or green navigation lights were visible.  Then one red flashing light then went to two flashing red lights, then three, then four, all in a straight line, not one under the craft, one on the rotor tail and one on nose, but all four lined up.  The flashing sequence changed from one blinking to two, then four, then three, then one, then all four at once.  At an arm’s length, the lights were half the size of my thumb at approximately 1-1.5 miles away. I called my dad out on the deck and pointed it out.  He was amazed.  The craft made no noise and was moving slowly.  If it were a helicopter we would have heard it.  Unless it was a silent helicopter without any normal navigation lights on, but then 4 RED lights in a straight row?  I immediately thought someone had a new toy drone and were flying it maybe from Lake City High School. I’m an amateur astronomer and have several pairs of high powered binoculars.  I quickly set up my tripod and 25/100 binoculars, that’s how slowly the craft was moving, that I could do this.  I got a good view of the lights but couldn’t make out a shape of the craft. As the craft was headed over our horizon, rooftops, I grabbed my smaller binoculars and jumped into my vehicle and headed north on Atlas Rd., which runs into the south/west runway of the Coeur d’ Alene Airport.  By the time I reached the airport, having the craft in site the entire way, 5 minutes, the craft was now across the airport at HWY 53 or so and now made a slow but quick hard left turn toward Spokane/Hauser, west.  I watched it for maybe 2 minutes at this position.  It was too lit up with street lights at this position to use the video on my phone. Returning to my vehicle I proceeded west on Prairie Ave. until McGuire Rd. turned north/right and saw the craft approaching the small mountain just south of Hauser lake, having kept it in sight the entire distance.  Now, looking at a map, the craft went over the hill just south of Hauser Lake.  A train stopped me at Hwy.  53.  That was the end of the viewing.  It was now 10:01pm. I don’t think this was a drone, as the distance I drove and returned was 36 miles.  No toy drones have this capability for this distance or duration.  The size of the craft, based on spacing of the lights, also makes me rule out a retail drone.",2015-04-08T00:00:00,47.700352531645564,-116.78960632911392

So I sat there and waited for it to get closer.  It was low flying, barely above tree top level.  It came about as fast as an airplane taking off would.  When it got close I could see 3 really large Round Bright Green Lights that were not blinking.  It was going South.   When it got to my fence line it stopped and hovered. It was real loud like a lawnmower in the sky. It was so steady hovering there.  I sat there wondering what the heck this thing is? I could not open my door to get a better look, or my Alarm would have went off.  I sat there watching it.  I heard a noise like a transmission would make and those 3 Green Lights rotated counter clockwise and was now Facing East instead of South like they were facing. That was an incredible sight.  The lights literally twirled around fast.  When it turned I now saw a R! ed Flashing Light on the back of this thing and could see about one inch of the Green light lens on one of the lights on the side near me, I knew the lights were still there but now they were facing East.  The craft took slowly off going East now.  This thing had to be black or a dark color cause It was so dark that morning, I could not make out shape of it.  I could not tell what it was. It was not our Police Helicopter or an airplane.  It was not a toy either.  It was too large.  The lights were huge. I live on the flight path of the airport and am used to seeing all kinds of airplanes and helicopters.  Never saw lights like that or a sound like that.  I have spent hours now researching every plane, drone and helicopter I can find and can’t find anything that has 3 Green lights on it that are that large and round and don’t blink.  So wish I knew what it was.   One thing for sure, I saw first hand how these flying crafts change direction so fast.  Apparently they must push a button or a gear and can go from going South to going East real quick.  It must be a new craft too, not many reports of 3 Green lights that are solid and not flashing.

Came from the west. at 2:41am, my fiancee and I were using the google sky app to try to identify strange star formations, and the google sky app wasn't able to identify the constellations we were seeing.  Then, we realized that the supposed constellations were moving from southwest, coming from the direction of the coast, and moving across the sky toward north east.  We realized that the entire constellation had moved from one part of the sky, directly over us, and continued moving in formation until we could no longer see them.  Waves of what looked like constellations or formations of flying stars kept coming from the southwest and crossing the entire sky, all passing over us.  It took roughly five minutes for each wave of them to appear and cross over the entire skyline.  However, there was one brighter ""star"", and once it crossed above us, it seemed to go only a few more degrees toward the northeast, until it hovered in place, then seemed to go back and forth as to stay visible to the new waves of ""star"" or craft formations that appeared.  it would get up to 80% brighter than it's original appearance, as if it was guiding the waves of flying ""star formations"" that continued to appear from the southwest and travel to the northeast.  We went and got our mom and her boyfriend after 2 minutes of witnessing the first wave of stars, which we thought was a constellation-but once it was over the house we realized it was moving and brought them outside.  After that, we witnessed at least 6-7 formations moving across the entire sky-each had approximately 6-9 stars in formation with each wave.  It looked as if Cassiopeia started to move and cross the sky, with a wave of more cassiopeia constellations successively moving across the sky.  There was a lot of fog, but the moving ""stars"" would go behind the fog and emerge so that we could see that they had traveled and kept their momentum while continuing to fly in the! direction of the one bigger, brighter craft.  They were all s! ilent. With the exception of the bigger ""star"" that seemed to oscillate within a small area of the sky to stay somewhat in one place as its lights grew brighter, none of the other starlike craft grew brighter.  All maintained a veritable ""starlike"" lighted appearance.  Again, no noise heard at all, no blinking red lights, and they were all way too close together to be actual airplanes.  I have never seen 40 planes so close together and all traveling the same altitude, the same direction, and without any noise or without some kind of blinking identifying light for safety, especially on a foggy night.  Each time the fog and clouds had a break, you would see more and more of these moving constellations, all following the brighter craft.  The brighter craft seemed to have illuminated its sides, and looked triangular.  However, you could only see this feature when it increased its brightness every few minutes, as if to light the way for the next wave of craft.  I tri! ed to take a video with my iPad, but it captured blackness.  someone please let me know the best equipment for filming at night.  Please!

Usual morning with my girls in taking them to school, left at 645am.   While driving, straight ahead of me I saw, red-orange fireballs coming out of the sky, then they would stop and maintain their altitude, hovering.  I said what is that? and one of my daughters replied, ""Do you think its meteorites?  But why would they stop in the middle of the sky?""  The other daughter mentioned, ""Mom, it's not a plane, the lights are not flashing, there constant.""   It was one fireball after the other, the first couple of orbs that came down first already formed a square, while others kept coming out of the clouds, but they were organizing themselves, in a line, it looked like they formed some type of constellation.  The big dipper.   Meanwhile, more red orange fireballs, at this time I was really scared and asking for someone to film it and looked at the time, it was 6:48 am and started counting them, 14.  I looked in front of me at the sky and they were there but not in my camara.  I asked my daughter to zoom in, but all of the sudden, the color changed to yellowish orange.  They were all there hovering waiting for some thing.  Then they all formed a ""V"", bright yellow/orange lights and completely disappeared.  Five minutes have gone by and I didn't see anything,   All of the sudden I saw 2 military airplanes flying towards the same exact direction the Orbs went.  I was never a UFO believer until yesterday.  I went to work really shakey with my experience.  I called channel 7 news and reported it.  I spent most of my day looking for other answers to convince me it wasn't UFO'S.  All the pictures of other experiences looked exactly the same as what my eyes seen.   My daughters and I witnessed it together, all 3 are believers now.",2015-02-12T00:00:00,,

Monday, Feb. 9, 2015, at about 7:58 am, I was driving my 12 yr. old daughter and 5 yr. old grandson to school when I noticed that you could still see the Moon very well.  I glanced at the moon, and then back at the road, and immediately realized I’d seen something under the moon, so I glanced back up at the moon and saw a long line of white dots moving at a steady pace in the same direction I was travelling.  I instantly assumed they were white birds and again looked away.  Then it occurred to me that they were in a perfectly straight line and evenly spaced away from each other, so I looked up again and said, “What the hell is that?”  At that point my kids looked at it too and the 12 yr. old said, “That’s not birds!”   At that point, I pulled the car to the side of the road and watched the objects.  What I saw was a perfectly straight line of 6-8 very bright white lights, all traveling north at a steady speed that wasn’t slow but wasn’t real fast either.  (They were flying, not drifting, on the air currents like balloons would).   Each light was evenly spaced down the line and did not appear to be attached to anything or each other.  They appeared to be separate units and were traveling as though they were following each other not flying side by side.  The second to the last light was slightly out of line, it was a little higher than the others in the line.  Each one had the same light intensity and were brighter than the moon was.   They appeared to emit light, not have lights on the outside.  I also noticed that they appeared to flash at the exact same time, but it wasn’t a normal flash and is very hard to describe.  It was almost like a strobe light flashing slowly but the light wasn’t going off and on, it looked like there was a grey thing that travelled down each light starting from the top and travelling down the front then appearing at the top again and traveling down the front repeatedly and the grey thing blocked out the light as it travelled down the orb.  (It reminds me of a light in a lighthouse that has a sheet of metal the rotates around the light, momentarily blocking it out so that it appears to flash)  It was like that, and you could tell the light itself wasn’t flashing. (I initially thought it was birds like I said, flapping their wings and that’s why it appeared to have that flashing appearance)  But it became apparent that it wasn’t birds when I noticed the spacing between them was too perfect, they were in a perfectly straight line (except the second to the last one), they flashed in perfect sync with each other and they were flying so high in the sky that I don’t even think birds fly that high). I continued to watch the lights until they were no longer visible.  They were actually traveling northwest, so as they continued across the sky they were no longer flying parallel to my car they were flying away from me as well and the first few lights could no longer be seen and eventually they all flew too far away to see anymore. There was no sound, they traveled at a steady speed, they flew at a pretty high altitude but were very easy to see and maintained the same altitude throughout the sighting, they appeared to be pretty large and very bright!  They were very noticeable even in the daylight.  I was able to see them from the side and from behind when they flew away, but they looked the same all the way around just a ball of bright white light, no structure could be seen. I was a police officer for 13 years and by nature skeptical and observant and have tried for 2 days to come up with a rational explanation for what I saw, and cannot come up with anything!  They were not aircraft of any sort because they made no sound and were flying way too close together and were too perfectly spaced out to be anything I am aware of. Also, I noticed that someone reported a sighting to this site that appears to be the same thing I saw, their sighting was on 11/25/14 in Oklahoma City, OK.

I thought it was a tower at first, but then I noticed a second red flashing light. I walked into the yard to get a better view and saw that they were moving just above the tree line.  They moved to my left and they were flashing in a perfect call and response pattern. They moved fluidly and appeared to be separate objects.  Their distance was not constant. They continued around to the left and over the hill until I could not see them.  I came inside and searched for similar sightings and found one report that described two lights ""dancing in the sky"".  This description fits what I saw. It was quite beautiful. I came out 5 minutes later and saw them near the mountains west of here, where they soon were out of sight.  I saw an airplane plane fly overhead soon after they disappeared.  I do not know if that is related. One other thing is that while I was watching them when they were within appx. 100 yards from me, I heard a crash in the house, which scared the death out of me.  I ran in and my microphone  had tipped over and landed on the ground.  I don't know if ufos knock over microphones, but if they do, I find that very rude.

It looks strange!!    Then as my girlfriend observed it another just like it appeared!!  I said wow look another one!!  She was like, ""What you think that is??""  I told her I don't know but it looks weird!   Then another popped out of nowhere from in the area of the first we saw!!  It was amazing!!   So I started watching the the third one as to see if it was following the the first two and as I watched them they started to kind of disapear!  My back facing where they came from I turned around and observed another coming my way from the same direction! I had to take my phone out to record this!!!   Next thing you know, one after another flying in the same direction started popping up!  I couldn't get a good view of them with my phone so I stopped recording to use a app I had on my phone!  It's like a binoculars app.  I took some pretty good pictures and then proceeded to film again!   At that time a young lady with what I guess was her father asked what was going on.  As they looked up they were amazed as well!  The father suggested I call the cops, as by that time, about fifteen passed us all going in the same direction.   So, I proceeded to walk home, while filming as much as I can.  There wasn't many people in the street, and the few that were around weren't paying us attention.  I know what a helicopter looks like at night and that was not helicopters!!  Nor were they drones!  Over twenty of those things past by Us! I have film and photos!!  Amazing!!!

It was stationary for a few more moments and then traveled east.  There where no flashing/blinking lights, it never changed color, nor did it make a sound.  In my opinion it wasn't even in our atmosphere.  The light was just as bright as the north star on a clear night.  I decided to take my telescope out when it was stationary to the east.

It was a triangle or almost U shaped.

It was just a very bright white triangle/U shape light that moved from north to south back to north and then east.  For me, the most incredible event was when it decided to leave.

I would guess its altitude to be near 40,000 feet.  There was no sound heard. As I watched I tried to see if there was any directional movement but could not see any.  I then picked three brighter stars as reference points and located the object slightly off center of the middle of the triangle.  I looked away for a while and looked back up to note that the object had moved from slightly off center to a position just inside the perimeter line between two of the reference stars.  I went out today, a day later, nearly the same time and could not see any objects within the reference triangle of stars. I would add one more unusual item.  While watching the object rotating in position I heard a buzz near me.  It sounded like a cell phone on vibrate or a fuel pump in a car.  After about five minutes I heard it again.

It was clear as day a ((profanity deleted)) huge boomerang shaped thing traveling really slow for the height it was at and not even a whisper of a sound I could see it for about ten seconds and then it went very low cloud.  The cloud was really low that night so I'm guessing a couple of thousand feet.  It was so low that the light pollution (Orange lights) were colouring it.  I could see the outline of it perfectly and I know for a fact that for something that big moving that slow would fall out of the sky and it made no sound at all.  I would say it was as big as two 747's width wise and one and a half long Fact because of the low cloud.  The hairs all over my body stood on end and I even felt worried that something on the url might have seen me.   The only reason I am writing this now is because I have been watching a lot of ufo videos lately and decided to type in ""boomerang shaped ufo"" in on Google images just now and I could not be live how many pictures (computer animated/drawn)were on there that were the same as what I had seen!.  It was not curved like a boomerang but the same general shape and it had lighter circles on the nose and three more down each side which are the same as the other sightings I have seen in pictures but other people seem to draw/say that these were lights where I could just nearly make out the difference from the colour of the rest of it.it really was a scary moment and I'm really glad I could share it with people coz until now I have not said a word to anybody in case they took the Mick.

It was so close to the vehicle that the car was lite up like a foot ball field.

It was so bright that in the rear view mirror I could see the entire road lite up like a giant spot light beaming down.   Approximately 1/2 mile from our driveway the light took  off at a high rate of speed off to the right.  We sighed not hardly believing what we had seen. I pulled into driveway and dropped my mom off stayed in the car with my grandson and then I backed out to go home I live on the point of the mountain a lil bit behind my moms house.  There are 4 mountains with a large L shaped ravine  between them.   Not even 1 minute after backing out off to the left below tree tops the ravine was lit up it was back.

A triangular shaped vessel greater in length than any aircraft carrier this submariner ever saw, passed stealthily over the tree canopy not more than 500’ to 700’.  With the exception of bow and stern light, there wasn’t a peep coming from this vessel, not even an engine roar.  Even the owls, coyotes, blue heron and frogs took note of its presence as all went silent.  The city lights were just enough to unveil the outline of the craft but not enough to identify any markings indicating origin.   As it passed overhead heading east towards Everett from Whidbey Island, I raced to an open meadow to witness this magnificent event with greater clarity.  I know what I saw.  I just don’t know who sent it. The next day I waited patiently for the subject to air on the radio and nothing would be said.

My mother had a strange encounter on 05APR2015, at 2AM Eastern Time, in Harrodsburg, KY.  She heard a strange sound that was so loud she went outside onto her back porch to investigate further, and the video she took of it did the volume of the sound no justice. 	Upon walking outside with her phone in hand, she immediately saw a UFO in the distance, then started to record.  When you watch the video, look closely to the left of the building. This building has lights around it, but the UFO is obvious after you study the video a bit.  You will see a light in the night sky moving erratically and can easily come to the conclusion that this UFO isn’t any known aircraft.  Soon after capturing the UFO on camera, it takes off.  The acceleration alone is astonishing.  After it takes off you will see two bright lights appear over the building in the distance, so keep your eye over the building when my mother tries to follow the first UFO.  This may possibly be military trying to follow the UFO.  They sort of fade in and out so I'm not certain it is man made aircraft, and right before she’s done filming, the original UFO caught on camera, enters back the frame close to it’s original location at about 43 seconds into the minute video. 	Also, all the while she is filming this sighting, you hear the odd horn type noise in the background.  She checked the next day with local officials, and there was no kind of emergency alarms or any other testing of alarm systems in the area.  Also it was a clear night with no storm systems in the area. 	I would much like to hear your opinion on the matter. I myself don’t fall into the category of being a believer of extraterrestrial life per say, though I am skeptical and even more so now.  The reason I wanted your opinion on the matter is because clearly you are more educated on UFO sightings.  Not only am I interested in the lights in the sky, but also the noise in the background.  If you look into this, if you already haven’t, you can find numerous video’s from around the world hearing that eerie sound in the footage.  Check them out and also my mother's video posted on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5gdG06iXbE  Keep in mind, I noticed if I viewed the video on my computer, the UFO that moves back and forth seems very blurry.  It may be due to the quality of the monitor on my PC.

At approximately 10:15pm Sunday evening, July 26th, 2015, my friend and I came up to my rooftop to have dessert and watch the sky.  As I sat down at the table, my friend was looking East and brought to my attention an unusually bright, red light.  Flying from the eastern sky from my rooftop perspective in downtown Toronto in a northerly direction were 2 objects with very large red lights.  What was different about these two objects were the lights, initially.  There was only one color and one light on the flying object unlike the airplanes passing overhead, which at that time the sky was very busy with air traffic compared to most evenings. The red light was a much deeper, denser, fuller red than the airplanes passing by.  It did not have a flashing or strobe-like quality as I’d normally describe the airplane light flashing on and off.  It was more like a slower turn-on, turn off quality to it, like a fade-up and down compared to the more abrupt flash on and off of the planes. The larger size red light was perhaps 4 to 6 times bigger than the plane lights overhead that were taking off in the distance from the West.  The smaller red light was around the size of a plane’s flashing light but at that distance I would guess it is larger, but only slightly. I could not determine if it was attached to a solid object or if it was just light.  My guess was that it may be attached to something but I could not see it at night, though the airplanes above the city can be seen unless they are extremely high.  I also should comment that there was a lot of energy in the air, as if there was a lot going on energetically in the city at that time whereas when the lights disappeared into the eastern sky, the buzz and activity overhead quieted down to a normal Sunday night feeling for 10:30pm. There were lots of planes passing overhead with red lights flashing on their left wings.  This was the usual flight path I see nightly. I’d describe this as a flash on and flash off, and very bright.  Bright because it seems like a white light beneath a red casing, like on a police car.  The red of the 2 unknown lights didn’t have that quality.  They were a much deeper, saturated red without white in the brightness of it. The planes overhead range in altitude between 2000 ft for the smaller craft and 5-10 thousand and much higher for the commercial jets.  By contrast, the UAP was first noticed in the Eastern sky flying North at approx 5-7 thousand feet.  There were two of them.  One was either smaller, just in front of the larger red light, or it was moving parallel to the larger red light but farther away in the distance, thus appearing smaller.  The small red light on the first craft, which initially made me think it was a lot farther away, had a red light slightly larger than the one on the plane flying over my rooftop even though I’d guess it was flying 5000 feet high and about 5-10 kilometers away.  The larger red light, which flew slightly behind the first one, was perhaps the size of the 4 or more lights on the plane. No other flashing or pulsing color was visible, like on an airplane.  One light, deep red, and with a slow on and off quality, not like the strobing quality of the airplanes.  There were also a few moments where the on-off quality of the red light was irregular, as if disappearing altogether and then appearing on the same path in the sky but farther ahead.  In the darkness of the evening and the distance from where I observed the lights, I could not determine if the lights were attached to a solid craft or not. As the two objects flew North, it looked like the smaller one continued north and the larger one turned left sharply towards the west.  The object banked a very strong left turn. The smaller red light in front seemed to continue north for a few seconds, but it then disappeared from our vision.  As the larger red light made its sharp turn, it sort of did a zig-zag move, or an “S” shape turn before continuing north of the city but in a westerly direction.  Also within seconds of that “S” shaped turn, I noticed a very bright white- blue flash in the sky in the North, not much more than 1/2 inch distance in the sky from the red light.  This bright flash seemed to me to be larger in an up/down size than wide, resembling a slit of some sort but it was extremely fast in its flash with no lingering quality.  I assume it was a meteorite. As the larger red light continued towards the west in the sky north of the city approximately under the Big Dipper now, we noticed that the little red light was there again, just slightly in front.  We questioned one another about how it could have reached and caught up to the large red light since they seemed to veer off in different directions at the point in photo 2 where the large red light made its turn from the northeast towards the west.  The little red light just appeared.  This time it was moving ever so slightly in front of the larger red light as they were now heading south but in the western sky from my rooftop vantage point, which for people from Toronto would be in the direction of the International airport now.  They were moving at a speed faster than the jets flying overhead, perhaps twice the speed as the jets were coming in and taking off from Pearson International Airport to the west of the city from my location. As the 2 red lights continued south they again banked left or towards the east, as if doing a large circle around the city perimeter.  As we looked to the south sky as the small and large red lights made their way east, the angle or distance between the 2 red lights gave the appearance as if they were almost touching, with no space between them.  At that point I ran downstairs to my condo for my camera but when I came back up, they disappeared into the eastern sky where we first noticed them.  I looked at my watch and it was 10:27pm. Perhaps 5-8 minutes later than when we first saw them. I go up to my rooftop almost every evening to observe the sky, sometimes with my star chart to see where the different planets are or even the satellites passing overhead, which I have photographed on my iPhone.  In all the years I have been living here and observing the plane routes and stars overhead, I have never seen red lights of that kind on a craft before.  Thus this report and the curiosity to know if other sightings from Toronto were reported about 2 deep red lights circling the city from a 5 to 10 km radius of the center of the city where I was located.  By chance, a friend who lives by Lake Ontario in Toronto told me he was walking his dog and many people by the beach commented on seeing red lights as well. Assuming Toronto is roughly 25 miles in diameter the distance traveled would be a circle of the city = 157 miles. If 15 min. it would be 628 miles per hour. If 10 min it would be 924 mph., which would have given off a sonic boom if it was a conventional aircraft. As it was closer to a 5 – 7 minute sighting, that would make it between 1386 and 1617mph. I don’t believe it was that fast. Perhaps the circle circumference was a tighter diameter. Assuming a tighter diameter (20 Miles) for the circle circumference = 125 miles a 15 min trip = 500 mph 10 min = 750 mph which is right around the speed of sound but still under. At 6 min and 20 mile diameter speed = 1250 mph I guessed the speed to be twice or more times the speed of the jets flying in all directions overhead. And that is my red light sighting.",2015-08-27T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

I was on a two-hour flight from the east coast, to go to my grandmother’s funeral.  I was sitting in the row directly behind the first-class passenger seats on the right side of the plane in the window seat.  Since I was on a smaller flight, this put my seat to where I was able to see clearly outside the window and still be able to see the front of the wing. 	During the majority of the time of the flight, I put my ear buds in and napped, as I usually do.  About 20 minutes before landing, a bell went off waking me up.  The bell was followed by an announcement, which caused me to remove my ear buds.  The announcement said to please close the windows as the craft prepared to descend.  Once this was said, the lights inside had dimmed. 	I have been on many flights before and really thought nothing of this. I figured maybe the announcement to do so, was a courtesy to others who might still be resting, or due to the summer heat in order to keep the plane cool when it had landed.  Regardless of what was said I kept window open, and watched the sights of the plane as it prepared to land. 	About twenty seconds of looking at the flooding of the many creeks and rivers of the area, I witnessed five shiny silver “tear drop/saucer” shaped objects in a formation of four on the bottom and one on top.  Each one was the same size, looking about the size of a mini van, but I could not tell how far away they were.  They looked as if they were floating, but due to how fast the plane was going, they had to be moving at some sort of slightly slower speed than the plane. 	I was definitely stunned and confused at what I had just seen, and looked at the businessman next to me, who just shrugged his shoulders.",2015-08-27T00:00:00,41.59971620416253,-93.61890936570863

Downtown Toronto, ONTARIO, Canada  12:08am -  For a distance that I would say is no more than 6-inches across the sky, tracking in a linear direction of a West to East direction but in the sky north of Avenue and Davenport Rd roof top location, we noticed a round, thick white light turning on and off to a rhythm of “on” for a count of 1 and 2 and, “off” 3 and 4 and, “on” 5 and 6 and 7 and off 8 and 9 and for a total of 5 “on” lights all together.  What is totally strange for me is that at 3 “on”s   I flashed on my green starlight laser and when I flashed it through the dark from 3 black 4 black and 5 it turned off but seemed to move faster for a moment and out of sight.  The size of the light was bigger than a commercial jet’s frontal high beam light coming towards someone, yet was lit from underneath, not in the forward direction.  Also, the light beneath it was somewhat subdued and not as bright as the planes in the distance flashing as they moved off in all directions.  In terms of size, from my rooftop it seemed ! to measure about 3mm in the sky above.  That it seemingly immediately reacted to my laser when I flashed at it was outstanding. 12:24am - Travelling from NW towards the moon in a SE direction (north of Avenue and Davenport again) was a cylinder shaped object tumbling or spinning in a clock-wise direction in almost a slow motion-like momentum, much like one would expect to see in space, yet close enough for us to see it with our naked eyes even though it was night, traveling within a halo of very soft, subtle and subdued light.  The object seemed to be illumined with a subdued, washed-out amber and green light.  It looked like the cylinder was a 4:1 ratio of length to width. In the sky it measured approximately 5mm and with the halo closer to 7mm in diameter.  It was lower than the clouds but higher than the jets flying east, taking off from the airport.  I pointed my green laser and could see the object get hit from the beam a number of times, much like I could see the laser hit the side of a building in the distance with a focused dot.  The cylinder’s surface seemed like it was a reflective surface judgi! ng by the green lazar’s clear visibility.  The cylinder disappeared from view as it got closer to the full moon’s brightness heading towards Lake Ontario.  From when we first noticed it until it was no longer obvious to the eye was about 2-minutes.  No phone or camera was with us. We noticed both objects roughly in the same area of the sky, initially, though they traveled in different directions. It was a very electric energy that awakened and excited us.  This is my 3rd unknown flying object sighting in a week and each time they were witnessed with the same friend.  I wonder if she is the reason why because I have never had a sighting before this, except once, caught on camera in Joshua Tree, CA, in June 2015.  The lights leave me curious but the cylinder object tumbling and spinning is very exciting and highly strange.",2015-08-27T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

I left a brief message on the phone line on Aug. 14th at approx. 15:30. On the evening of Aug. 7, 2015, my wife and I were sitting on our sofa watching tv and of course had the air conditioning running full blast because we have had six weeks in a row of 90 degree or higher temps every day with very little rain.  It's hot even at night.  Having these items on makes alot of noise in the house so it is a bit difficult to hear what is going on outside.   That being said, we began to hear a noise that we could not identify.  It was a pulsating noise , fairly loud that can best be described as moaning and gringing and almost like the sound that the alien crafts made in the new version of the movie war of the worlds.  It was very creepy for sure.  Just about the time we were aknowledging to each other that we heard this sound, an extremely, and I mean extremely loud jet engine noise came roaring out of the northeast, came right over our house, but did not pass by as a plane normally would.  Instead it stayed for at least 10 to 15 seconds, then slowly moved away to the west just a bit.   Our home is located in Metairie, Louisiana, about 15 miles to the West of New Orleans and the New Orleans Louis Armstrong Airport is about 5 miles due West of us.  This sound scared us to death.  We both instinctively ducked down as we thought for sure a plane was going to crash into our house.  I ran out my back door as my wife ran to the front of our house to look out of our bedroom window.  When I got in my yard and looked up I saw absolutely nothing, but could still hear very lound jet engine noise like that of an F-16 fighter.   I am retired from a 32 year career with a major airline here in New Oleans and have been around jet aircraft all my life.  I know what an airliner sounds like and I know what one would sound like just normally on approach to land at the airport.  This was NOT an airliner.  I also know that military craft are not allowed to do routine training over a dense populated neighborhood such as ours and if they fly over at all the ceilin! g should be around 1500 feet or so.  Knowing these facts as I d! o, I sti ll could not identify what it was I was hearing.  The pulsating sound could still be heard and the jet engine sound was now moving back and forth from East to West and West to East as if fighter jets were chasing each other.   Not being able to see anything from the back yard, I ran back inside to find my wife shaking and scared to death looking out the window.  She still could not see anything, but told me that the pulsating noise was really scaring her.I stayed with her for a few minutes and then ran out to my front yard. Now it really got interesting.  Once in the front I could see more sky but still not any craft at all in the sky.  My UFO witness report does not come from a sighting but rather a ""hearing"". the pulsating noise got lounder and then softer as if to pulsate in and out or back and forth.  The jet engine noise was so load that I was waiting to see an explosion and fireball any second figuring that what ever it was had to be in trouble or out of control.   All of the dogs in the neighborhood were barking and the cats were screming.  The sounds gradually drifted further west toward the airport and started to sound as if they were going in a huge circle just like a ferrous wheel would do.  And as the sound circled it still got loud then soft......when we first heard the jet noise I would estimate that it was no more than 200 feet off the ground.   I was shaking in fear so bad that my knees buckled and I almost fell to the ground.  Very very slowly this grouping of sounds drifted more to the West, until they faded out of my hearing.  I slowly managed to walk myself back inside to consult with my wife. We sat down and compared what we had experienced but neither of us had the composure to call the police or anyone to report this.  I tried to contact a couple of neighbors by text not wanting to wake anyone with a phone call at 11pm but got no responses. I run a small lawn business since I retired from the airlines, and most of my customers are in a 10 mile radius of our house.  As I saw them during this week, I asked them all the same question and only got the first few words out before every single one of them without fail stopped me by instantly blurting out almost identical stories.  I would ask, ""Oh, by the way, last Friday night around 10:30 did........"" and that is where I would get cut off.  ALL of them would then say the same thing...I heard a very strange noinse, I thought a jet was going to crash into my house, I heard a weird pulsating noise, and I was too scared to evern go outside to see what it was....... I have spoken to over 15 people now and all are verly puzzled by this event.  Two women actually did see something and they described it as follows. ""We saw what appeared to be 5 F-16 fighter jets flying in CRAZY , INSANE PATTERNS.......""  Hmmmm.  When I told one of my sons who now lives out of town he told me that a friend of his who lives near us, on two different occasions in the past year, has seen orange globes in the night sky flying in a triangle pattern over our neighborhood....... I know from my background in the aviation industry that military jets are not supposed to fly over our houses that low.  I also know that when they would practice touch and go at the airport it would be two of them in a pair but never five all at the same time.  Calendar Air Force Base is about 20 miles from our house in Belle Chase, Louisiana, and could have sent up the jets. I reported this to my councilman since it happened in the air space over his district, but I have not heard any response from him.  I also reported to a local news channel but have not heard a thing back from them.  Regardless of wether or not I get responses back from them, I do know that five F-16 don't just buzz rooftops and fly in crazy insane patterns over residential areas as a matter of daily training or normal missions.  But yet there they were, flying in a frenzy over our heads for some reason.  What were they chasing?",2015-08-27T00:00:00,29.998805633802814,-90.17318112676055

I was in camp alone, approximately 50 feet from the northern shore of the lake. At approximately 9:30, as I was speaking on the phone, I saw a light source over the lake.  It had no discernable shape, but was fairly ""large"" as point light sources go; lacking any other external clues, I would estimate it at no more than a hundred yards from me.  It was reddish, but not the ""stoplight"" red of aircraft signals, having a distinct purple/pink tinge.  It made no sound and moved quite slowly, but there were two small course changes; the night was essentially still at ground level, so there was no significant wind for it to be moving against.  I watched it for approximately three minutes, mentioning it to my conversational partner, before it abruptly disappeared. At first I thought it was an airplane, but it was too large and the wrong color.  It was also the wrong color to be a live flame, as in a floating lantern, and seemed to be course-correcting under its own power.  Of course, I had no good size cues to judge from, so my estimate of its distance may be extremely off and the lack of noise may have been because it was simply too far away.  At this point, my best hypothesis is a toy drone; though those were specifically disallowed by the rules of the special event, people have been known to break the rules.",2015-08-27T00:00:00,,

Time: Approximately 2100hours Witnessed by Three aduklts and three children. My wife and a daughter along with three grandchildren were swimming in our pool on Saturday night August 8th, 2015, at approximately 2100 hours.  I was coming outside to see how everyone was doing and was not in the swimming pool with everyone at that time. My youngest grand daughter who is five noticed what she saw was a shooting star, about that same time I noticed several reddish/orange balls of light.  At first there was only three which I thought were unusual and the I noticed three more just above tree level off at a distance.  It was hard to tell the distance since it was night and there were some clouds in the sky. I asked what everyone just saw and they said almost the same thing I had just witnessed myself, I went inside and retrieved a pair of binoculars and tried to get a better look at them and they were still fuzzy.  I tried my cell phone camera and it would not take a picture because it was to far away. The lights moved several times one in and out of the clouds and another made a drop and joined the other three lights above tree level after about two-three minutes two lights moved off into the distance and the other four lights left as well two of the appeared to vanish.  There are no military areas where we live however there are some strip mining areas in the area.  Some of the property is owed by AEP and was a wildlife area until it was closed off this past year and signs were placed to keep people out do to sinkholes in the area. The ages of all the witnesses are 60, 58, 31,13, 9, and 5. Myself, I am a retired male age 60 who has been trained over the past 42 years to observe the unusual after being in the Marine Corps and being an ex deputy sheriff as well as a private investigator and correctional officer and a contract security officer for homeland security. One thing I can add to this report is the way the lights in the sky acted.  They moved around like no aircraft or helicopter I have ever seen, and had a reddish/orange glow to them, which if checked with any federal regulations on aircraft lighting is highly improper.

I looked over and saw what he was talking about.  At first I thought that some business must be projecting lights into the sky to draw attention. When I said that to him, he said, “Just look at it.  If it was a business projecting that light, wouldn’t you be able to see the beams coming from below?”   I sat there for a moment and watched this ring. I looked over at my boyfriend and asked him if he thought that the ring seemed to be moving closer to us.  He agreed with me.  As we sat and watched this ring, I noticed that it seemed to be illuminating from inside the ring.  I went in and got my phone so I could take a photo and hope to capture the light.  I came back out and started to take photos.  Unfortunately, the photos do not show the enormity and brightness of this ring.   I live close to an airport, and was able to take a photo of a plane flying near this illuminating ring.  The longer I sat and looked at the ring, the more I convinced myself that there had to be a logical explanation for it.

The lights probably were from the casino.  PD)) I am submitting this in response to the report about the halo of lights seen by multiple people in the Minneapolis area on or around the date of August 9, 2015.  I heard about the sightings last night (8/13/15) on Coast to Coast AM, and, since I live in the Twin Cities area, I was of course very interested in these sightings and went to your site to view the photos and read the reports. Upon viewing the pictures, I could not figure out what the lights might be from, nor could my husband.  We were both very intrigued. Later today, however, as luck would have it, I was perusing various Facebook pages dedicated to another (local) interest of mine, namely the musical artist, Prince.  When I saw the photos on your site of the halo of lights, it didn't jog my memory about a particular photo that was posted to Prince's band's official Twitter on that same night of the other reports of the halo:  August 9, 2015.  But one of the Facebooks I saw today had posted the photo and well...I think I have an answer for you as to the source of that halo of lights. Here is the link to the Tweet and photo posted to Prince's official Twitter: https://twitter.com/Prince3EG/status/630615331308830720?s=04    As I read through the comments, I saw that many people said the halo of lights was from an illuminated teepee display at a nearby casino, Mystic Lake Casino.  Paisley Park Studios, Mystic Lake Casino and the area the other reports came from (if I heard correctly last night on the radio) are all relatively near proximity and also if it was an overcast night, the lights would likely be seen a distance away as well (I'd think, anyway). A quick bit of research by my husband, using Google Earth and Google Images, shows that, in my opinion, the comments about the halo of lights coming from that teepee are likely correct.  I will email images for your convenience, but if you would like also to check for yourself as well, merely put search terms ""Mystic Lake Casino"" into Google Images and it will pull up these same pictures, and more. I hope I have helped.  I enjoy your reports on Coast to Coast AM very much.",2015-08-27T00:00:00,44.98078334423014,-93.29330787839163

All of a sudden we start seeing a very bright light in the sky jumping around all over the place like a bouncy ball in the sky, nothing our crafts can do, as we are watching it, a HUGE disk-like object appeared out of no-where and accelerated at a speed i have never seen in my life.It was completely quiet, extremely close, and lit the entire sky and surrounding area up like day light when it took off.  It took off so fast from a dead stop that it left a tracer of itself momentarily and had almost a plasma looking tail coming off he end of it, and in a flash it was gone, leaving a trail behind it which lingered for a moment. It shot off towards FT. Lewis, SW direction, and lit the ENTIRE sky when it did.  However, it was faced almost in a downward direction when it took off, and looked like it could have landed in the FT. Lewis woods.  Almost immediately afterwards, the sky lit up with unmarked helicopters which searched the back woods of Ft. Lewis for HOURS.  They were definately looking for something, thry flew extremely low and had no lights or markers on, could only see the red blink of a safety light occasionally and you could hear the thunderous engines of the helicopters working overtime all night.  We also noticed that almost right after the ""ufo crash"" or whatever it may have been, there were bright dots in the sky which would randomly show up, do some extremely crazy aeirial acrobatics, then appear to fade away.  One of them came extremely close, and was bright as a spotlight, it was a completely round, extremely bright, white light that seemed to scan the area.  I also think it's important to document that both my daughter, my girlfriend, and I kept feeling as though we were being watched, even before te sighting when we were just watching the meteor shower, and when the craft first appeared, it did seem to appear out of no-where.  I have seen MANY meteor showers, as have my daughter and girlfriend.  What we saw WAS NOT A METEOR, nor were the other objects.  We also noticed more military planes and helicopters in the sky as the night went on, all neglecting to put on their main lights, just a couple red lights keep from having mid air collisions.  I finally went to bed at a.m., and I could still hear the helicopters  searching for whatever.  It is important to note that there was not a single military vehicle in the air or area until literally RIGHT after the UFO sighting, all neighborhood dogs were going absolutely CRAZY.  It was as if this thing un-cloaked itself and went into warp speed right in front of us.  It was absoutely incredible, and I will NEVER forget what we saw last night for the rest of my life.  Being during a meteor shower, I'm sure everyone will write it off as a meteor, but we know what we saw, and so does the military apparently, and that was NO METEOR.

((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain as to whether this is a serious-minded report.  We have written the source of the report, requesting confirmation as to whether it is a hoax.  PD)) Right, okay, so this isn't a UFO sighting as such but something that happened to me a few weeks ago, now i have only told one other person and have not gone to the police or anything because well they won't really do anything.  So im hoping that people on here will have some answers to what actually happened and if it will keep happening. A couple weeks ago i was having a really stressful day, and thought that i would take a drive up to a hill where i normally go walking or to chill out.  Now this hill is out the way of people and so is quite remote but there are a few farm houses about.  I was sat in my car just strolling on my phone when i caught something in the corner off my eye, as first i thought it was nothing more than a cow or some people going for a walk but the longer i stared the more my mind just couldn't make out what it was.  Now the area is flat with a few walls and bushes about so it was not a tree or a pole or anything else that may cause my eyes to play tricks on me.  Whatever it was just crouched there and stared at me, i just sat frozen to my chair, it then stood up on two legs, and with that another creature stood up next to it, i was just frozen and was unable to move and as much as i tried i could not stop staring. They both walking up around the back off my car and next thing i know i am stood outside my car face to face with them, Now they must of been about 7ft tall each, they had long slim bodies with long skinny limbs and heads not much bigger than ours, with eyes similar to ours but with a yellow look and glow to them and they was the same colour as a dolphin.  One off them just stood in the background while the other one was stood in front of me, my body felt really fuzzy and it was something had never experienced in my life, i could also feel a warmth sort of like a wave of heat hitting me.  The one being in front of me held out his hand and both of them where exchanging noises that was like a monotone humming with a popping sound every 2 seconds or so.   He then looked at me and began speaking but i couldn't understand what was being said.  But for some reason the sounds began to translate to english in my head and they where saying ""no harm no harm no harm"" it was like they where translating the words to English in my head for me. I didn't know how to react when its hand was out stretched but for some reason i felt the urge to hold out mine and grab it, it put its hand on mine and the next part was just a blur and next thing i know i woke up outside my car and 12 hours had passed. i just cant explain that bit because i have never been able to sleep that long in my life even when i am really tired.  When i got home i just didnt know what to make off it and honestly i was just hoping it was a bad dream because this is something i cant even begin to explain. I have gone over this scenario so many times in my head since it happened but non of it makes sense. I have had strange nose bleeds and lapses of time that have just gone missing from my day that i cannot explain, i dont do drugs and i do not drink stupid amounts of alcohol, i am a normal person who plays sports and works, and i cant add this together.  I have now had 3 nights where i will wake up early in the morning and hear the monotone noise in my head and feel that warm glow and fuzzy feeling and i have now got two strange marks on my body on both of my collar bones. Please someone must have some answers but these creatures match no descriptions of anything and the last conclusion i want is to say that they where aliens but this is the only explanation i can come up with, I have been reading reports and have come across two other experiences which match that of mine, please someone must have some answers because it is getting to the point where i am scared they will come back, i never seen any flashing lights in the sky or anything and never have and the only signs i am getting or this weird feelings in my body followed by this constant missing of time. Also which is strange is that my cat wont come into my room anymore and they are normally dead friendly but when ever i pick them up or go to stroke them they just run like something about me is scaring them away but seem to fine with everyone else. Someone must know something and be able to help.",2015-08-27T00:00:00,,

Summary:  At 9:30 PM Eastern, 8/12/2015, several adults & children  observed rectangular shaped objects glowing orange in color moving along a straight flight path from N/NW to S/SE direction.  Location was eastern shore of Brantingham Lake, town of Greig, Lewis county, New York State, approximate Latitude of 43.7 & Longitude of 75.28.  Similar objects were observed the following 2 nights at approximately the same time along the same flight path.  Each night was calm, no precipitation, temperature in the 60s.  Several IPhone photos and videos were taken. Details:  At approximately  9:18 PM Eastern on  8/12/2015, we observed first object  overhead, directly above, traveling at constant rate of speed.  Was observed for approximately one minute until out of view  out of view to the S/SE.  See photograph 1 at 9:18 PM  taken from an I Phone 6. 5  minutes latter a second object, same size & color moving along the same flight path and at the same speed was observed  in the N/NW sky that went overhead and then out of sight a minute later to the S/SE.  See Photograph 2  at 9:23 PM from an IPhone 6. Also a number of videos were made of the first 2 objects . Then approx. 4 minutes later a third object was observed identical to the first two but smaller in size.  No sounds were made.  There were no other observable aircraft  or objects in the sky.  Observed by 5 adults and several children. At approximately 9:17 PM Eastern on 8/13/2015, the first object was observed in the S/SE sky traveling in the OPPOSITE direction but along the approximately  SAME flight path as the objects observed on 8/12/2015.  See Video at 9:17 PM 8/13/2015. See Photographs at 9:18. A second object was observed at 9:24 PM. See photographs at 9:24 and video at 9:25 PM. This second object was larger than any of the previously observed objects but all other facets are the same (color,speed, shape). See Photographs at 9:25.  A third object (the same size as the first object that night  and all the same characteristics as the first object)   was observed at 9:37 PM. At approximately 9 PM, the first of 3 objects was observed moving along a flight path somewhat close to the previous 2 nights but in the SAME direction as the first night (8/12/2015) N/NW to S/SE.  See video from 8/14/2015.  A photograph with a traditional shutter camera was taken of the 2nd object observed.  The shape appears to be a glowing rectangle however the detailed zoomed photo shows differently: an orange ‘line’ in the shape of a backwards S.  Again, no sounds observed.  There were no objects observed on 8/15/2015. We left the camp Sunday 8/216/2015. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2015-08-27T00:00:00,,

UFO sighting 12 AG, 2015.  Shortly after 10:00 PM, CDT, I went outside on the south end of my house to watch the Perseid shower.  My chair was facing east and I was rocked back and looking mostly overhead.   Within a few minutes I noticed a northbound object.  I knew this was not any kind of normal craft. Probably within five seconds the white ""craft"" blanked out, reappeared and then browned out completely.  OK, that was really an eye catcher.  The object, actually in four parts, had passed west of Deneb in Cygnus and toward the small constellation Lacerta.  The object truly hit me a little humorously, as a design that might have been from Star Trek's Walt Jeffries. Pondering for a couple of minutes, I noticed a jet coming out of the north northwest.  Within seconds it was overhead and I noticed a white ""rectangular"" light in about the same area where the jet came from.  At first I thought maybe the International Space Station.  A second look seemed to show my original sighting object in a right hand profile below but with no distinct separation of the light.  Describing a subtle rising arc, it was south of Polaris and heading east toward Epsilon Cassiopeiae.   Enough!  I took the few steps into the house to grab my 20 X 80 binocs.  And true to form, it had disappeared. Time was ~10:15 CDT for the first sighting, and at the very most, five minutes total for the entire event. There were no lights of any kind on the objects. No beams or rays. Overall, a not so intense white. No noise whatsoever. Relative size for both, a nail of the small finger held at arm's length. The second sighting seemed to show a very slight haze around its entirety. Were not birds or as one suggested, a drone!

I took a double look thinking it was moving but it was sitting in mid air.  The reason I noticed the thing in the first place was the running lights.  The running lights were two colors red and white.  They ran around the edge of the ship .   The UFO was no more than hundred yards away and about forty feet off the ground.  I could see the shape of the ship without any mistake what it was.  The ship tilted down slightly on its right side and started to move sideways for a city block or so and stopped.

There was no vehicle they hiked to the top of the mountain,Canada,BC,1982-06-30T00:00:00,,,"Occurred : 6/30/1982  Reported: 9/4/2015 1:27:02 PM 13:27 Posted: 9/11/2015 Location: Canada, BC Shape:  Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/121/S121677.html,"There was no vehicle they hiked to the top of the mountain The photo was taken in the early 1980's ..the woman is an old girlfriend of the person who took the photo and they are at the top of a mountain in B.C. The photo was taken with a 35 ml. camera the original nothing has been altered whatsoever. If you look through a magnifying glass and use your imagination you can see little people. I'm not sure what the orange blobs are and I don't know if they were visable to the woman or the man who took the photo as they are no longer living.  I found the photo in an pld photo album there was hundreds of mountain shots but only one with the orange balls. It's almost as if they are not completely iin this demension ..but thats just a thought. Hopefully, someone will have a better explanation.",2015-09-11T00:00:00,,
