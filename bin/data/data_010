I saw two very bright white lights to the east.  The moon was out and almost full. Above these two were a circle of approximately 10-12 smaller lights creating a semi-circle above and then appox 4-5 more to the north creating a ""tail.""  There was a lot of interactive light activity going back and forth between all of the lights, creating what appeared to be lines of light.  There was also unusual movement of some of the lights (up, down, left, right) which confirmed to me that these were not airplanes, satellites or the Russian Muir Station which was in the night sky.  I went in the house to find binoculars and when I came out, the two main lights dropped behind the mountains at amazing speed and simultaneously.  The remaining lights also dropped behind the mts.  Then a massive group of lights rose up above the mts in a horizontal oval shape.  At this point, my daughter who's 6 and my husband came home from their evening walk.  I pointed out the cluster of lights and they witnessed the remainder of what I describe.  The cluster of lights looked like a galaxy, but very organized.  Occasionally a light would blink or twinkle.  The mass of lights then proceeded to move to the south in a collective, organized manner.  They moved faster than the rotation of the earth.  They then stopped.  They dropped below the mountains and we could barely see the glow of the lights on the horizon.  Then two bright lights moved above the horizon and stayed for a bit.  Then dropped back below the horizon.  The collective group then all rose above the horizon and created a side portrait of a jet airplane (tail, body and cockpit).  The mass of lights stayed there for a few minutes then dropped below the horizon.  They then fazed in and out, up and down from the horizon until they finally disappeared completely below the horizon.  The evening was mostly clear with a few scattered clouds.  The area is rural and city light is extremely minimal.  The moon was very bright, but not enough to deter the visibility of what we saw. My ! husband and I are college educated (Univ of Wash).  I have witnessed other paranormal activity, but never felt compelled to report it.  I consider us to be normal, professional people.  We all felt the experience to be really eery and it bothered my daughter quite a bit.  I also noticed that a lot of dogs in the neighborhood were whining.

It eventually moved farther away in the sky untill it was just one light in the sky. The object was close enough when I first saw it to see some detail.  It had a triagle shape. Lights came from the three angles of it's triangle shape.  The light it omitted was white like a star, however at the angles of the object the light was a golden yellow color.  The object kept moving away from me in a north east direction in the sky.  While hovering away it would move in circles and figure eight motions.

I live on the bluff above the North Everett waterfront.  This evening I had a clear view of the south end of Whidbey Island and the Olympic Mountains behind.  I was watching the sky from my window and saw a streak of light that appeared to be moving very slowly at an angle of 25-35 degrees in a southerly direction.  I looked at it through my 8X binoculars, when I first saw the streak and it was near the middle of the field of view with the lower edge of the field on the water/Whidbey Island edge. (I don't know if that is helpful - it's a way to locate raptors for birdwatchers.) I was able to watch the streak through my spotting scope which has a zoom lens 20X to 50X, and it looked like dense orange burning gasses getting less dense toward the end, but not fading very much.  I could see no object associated with this streak of light, just the look of roiling, burning gasses.  It did not leave a trail as it moved, but moved as one entity.  As the streak was moving toward then behind the mountains, it passed an adjacent mountain peak, possibly Mt. Olympus.  The streak was about 2/3 the size of the silouetted slope of that mountain peak, so it must have been very large.  Mt. Olympus is about 70-80 miles away as the crow flies from Everett.  I am not sure about the length of time of the observation, but I had time to get my binoculars across the room, watch through my binoculars for a short while, go across the room, get my spotting scope set up, find the streak in my scope, which took a little while because I could no longer see it with my naked eye and had to check again with my binoculars to get a location, and watched the streak until it went behind the mountains.  I work for Snohomish County Surface Water Management as a watershed steward for the Snohomish River basin.  I have never seen anything like this before.  One more thing, it probably moving westerly as well since at first I could see it without optics, then it must have gotten farther away since I could only find it again by using my binoculars.",1999-10-02T00:00:00,47.92466490727532,-122.21939985734664

My family and I were just coming around the curve were rt35 conects with I70w and I saw an unusual light off to my left (sw). It appeared to be a plane at first but only one yellow/white light and no other colored blinking lights.  I noticed my wife in the passenger seat looking at it also.  About the time I was rounding the entrance ramp omto I70w, I noticed it had formed a short tail of fire or sparks.  From the direction of the tail (angled upward and to the right) it looked to be falling like a meteor, but much, much slower.  My wife and I were comenting and speculating to each other about what we were seeing, this all while I was merging into busy intersate traffic.  I continued to watch and look for a good spot to pull over at the same time.  As I continued to observe the object it did not appear to be falling! but instead the short tail slowly changed position around the ball of light, making it look like it was now spinning very slowly. The trees along the roadside made it hard to see and we lost sight of it several times, but I finally pulled over and grabbed my video camera.  As I rolled my window down and started filming, the tail was gone and it just appeared as a ball of light again.  Frustrated because I was having trouble focusing on the object, I pulled the camera down and my wife and I observed the object nearing the tree line which seemed to be several miles away.  Just before it reached the tree line the ball disappeared and a large triangle formation of orange lights appeared pointing torward the southwest.  We only saw this formation for a few seconds then it dropped beyond our view.  Setting there as the trucks rushed by discussing what we just saw, I recall seeing a second triangle fromation in front of the first pointing at the first, almost forming an x.  My wi! fe states she saw a line of lights coming from the front of the V.  Re gardless, the V formation was made up of nine lights, four on each side of the center one.  All lights appeared to be the same intensity.

About 15 of us left the warmth of the fire to go and see. What we saw were three bright lights, very high in the sky - and traveling in a triangle shaped formation. They were about as bright as venus gets or brighter than most all of the surrounding stars. We noticed stars in-between the objects so it definitely seemed like three distinct crafts. They traveled together, but the shape of the triangle would change from equilateral, to right, and back again. We watched the objects for about 5-10 minutes as they traveled in a north to south direction. Nobody had binoculars, so all we could make out was the bright white glow they made. Based on the height, we guessed the objects must have been very large though. My brother, holding a flashlight, tried doing the SOS signal to the objects. About 30 seconds after he started flashing them, the three objects suddenly blinked out and never reappeared.",1999-09-12T00:00:00,46.3558,-91.1336

Outside the window of my apartment, I sighted at 07:15, 12-9-98, a bright, shimmering, orange colored massive object(1)descending at a moderately fast controlled rate on a straight path to earth. Hard to judge size and speed because of distance (about 100-150 miles south of Humboldt County California) but very massive size moving at a high speed judging from distance. Sighted near horizon just above tree line south. Looked like a planet or very large star (about 8 stars together) at first but with binoculars sighted a tear drop shape(""U"") with hole in center descending at the speed that of a jet plane would in the distance or even faster. Before sighting, there were 5 jet planes going towards the location where the object was descending which directed my attention to that area. There were 2 more jets following the other five after I sighted the object (7 jets all together going on same route towards object within 10 min.) Object disappeared behind tree line and so did 5 jets except for the 2 which were still visible but then dissapeared behind tree line also. The sun was not quite over the hills yet, but the 7 jet streams were all pink and the sky was very clear with no clouds. The temperature was about 45 degrees F. outside. The moon was in its last quarter stage but nowhere close to the horizon. I was wide awake and had been up for about an hour and had a very restful sleep. Five minutes after the object disappeared, 2 jets were still visible and I had to leave for a class at 08:00. I am a Senior at Humboldt State University majoring in art.

I was surprised to see the below-described meteor shower (of Dec. 13, 1998) because it was not announced on the news but was more visable for me than the highly-talked about Nov. 16 meteor shower.  In fact, I never saw ANY meteors during the November meteor shower, but I saw 5 on December 13.  It all began at 1:55 am when I woke up from sleep and was laying there looking out the window.  I saw a bright, very large ""shooting star,""  it was about 5 or 6 times larger than a shooting star and way brighter than the brightest star in the sky.  The color was different than the rest of the stars too.  It was the same color as the moon when it is full and bright.  A few seconds later I saw a ""typical"" shooting go by just east of the path of the meteor.  A few minutes later I saw a second meteor shooting through the sky and another shooting star a few minutes later.  At this time I phoned the UFO Reporting Center because I thought it was unusual to see 2 meteors and 2 shooting stars in such a short time.  Then I went back to sleep and woke up again at 3:00 am.  I no sooner looked out the window and I saw yet another meteor go shooting by in the sky.  This really got my interest, so I decided to sit up and count how many I saw.  I grabbed a tablet and made a column for ""shooting stars"" and one for ""meteors.""  Within an hour (3 am to 4 am) I saw 3 more meteors and 4 more shooting stars for a total of 5 meteors and 6 shooting stars.  I just think it is curious that the public was never told about THIS meteor shower and it was much more spectacular than the one in November that all the news stations covered.

Then it flashed again (white).   After it flashed about 3 more times, I called my mom and she came out and then my teenage son and his friend.  We started timing it and it flashed every 10 to 13 seconds only.  I could see it in my binoculars only when it flashed.  It was SSE in line with Jupiter.  It would move up and back and sideways but you could only see it when it flashed.  Then there was a streak of light and we all screamed and it was gone.  There was no sound. I had gone outside and was sitting on my back steps before Iwent to bed and was looking at the sky.  A plane was going over pretty high up and I was watching it, when a single flash occured out in front of the plane.  I thought the plane had shot something out of it.  The plane went on and I was still looking where I saw the flash and it flashed again.  So I sat there and watched it.  It was just a bright flash, not as bright as Jupiter though.  But it looked like that.  I yelled for mom and she came out and it continued this slow flash but moving around.  It would be more north then it would flash the next time over to the East and then South but it always stayed in a pretty small area.  I called for my son who is 15 and his friend and we stood out back and watched it.  Planes continued to go over but this just stayed there.  I ran inside got the phone and called my uncle in KY to see if he could see it. I was trying to explain to him where to look but with it only flashing about every 13 seconds it was hard to tell him where.  Then there was a brighter flash headed east with a long trail behind it like a shooting star and then the flasher was gone.  We all screamed when whatever it was flew across the sky because it was so bright.  My mom saw a red streak come out of it headed due east when it was just the two of us out there but I did not see that.  My mom is 58 years old and psychologically stable.  My son is 15 and attends an academic prepatory high school.  His friend is also 15 and goes to a local high school.  He was scared.  I am 41 years old.  I used to work with a local Mufon group here in Nashville but have not been in contact with them for about 5 years.  I have always wanted to see a UFO because I believe they are out there but this tonight was the most unusual thing I have ever seen.  I told my son's friend it was probably something of ours (from the USA) so he would not be so scared.  Maybe it was a satellite, if they can stop and move in 4 different directions and then take off and lea! ve a whi te trail.  I very much doubt it though.  My uncle reported he had observed the same type thing 2 or 3 nights ago (in Paducah, KY) and watched it for awhile and went to bed.  It was in the south.  He said it was a slow flash like what we saw.  I asked him who I should call and he said no one, just enjoy it and go on to bed.  But I had to tell you all.  I have written one other time to tell about a gold light that I saw one night headed north that disappeared but that could have been too many different things.

It was saucer-like shape with a very bright glow in the middle.  It had red and green lights circulating around it. I was sitting on my deck and was on the phone with a friend of mine.  I saw an object that seemed as though it was not moving.  It was just becoming dusk and the reason I noticed this object is because it looked like it was twinkling.  As I continued the conversation on the phone, approximately 25 minutes, dusk turned to nightfall and the object was getting to be more defined.  It seemed like it was moving very slowly towards the north.  At the same time, there was jets flying a southernly pattern.  They were very high--you could not hear their engines and they were going in the opposite direction of this object.  The interesting part of these jets is I counted the time it took these jets to pass the same area that this object moved in.  The jets took approximately 12 seconds.  This object, at this point, was up to about 40 minutes.  The object briskly moved to the south for a very short period of time, probably 30 seconds, and then went back to its northerly path.  The movements were quite sharp in direction.  It did not turn, but it just moved in the other direction for a period of time.  When comparing the distances between these passenger jets probably 30K feet, this object seemed a lot further away.  I finally told myself that I was really experiencing something that I never have before and went and brought out my telescope to see it more clearly.  I set the telescope up and saw it very clearly.  It was a saucer-like shape with a darker space in the middle, outlined in white with red and green circulating lights that seemed to be flashing/twinkling.  I called my wife who came out and looked in the telescope and she saw the same thing I did.  I asked her to call NASA at Moffet Field, but we couldn't get through.  We then called the FAA who switched us to the Oakland Tower.  They gave us your number.  We called Channel 5--KPIX News Room and asked if anyone had reported anything out of the ordinary in the sky.  The gentleman told me that yes there had been some reports and he said he thought it was t! he re-en try of a satellite.  I told him I had the object in the sights of my telescope and that unless there building satellites that look like flying saucers that hover in the sky, I don't think it's a satellite.  He told me he would check into it.  I watched the 11 o'clock and there were no reports of anything, which of course, I really didn't expect anyway.  My wife and I have never seen anything like this before.  We are in our 40's and don't typically follow this type of thing.  However, this did catch my attention and I know what I saw.

My husband and I have seen a questionable distant light in a very remote mountain area, for at least the last eight months off and on. Usually between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m. in only selected areas we frequently travel. The areas are remote wooded and recently logged areas on the west side of the mountain. About 2 months ago we had my husbands mother babysit our son.We were in the woods and called her to say we would be home in 30 minutes,at about 10 p.m. on our way out of the woods we saw the same orange light but was closer than normal, we got out of the truck to watch it in the distance moving about for what we thought was about 2 minutes.The light disappeared and we got back in the truck and headed home.When we got on the highway my husband asked what time it was and it was after 12:00.At 11:00 my mother in law called my sister in law to ask if she had seen or heard from us,and she hadn't she then called our cell phone and could not get through.We arrived at my mother in laws house at 12:30 and could not account for the lost time.Last night My mother in law was watching our son for the night we went spot-lighting bucks in the cut timber ridges where my husband has been hunting.On the way in we noticed that the wildlife behavior was very odd,they paided us no attention at all.We have been doing this in this same area for years and have never seen this behavior before such as:an owl sitting in the road and not moving when we approached it in the truck we stopped beside it and it flew into the side of the truck.Very exsessive amounts of small game like skunks,rabbits,coons,opposum,and rodents all traveling in the same direction out of the cut timber.At the same time about 3:30 a.m. we observed a female deer acting very strange as we passed by she came to the truck and looking behind her into the clear cut acting confused,we assumed a buck was pushing her towards the road so we shinned the hard wood hollow looking for the buck,not seeing him we eased down the road to give him a few minutes to come into the clear cut. We drove up the road and turned around to come back to find she was the only doe we saw which is not usual for we usually see 15-30 does a night.She was in the same spot still confused, we shined behind her! for the buck to find nothing on the first pass of the spotlight,upon the second pass of the spotlight we saw a red-eyed deer.We have never observed a red-eyed deer most deer eyes reflect green.When the hit the red-eyed deer he moved swiftly over the ridge and out of site.We waited a few more minutes to see if he would return to the doe.Afer about 5 minutes we he did not return so we down an adjacent road to see if he had circled the ridge.When shinning the back side of the same ridge on the first couple of passes of the spotlight we saw nothing driving slowly while still shinning the spotlight we spotted the red-eyed deer.My husband looked through the scope of the gun to see if it was a buck.It was about 200yds. off the road it was very hard to locate the deer in the cut timber.When my husband got a good look at it,it had a enormously massive rack not usually found in this region.He got out of the truck and fired one shot at the deer and I saw another red-eyed deer to the left of the first.He shot the red-eyed buck it dropped to the ground. He looked at the one on the left through his scope and it was also a massive buck. He shot at it also and it too dropped to the ground but was trying to get up so he fired a second shot then it was also lifeless.We sat in the truck for 45 minutes because my husband felt somthing wasn't right we shinned the spotlight on the deer 3 different times to see if the deer were still laying there.My husband still could not concieve the idea of the two abnormally large deer.After the third time checking they were still there,we decided to turn the truck around we came back to retrieve the bucks.We were about to get out of the truck, when my husband turned to get his gun and out of the back window he saw the same mysterious orange light in a distance moving very rapidly in figure eights and looping in the sky.My husband said there's your light.I turned to see the light moving while he cranked the truck because of unusual movement of the light.Scarred to death he floored the truck while! I watch ed the light,half way to the road it started coming towards us very rapidly.I screamed go It's coming after us.My husband driving as fast as possible while I was still looking at it coming My husband let out an ungodly scream and bowed out of the seat he felt an electrical serge in his back and was screaming everything was black and white.A few feet from the road I turned to see that the light had stopped where he had shot the red-eyed bucks.We keept going towards the main highway as fast as we could and scarred to death.As I looked to the left once we were on the highway the light  had followed us, traveling 100ft. above tree level never leaving our side approximatly a mile away. Panicing trying to get away from it we were going about 90mph.But even through the curves it never left our side for about 5 miles.About 3/4 of a mile before approaching a steep ridge the highway went over, it started angling towards us appearing to intercept us at the base of the ridge.Pushing the truck as fast as it would go,screaming and crying more terrified than we have ever been. At the base of the ridge it was directly above us we felt enormous static electricity we heard a loud bang on the truck like someone had thrown a baseball at it.My husband screamed radio the police as I turned the police issued radio which will radio to Sequathcie, Grundy, Marion, and Bledsoe Counties as I keyed it made a popping sound and went dead.  At the same time the electrical systems in the truck began to fail.  The truck headlights, interior lights, gages, electric fuel pump, and engine began to fail which caused the truck to start missing.  I saw the windshield wipers beating on the windshield and there was a bright glowing light inside the truck.  Suddenly a calmness fell over us and I held both of my husband's hands as we starred at each other confused and terrified at the same time the truck felt as though it was being levitated less than a foot off the road at the same instance my husband grabbed the steering wheel as the truck was s! till mis sing we were coming out of the light now much slower than what we entered about a 1/4 of a mile back.  As soon as we left the light the truck began to function normally again.  Still terrifed and panicking we drove about 3/4 of a mile as fast as the truck would go to our friend's house for help.  As we turned into our friend's road I looked back and and saw that the light had dissappered.  As we skidded into our friend's driveway we jumped out of the truck and ran to the front door.  As my husband was beating on the door he noticed that all the lights were on, all the vehicles were there and that his Friend's two house dogs did not come to the door barking like they always have.  Terrified he beat on the door harder and began to scream to be let in.  Panicking he reached to where his friend always kept his spare house key and it wasn't there.  He tried the door knob and it was unlocked.  He ran into there house screaming his friend's name and yelling for help.  Although four adults and two loud house dogs live in the house there was total silence.  He ran to his truck and grabbed the cell phone and tried to call his frien's number hoping he would answer but it would not go through.  Immediatly he called his sister's home for her to pick us up because we were extremly disoriented.  His sister answered and he began to scream hurry come out here and get us out of here theyr'e after us.  the phone kept cutting in and out but he finally got her to understand where he was at.  His sister and her roommate called us back from her roommate's cell phone as they were franticly coming up the mountain not knowing what was going on they had called back to let us know they were coming as fast as they could and trying to find out what was going on, but when he tried to warn them to watch out for the orange light the phone died.  He tried calling back several times but it would not go through.  About six minutes after he had called them they slid into the yard expecting the worst.  We ran screaming and jumped into the ba! ck seat of his sister's car.  She could tell how mortfied we were and immeditly back out of the yard and hauled ass back towards the highway to take us home.  We were so shook up that we were babbling and could not get them to understand what had happened.  As we pulled onto the highway my husband yelled ""There it is!!!!"" as he pointed at the bright light in the sky that was now white. His sister and her roommate(who is an EMT) both saw the light following the car a great distance up in the sky.  His sister who had heard us talking about the orange lights before knew immedialy what had happened to us.  She began to drive over 100 mph to get to the only convience store that was open at this hour approxmalty 4:45 a.m.  We pulled into the parking lot and parked in front of the doors.  We sat there for about 20 minutes trying to explain what had happened the whole time all four of us were watching the light that followed us.  It moved side to side, up and down, and it would fluctuate between bright and dim, always returning to bright.  then we decided to go to our house which is about a mile from the store the white light followed us at the same distance since we had been with them.We pulled into the driveway and sat in the car the light was still at the same distance in front of us and I turned around looked out the back window and saw an identical light as in front of us approaching us from behind but keeping the same amount of distance as of the one infront of us.We decided the best place to be was a public area so we went back to the store we sat there for about another 10 minutes and decided to go back off the mountain to his sister's and stay.But my husband was begging us not to go back towards where the incident had occured.We got about 4 miles from the store which was about a mile and a half where the light was over the truck.When his sister's roomate who was watching the light all the way from the store which up until this point had remained the same distance,started to scream ""turn around it's coming @#$%!! !!!"" we made a u turn and the light shot back up to where it had been the whole time. we went back to the store and sat for about 5 minutes and his sister and her roomate were now terrified of the situation also.We drove back to our house again and no one would get out of the car because the light was still following us.We finally decided to brave it and go to his sister's house as fast as her car would possibly go.Once we hit the road we never slowed down but the light traveled the same distance beside the car as it had been.as we drove down the mountain it stayed above the mountain but still beside us and always in view.When we got to their house which is at the base of the mountain it was still above the mountain but in plain view over the valley, we went into the house about 5 minutes later his sister went out to her car and said that the light was gone.we stayed there and colmed down and tried to figure out what had happpened. we couldn't figure any other reason of them chasing us other than the red-eyed deer. so we waited until daylight and went back to the clear cut to see if the deer were still there because we couldn't understand the relationship between the red-eyed deer and the orange light chasing us or if there was any at all. We needed to see the deer to prove to ourselves that there was no connection.When we got to where the red-eyed deers were laying we saw nothing from the road.But my husband knew exactly where they were laying so his sister,my husband, and I walked into the clear cut to where we had seen them laying.But we found nothing no hair no blood and no tracks as if they were never there.We spread out and searched for deer tracks and walked for 2 hours over a 15 acre area and found no tracks that were equivilant to the massive deer we saw.As we were walking we found a deer carcuse not visible from the road which was laying on it's back without any meat, flesh,hair,or blood anywhere around it but suspiciously ALL bones were still intact. we left the clear cut and are now wondering what ha! ppens ne xt?",1999-10-19T00:00:00,35.2044,-85.3255

Different heights and distances from my position. NOT stars, planets or aircraft. I have been witnessing a recurring sighting of something in the sky over Redding since the 21st of September.  The object(s) are still appearing as of tonight, the 12th of October.  These objects have been witnessed by three of my neighbors as well as my Grandmother, my Nephew and another friend.  The first object appears in the western sky at around 7:10 PM.  It slowly, almost imperceptibly, traverses the sky in a diagonal, downward track until it reaches the crest of a mountain called Boley Mountain which is roughly 6 miles from my location. It then disappears on the other side of the mountain.  Within three minutes, the object, or another identical object, appears in the northern sky, roughly 30 degree's above the horizon.  From this position, it tracks opposite from its path in the west until by 12:30 AM, it is very high in the northeast.  The object does not get much higher and does not move east or west.  The latest I have watched it is 2:30 AM.  At that time it had moved slightly south.  I got up at 4:30 AM about four nights ago and saw nothing but stars, the moon and planets.  I noticed on the 28th that another, seemingly identical object would appear in the eastern sky at the same time this object moved.  The eastern object must be either over or just east of Redding Municipal Airport.  On October 4th I started finding more of these objects in different positions around my location or encircling Redding.  On the 5th, I counted 16 that I could see.  These objects can only be identified as bright white, green and/or blue and red lights with the red light appearing to pulse or rotate around something.  Very reminisent of the old police ""bubble gum"" lights or maybe lights reflecting off of one of those aluminum christmas trees.  None of the witnesses, including myself, have been able to see a discernable shape.  I am using a fairly new pair of 20X50 Tasco binoculars to view this.  Not the best but I all I have available.  My neighbor, who was actually the first to see this, has tried to view the object through his 35mm camera using a 300mm telephoto lens.  Still could not make out what it is.  He took some time-lapse photographs of the first object but is not confident of the outcome since all he had was 200 speed film.  I have snapped several photos using a Kodak Max one-time use camera.  I know these will either be blank pictures or of poor quality but they are at least pictures.  Since I am now dealing with so many of these things it is difficult for me to list every objects position and behaviour.  Some of the new ones to the southwest actually appeared very close to the ground. However, being night time and not knowing the distance of my binoculars yet, they could have been thousands of feet in the air.  I think they were close to the ground because of my location and knowing the area they appeared to be over.  I have sensitivity to bright car lights so could not investigate even though I wanted to.

The object itself:  Since there was not a frame of reference the exact or reasonably estimated size object is unknown.  The object was large and the green light probaly could have illuminated clouds if they had been around.  The color was bright emerald green.

At approximately 23:55 EST on 09/22/98 I was standing in my driveway  in Ladson, SC. and was looking to the night sky directly overhead.  I was facing towards the Northwest and suddenly something streaked across the sky directly above my position.  It was heading in a Northeast to Southwest direction.  The sighting was very brief, maybe a half second, as the object moved very quickly.  At first I did not think much of what I had seen.  After further consideration of the event, I began to realize that I could not figure out what it could possibly have been with any certainty. When I had originally sighted the object, my first thought was that it must have been a shooting star.  I then rejected this idea as it did not 'burn and spark' as other shooting stars that I had seen in the past.  The object had been, in fact, rather dull in appearance.  It had no luminescence to speak of and my best guess is that it was only illuminated by ambient light from the ground.  There are streetlights and other less intense light sources in the immediate area.  The night was clear and visibility in the sky was quite good.  The moon, if I remember correctly, was low on the horizon and not full.  I do remember that whatever the moons' aspect, its light did not interfere. I had been rather pleased by the clarity of the stars and this is why I had been looking skyward in the first place.  Dirtectly behind me was a streetlight that was approx. 120 feet away and I had faced away from it in order to see better. The best way to describe what I had seen is to say that it appeared to be a small orb or disc that was a dull, metallic color.  It had no external sources of light and did not emit any noticeable sound.  There was no trail or glow to the object.  As I had indicated previously, it appeared that ambient light was reflected from the object.  It looked rather dim/dull and was only visible for a brief instant.  This leads me to believe that it was travelling very low to the ground.  I had considered that it may have been a bird or bat.  I dismissed that notion also as its velocity was far greater than any bird or bat I had ever seen.  I also briefly thought that it may have been a airplane of some kind.  I again rejected that idea as the circumstances and my perceptions of the object strongly refuted this.  There is alot of low-flying air traffic in this area.  This is due to the nearby Air Force base and small commercial airport that share runways.  Mostly they are rather large commercial and military planes with a few small, private planes and jet fighters.  However, the vast majority of the air traffic are large planes.  The Air Force base is part of the Strategic Air Command. The only other information that I can provide is that, by my estimation, the object covered 30-40 degrees across my line of sight.  The object appeared very suddenly and had disappeared just as quickly.  This reminded me of something flying low and only visible by ambient light from the ground.  The object moved in a very straight trajectory.  This is the best and most accurate description that I can provide of the events and observations on that occasion.  I do not completely rule out any possible explanation to what I saw that night.  I can say that, whatever I had witnessed, I am perplexed and had never seen anyhting similar.",1998-11-01T00:00:00,32.9831,-80.1223

We decided to set a goal of getting into Montana before stopping for the night, finding a motel room in a small town.  There were loads of deer crossing signs and we nearly hit one crossing the road.  Because of the lack of cars on the road we were able to switch to high beams so I was tunnel visioned, while driving,  to watch for deer on the road.  It was then that we noticed the solar flare stuff that was lighting up the sky that has been in the news lately.  We pulled over to the side of the road to look at the brilliant illuminating effect.  We totally shut the lights off and stood looking up at it amazed.  We got back in the car and I wanted to continue looking at the shimmer of white light.  The only place I could do that was behind me over my left shoulder.  It was then that I noticed a quarter sized perfect circle cutting out one of the shimmering flare areas in the sky.  I looked at it several times.  Then I looked forward and noticed in the upper right hand corner of the wind shield a dark well defined disk shaped object.  I said to my wife ""You will think I am crazy if I tell you what I see"" and she joked that it must be a UFO.  I said I  think so and asked her if she saw the object.  She said she did and she continued to watch it.  She said it was moving and I meantime was looking at two and sometimes three directly ahead of us.  The third of those objects kept collapsing in on itself.  There were no lights on any of them.  They were not clouds, as the sky was perfectly clear.  The quarter sized circle thing had vanished but directly out my driver side window was a long very large cigar shaped object - dark but very clearly defined.  Sometimes it was rectangular and sometimes triangular.  Very clearly defined but dark.  Then that object became more abstract in shape.

It stayed in that position for what seemd like 10-15 minutes as we drove along.  We were both scared crazy but kept driving at 65 mph.  The object stayed in what seemd a fixed position in the upper left hand corner of the windshield and the shimmering light quality of the flare effect revealed sort of a greyish color to the object.

I first looked out my window after hearing on art bell lights were spotted,went to the side of my house to look at it,saw a bright light that turned out to be a star. I then went to my backyard becuase there are less trees,and looked up and saw nothing.I then went back to the front of my house,(same route),and once i arrived at my driveway,near my deck,almost ready to enter my door,i saw a very bright white light. (I did not see it when i was leaving my house,becuase it was in back of me.)I then went inside to get my binoculars and zoomed in the light was steady and did not blink,the shape did not change.  I then looked above my roof to see if there were any other objects near it,and i saw what at first i thought was a comet.(Some haze)I zoomed in and i saw 5 white circles,with steady non blinking light,the objects did not move,all the circles were the same size.(The circles were much smaller and farther away than the other object to the right.) The circles were arranged one behind another equally spaced in a arrangement that looks like a hook. I was pretty convinced this was a comet,as soon as I looked at it becuase one circle in the middle had a little haze around it.But that would not explain how the much bigger circle and much closer circle did not have haze around it also.  It was very cold out and i went inside for about 15-20 min then went back out to see if the objects moved,and they did not.I then zoomed in on both objects again and there shape did not change and they did not move.I went back inside after 5 min,then i went back outside after my dog started barking (he does this alot i doubt it had anything to do with the light).But I did find it strange and i was a bit scared becuase he stayed outside for about a hour,and i thought the weather got to him,or he got to a fight with another animal. I yelled out his name a couple times 4 or 5 and he came in. I then went back outside with my binoculars for a final look and the objects did not change. I went back inside.  I assume the objects may have stayed out there all night until the early morning,but i was to cold and not very impressed by it,(i thought it was a comet),but know think otherwise.(After hearing all the reports.

""It started above the tree line, about 10 degrees above the horizon, and disappeared into the clouds... Ended up slightly 30 degrees up. The departure angle was close to 45 degrees. It departed into the west and up."" ""I'm a reliable judge of speed. This thing was smoking and accelerating! Speed 400 to 500 knots, with a behind-the-trees dash at Mach 1 (600 knots), easy."" ""It was the brilliance that brought my eye to it. If I had done a slow blink, I would have missed it completely. This was truly an amazing sight."" He described the UFO as ""oval, like if you put your thumb and index finger together to make the OK sign. No blinking lights. Glowed like looking at a picture of the filtered sun...amber/gold.""

We had been apprised of the upcoming launch, but had forgotten about the notification.)) Orange light ascending, two pieces separating, then flying horizontally, very visible shock wave. At 0240 local time, in Andrade, CA (Where the California, Arizona, and Mexican borders meet) I saw an orange light rising in the western sky(about 290 degrees)leaving a trail of the same color.  At first it appeared to be a firework or flare.  But as I continued to watch, the light did not descend.  Instead it began to move horizontally to the south.  At this point I grabbed my binoculars, and I could see that in addition to the brightest object there were two dimmer objects with fading orange tails which had apparently separated from the main object, and were decelerating, descending, and dimming.  I assume they were boosters of some sort.  I continued to watch the brightest object, which now had what appeared to be a very prominent shock wave originating in front of it.  After maybe 30 seconds, the shock wave suddenly got much bigger, then dissipated as the object continued southbound.  The object seemed to accelerate at this point.  I watched the object until it was obscured by a nearby mountain.  The object never changed color, and once it began moving horizontally never seemed to change direction, and from my perspective did not appear to be climbing or descending.  I would estimate that it was visible for two or three minutes.  By the color, I believe that the glow must have been from friction with the atmosphere.  While I would guess that the object was of Earthly origin since it appeared to have take off from somewhere in California, it certainly was not any type of conventional aircraft I have ever heard of.  There was simply no reference for me to be able to estimate distance, speed, or altitude, but it was about 25 degrees above the horizon.  I don't know from how far away a shock wave - if that's what it was - would be visible with 7 power binoculars, but perhaps that would help estimate a rough maximum distance.  I am assuming that whatever it was must have taken off from Vandenburg AFB. But if that was the case, and it stayed over the Pacific (which it mst have, or it would have been in Mex! ican airspace) it would have been at least 150 miles away from me.

TRANSLATED FROM PAGE 9 OF LOCAL NEWSPAPER CALLED ""UTUSAN MALAYSIA"" SEREMBAN, 24 May 1999- A student claimed that he saw an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the air in his village KAMPUNG BEMBAN HILIR, MAMBAU near SEREMBAN before the object descended and hovered near his house. MOHD FAHMI ABU HASSAN, aged 17, said that the object emitted intense blue light so much so he could not make out the object clearly. He then saw a being about 0.5 meters in height alighting from air. ""At that time the light emitted by the object increased and it was difficult to see the creature."" said he here today. UTUSAN (the newspaper)upon searching around the house found seven paw prints about half a centimeter deep. The paw track had four fingers and had sharp claws based on the grip clearly seen from the prints on earth. the student also claimed, UFO was detected first around 4.30 am when he woke up from sleep. MOHD FAHMI said, he woke up upon hearing the zinc roof of his house made loud noise as though being blown by strong winds. ""I woke up and found that the wind was blowing as though about rain"", he said.

This is from an interview I had  on 5/28/99.... 5/28/99 Phoenix, Arizona -- At 10 AM on Friday, May 7, 1999, 48-year-old man was experimenting with his new Kodak DC-200 digital camera in front of his Phoenix, Arizona home. He was puzzled by the number of contrails, some in X-shapes, and aimed the camera sequentially moving around the sky. He did not realize until he went to his computer to download the digital images that he had captured unidentified aerial craft in one frame identified as Dcp00102, shown below. The frame Dcp00101 which preceded it by only a couple of seconds is also shown below. Not only are the objects unidentified, but there is another mystery: why aren't the objects visible in frame Dcp00101? Here is the man, a Phoenix salesman, describing his first hand experience that morning: Phoenix, Arizona: ""I've been kind of interested in the contrails and been taking pictures of them for the last several months. And so, I looked up into the sky and the sky was just full of contrails that morning, including an X which - I've seen a lot of contrails up there, but not an X every single time. So, I was taking pictures starting from the north and then turning clockwise and I probably took about six to eight pictures and wound up kind of facing to the south, southwest, with my last picture. And about an hour later, I went to the computer and downloaded them into the computer and I was looking at them to see if there was anything I would like to put on my web page. I've put most of the of the contrails I've taken on my web page. As I went through them starting with the first picture heading towards the last picture, they were pretty much typical with the contrail in there and what I had expected to be seeing. And then I got to the last picture, or next to last (turns out it was last), and I saw something in that picture and it was definitely unexpected. WHAT DID YOU SEE? When I first looked at this, it looked almost like a round, metallic ball in the sky. I kind of focused in over the roof of my next door neighbor's house and just outside one of the clouds up there and fairly close to one of the contrails, there was this round, metallic, ball-looking thing. And then right next to that, fairly close to it, there was a dark spot on the film. And as I zoomed in on it, I could still see what appeared to be kind of a round metallic object up there, but then the two dark spots - or actually, the dark spot - looked like TWO dark spots. It looked to me as if it could be a couple of military jets. They were dark in color whatever they were. They were kind of in the shape of an aircraft. AND IN YOUR PHOTO WHICH I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE QUITE CLOSE. AND WHAT PUZZLES ME - YOU WERE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS WITH THIS NEW CAMERA, SO YOU WERE CONCENTRATING ON THE NEW CAMERA. BUT DID YOU NOT HEAR THE SOUND OF JETS? No. no. One other thing I was going to mention - there was another photo I took, I think it was the one just before this that has that same cloud in it. It's just slightly moved from that location. But, in that picture there was nothing other than that same cloud. You could see the form of it. You can tell it's the same cloud. AND WHAT TIME PERIOD DO YOU THINK IS BETWEEN THE TWO PHOTOS? Oh, it was just a couple of seconds. About the time it takes for the camera to regenerate to the next shot. I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO SHOW THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE SECOND PHOTOGRAPH DID NOT SEEM TO BE IN THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPH TWO SECONDS BEFORE. Right. AND THAT WOULD MAKE BOTH OBJECTS, THE BLACK AND THE ROUND OBJECT, ANOMALOUS. Yes. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING ANOMALOUS IN THE SKIES BEFORE THIS PHOTOGRAPH ON MAY 7TH OF THESE UNUSUAL OBJECTS IN THE CONTRAILS? PHOENIX LIGHTS, March 13, 1997: Well, yes, as a matter of fact on March 13, 1997, when what came through here they are now calling the ""Phoenix Lights."" I was a witness to that also. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. OK. I was going to a friend's house. It was just a little after dark, probably somewhere between 8 and 8:30 in the evening. So, it was fairly dark out at that time of year. And I pulled up in front of his house and was just turning the car off, just about to get out and I looked out my driver's side window and I saw four lights in the sky. Maybe about 3,000 to 4,000 feet up in the air. And they were just huge, bright lights. They appeared to be maybe a couple of miles from where I was. But what was unusual about it was that they were in the shape of a diamond - like with one light at the top and one at each side and one at the bottom. So, I kept looking trying to figure out, 'What is this?' Because I had never seen anything like this before. And I noticed they were coming straight down out of the sky. They were all coming down at the same time, so it wasn't like they were individual objects. They appeared to be all moving at the same rate of speed which was actually fairly slow. LIKE FOUR LIGHTS ON SOME SORT OF A LARGE OBJECT THAT WAS THE SHAPE OF A DIAMOND? Right. OR AT LEAST THE LIGHTS WERE IN THE CONFIGURATION OF A DIAMOND ON A LARGE OBJECT? Right. More like that actually. And so I was trying to figure out in my mind, 'What is this?' and what came to mind was that it might be a commercial jetliner in a nose dive headed toward the ground. But then I thought that can't be because it was moving too slow. And I just didn't know what it was. And as it continued down, I kept thinking I was going to see this gigantic ball of flames burst up when it hits the ground. Then it just kind of disappeared behind the house across the street from where I was. Then I couldn't see it any longer. Then this turned out to be the Phoenix Lights. As the story goes, they came from outside of Phoenix from the north headed down through Phoenix and kind of turned and headed out towards the Tucson area. And there's just been people all over the city and state who have seen these. And evidently, that's what I saw.""",1999-07-05T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

There was a small pinpoint light on the wing tip of each craft.  I was so astonished I stoppped the car and got out.  There was absolutely no sound and no movement.  The craft were black and metallic and the bottom appeared to have a ridge line.  I could see the sky between the two but they were probably no more than 20 to 25 feet apart.

My first impression of what I saw was that I was seeing the underbelly of a plane or something of that sort, but then when I processed the whole event I realized that it couldn't have been a plane that close to the land with that configuration and there wouldn't be a chance to have the underbelly lit like it was.",1999-07-05T00:00:00,30.20772994923858,-85.62376675126903

Our family was directly in the path and as we were all illuminated blue, we looked up into the light.  It moved off towards the woods north of the house and the light was turned off.  Two of us saw it go off just before it would have gotten to the woods.  We all discussed this strange happening at length.  The object came from the direction of Columbia, IL and moved off north towards Cahokia, IL.  Our sighting was two miles east of Dupo, IL on Imbs Station Road, about 3/4 mile west of the intersection of Imbs Station Road and Triple Lakes Road.

I live a stone's throw away from Wright-Patterson AFB so I thought it may have been a weather balloon or possibly a kite or kids helium baloon.  I don't think it was any of these because it was not moving or rotating.  I was close enough to it to see that it was approximately 3ft. in diameter, spherical, with flat sides (not shiny).  It looked like something you would see on Star Wars used as a probe.  I studied it for about 30 seconds before someone pulled up behind me waiting to turn.  I headed east to get a better look.  I could see it through the tree lines and was anxiously driving to a clear spot.  When I arrived at an open clearing, about 3 blocks away and 1 minute later, it was gone. The day was overcast with little wind.  It was also raining a bit and had been doing so for most of the day.  This would discount the possibility of it being a kite unless we have the second coming of Ben Franklin.  There was also no thunderstorm activity in the area.  Secondly, it was not a balloon because the slight breeze would have moved it.  The clouds were moving around it but it was dead still. I did not hear any noise either. I was also close enough (500ft.) to see that it had two cylindrical objects sticking out of the side, side by side (almost looking like a nose).  I would say they were about the size of pop cans.

It made no sound whatsoever. It changed locations several times, moving at the speed that would be expected of a helicopter, hovering over several different ridges.  After between 5 and 10 minutes, it suddenly shot away at an incredible speed, impossible for an airplane.  The next day, unknown to the other witnesses, several people came into the local country store and asked if others had seen the object, describing it in exactly the same manner. This has been going on intermittenly in this area for years, but no one likes to talk about it.  There have also been numerous cattle mutilations, the most recent reported one occurring about a year or so ago.  It was reported on the radio news as a crime, describing the bowels and eyes of the cattle appearing to be cut out surgically with a knife!!!  Locals say it was just coyotes.  This is a very rural, conservative area, and most people out here would never admit to a stranger that they might have seen a UFO. Witnesses are farmers, factory workers, and laborers.  The common explanation is that it must be secret government testing of aircraft. Over the years, the lights have appeared many times, usually hovering over ridges, sometimes appearing to land and then take off.  I am not aware of anyone saying they have witnessed any aliens or having been abducted, but I will admit here that I have had marks appear on my inner elbow that look just like where I have had a blood test (i.e., needle mark).  I have never used IV drugs and I hate needles.  Also, shortly after I moved out here to the country, I began having excrutiating joint pain, for which I was tested for lyme disease. All tests were negative, and no explanation was found.  After a couple of months of this, I had a feeling (please don't think I'm crazy) that something was in the skin between by left thumb and index finger.  I got a needle and dug out an object that looked something like a poppy seed, but not exactly.  I studied it but couldn't figure out what it was, so I threw it away.  I have never had those type of joint pains since that day.  I never thought much about it until the last couple of weeks when I have been reading when I have been reading about alien abductions.  I have no counscious memory of anything like that, but I do have a just-beneath-the-surface memory of ""something"" terrible and frightening happening, and I think I know when and where it happened (1975, Murfreesboro, TN).  The almost-memories are brought back by certain chemical smells (like poison) or some types of music.  I don't know what to make of any of it.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,,

I then proceeded to locate our 35mm camera and snap off 6 pictures. Unfortunately when I went to rewind the film for developing it was no longer in the camera and is still missing. The first thing I did when I picked up the camera was to look through the little window to see the type of film and number of exposures on it ( 200 ASA 24 exp ) I then looked at how many exposures were left ( all 24 ) and proceede to the back porch to take my 6 photos. What happened to the film is still a mystery, but this object was a very symetrical structured craft that was so black it looked like a hole in the sky.

Orange cigar shaped light about one thousand feet in the sky. Disappeared and then came returned about five minutes later. As we were visiting my boyfriends' parents house.  His mother and I were parking the car.  She looked through the windshield and saw a large bright orange cigar shaped object travelling from northwest to southeast, about five hundred feet in the sky.  It silently accellerated straight up into the sky then disappeared within a minute.  My boyfriend came home five minutes later and was told this story.  In disbelief (but curious) he went outside.My boyfriend observed a white cloud like formation of a sideways ""s"" shape above our house. He then yelled back to us to come outside.  We witnessed the object travelling southeast at tremendous speed. At approx. 100 feet the object appeared to be cigar shaped.  The craft appeared silvery gray leaving a trail of orange light.  As the craft accelerated the orange light extended to four times the length of the craft, maintaining the crafts width throughout the sighting. The ship appeared leaving the orange light behind it travelling about 30 miles upward.  It came to a sudden halt. A split second later a small white light appeared growing to the size of the moon.  The light expanded growing about fifty times its original size.  It then disappeared, leaving a backward ""C"" shape formation with the white light in the middle of the ""C"" fading.

At approx midnight I decided to begin driving back to Philadelphia from my aunt's house in rural Lancaster County, PA. As soon as I went out side my aunts house i saw a huge object sitting in a field directly across from her front door. It was large, as big as a foot ball field judging by the nearby trees it lit up like daylight. it had windows with a bright bluish/white light inside and had lights all around the bottom. At first I thought someone put up a large ""double wide"" mobile home there in the couple hours I was inside. Then I realized it was larger than any mobile home and actually would be as large as four of these put end to end. I also noticed a number of antennas and other ""garbage"" sticking and jutting out from the top and sides. after running back inside my aunt came out and was a bit shaken by this. I was pretty scared too but I was intrigued. It was just that weird. After about watching this for around 10 minutes it began making a very low sound. like a buzzing wire that isnt plugged into the stereo correctly but with more variation in pitch and alot deeper. you could feel this in the pit of your stomach and my aunt felt sick. the craft then began to lift off the ground and turn. it was then that i could see it clearly was a rectangle as it slowly turned it's narrower side towards us. it turned off some of its lights and began moving steadily upward in an awkward wobbling motion almost like it was too heavy to support it's own weight. at this point the sound became more intense and my aunt went back inside for fear that it might crash and we weren't that far away. it managed to lift off vertically and turn itself 90 degrees after reaching about three times the height of the tops of the trees.  then for about a 25-45 seconds it began shaking wildly and began to accelerate like the space shuttle but only with that low humming sound not a rockets roar. after it started shooting upwards it was nearly out of sight within 10 minutes becoming nothing more than a slowly moving star. I called the ! local TV station and they knew nothing about it and suggested I call the sherrif's department. I did and they said they had a couple reports of odd lights in the sky and they passed them to MUFON. Afterwards I was firmly shocked. I've never believed in this stuff until now and I feel we are about to be taken over. I got a very ""sinister"" feeling from that object.

This is not unusual because we have quite allot of air traffic in our area.  I watched as this object approached my home from a south western area to the north east.  It flew directly over my home.  I am not allowed to smoke in the house so all of this ocurred while I was out back smoking.  I always try to listen to the engine of the aircraft that fly over at night, because I try to determine if it was comercial, military, private,  etc...  All I can see in the night sky is lights anyway.  What was strange about this object at first was the way it seemed so smooth as it flew accross the sky.  I then noticed that it was a group or cluster of smaller lights that seemed to be attached somewhere together (almost by a string) in the center.  The lights seemed to move away from the center and back towards the center in no specific order or fashion.  Almost as if they were blowing around in the wind.  The second thing I noticed that I wasn't hearing any noise or sound comming from the object.  Since trying to hear for the sound, of the engines, of the aircraft that fly over or around our home is kinda of a ""thing to do while smoking"", I tried as hard as I could to hear some kind of noise from this aircraft.  When I realized that what I was seeing and NOT hearing was not something normal, I kinda went into a fixation on this craft as it dissapeared over the roof of my home.  It really FREAKED ME OUT!!  The entire event lasted about 15 to maybe 20 seconds.  After I realized how strange this thing was I just stood there and tried to take all of it in.  The lights were red and white.  Not bright white but more of an off white.  These were not the lights o any airplane either.  These lights changed the entire shape of the object as they moved all around.  Not a hurky jerky motion but a very fluid like random order.  I don't know what this was, but !

I was at stop sign with a road to the left, HWY C, and my road continuing straight to HWY 151.  I saw an object hovering towards me, off to my left, very slowly with no sound.  As it got closer, it almost seemed to hover above the telephone lines, how high, I'm not sure.  It had a cross-like appearance, I can only say this because of the 4 directional lights I saw in a cross shape, it was too dark to see an actual outline of the object itself.  I also believe there to be a circular red light on the bottom - center of the object.  To my immediate left was a corn field.

It moved off in a NW direction, I believe, away from me and into the cornfield, apparently getting higher as it went.  Before I knew it, it was gone.  I didn't see any fast take off or anything of the sort it just sort of..  slowly disappeared into the night.  I had never seen nor heard of anything even remotely close to this, until stumbling upon this site.  I had this form filled out once, and backed out of submitting it, and continued browsing.. I found another sighting, in Puerto Rico, if I remember correctly, that was frighteningly similar.. so frightening in fact, I've yet slept tonight. :P  In any case, that really pushed me to go ahead and submit this..

It had 4 lights in front, a bright light underneath, a wavelike column of yellow-orange light in back. Last year, on July 2nd, on the 50th Roswell anniversary, I was at my pond with a friend. We saw a very bright light, which looked brighter than Venus, in the Northwestern sky. It was 21:30. It was very high in the sky, and looked like a very bright star. We observed it as it got closer. By 21:40, the sky was dark, the aircraft was very close to us. By that time, we could see 4 lights, two on each side of an inverted, very broad V. The lights looked like the headlights of two cars flying sideways. We could see the air move around the lights, like you can see the air move over a hot road in the summer. The aircraft came down right over us, it was barely over the fir trees around my pond, maybe 100 feet directly above us. There was absolutely no noise, except for a barely audible hum which seemed to encompass everything. There was no noticeable air movement. The aircraft was going very slowly, maybe 20 or 30 mph. At that point, we could see its underside: it was rectangular in shape, light colored, and the very bright light we had seen earlier was right underneath the middle, lighting itself more than the ground. We could see two wings, the tips of which barely went beyond the rectangular underside. The whole aircraft was very large, at least as large as a large commercial airplane. As it started going beyond us, we could see from its outline against the sky that it was triangular in shape, probably dark in color. The back of the aircraft had a vertical column of yellow-orange light. The light moved up and down the column in a seamless wavelike pattern. The pattern was not regular, and when I told my friend that it looked more like a language of some sort than a simple aircraft lighting system, at that very instant, the pattern changed completely. After that, the aircraft started going back up and disappeared behind a hill. I tried to report this sighting to one local newspaper and one TV station the next day. I wanted to find out if anyone else had seen it. I got some chuckles and I did not insist. This year, on July 2nd also, I invited my friend for a sky-watch evening. She could not make it, but 2 other friends came. The sky was perfectly clear. Around 21:30, we saw a very bright light in the South sky, just as I was describing my experience of the previous year. One friend pointed to that light and asked: ""You mean to tell me this is a UFO?"" Within 2 seconds, the light was gone. It just faded away. My friends went home. Later that night, at 23:00, I went to pick up my daughter from town. On the way back, I saw the same bright light, closer than before, I showed it to my 14 year old daughter, and it was gone before she had a chance to see it. Around midnight, I went outside and saw the same bright light close-by in the Northwest sky. As soon as I concentrated my attention on it, it disappeared. 10 mn later, I looked out my bedroom window and saw the light again in the Western sky. I went to get my binoculars, pointed them at the light, it disappeared. I went to sleep. I am a 49 year old female, and I grow grapes and aromatic plants. I also teach plant propagation. My female friend who saw the large aircraft with me is an herbalist, as are the 2 other friends who saw the lights with me.

My house sits two miles directly south of Jones/Riverside airport, considered a ""small"" airport though I believe it gets more takeoffs and landings than Tulsa International, 10 miles to the north.  So I see lots of airplanes.  Again, I had just sat down and looked up over my left shoulder and noticed a ""moving point of light"" or a MPOL, at my 11 o'clock position or so.  It was like a medium bright star (sky was very clear and somewhat crisp) moving from north to south, but no sooner than I saw it (near the constilation Cygnus) that it began to brighten.  In about 2 seconds it got so bright that it felt like a beam shining directly into my eyes.  For an instant, I thought it was an airplane banking and heading right toward me with its beacon almost blinding me.  But as quickly as it brightened, it started fading and within five seconds or so had disappeared.  I then got my binoculars, feeling that if anything else happened, I would see it up close. (A note:  my binoculars are 10x50 Jason, but have been so abused that I always cover one end and use the left side more like a telescope.  It works, but not sure how that effects the optics.) About 30 minutes later, I saw a MPOL moving from north to south, this time with a strobe.  I saw it naked eye, straight overhead, then with my binocs I saw it had a two second strobe.  I was able to see it for about 10 seconds but I could tell that after each strobe, it was dimmer and dimmer until it just faded out.  This happened twice more in about 15 minutes, with a dim but solid light going N to S and then with another ""strober"" going W to E.  Seeing four of these MPOL's in about 30 min. time was really strange to me and my history of viewing the sky. Strange in that they ALL faded away. But about 10:30pm, I saw, again, a medium bright ""star"" moving slowly from NW to SE, in my 10 or 11 o'clock position, almost going straight down from my perspective.  When I focussed my binocs on this MPOL, I tried to use a couple of stars in my view field to make sure this other one was really moving. Then I noticed that these other two ""stars"" were also moving.  The three lights,all the same brightness were moving together in the same direction at the same speed. I do not believe that they were physically connected and it wasnt a solid object for I could see stars in between the point star and the two parallel stars that were trailing.  They formed a triangle with legs being about 3 times as long as the distance between the two trailing lights, a thin but long legged triangle shape moving in the direction of the point.  I watched for maybe 5-10 seconds before lowering my binocs to get an overall look at the sky, but I couldn't see anything odd with my naked eye.  When I raised the binocs again, I could only re-locate the two trailing lights still moving together in the same direction as before.  Although I assume these to be the same two, something seemed different about them, but I am not sure what.  Less than five seconds later, these two lights faded from view, still far from the horizon where I might expect them to fade away. By now my heart was really pumping.  I didn't know what I would see next.  And I didn't see anything for over an hour but about 11:45pm, I started seeing meteors.  After my long  meteor drought, even during last weeks shower (I worked graveyard shift so peak night I only got to view during short brks) I saw four meteors in the ESE part of the sky, all in about 10 minutes.  All going more or less to the south. Then at about midnight, I was going to call it a night.  I looked at the patch of sky where the three lights had been (now much further to my west) and saw one last beauty of a meteor, right where they had been. With my binocs, I can barely see, at the same time, the 2nd and 3rd stars in the handle of the Big Dipper.  It was only a little bit easier to get all three moving lights in my field at the same time.  I suppose that would give you an idea of the distance between the point and the two trailing lights.  Again, my binocs are used more like a telescope. I must say again, when I realized what I was seeing, I was on the border of being really scared.  If they had not disappeared so quickly, well, I'm not sure what I would have done. Hope this wasn't a waste of your time.",1999-08-30T00:00:00,36.0027,-95.97749999999999

While camping out overnight on my birthday (8/16/99) on the Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge (which includes property bordering the Kennedy Space Center) at around 2:30 a.m. 8-17-99 I witnessed what appeared to be a large light blue glowing object moving across the horizon in an easterly direction. Earlier in the evening I had witnessed (at around 12:30 a.m.) the launch of a satellite from KSC, then continued fishing (as my campsite bordered the mosquito lagoon and Indian rivers), until about 2:00 a.m. At around 2:30 a.m. I exited my camping tent to toss a few logs onto the fire, hoping that the increased light from the fire would ward off a few raccoons, which had been keeping me awake by their scampering around the campsite. As I had left my flashlight in the tent, I utilized what little campfire light remained to scout out some of the numerous fallen tree limbs surrounding the tent (for firewood). While peering around in this semi-darkness I was startled in that I noted wooded area around me began to lighten and even pronounced shadows appeared behind the trees surrounding me. Looking up through the trees I could see that there was something very bright emerging in the Western Hemisphere, but I couldn't make it out due to the tree cover above me. I was perplexed by this and while at first thinking ""Holy smokes, I've never heard of the cape sending up two rockets in one night (as it was that pronounced a light)"" quickly reasoned that the light was coming from the direction opposite of the launch facilities. So, I quickly moved through the brush to a point jetting out toward the open lagoon and witnessed the following: What I saw was a steady light blue glowing object moving from the east out toward the ocean. I immediately determined it was a meteorite, as it seemed to leave a slight glowing orange-white contrail behind it. But as I continued to observe it, that initial impression seemed improbably for several reasons. It didn't move as quickly as one would think a meteor would. It seemed to move at a speed slightly faster than a commercial airliner. As it neared it became nearer the object's brightness increased significantly - and by - that I mean it was frightfully bright. When it was at it's nearest, I'd guess 20 - 30 miles off, it produced enough light to have read a book - it literally seemed like daylight. As it passed, I could somewhat discern (especially as it proceeded away) that the intensity of the object varied - from bright, to less so, back to it's full intensity. It continued out easterly and over the ocean until disappearing over the horizon. I at first stood just staring in shock trying to recall all the details of what I had seen, as I figured that since such an event would be widely reported the following morning, and because I was up and awake and in such a perfect environment for viewing it (being away from the city lights), that my testimony about it might be important. After a few moments (probably 5 minutes) I witnessed two helicopters flying very quickly out from the direction of KSC toward the northeast. I mean they were moving at top speed. I simply thought to myself concerning them - ""good luck catching that sh*t!"" and wandered over to the opposite side of the campsite to view the KSC launch area and VAB to determine if there were any other noticeable signs of activity there as a result of the event, but couldn't discern such. I might have heard a slight (difficult to describe) sound during the event, but the surrounding water's activity may have be partly to blame, so I would offer that possibility as a fact, only that I believe I might have noted a slight sound from the object during the event. I did not report the sighting for two reasons 1). My girlfriend slept through the entire event (in the tent) and believing she'd suspect I was acting like a crackpot, decided I'd best keep it to myself until getting back to town in the morning where the event would be collaborated by others, and 2). because one is not normally permitted to camp out in that area during launch activities and I did not want (and still do not want) my presence there to be made common knowledge. Therefore, I'd request that this report include only that I was camping in the mosquito lagoon area ONLY. After returning to town I noted (and in days to follow) I've not run across anyone else who sighted the object (which seems hard to believe - but I suppose I've just not run into them). Well, two days ago I related this event to a friend of mine who laughed it off, giving me the same dreaded reaction I had avoided by having told no one else sooner. Then, this morning, he called me and informed me that he had been up late last night and listened to a radio program (yours?) discussing a similar event, around the same time, but in Mexico. He told me your web site listing ""ufocenter.com"" and recommended I pull it up on the web for any information. And here I am.

At 05:50 on August 17, 1999, I was standing on a sidewalk across the street from the baseball stadium in downtown Portland Oregon, waiting for a bus.  I looked up at a twin-engine Cessna climbing out southward (roughly 1500 feet as it passed overhead) and noticed a small speck apparantly far above it.  At first I thought this was sunlight reflecting off a high-altitude jet.  (While it was quite light enough to read, the sun was not yet actually over the horizon, so it would reflect from a high-altitude object even though we were in shadow.) I watched to see whether this ""jet"" was going south or north.  (Almost all high altitude air traffic here is to San Francisco or Seattle.) It did neither, but rather stayed in one place.  After a couple of minutes of this, I checked to see if the scattered cirrus clouds were moving. They were drifting slowly westward.  At the surface, we had a breeze moving from north to south.  In either case the object should have drifted (if loose), but did not. I looked carefully to see if I could detect any bobbing or any air patterns that might indicate this was something much smaller and closer, such as a tethered balloon, but another airplane went by climbing out, and passed between me and the object, so I concluded that it was likely higher than the plane.  Also, I saw no bobbing movements or shadows anywhere indicating a tether.  (They might exist, but I did not see any.) After a few minutes, the angle with the sun had changed enough that I did not get a specular reflection, but a diffuse one.  The object appeared to be white, and shaped like a ""Y"".  On the other hand, it was extremely small and so I can't guarantee that I wasn't seeing glare or artifacts from my eyeglasses. About this time the thing seemed to rotate a little bit, then move a few feet, and then hover again, as though it were under control and ""keeping station.""  It repeated this behavior occassionally until I lost sight of it. The object continued to stay in place, with no noticable changes, until my bus came at 06:05, when I lost sight of if.  At this point, other boarding passengers asked what I was looking at, and so I pointed it out.  Two saw it right away, both shrugged.

At about 8:00p.m. on Mon. Jan. 4, 1999, my husband and I were returning home from the grocery store.  Just as we were about to pull into the driveway, I asked him to stop and look at a ""star"" that seemed to be flashing.  Once he had stopped the car, we could tell that the object wasn't flashing, but were lights that were changing colors.  We got our binoculars (we had just sold our telescope), and could see a circular object with four different lights on it: blue, green, red, and either orange or yellow.  Thinking that our friends may have a telescope, we called them to say we were coming over.  On our way over, my husband asked me to keep my eye on the objects, and that is when I noticed another one.  It was the same distance up in the sky, but seemed to be farther away because it was not as brilliant.  They were probably a mile or two apart.  When we got to our friend's house they came outside to look and saw exactly the same thing.  The brightest of the objects was slightly below the ""little dipper"" and lined up with one side of it.  The objects were not flying, but maybe hovering.  It was hard to tell because of the distance.  We all watched them for a while and went inside because it was cold.  We checked on them periodically throughout the night and they never moved, even though the ""little dipper"" did because of the Earth's rotation.  The next morning, Icould faintly see one of them, but it was much harder to see the lights because of the sunlight.  Later that afternoon, they were both gone.  The witnesses included myself, a college student on the Dean's List, my husband, a drafting instructor at a college, and our friend's who are a housewife and a computer programmer.  I also noticed a plane (not a commercial jet) fly very close to the brightest object about 30 minutes after I first spotted it.",1999-02-16T00:00:00,32.52817399103139,-94.73228206278026

Earlier in the evening, and all evening there had been a noticeable increase in aircraft activity. While working as an outside security guard at the Barona indian reseervation on the night of the sixth of January I noticed earlier in the evening at around 6:30 p.m. shortly after I began my shift that there was increased aircraft activity in the airspace over that region of Southern California. There were military jets, heliocopters, and commuter planes. Later in the evening at 9:30 another guard that I was standing with saw the first white flashing strobe-like craft appear overhead traversing at a tremendous speed zig-zaging across the night sky; thats when he told me of it and I looked up startled at a white flashing craft zigzaging across the sky making pin-point moves seemingly defying the laws of movement, then at about 20 seconds into that another craft appeared but not overhead it was moving around up and down strait ahead north of us, then as suddenly as that had appeared a thrid one appeared just a little west of the second one. They all danced around the sky in strobelike fashion for around another minute, during which a military jet, with red and green lights on the wing tips, going at a fairly normal speed, which helped to compare speeds of the crafts, crossed the sky heading south. Then as suddenly as they had appeared the third one headed west, the second one headed northwest and the first one was still visible heading north and went out of range at around 9:34 p.m. Just as the first one was getting out of range we  saw another military jet heading south and then veering west. That was the first time I have ever witnessed such a craft going through space at such tremendous speeds, I would guess they must have been going in the thousands of miles per hour based on the time it took them to go from directly overhead to a point north of us in only around ten seconds time.

I assumed it to be an satelite as it did not have 2 sets of lights. i then noticed a second identical light to the left-behind the first light. they were moving at normal air-speed for a small aircraft, i thought this strange as i have been in the military and jets that fly in such formation are very noisy at such altitudes(approximate same as for airplanes arriving to the Williamsport/Lycoming Airport.  I didn't hear any sounds.  Then i heard a small aircraft and within a few seconds did see a small aircraft heading east toward the airport.  As i watched the ""tandem"" lights they seemed to have a light pattern: first a whitish-yellow, then a blueish slightly green, and then red.  I have also had instruction in astronomy and have utilized several college observatories.  I have never seen two satelites(sp?) orbit in such fashion. or at such low altitudes.  And once the small aircraft dissappeared from veiw i no longer heard a sound, but still saw the lights.  The lights appeared to accelerate slightly and then the front light flashed a ""beam-kind of like you would see lightning between clouds"".  This did not light up the entire sky, but slightly illuminated the area directly around the 2 objects/lights.  within about 5-10 seconds the light to the rear ""sent"" the same type of ""beam"" back to the first object. My attention was distracted to the west and i thought i saw a shooting star.. it went directly towards the point where the 2 objects were located.  Those 2 objects began to show a change in behavior.  Their lights got brighter/stronger..the item to the rear picked up speed and seemed to run into the first the flashing of the lights continued(no beams, just the white,green, red) Then another shooting white light came straight down to again seem to come to a target or convergence area.  Another appeared coming from the Wilkes-barre/Scranton area. My next thought was that of a meteor shower, but i know there aren't any right now. Then all of the white lights stopped all logical behavior and seemed to move around. More erratically than you would see from a spotlight..like when a child plays with a 4TH of July sparkler and swirls it around in front and you can see the tip glowing.... At this point there were at least 5 lights in the sky.  I could no longer rationalize anything reasonable that i could blame this on...i wanted to verify with the airport . I left the window and called the Williamsport airport, but no answer. i called a delta 800 line...the reservations person took a bit of information and told me that i needed to hang up and call 911 and make a report, and again asked me to please do so right away. I called 911 embarrased.  I am an educated person, but this was too weird.  I wanted some reasonable explanation of the events.  I went back later to look again(took me a while to get up the courage..the incident really seemed to get me in the gut..but there was nothing.  I live in Williamsport on edwin street there is a hospital--Williamsport hospital about 5 blocks directly north of my home. The activity appeared to take place directly over the hospital. It was way too low for a satelite(sp?) but was at a higher altitude than the small aircraft that passed through the area. I have never seen anything like it in my life.  it was very unnerving. Please feel free to contact me for any additional information.  I was unaware that anyone would even call me about this.  I had already received a phone call from Stan Gordon.

Pulled over and stopped again, and the 2nd lites turned and became three lites in a row with the  middle one flashing. It turned more and I saw a fourth lite creating a diamond shape. Then the object moved behind the hill I was parked by. I continued to drive up the mtn, and observed the 2nd lite occasionally through the trees. I stopped a third time on top of the mountain when I could see the 2nd lites again. It made a deep rumbling sound and was in a diamond shape with a darker blackness between the lites which blocked out the stars behind it. It moved to the south. At 19:15, while driving N on Hwy 70 at the Hwy 191 exit to Paradise, I observed a flashing white lite, brighter and bigger (maybe 6 times bigger than the surrounding stars), in the sky above Paradise. I looked at the digital clock in the car. About one mile further, I saw a 2nd lite NE of the 1st. At first I thought it might have been a reflection in the windows, so I pulled over, stopped  the engine, and rolled down the window. It was a dark clear cold nite. The 1st lite was still constant in the same place in the northern sky above Paradise. The 2nd lite split into two lites, fairly horizonal in the sky. There was no sound. I proceeded to drive NNE on Hwy 70, sighting both the 1st and 2nd lites the whole time, and turned W on Pentz Rd. Here, (4.8 miles from the Hwy 191 cutoff) I pulled over a second time, turned off the engine, viewed the 1st lite in the same place in the sky, now left of my position, constantly flashing on and off. The 2nd lite seemed to turn and the left lite split into two, making three lites in a row with the middle one flashing. It continued to turn, while hovering in the same place, and I saw a fourth lite creating a diamond shape, with the middle flashing lite of the first three slightly ahead of the other two. It was now 19:25, I was parked facing WNW and was viewing the lites by ducking my head a little and looking out and up of the passenger side front windowshield to the N. I held up my hand, and the four lites, if they were at the outside corners of an object, would make the object about as long as my thumb (maybe 1.5 inches). The object then moved behind the little hill I was parked beside. I continued W on Pentz Rd, nearly driving off the road to keep the object in site! Pentz Rd then turns and heads NE, up the mtn. I lost sight of both the 1st and 2nd lites at times as the road climbs the mtn. On top of the mtn on Pentz Rd, (at 6.2 miles from the Hwy 191 cutoff on Hwy 70) I again sighted the 2nd object. I stopped the car (third time), turned off the engine, and rolled down the window. The car was facing N, and the object was in the sky to the W of me traveling in a S direct! ion. Now I could hear the wind in the trees and another deeper rumbling sound that seemed to be coming from the object. It was about three inches wide in the sky and there was a darker blackness between the lites which blocked out the stars behind it. I viewed it for perhaps three minutes before it went behind the trees. It was now 19:40  and I continued on my way home to Magalia.

The duration of the sighting was limited because the object was near the sun, making it necessary for me to use the eave of the house as a sun-block--which, in turn, meant that the object dropped beneath the roof of the house within perhaps 15-20 seconds.  By the time I could run to the other side of the house, I could no longer see it. In regards to the object itself, a number of things struck me as strange.  First, its shape: Unlike the many airliners that traverse the sky overhead, at altitude, during the course of any given day, this object had no wings that I could discern.  Second, and also quite unlike an airliner, the object made no sound whatsoever.  Third, it appeared to be moving at a rate well above that of an airliner. This is speculation on my part, but I would estimate--given what I would take to be the rough altitude of the object (20-30,000 ft.), and given its angular speed--that the object, whatever it was, was moving well in excess of the speed of sound.  This would seem to point to a military aircraft of some type...but, again, the object made no noise at all, and it is my experience that all jet-propelled aircraft, almost regardless of their altitude, make noise audible to people on the ground. As for myself: I am 23 years old, and a graduate of Harvard University.  I'm currently at home, visiting my parents on their farm 2 miles east of the small town of Morrowville, KS.  I am a licensed pilot with an instrument rating.  My hearing is excellent, and my vision is 20/20 with glasses (which I was wearing at the time of the sighting).  Btw, the sky was clear during the sighting.",1999-10-02T00:00:00,,

It did not stop abruptly, but slowed first. The light then just slowly faded out, getting smaller and smaller until it was no longer visible (this took about 3 to 4 seconds).

It was a clear night and where I was in in the flight path for airplanes from Little Rock to Memphis. I am an avid airplane fan and I have observed many jets but this object was moving way to fast for a plane and had no visible navigation lights. It was emmiting an orange glow from the back which made the contrail more visible. I couldn't determine a shape from the angle I was from it but I could make out a large form. I thought it might be a fighter aircraft with it's afterburners on but it was to large to be that high up and still be seen. The contrail was also very wide.

I looked up towards the Western sky (10 o'clock above horizon) and observed 3 objects moving North to South. Distance out from my location was approx 5 miles West of me. I was at 14050 Boggs Dr. Miami, Fl Approx 144 street and SW 112 Ave. The 3 objects had a blueish-green color and at times had a yellow fire like tail. They were no in straight line center object was a little lower than front or rear object. I am familiar with aircraft landig patterns in area and these were not in that pattern. If I were to guess at their speed it would be 200 mph. Like a plane coming in for a landing type speed. Objects dissappered for approx 5-10 sec. Possibly going behind a cloud. We were having some lightning storms down here. Then they reappeared in the same level continuing South-SW in direction. The objects had a ""cone"" effect like photos a a missle shot where missle causes a white cone to precede it. As said at times objects had a fire like tail. I told my wife when I got home as as ususal comment of being tired was brought up. On the news that evening local TV station (WSVN ch7, FOX affiliate) had a short blip on the sighting in Tampa,Fl. They also had a video clip. There video clip showed the center object higher than the front or rear object. I do not know if you can get copy of the clip Mr Rick Sanchez was the news achorman giving the report.They said officials said it was the booster rockets from a Russian space ship.

The second object was a dull red color.  It was about the size of a pencil lead held at arms length.  The object maintained its color and illuminosity for the duration of the sighting.  The 2nd object crossed the sky from horizon to horizon, as if chasing the 1st object.

I am curious that if they are indeed satellites, why are so many in the same orbital direction and so closely spaced? On 9-8-99, our sky was cloud obscured and I was unable to make any observatios.

I was driving in a westbound direction on Missouri Highway 94 South very early in the morning.  The sky was becoming light but the sun had not risen yet.  As I came over the top of a ridge I saw an extremely bright light in the sky ahead of me that appeared to be moving down towards the horizon in a gradual, steady motion and also appeared to be shimmering or pulsating.  Being somewhat of a skeptic I attributed the movement I perceived to the fact that I was coming over the top of a ridge and going back down the other side and I attributed the shimmering aspect the the crisp cold air.  As I came across the next ridge the object now was in full view and stayed in the same position for the next several minutes.  It really grabbed my attention because it was at least three to four times brighter than a star.  I thought several times that it was possibly a planet in the morning sky buy it was extremely bright, a white/silver color. I continued to observe the object for several minutes while it appeared to be stationary.  There was no movement and as the morning light increased there was no change in the brightness of the object.  I stopped at the QT quick mart at the intersection of Hwy 94 and O'Fallon Rd to grab a soda and a bag of pretzels.  As I stepped out of my car I gazed at the object for a period to try to ascertain exactly what it might be, it was extremely bright, still about three to four times brighter than the brightest star I have observed and in the western morning sky all by itself.  I quickly ran in to get what I needed, I would guess it took me a total of 45 seconds to one minute because I knew exactly what I wanted and I was the only customer in the store.

We apologize to the witness if our assessment is incorrect.)) I first spotted two objects west of my position.  They were 1000 feet above ground level in the night sky.  One was greenish blue and another was reddish yellow.  I took 15 pictures of objects of which I do not yet know the quality.  I followed objects for 10 miles to see if they would appear closer to me.  They did and as I continued I spotted a third object which was much closer.  It had a circle of white lights with a red light circling the object and constant.  Lights were not blinking like a plain. I had just walked my girlfriend to her car. I came back up to my 3rd story apartment, got a glass of water and glanced out the window.  West of my building I noticed an object with greenish blue lights.  I thought at first it was just a satelite or plain.  But as I continued to look at it I noticed the object changing color within seconds -  going from blue to green to blue to white.  The lights appeared to have a circular sequence around the object and as they made one complete cycle around the object they would then change color.  I continued to monitor the object through two large branches on a tree outside my window which extends to the top of our apartment complex.  I used the branches as limits to see if the object would move above or below a branch.  It did as if it was bouncing around in the sky.  Then I noticed a flash of light north of the object I was observing.  A second object appeared.  This object appeared to be higher up and was reddish yellow in color.  I could see a haze around this object and it appeared to be farther away or just smaller.  I then was convinced that something strange was up. So, I grabbed a camera (disposable from a wedding I attended) and ran outside.  I wanted to see if the images would appear closer to me if I drove west.  As I went 1 mile west of my complex I pulled into a parking lot where a man was laying dirt.  I got out and asked him if he thought those two objects looked strange.  He was startled but admitted that the blue green object did seem rather strange.  So, I got back into the car and drove 40 MPH down a suburb street that connected several counties of St.Louis.  The road went directly west towards the objects.  The reddish object seemed to be leading me.  In fact it gradually moved directly in front of me and as I slowed down it almost seemed like it would slow down.  So then I would speed up and it would seem farther away.  I felt like it knew I was following it.  Meanwhile the greenish blue object remained on the left of the road and was still twice! as low to the ground as the reddish object.  After 10 miles on the same road heading west towards the objects there was no doubt in my mind that the objects were unidentifiable and moved very freely unlike a plain or a baloon of any kind I had ever seen.  I was running out of road after 10 miles and decided to pull over into a neighborhood street to take pictures of the object.  The lights in the area I was now in were more scarce then where I started following the objects.  As I got my camera out and closed my door, I turned to see a object flying maybe 500 feet off the ground and maybe .25 miles away from me.  The object was so low that it's image was constricted when it passed behind the houses I was standing in front of.  I quickly snapped off two pictures of this object and ran back to my car to follow it as I had lost sight of it behind more houses.  When I pulled back out to the main street I could not see the object.  Also, I noticed that the reddish yellow object was no longer high in the sky.  In fact I couldn't find it.  Therefore, the object that was low to the ground could have been a totally different object or the object I followed earlier.  This object that I flashed two pictures of was oval in shape it was circled in bright white lights and had several red lights on its front ( I think it was the front because of the direction it was heading which was north of me).  It did not make a single sound and when it flew it seemed to float move effortlessly.  Also, it's flight pattern was very irratic as it decended and ascended several times within 10 seconds I had a good look of it.  Finally, the object was not moving fast at all.  In fact it seemed to be slow which may have been what caused it to look like it was floating. After getting back in my car to follow the object I realized that the greenish blue object was no longer west of me but was now east of me and still on my left side.  I raced towards a local highschool parking lot in order to park my car and get away from the trees.  I was able to get a fairly good look of the sky.  I waited for 10 minutes and did not see the object that had previously flown close to me.  So, I continued to watch the blue green object which seemed to be stationary in the same position I described earlier.  Then, out of know where I noticed this object moving at the same speed fly from behind my position - yet not directly over me towards the blue green object.  In fact, the blue green object seemed 500 hundred feet above it.  The object continued but again was low enough that objects such as houses and trees seemed to restrict my view.  I got in my car and drove back on the same street following the blue green object. It seemed to be moving higher away yet I kept a clear visiual of it. At this moment, I was 5 miles away from my complex and the sun was coming up directly in front of me.  The stars were no longer visible nor were the satelites.  Yet, I could still see the blue green object.  I drove back to my apartment and looked up to find nothing left in the sky. I am currently working as a engineering consultant with a focus on pneumatic fluid power.  Our company is familiy owned and distributes a full line of pneumatic automation equipment.  We work with plants and OEM's throughout the Missouri, Illinois area.  I have a BA in finance and economics.  I graduated from a top private university.

I believe the experience that happened to me was a coincidence.  If I hadn't glanced out my window at that time I believe that I never would have witnessed the occurence - so no I dont think they were looking for me or that I have ever been abducted.  I am not into Star Trek and Science was my least favorite subject in school. I believe what I saw were UFO's.  However, whether they have aliens on them I don't know.  What I do believe is that whatever I witnessed seemed to tempt me to chase after it.  It was a strange sensation, kind of like I was spying on them - I don't know.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

I found this site this morning so here is where I will post it: I was outside with my mother while she smoked and I began to look up at the stars.  After a short while, I was facing NW but looking almost straight up when I noticed what I first thought was an owl flying around.  Then I realized that the flight pattern - tight figure 8's and circles - and speed it was flying at would be impossible for a bird or plane.  I watched it further and noted the shape, it had the chevron shape - almost like a boomerang - but the color was kind of like what a gray or silver car would look like by starlight alone.  The size or altitude was hard to tell because there were no buildings or mountains around it, it was almost straight up from my house. I told my mother about it and it took her sometime to finally see it.  By this time, the object's erratic flight had placed it almost directly above the house.  She ran inside to get some small binoculars, we have no video camera and it was too dim for a photograph.  While she was inside, I noticed a plane approaching the object from the north.  The plane must have been very high up because I did not hear it but I could see lights.  When the plane got to within what to me was about 8-10 inches, the object began to move towards the south while still flying it circular patterns.  It made a final 2 circles and then turned and sped away in a straight line to the south.  I watched it for as long as I could but I eventually lost in the glare of the LA lights.

I noticed that northbound Washington Road was blocked by a road-closed sign (stating that the road was closed 3/4ths of a mile ahead), the orange kind that are used when construction is taking place.  As I waited for eastbound SR 41 traffic to clear in order to make my right turn, I looked past the road closed sign and to the north toward the point where dump trucks and a (presumably) construction crew was gathered.  In the sky above them was an object that I at first thought was a blimp.  It was metallic or silver in color, looked to be the correct length of a blimp at that distance, but was not tall enough in my estimation to actually be a blimp.  This was in the middle of the afternoon and the sky was perfectly clear.  The object seemed to be floating or hovering over the construction site, at maybe about twice the level of the nearby treetops.  I just sat there for about 1 minute, trying to justify and identify what I was looking at.  I dismissed the blimp idea, and then wondered if this was some sort of weather balloon or something.  I might point out that the location of this object was in a rural setting not far from a small city.  I thought that the folks at the road construction site HAD to see this thing!  I briefly considered driving around the road closed sign, to the construction site as to get a better look, but I convinced myself that I should go ahead and run the errand that I had set out to do and that if when I came back by it was still there then I'd try to investigate.  When I came back by the same area approximately 30-35 minutes later, I could no longer see the object.  A couple of hours later the road closed sign was gone and I drove down northbound Washington road to the point of construction.  It looked like they had been working on grading the roadside ditches and there was nothing that looked out of the ordinary. I'm afraid to make inquires about this locally, since I've observed that people that admit that they see UFOs are treated like nutcases.  I'd really like to know if there was a blimp in the area or if that was some sort of weather ballon.  I'd also like to know if the construction crew noticed it overhead.

After a few moments I described what I saw to my friend who was a passenger. AS the lights moved across the road in front of the vehicle proceeding at 50MPH I watched them to see if they might be a reflection or something explainable but they continued from left to right and wound up at the curb to the right still making their random scrambling movement. I saw no object only the lights. They moved less than a foot off the ground.

On this night she called me outside to look at what she thought was a peculiar star in the sky. I came outside, looked at it and told her that it was ice crystals far up in the atmosphere causing the effect. I went back inside and within three minutes she had called me back out again. This time the star had moved !! I made sure to look at it from the same location both times so as not to distort my perception of what I was seeing. From our point of view the star/object moved from being over the top of a tree to its side in just a matter of 3 to 4 minutes. I stood and looked at the object for close to 10 minutes. I just to stay in one spot when my wife and I noticed that it was moving out of our line of sight behind the tree. I told her her to keep and eye on it while I got the car keys. We both got into my convertable and headed of in the direction of the object. My wife noticed that as soon as we got into the car the object shot of at great speed to the west. We drove down Hwy. 40 heading towards Folkston looking for the object in the sky. We were halfway between Kingsland and Folkston when I said to my wife that I saw a red light to our left in a clearing as we drove. She saw it but our view was obstructed by a group of trees as we drove more. Within just few seconds my wife and I saw the same red light on the opposite side of the road still above the tree line. My wife started to get scared so I turned around and went back home. It was only upon us discussing the matter when we back home that she told me that she remembered seeing the shape of the object for a brief moment. She said that it did not really occur to her how big the object appeared because she had quick view of it as we were driving. She said that it looked like a pyramid shape. At this point this when I knew we had a bonified sighting. The next night an even more spookier event happened to us. This time we purposely set out see if we could ge! t closer without (detection).(I don't how or why, but my wife and I knew somehow that the craft could sense our attention of it) The second night when we saw that the same star like object was in the same position as the night before we jumped into the car and drove off down Hwy. 40 again. This time we went as far as Folkston and started driving up Hwy 82 towards Tifton. We could not really tell if anymore if the starlike object we had seen was still there so after driving on 82 for 10 miles I started to turn around go back home. As soon as I slowed and turn my blinker on to make a U turn a bright light popped on in the sky above the tree line and to our right. I kept going forward to see it more. As we got closer I could see that the object was passing over the trees directly to our right. The thing that really capped this night for me and my wife was that there were two to three other cars ahead of us stopped on the side of the road with some of the people out of there cars looking at the light as it went by. I raced back in the direction of the light heading towards home. We both lost site of it. On the way back home we got a little lost on one of the back roads but eventually made it back home. We stood in our driveway now at home looking still up into the sky. Before we went in we saw a craft come directly over our neighborhood that made NO SOUND what so ever. Not even wind noise. At the level it was we both said that we should have heard something. The next morning I got up early right as the sky  begining to blue. I looked out of our bay window and saw that up in the morning sky at about 75 degrees was a brilliant object just hanging in mid air to the south west sky. I looked on for about 6 to 7 minutes and then just dismissed it as a star I got dressed for work and came back out to Our bay window for another look. It was gone!

The pilot tells the observer, ""Hey! You want to see a UFO? Look at that!"" The observer and pilot see a orange ball of light in front of the helicopter, heading from west to east at the same altitude. The object is at 2 miles and closing. The helicopter is in right hand orbits over the call at approximately 400 to 500 AGL. The object was moving at a normal speed for the area ( under 200 knotts) at what the crew estimated at around 150 knotts or so. the object was at the helicopters 12 O' clock postion as the nose of the aircraft passed through the west (270- 280 degrees) while in the orbit. the object was moving slower relative to the nose of the aircraft while it continued to orbit. As the nose of the aircraft came to about 360 degrees (north) the pilot began a straight and level flight path. The object was moving across the wind screen from left to right (from 10 O' clock to our 2 O' clock). As it got to the 2 O' clock position, the object changed direction and did a wide right hand orbit to the south.the pilot adjusts the aircrafts flight path puting the object at the 2 o' clock position again. the object then changed direction again, accelerated, and headed directly at the observers door (right side) of the helicopter. Startled, the observer, thinking he was pressing the intercom button, said to the pilot, ""Oh SHIT!"" as the object came at them. The observer had acually pressed both of the foot switches, activating both the intercom system and the radio transmitter. The object got within about 200 feet of the aircraft and then changed direction again, flying to the north at a very high rate of speed and out of view. The ground units call the office after the crew had landed and wanted to know what happened and why the crew left with out saying any thing but, ""Oh SHIT!"". They did not see the object. It should be noted that hte object was able to change direction with out any ! type of turning manuver. it just changed direction. If you were to draw its' flight path, you would draw all right angles. the only time that it turned semi-normal was when it started the right hand orbit to the south but even that did not look normal. The movement almost looked like a Hollywood special effect. I hope you don't think I'm a nut but I've been around/involved in aviation for a long time. I've never seen anything like this. The texture, the shape, the movement, the speed changes and the drastic angles all add up to it NOT being anything that I have ever seen.

Three witnesses at the same location as the March 13th sightings.  We saw a rounded triangle-shaped object totally black against the lighter sky. Within 300 feet. Object could have been 100 ft in diameter. There was a faint glow on each side of it. July 23, 1997; 8:25 PM; Phoenix AZ/ 9822 N. 16th Place; Looking west, then north. My background is that myself and my family saw the extraterrestrial craft of March 13, 1997 fly directly over our house.  Our family was featured in the USA Today article on June 18, 1997 and then on various TV programs. 	I had been sitting in my back yard with my son-in-law Danny Pasqualini and grandson Adrian.  We had been talking about the March 13th sighting and then the return of the craft on June 25th.  We were trying to understand where did the people on the craft come from?  I told them about a outline of a story I wrote in 1966 which could possibly explain where these people were from. I recounted the story of Windsloop, a man living at some time after the destruction of the world. At one point in the story he is ""captured"" by ""extraterrestrials"".  Everyone thought the world had been devastated by the ""gods"" and the world was only now in its ""feudal"" stage.  There was no real science or technology nor people that could operate technology. We find out that right before the destruction, an armada of space ships left the earth with scientists and mechanics and technicians and scholars etc.  They knew destruction was coming and they wanted to preserve civilization.  They travelled for ove! r 100 years and arrived at an earth-like planet. They prospered and developed for 300 years and finally developed faster-than-light travel.  They immediately sent ""scout"" ships back to earth and found it devastated.  They built a huge ship, over 1 mile in diameter filled with everything they would need to ""resurrect"" the earth and its people. Windsloop ends up joining up with the ""returnees"" and agrees to be an ""agent for rebirth"" of the planet earth. Right after I finished the story and we stood up, and looked to the western sky, where the sun had gone down while we had been sitting there. Out of nowhere we saw an object moving through the sky west of us, perhaps 500 feet away and up about 200 feet. It was solid black and had a rounded triangular shape. The first thing we noticed was its absolute silence.  At first we thought it was a balloon, but after watching it for 10 seconds or so we knew it was not a balloon. Its movement was too deliberate and too rapid to be a balloon! .  It was moving diagonally from the southwest to the northeast directly in front of us and then passed us on the north side of my property heading slightly northeast until we lost it in the darker eastern sky. It almost seemed to fly out at 300 feet around the edge of my property first on the west side then on the north.  It made absolutely no sound at all at any time.  We had just seen a small plane come from the west towards us and we could here its engine from a couple of miles away. This thing passed within 300 feet of us as it passed by us on the north side of my yard. It's altitude over the area was only about 200 feet up but as it headed northeast it went higher. It was completely black against the dimly lit background sky and it seemed to have a slight glow on either side of it towards the rear.  The glow seemed to come from the other side of the object as if there was a light source of some kind on the other side of the object and it was ""bleeding"" over the edge so ! it could be seen just as an edge glow, slightly reddish and yellow on each side. From that view it seemed this object was facing its ""bottom"" away from us as it went around us. Its profile seemed almost spherical; but more oval at the leading end, so it almost seemed like a very rounded triangle with the point leading and the glow on both sides of the base end. We all were astonished because there was no earthly explanation for what we had just seen. Danny was saying ""what the heck is that?""  I said ""What do you think it is? Its a flyover by one of those craft. What else could it be?""  And we were even more astonished because we had just been talking about the visitors and where might they have come from.  For the three of us, it was not a coincidence that this UFO showed up at that moment.  It was a verification for us that there are people on these craft and they are deliberately letting us see them, and that they were here at God's behest to help mankind.",1998-09-26T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

A large light slightly brighter than a large star which had been sitting motionless for a half hour suddenly, started moving from N.E. to S.E. at approx. 45 degrees above the horizon We had been watching planes fly slowly by during the evening and knew immidiatly it was a UFO.  We have seen ufos many times before so are familar with their flight pattern. From a stopped position it speed up three or four times faster than the planes or jets that we could see in the distance.It varied its speed slowing down and speeding back up for about ten seconds than James who had been looking at the ufo with his binoculars took them down for a quick readjustment.  I looked at my night vision scope in preparation to looking through it.  This took about one second for both of us to make these adjustments when we both looked back to our amazement it was completely gone from the center of the sky a distance that would have taken a plane about ten minutes to travel. We both realized even more deeply how prevalant and a part of the universe UFOs really are.",1998-09-26T00:00:00,,

It was about 6 pm and my mother and I were driving on Route 422 in Niles, OH, to go to the Eastwood Mall.  I looked up and noticed these streams in the sky.  They resembled the streams that jets produce in the sky as they fly.   That's what I thought it was at first.  However, there were so many of them...about 8-10, and planes would not fly that close together.  Some of the streams were going up..some down...others were cris-crossing...some were horizontal.  I also thought that maybe they were meteors, because they had tails that looked like comets.   When we got to the parking lot, we got out and were able to stand in the parking lot and get a good look.  That's when I noticed that in front of the streams were cigar shaped, golden metallic objects.  They were so bright.  There were no wings, so these were NOT airplanes.  They were all in the same area of the sky, except for one of them.  I noticed that one when I turned around to go into the store.  It was behind us, quite a distance from the other objects.  This was the lowest one in the sky, and I was able to see the cigar shaped object much more clearly on this one.  There were other people driving through the parking lot who were also staring over in that direction and pointing, so we were not the only ones that noticed these objects.   Now, I have a law degree, so I like to consider myself to be a very rational person.  But I've never seen anything like this before in my life. I think I should point out to you that I live in Trumbull County, OH...the same place where police officers chased objects in the sky a few years back.  This story was chronicled on the NBC special ""Confirmation"" a couple of weeks ago.   We do live near the Vienna Air Base, so that may be relevant.  Also, back in November, my mother and I also saw some strange lights in the sky, and my uncle, who was about 10 miles away at the same time, reported seeing objects on the same night as well.  There were three of them.  They didn't move at all.  They were lights, but you could tell they weren't stars.  They were too big.  They never moved.

Second object, same as first -- but moving due South. Elapsed time, 8 minutes. I am a 34 year old Technical Writer, employed by a defense contractor at Edwards Air Force Base, California.  I served one tour of duty in the U.S. Marine Corps as a field artillery, fire-direction controlman.  I have spent a total of 10 years on or around military bases. 03/04/1999, 1900: Sighting occurred while driving Westbound on Avenue J, in the vicinity of 5th Street East, Lancaster, California.  The sky was full dark, clear with no clouds.  This road is two-lane, mostly open desert with very little light.  As the sighting continued, I entered the outskirts of Lancaster – a more urban environment. If my direction of travel is thought of as “12 o’clock,” the object was at 11 o’clock, approximately 50 –60 degrees above the horizon.  I do not know how long the object may have been there, as I just noticed it out of the corner of my eye.  Its speed was approximately that of jetliner – perhaps 500 mph.  Its direction of travel was from the Southwest to the Southeast.  The size of the object was the length and thickness of my thumb, held at arm’s length – approximately two inches by ¾ of an inch.  The object was ½ to ¾ as bright as a full moon, if obscured by light cloud cover.  By this I mean it was bright -- white, but with something of a haze about it.  The edges were sharply defined and its overall shape was of a “picture-perfect” comet – with forked tail.  I will send a hand drawing by snail-mail if you would like. After 30 seconds (approx.) the forked end of the tail began to spread out until a leaf-shaped “cloud” had taken shape.  Note, the head and part of the tail remained sharply defined and attached to this “cloud.”  The “cloud” was thick (no stars shown through), white and somewhat luminous from either internal or reflected light.  Looking at the “leaf shaped” “contrail” with peripheral vision, I could make out a round mass within its center – seemingly of the same cloud-like material.  This center mass, though barely discernable, remained long after the object and “cloud” disappeared. The object continued on its southeasterly course for approximately four minutes before “disappearing.”  One minute it was there and the next – it was gone, leaving the cloud behind for another one to two minutes. 03/04/1999, 1906: The second sighting occurred as I continued to drive on Avenue J, now within the urban area of Lancaster, California.  This object appeared to be just like the first, but oriented due South, and without the leaf-shaped “cloud.”  The object was lower on the horizon –perhaps 45 degrees and with a pronounced nose-down angle.  This sighting lasted approximately two minutes, before I lost sight of the object. There were two aircraft in the area of the sightings:  one, heading South at a lower altitude to the first object during the last minute or two of the sighting.  The second aircraft was at a higher altitude heading North, and observed after the second object was no longer visible. If I can be of any further assistance, do not hesitate to contact me.

Departing PHX flying westbound sighted over SW PHX area at approx 16000' what can best be described as a large bright comet shaped object.  It resembled a rocket lauch contrail and I suspect that is what it was. Unlike other rocket lauches I have seen it was traveling horizontally at a relatively slow speed (200 kt est) and the contrail was fully lit up with a bright white light uniformally.  At the front was a single point of bright white light.  As we got close to the dissapating contrail we thought that possibly an aircraft in front was dumping fuel and the residue was being lit by the city lights below.  We asked PHX tracon about this possibility and they were very unhelpful and almost argumentative.  The only known traffic was another aircraft 15 miles ahead that we also had in sight. The object was in view for approx. 2 min from a point I would estimate over Goodyear AZ traveling WSW originating at 15000' and climbing to possibly 18000'.  Several aircaft reported it and queried ATC.  We flew through the extreme tail end of the contrail with no odor.  The object faded from view after approx. 2 minutes and the reappeared after another 1-2 minutes at a point I would estimate as 20-25 miles SW of PHX again traveling WSW at an estimated 18000'.  It was in view for approx 2 minutes at that time also and at least one other aircraft reported it.  We were then in contact with ABQ center ATC and queried them about the object. They had nothing on radar they reported. I have seen rocket launches before and this was different in several regards.  First the point that would be the rocket and the contrail were both uniformally bright white.  Not bright at the origin and fading to orange as would be expected.  Second the contrail was very wide and had the shape of a fan or as I said it had the shape of a comet but was very large.  Third and very unusual was the fact that Air Traffic Control had no knowledge of a launch.  They always give prior alerts to any such launch. I would appreciate any feedback on this object.,1999-04-02T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

We viewed the light while traveling West on Interstate 60, the Superstition Freeway at about 8:45PM.  My brother saw it first, as I was driving.  He remarked something to the effect of ""What the hell is that a comet?""  I looked up and saw an extremely bright light traveling at a very slow rate of speed in a north to south direction.  It looked exactly like pictures of comets that I have seen, a very white part, followed by a long smokey trail. It appeared fairly close to the ground, perhaps 2,000 feet. It was very bright for about twenty to thirty seconds and then it went out.  You could see what appeared to be a smoke trail after it.  It did not have any type of blinking navigation lights like an aircraft.  The bright light was at the aft end of the object as it traveled south.  It could not have been a search light from a helicopter or a landing light as it was pointing in the wrong direction(unless some crafts have landing lights on the rear of them).  We continued to look at the apparent course of travel for about 2-3 minutes.  Suddenly the light appeared again, perhaps 3-5 miles south, south west of the first sighting. I viewed the first incident through the front windshield.  I wanted to rule out reflections so I rolled down my window and viewed the lights clearly through the drivers side window. It exhibited the exact same characteristics, very bright, no Nav lights, ""smoke"" trailing from behind it.  It stayed illuminated for about fifteen or twenty seconds and went out again. You could clearly observe some type of ""smoke"" trailing from behind the object.  The smoke did not swirl or appear to move as if acted upon by rotor blades, jet engines, etc.  The object could not have been a jet, as if in afterburners, as it was moving far too slow to be a jet in burners.  Further, the color exhibited was very pure white and had not blue colored flame to it like a jet engine does.  It could not have been a balloon as it was too low, you could have easily seen the balloon being illuminated by the flame, furt! her it was moving too fast to be a hot air balloon.  It obsolutely was not any type of flare as has been reported by many in the past.  It was moving too fast to be a flare floating in the wind, and it would have been low enough to see a parachute suspending it.  Further, I am unaware of a flare that can relight itself after traveling five miles at a constant altitude.  There were no aircraft in the immediate vicinity of the light which could have released a flare.  The closest airforce base would be Luke some twenty miles to the north west and no military aircraft of any type were seen.  However, there were about a dozen commercial aircraft in the pattern around SkyHarbor.  They were very obviously aircraft with Nav lights.  Several were traveling south of the airport in an Easterly direction.  It would have been very easy for them to see the lights, at a lower altitude and directly in front of them.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

The new thinner glowing trail was circling around back towards the glowing cloud like cluster we thought had to be covering the moon. It continued to make a large circle, then the light that was creating it vanished.  When it vanished, the entire picture stopped glowing.  It now looked the color of a normal airplane trail when a plane is gone.  We watched as the sharp immage discipated.

Last night the same thing happened and we were laughing about our UFO, wondering what was so interesting in that same area to bring it back. We both called it a UFO simply because we could not identify it. That observation was only for a little over a minute.  BUT, tonight as we were both having the pre-sleep cigarette, I noticed movement to my right, not in the same location as before but close, it was huge and moving very quickly off to the side of the house. We both could see the shape very clearly, but retrieved the binoculars again for a better look. V shaped with 2 white lights on each end and one white light in the middle.  The sound was an odd low hum. Surprising to me because on the other two occasions I had not been aware of any sound. (Possibly because it was not as close previously as it was tonight? I don't know.) There was a reddish glow coming from somewhere on the craft but I could not pinpoint it due to the intensity of the whites. We watched it pass by the side of the house and back beyond the trees.

It's path was nearly directly overhead about 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon to the west.  About 1 min after I lost visual contact with the object to the north, there was a bright star that appeared in the sky about 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon and about 5 degrees north from direct east. It appeared in the constelation south east of Cassiopea.  This Bright Star was 2-3 time brighter than anything in the sky, about the intesity of aircraft landing lights. It was so briliant that I immediately thought that a new supernova had just been seen, but the brightness faded and the star dissapeared after about 1 min.  Because of the coincedence of the events I surrmise that they were connected. My gut feeling is that the bright Flash may have been in response to the very quick satelite Moving from the south to the north.  A Star Wars defence mechanism or simmilar devise.

The time was 10:45pm cst, I had just let the dog outside before I was going to go to bed when I decided to step outside with him to do a little star gazing. I was sitting in a patio chair w/my head leaned back against the house facing east. It was no more then 5 minuets when I noticed a silent object moving across the sky. My first thought was that it was a large bird, only because of its size & the fact that it was silent. I immediately realized this was no bird, it had a translucent appearance. I say it appeared translucent not because it was see through but because the object was so faint that it was not that easy to see. After watching it for about 4 seconds it started to go out of sight over the house. So I jumped out of my chair, took a few steps away from the house & faced south, never taking my eyes off the object. It was then that I got a real good look at the object. It was a silent moving, triangular shaped object with a faint reddish light in each of its 3 corners. It was moving in a straight line north to south, just west of do south to be exact. The speed of the object was about twice the speed that the average satellite moves across the sky. The size of the object was about the size of my thumb nail at arms lenght or a little smaller then the triangle in the constellation Lyra to be exact. The height of the object I can only guess at. I would say that it was at about the height that an average airplane would fly at, not a jet but a smaller prop airplane. I discribed it as being 1 object w/3 faint lights but for all I know it may have been 3 or more seperate objects grouped together. I discribed it as 1 object because it never changed its shape, size, speed or direction. The object seemed to be on a precise course, was in no hurry to get where it was going & was definitely trying to go undeteced. I feel very lucky to have seen this object, it was not bright enough to see out of the corner of your eye like you can do with a shooting star or a satellite, most of the stars in the sky where ! brighter then the object. You had to be in the right place at the right time & looking in the right direction to see this object. I am & for over 30 years have been a backyard astronomer. I have always had a fascination for the night sky. As a boy I spent many weekends & summers in the remote north woods of Wisconsin learning the night sky.

Neighborhood witnesses oval light with large luminous contrail pass over houses 400 yds away at 150 ft! At about 9pm myself and a friend went outside on the lawn to watch the beautiful full moon and stars. At about 9:20 pm, I spotted in my binoculars a fast moving oval shaped gold tinged light moving from northwest to the southeast. Simultaneously, my friend saw another light passing directly overhead heading north. We then saw another one at 9:35 pm passing overhead from south to north. This one drifted slowly overhead in a wavy snake-like pattern at about 20,000 feet. As an airliner approached its path -- as it moved toward the southwest, the light suddenly darted over to it and remained over it for a few seconds then hovered a couple of seconds and returned to its original path. It began zigzagging widely until it disappeared. I saw another light a little before 10:00 pm moving to the southeast. All appeared to be travelling at the same altitude. Then at about 10 pm, my friend said, ""Look at that!"" and pointed to the south of the house which overlooks the lake. Coming across the sky at about 150 feet up and 400 yards away was an oval shaped brightly lit object with a gold tinge spewing out a luminous contrail (which became approximately 50 feet in width). This object was seen by multiple witnesses -- neighbors were shouting out -- ""Would you look at that!"" and ""That's not ours!"" to the northeast and southwest of us. The object and its illuminated contrail (which looked exactly like the persistent contrails laid in the skies during the day) were distinctly horizontal moving from west to east at about 180 mph for 1.5 miles. The object looked about 20 feet across and flew steadily over the rooftops until it disappeared -- ""went out"" 30 seconds later over the city. The craft seemed to be fully lit from the inside -- or glowing smooth in appearance-- and the contrail reflected the moon on top but was self-illuminated with a slight gold and orange tinge. It stayed luminous and dissipated 30 seconds after the craft disappeared.We were in total wonderment...So close and not a sound! Was it ours? Why over a town? Why so many? What was in the contrail?  Incredible but real!!  I reported to your center on 1/10/98 a light zigzagging horizontally across the western sky with a large contrail -- perhaps this is a similar occurrence close up!

On the second night out of a five-day camping trip near Wadley, Mexico two men were skywatching right after dark when they noticed two bright stars in the sky. The ""stars"" suddenly descended upon them, and as it turned out, they were not stars, but instead UFOs. The objects hovered overhead for no less than fifteen minutes. The craft were so massive, and close enough for the men to make out a dark, metallic hull with a ring on lights that encompassed ""every color of the rainbow"".The men stood there mesmerized, and watched as the UFOs suddenly ""went right back where they came from"". Two nights later, the UFOs re-appeared, and this time instead of hovering, they decided to put on a display of ""out of this world"" aerial manuevers. This event lasted about fifteen minutes as well. 	A friend of theirs was in the town of Wadley, 14 miles away, and he too observed the aerial display of the second encounter. The event seemed to have a profound effect on the witness and I believe his story is absolutley true. We also contacted Dr.Steven Greer (CSETI), a personal friend of the chief witness. He was very interested in this particular sighting. Although we filed this sighting with CSETI, I thought it extremely important that NUFORC be informed as well.

The craft also made no noise. As I stated above I was driving south on U.S. 51, travelling from Wausau, WI to Stevens Point, 30 miles away.  Mosinee is approximately 10 miles south of Wausau and the regional airport resides there.  As I passed the airport and got away from the lights of Mosinee I noticed what appeared to be a set of automotive high-beams floating above the treeline about 3 miles ahead.  I assumed it was an airplane, but as I drew nearer I realized that I was the only one in motion.  When I was finally only a mile or so away I saw 2 blue lights on either side blinking in unison, and one light blue flash on top that comes only after the side lights flash.  I slowed from 65mph to approximately 30mph and noticed that it had a saucer-like base but it had 2 C shaped pieces sticking out of either side and almost meeting in the center.  It hadn't moved since I first saw it and when I was closest I measured it's altitude with my thumb, and it sat one thumbnail or about 25 feet above the treeline.  It was also right next to a road that overpasses the highway and winds into the countryside.  There are no homes or farms in the immediate vicinity of the sighting.  The second witness was not with me in the vehicle, but rather a truck driver who came up behind me.  I was in the right slow lane,(51 is a 2 lane freeway), he was in the passing lane.  He slowed his rig down to about my speed of 30 mph and I noticed that his attention was fixed on the object to the left of both him and I.

The object flew (or floated?) at an apparently inexplicable speed, heading roughly NE. The object seemed to be composed of two parts arranged in unchanging formation. I am a college student at home in the Upper Penninsula for the summer. I am a painter, and drove to the remotely located Crisp Point Lighthouse on Lake Superior to paint a picture of the adandoned lighthouse still standing there. I stood my easel up on the beach and had been painting for roughly 45 minutes when an object on the horizon of Lake Superior caught my eye. Visibility was perfect that day, and the sky at that time was cloudless. A small shape was closely followed by another small shape on the very edge of the sky, slightly above a thin layer of reflecting air atop the water, but I do not remember if I could see the shapes reflecting on the water. The shapes, if I were made to guess, were rectangular, but I am not certain what their shape was so perhaps this is an association of my own with the Great Lakes freighters commonly seen on the horizons of lakes: the cabins atop the hulls of which are angular in form. The object (I will assume it to be one object, for the two shapes moved in connection), however, moved at a rate of impossible speed for any sea-going craft, given its distance from me at the time. I watched it soundlessly cross nearly a third of the 180 degree horizon in about ten seconds, then I looked down for a reason I do not remember, either to look for my camera or pick up a dropped brush. When I looked up, the object's path had taken it behind the remains of a defunct pier jutting out from Crisp Point which obscures the horizon. I assume it vanished over the horizon behind the pier, for it did not emerge from behind it. The object followed a roughly north easterly course from where I first noticed it to the NNW, travelling consistently at the same rapid speed. The largest visibility possible across water on a clear day is twelve miles, so I assume it to have been at that distance. Though it is possible that two large supersonic jets, perhaps bombers, somehow flying in close formation at an altitude lower than about 500 feet above the water could explain the sighting, the sighting still remains mysterious to me, given how unlikely it is that two such jets would be following this course towards the elevated shoreline hills of Pancake Bay and batchawana Provincial Parks in Ontario (hills visible to the ENE of Crisp Point, and furthermore that the speed of the object seemed greater than any plane I have ever seen at that distance. The object moved far faster than a jumbo jet cruising overhead (which would be cruising at six or seven miles away), and either of its two portions were at least as large as a jumbo jet appears at that lesser distance.

The motion stopped for a few moments as the object hovered and glowed dimly pink and then accelerted at an astonishing rate. I stood on the beach with my wife watching the stars and occasional planes and helicopters move across the sky over the western Florida coastline and the Gulf of Mexico.  I saw a distant object, approximately 40-50 miles away pulsing from bright white to red to blue randomly and exclusively.  I pointed the object out to my wife, who then pointed it out to another couple walking on the beach.  From my perspective, the object first appeared due west of my location and was moving toward the coast south of me.  Over the next few minutes the object's flight path looked like the pattern of angles that can be found on the side of a car key.  The object occasionally doubled back and retraced its steps.  When the object was directly south of me (possibly just west of Ft.Myers over the Gulf) it hovered in place for a few moments at what looked like about 20,000 feet, held a red color that slowly faded to a dim pink, and then accelerated faster than anything I've ever seen.  It took the object approximately 350 milliseconds to move from its hovering perch about 15 degrees above the southern sky through a path directly over my head toward the north until it faded away.  From my perspective, the acceleration path was a straight line that went between Orion and the Seven Sisters, fading in the vicinity of Polaris.  I witnessed a similar event the next night at midnight.  The only other time in my life I saw anything remotely similar to this was in late April, 1996 in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.

The strangeness of this sighting impressed all three of us, and I immediately dictated a few notes on our observation. The disc of light was larger than the pipoint of light usually seen from a star or meteor.  The visual angles subtended were similar to what one would see from a green stop light at a distance of about a quarter of a mile.  We viewed the object when looking out the left-side van windows while traveling at about 50 mph in an east-south-east direction.  Since the disc did not appear to chane size and moved in a left to right direction as we looked in the north-north-east direction, this lead to the perception that the object was moving roughly in the same direction as we were, but of course falling as well as moving forward.  Although we could entertain guesses as to distances and speeds, I don't believe there is any objective basis for doing so. The trajectory swept a path from a elevation angle of 30 degrees to an elevation angle of 10 degrees, while the azimuthal angle swept through approximately 20 degrees.  The visual duration was between 1 and 2 seconds.  Both my wife and my son reported the path as being curved downward.  The duration of the image was so short that I am not sure whether I perceived the path as a straight line or curved. The color was distinctively green, much like a stoplight green with not as much blue in it.  The sighting took place approximately a mile west of tyson'S Corner.

First I noticed a bright light shining through a small break in the clouds just north of my home which overlooks the water. I assumed it was a plane and gave it no further thought. Then I saw a second light of equal size east of the first light and a third light just north and inbetween the other two. The space between the two nearer lights, when I held up my hand, was four fist-widths. Each light was about the size of a full moon but appeared eliptical in shape, always keeping the same horizonatal axis. This triangle of lights was about 60 degrees above the horizon. My next thought was that it could be helicopters launching a search for a missing boat on Possession Sound, however the lights did not descend over the water. The lights rotated clockwise about every 20 seconds and with each rotation, all lights appeared to converge with the northern-most light. It was like a laser show, except there were no visible light beams. The lights were only white, and the pattern of motion was unvaried. I tried to spot the source through my binoculars, but could not see through the clouds. There was no sound. I scanned Possession Sound for boats but could see none. I went outside and checked many times, but the lights and the activity remained the same until 9:30 PM (21:30).

At first glance it appeared to be an airplane as far as the front lights were same as you see from an aircraft at night.

They left, and about (2:20pm) they came back, this time they flew past our trailer and we grabbed our 35 millimeter camera and started to take a series of photos without them knowing and then they left. I didn't get to take any photos of it but I'll try next time!!! Mr. Davenport I wish not not to give my name for the safety of my family. I need to get in touch with you on another story I have concerning what my stepdad saw on the night of (July 3, 1999) He saw a ufo just coming home from getting dinner. He saw what looked like a huge ufo explode into strings of multi-colored lights ranging from white to red to blue and purple ect... What I want to do is send you a map of the area in wich we live so that you will know where to pinpoint the locations of these events individually. I believe that the event of (July 3, 1999) and the black helicopters are are connected. Please, I wish to remain anonymous but I give you permission to tell Art about these events when you appear on his program next tuesday night. Thanks for reading my letter! Keep up the good work!!! p.s. If you need more info concerning the times or locations, I will send them to you via snail mail.",1999-09-12T00:00:00,33.7061,-86.8238

It ascended like a baloon which is what I first thought it to be.  However I noticed what appeared to be several shape changes,including yhe final form which looked like an egg with short stubby wings. It rose to roughly 3-5000ft and appeared to hover.  I expected ""the balloon "" to either be blown further away by upper atmosphere winds or to eventually rise high enough to not be seen by the naked eye.  Upper level clouds came in and eventually obscured my vision.  I did not have my Binoculars much to my disappointment.  I estimate that the thing travelled a minimum of about 3 miles to the north,based on the guess that it was a balloon.  However balloons don't maintain position against upper air currents.  It may have been larger, so my estimation of distance would obviously be off.  Aircraft taking off from KCI were taking off southbound.  At least 3 took off and went east.

Was observing the night sky (cloudless, moonless) from my balconey when I observed a star like object which, all of a sudden, gained great brilliance and was surrounded by an illuminated ""haze""(similar to the consistency of a haze you would see surrounding the moon).  The brilliance peaked then wained, however the object moved, slowly, in a hook pattern (like the letter ""J"" starting at the top of the letter) until it vanished.  The area it moved in could be described as a 3inch by 3 inch square area of sky at arms length.  At first I thought it was a supernova explosion, but ruled it out due to the haze (plasma?)and apparent movement.  The star-like object in the center of the haze maintained it´s shape as a ""star"" or point of light without warping or dissipating. It steadily lost its lumonisity until it disappeared (along with the haze, which mimiced the brilliance accordingly). The event lasted about 5-6 seconds.  Maybe it was a meteorite entering the atmosphere at such an angle as to be ""head on"" if you catch my drift. Or a satellite activating a booster rocket?  Well about 10 minutes later the same event happened again...about 12 inches at arms length to the right of the previous event.  Charecteristics almost identical only this time the patern of movement was of a reversed ""J"". This was no flare, no sound was emmitted.  Since only I witnessed the event (my wife heard me yell ""wow!"") a report such as this would only be of use if others reported activity in this part of Bavaria.  A correlation maybe, at best, but worth reporting.  By the way, there was heavy observable satellite activity around this time.

They separate back into pair and single. Three craft, which I first thought to be satellites, forming a close encounter over the Sacramento/Marysville area - 50 miles to the South.  As I watched it was apparent that two of these craft were flying together as a pair up from the south, and a third craft was approaching the encounter area from the West.  Clear skies, some very high clouds, good lighting, about a half hour after sunset. The craft pair was arranged so the larger of the two was always to the left of the smaller.  All three craft went through continual complex fast changing lighting arrays.  Their lights weren't synchronized.  Quite bright, brilliant colors, or a brite white light disc.  Sometimes the lights would double or form arrays of four, all flashing differently, sometimes with different intensities. This didn't appear to be the light signature of the satellites which are visible here every clear evening, and their movements implied airplane, but on an out of atmosphere scale, which meant that the lights in their fantastic array were very brilliant. The smaller craft almost always was two tightly bound points of scintillating lights.  Often times there were four.  Only rarely did it become a single point of light.  There did not seem to be an structure associated with the light arrays, yet they maintained an integral formation as if there were a structure.  It appeared several times that it was presenting a changing profile to the viewer as it moved around, that perhaps a cause of the observed relative movements of the lights. As they converged the solo craft from the west executed a turn to the north and began flying with the two coming from the south.  I then thought I was watching airplanes, but there never was a sound, and the scale of movement was wrong for an airplane.  The solo craft cruises around the pair who turn to the east.  There is movement between the pair, but it is subtle and their overall position remains exactly the same to this observer _througout_ their entire flight!  The solo light is, what one could almost call, animated, especially as the scale of this encounter became apparent.  The solo craft flew north above a cirrus changing vectors a few degress several times, at one point appearing to reverse course as it circled back over an area - they were complex very large scale manuevers in a patch of sky the size of my hand at arms length - never leaving a contrail or noise.  As it did these high speed manuevers, it reached its highest point as it turned westward at about 10:30 as my arm would point to it.  As it slowly went into the west glow I could see that it was still manuevering but it was so far away that distance only indicated that this light or group of lights was not an airplane and was way off planet as compared to the usual couple of dozen satellite crossings.  Eventually this brilliant cluster of glittering jewels was lost in the evening glow. As I caught up with the pair they had traveled across the sky in an enormous turn from the east to north over in the Reno area. That city is almost exactly East from this observer.  They traveled north 15-20 degrees then I saw that they were just slowly getting closer together in appearance which meant that they were now traveling to the Northeast and they maintained that till they faded into the night sky a hands width above the horizon.  At their highest in the East they seemed at about 10:00 in the sky as pointed to by my arm.  There was never a sound. The scale of these executed movements would seem to require high altitudes.  This was a very grand encounter, very majestic, and it would seem, when postulating actual physical craft, quite an extraordinary expression of speed and power. During this 20 minute dance the land and sky were very quiet.  No jets and no local noise at all, it was quiet.  Any sounds caused by these craft would have been audible, if they had been aircraft, as exampled by similarly placed jet flybys.

At approximately 2:00am Thursday, Dec. 17, '98 I woke up feeling agitated for no reason, went to the kitchen to get a cup of tea, then stepped outside for a few minutes. The yard faces east and we are located on the Los Angeles/Orange County border just a few miles west of the 57 Freeway. I was looking up at the sky enjoying how clear it was and how many stars I could see... As I looked towards the Big Dipper, just below the last star of of ""handle"" and falling at a 45 degree angle towards the middle star of the handle, I saw what appeared to be a regular ""shooting star"" but rather than the whitish appearance I have usually seen, this was a brilliant blue/green color. It was also at least 2 to 3 times bigger and brighter than the brightest stars, yet it seemed pretty ""normal"" till that point. Then rather than burn out or fade out, it seemed to explode out and for a brief moment get even larger. My first thought was, ""It must have entered the atmosphere there."" But what struck me as strange was that the center appeared ""darker"" than the sky at the moment of ""explosion"" and this darker area grew larger as the brilliance around it spread out. As the light around the dark hole began to fade, I thought that was the end of it. But then I saw the strangest streak of light, same color as the fireball, begin at appoximately the same place where the fireball first appeared and following the same path. What was strange was that the streak of light did not ""behave"" as others I have seen. First, it seemed to be separate and distinct from the fireball that preceeded it instead of the tail of the fireball. Second, rather than have the tail end begin to fade as the front end moves, this streak maintained its brilliance until the front end reached the ""dark hole"" that was still faintly visible. (If I hold my hand out and use my fingers to measure how long the streak appeared, it was two and a half to three inches long.) Then, even stranger, rather than fade away, it appeared to remain stationary for a moment before it ap! peared to accelerate and dissapear INTO this dark hole. Again, it did not dissapear as I have seen before, with the tail end fading first but rather the front end fading at the location of the ""hole"" and the rest of the streak following. I have never seen anything quite like this before, nor have I ever seen anything that out of the usual. I am 45 yrs old, married to the same man for almost 20 years, have 2 teenage sons. Although I am a full time mom, prior to my having children, I was trained as a professional proof-reader and worked for several years at this for Los Angeles County.

A discernable craft flew directly overhead and proceeded to disappear over the horizon at low altitude. There was no sound and viewing conditions were optimal. We were moving harvesting equipment from a remote field back to the farm. While driving  I had observed 2 orange fireballs in the southern and 2 in the western quarter of the sky. A cold front had passed through earlier and viewing conditions were optimal.  The fireballs were distinctly orange, had a definate round shape, did not move, were all of the same appearent size, and faded quickly after about four seconds.  There was no pattern to their appearence; 2 were seen at the same time to the west. I could see only a small area of the sky while driving but saw these while driving for only 15 minutes. The fireballs were approximately the size of the full moon, about half a degree of arc.  After arriving at the farm on the prairie at 9:15 PM I asked the other drivers if they had seen the fireballs but no-one had.  We scanned the sky and noticed a very bright light to the SW low to the horizon. It was a point source but did not appear to be moving.  I determined that it was not a planet because it was south of the plane of the ecliptic.  We observed it for a while until  we realized it was gaining altitude.  It soon resembled car headlights about 2 miles away and was at about 15° elevation.  At this point it became evident that it was an aobject moving directly at us and maintaining altitude.  I remembered I had my Pentax with a 205mm lens in my truck a started taking pictures.  The object flew almost directly over our heads.  It had 3 bright white lights that were visible from all angles. There was a white light on each side with the center light  slightly ahead of the other two. There was also a cluster of green lights in the center of the object with one or two red ones intermixed.  These lights were very faint and did not blink.  There was no sound whatsover. As it continued to the NE the white lights were still dominate but there was also faint reddish lights visible from behind.  We eventually became bored with the event an left the property about 9:30PM with the object still visible above the horizon.  We were treated to 2 more orange fireballs in the west as we left.  My cousin says he returned to the field at 10PM and saw the object again.  I recall an incident in April of this year just a few miles to the north of this sighting that I saw the same lights (the rear aspect) at about 10PM along the same flightpath as abseved on 10/1.  I had lost sight of them as they moved behind a neighborhood house. I am a 40 yr old geophysicist and my cousin is a 43 yr old farmer.  his 12 yr old son and my 16 yr old nephew were the other witnesses. My nephew reported that someone at school claimed to have seen an object in a field near Vermont, IL that night.

At approximately 2:30pm CST myself and a friend were sitting on a couch outside of our fraternity house in Carbondale Illinois.

It was about 1500-2000 feet in altitude, and about the size of a gumball held at arms length.  We both stood up to get a better look and could not figure out what it was.  We were faceing east and it was about 3-6 miles away from us.  The object began to move from north to south and back, in the sky.  The object was also changing shape.

It then proceeded at a rapid rate, faster than conventional aircraft, taking only about 2-3 seconds to complete its northward journey. Then, it stopped and simultaneously turned red.  Then, it proceeded much more slowly back toward the airport at a slightly lower elevation.  It proceeded past the airport and that is when I stopped looking for it, as it was being lost behind trees.  Total sighting was a minute or more.

I was now facing slightly north, perhaps about 30 degrees north of east.  As soon as it stopped, the light became red.  The red was not as bright, but, it was far brighter than the aforementioned red marker lights.  Then, it reversed course and headed back toward the airport, but, now it was moving much more slowly.  It actually went past the airport when I stopped watching for it.  On its reverse course, it was at a slightly lower altitude and was disappearing and reappearing behind trees.

We spent all day working on a dock I am building on the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. It was time to take my family across the river so they could get in their car and drive home. It was around 9:15pm on Sunday, October 4th, 1998. I know that because my sister had to be at her home by 9:00pm and we were running late.  We were in a boat. We left from my dock on Goat Island, SC and went across the river to a dock on Isle of Palms, SC. We were unloading my family and their things off the boat. I was facing south down the Intracoastal Waterway. Over my left shoulder I saw a double blue flash out the corner of my eye.  I thought it was lightning and turned around very quickly to my left to see. I saw a ball about the size of a soccer ball. The sphere  was glowing yellow and faded  red glow around the ball.  It had an extremely long tail about 10 times the size of the ball.  The tail faded from red to blue. I could see all the colors of the spectrum .  the red was directly behind the ball and went to orange, yellow, green then blue. the tail also tapered out to a point at the end. The ball & tail was above Isle of Palms when I first saw it. It moved horizontal (parallel to Earth) for about 4 full seconds. Once it was above the waterway it reduced in intensity and began to fade out. Then it shot off again at about a 30 degree angle toward Earth...still headed away form the ocean...west. that took about 3 seconds. then faded out completely. I was with my boyfriend, in his boat. That was the second time we witnessed the same type of event.  The other was June 28th, 1998.  This time the rest of my immediate family was there and saw it too.

The object moved at constant speed and looked like a round glowing sphere, green in color with no distinguishing marks. The color was light green and looked similar to the bio-luminescent green light sticks the kids use on Halloween.  The diameter appeared abount ten times Jupiter and brigter than the Moon. The Moon was full, due South, close to Zenith with Jupiter just to the West, sky was very clear. Just before disappearing (.5 sec) a second smaller sphere appeared just in front of the larger sphere. It traveled at the same speed, with the same glowing green light at about one fifth the size.  The objects moved much faster than any jet or prop plane, but slower than meteors.

Thursday June 3, 1999 Object observed from approximately 7:55 p.m. to 8:03 p.m., Thornton, Colorado While sitting on the back patio of my home with my wife, I gazed up and something out of the ordinary caught my eye &#8212; something that stood out from the normal air traffic departing DIA (Denver International Airport, 20 miles SE), and much higher. What I discerned shape-wise was extremely wide and triangular and flying northeast to southwest. Squinting my eyes, however, I could not make out a fuselage. This craft was definitely all wing. (Note: I was wearing my prescription glasses, and with them on my vision is corrected to 20/15 &#8212;  better than perfect.) The color was either white or gray. For just a few seconds the craft banked (corrected course?) to its left (easterly) and the brightness of the setting sun brightly illuminated its belly during that time. I ran in the house and managed to find my binoculars. I went to the front porch to observe the craft more; however, the it was so high and far away by this time that the magnification provided by the binoculars was inconsequential. I then went to my upstairs window, which looks south, and watched until I lost sight of the craft as it headed generally toward Pike's Peak/Colorado Springs (approximately 100 miles away). * At no time were anti-collision lights observed * Craft was perhaps 30,000 - 40,000 feet high * Two contrails tailed behind * Estimate the craft to be as wide or wider than the wingspan of a Boeing 747 * Though unusual, I feel the craft was definitely earthly in origin owing to the conventional way in which it flew * Craft was probably military, but type and purpose clearly unknown by me * Environmental (neighborhood) noise prevented me from hearing the craft I hereby affirm that the above commentary accurately portrays my observations of unidentified craft sighted June 3, 1999 in Thornton, Colorado.

I continued to watch this object, directly overhead, for a full 7 minutes...and quite frankly Peter, I got bored and went to get my lunch..I was inside for about 5 minutes and when I came out, the object was still there...only now it appeard to have split into 4 ""lobes""...still rotating. So I continued to watch it...and after about 5 minutes the object did the most astounding thing.  It suddenly moved in a rapid ""figure 8"" pattern, but did NOT travel in any direction, per se...it was still quite stationary, other than this manuver and it's rotation. It was at that point that I knew this had to be a real ""hypertechnology vehicle"" (ufo) and it was also at this point that I tried to get the attention of the people around me, to look at this. NOW THIS IS THE ODDEST PART OF ALL....I COULD NOT GET ANYONE TO LOOK AT THIS OBJECT!  THIS WAS A CROWDED STRIPMALL, AND YET I COULD NOT GET ANYONE TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS EVEN THERE!  NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON EVEN GLANCED IN MY DIRECTION, IT WAS JUST LIKE I WAS NOT EVEN THERE.  THEY HAD TO HEAR ME, I WAS SOMEWHAT FRANTIC, TRYING TO GET THEM TO LOOK AT THIS OBJECT, BUT I SWEAR PETER...IT WAS LIKE I WAS NOT THERE, AND THEY DID NOT REACT AT ALL TO MY WORDS. This really started to bother me...and the object continued to rotate, in place. I stood there for several more minutes. Well, at this point I went back to my office to call a friend of mine who lives a few miles down the road, to see if he could see this object..but he could not. I went back outside to see if it was still there, but it was gone, nowhere to be seen. I did not have a camera at the time...much to my disgrace. I hearby swear that the above events are true and accurate, and I KNOW this was not an ordinary object...it was not a bunch of balloons, such things could not travel that fast and suddenly stop and hover in place..for 20 minutes, it's impossible. But I have to say peter...the fact that I could not get ANYONES attention really scared me, and I wondered if there was some sort of ""mind control"" taking place here. --END.",1999-05-24T00:00:00,33.741524958402664,-117.86342978369385

I live in Forest Hills, NY, which is located between LaGuardia and Kennedy Airports.  Therefore, I see lots of flying objects in the sky, and if it's night I always look up at the planes.  Well, on Monday, May 10, 1999,  around 9:15 pm, I had just dropped off a letter into the postbox and was on my way to the supermarket, when something right above me caught my eye.  At first when I looked at this object I thought ""what a strange plane"" it was.  It took me about a second to realize that this was no airplane--at least like none that I have seen. It seemed to be triangular in shaped (not equilateral), with golden yellow lights at what would probably be the points, and moving very fast from the southwest to the northeast.  The forward part of the object was not actually a point, but rather more to the left of a point--so I guess if you were to look at a triangle that was turned about 5-8 degrees to the right--the reulting top of it would be the front part of the object (I hope this makes sense).  It made absolutely no noise.  It was VERY large--though without a frame of reference I can't say exactly how large.  Living in a metro area, I only see (on a really clear night) the major stars and planets, so, I couldn't tell if any stars were blocked by the object. The most peculiar thing about this object was that I felt like I was viewing it through water.  The image shimmered like a mirage, or something like the transporter scenes from Star Trek when the people are midway in the transport process.  The lights did not seem to be singular but rather arrays at each point; but this impression could be due to the shimmering effect.  The viewing lasted about 5 seconds, at which time the damned thing simply blinked out. The night was crystal clear, not a single cloud in the sky so this was not a case of something being reflected off clouds.  A couple of seconds after the object blinked out a commercial airplane came in (from west to east) for a landing at LaGuardia.   I got the impression that this object was up very high, certainly lots higher than the incoming plane.  Unfortunately, there were no other people near me at the time--well there might have been , but I simply couldn't take my eyes off this thing and it all happened so quickly--it would have been gone before I could get someone's attention.",1999-05-24T00:00:00,40.7229,-73.8424

Light was a bright white and then would emanate bright flashes of red, blue and green.  Light did not change its position in the sky at the same  pace the stars did and clearly appeared much closer than any star.  At one point, a bright red light shot off to the north and downward to the horizon from the light.  About 40 minutes later, another red light shot out to the south from the object at an incredible rate of speed.  The main light appeared to shift position to regain a position relative to a star we were measuring against.  The sky was perfectly clear.  We were in the woods with no background lighting other than a full moon.  Comparing the position of the light to a map, the light may have been in proximity to McChord AFB.

Appropriately enough, we were out at the Oceanside Municipal Airport and there were about 20 or so adults, including a couple of elected city councilmembers, standing around chatting, getting ready to leave the venue when I spotted what I thought at first was a cheap skyrocket. I thought this because of the sparks and firey trail coming out from behind. The object was moving at a high rate of speed, but maintaining a level flight in a direct westerly to east path. I had enough time to realize that this was not a meteor or a skyrocket and something unusual. I shouted to everyone, pointing up to the sky. Everyone was able to watch this object travel east into a bank of light clouds. It didn't look that high, but the next day I read in the San Diego Union that the same object had been observed by people as far away as north of Los Angeles. What makes me write this report nearly three weeks after the fact was hearing Peter on Art Bell's program tonight (09/24/98).

There was no sound associated with it. It was going slow-not even as fast as a slow plane. There was a smoky looking circle of haze around this object, but as we have had forest fires around here maybe it was just leftover pollution, although the rest of the sky is clear today.The object moved west for about three to four minutes, then appeared to gain altitude and began going south. I watched it until it was very hard to see, then came inside. I thought, initially that maybe it was a helium balloon, but I have seen those in the sky before and this did not seem to be one. I have never seen helium balloons reflect sunlight like this object did. It definitely was NOT any aircraft that I have ever seen, and it was moving too slow to be a weather satellite.

Then it appeared to have dropped a red light to the ground.  Then it simply was gone. I was frequenting one of my favorite hilltop locations as I very often did on evinings such as this one.  I must admit the thought of UFO's never really crossed my mind.  As a matter of fact I generally considered people who claimed to have seen a UFO to be some sort of weirdo starved for attention.  However on this night it became quite clear to me that I too was now one of those ""weirdo's"".  As I gazed across the beautiful night sky I saw what appeared to be a shooting star only it stopped ""on a dime"" at what appeared to be about three feet above the mountain top from the distance I was observing.  In all actually the object which seemed to have grown from a white streak into a stationary reddish ball was probably about a half mile above the ground.  I immediately excused the strange object as my own confusion between a shooting star that apparantly had brought my attention to  a large planet mars perhaps.  However the thought that I was witnessing something very strange quickly crept into my mind.  There was no sound and absolutely no movement from the object for about 10 minutes.  Then the reddish quarter of an inch ball seemed to blink releasing a sort of red light down to the ground.  The light fell very slowly then dissappeared behind the horizon.  I again focused on the red object only to see it dissappear as if the  light was turned off leaving nothing behind.  It did not exit in the same manner as it entered and the bright moon provided ample light to see an unlight object from where I was.  I truly hope someone believes what I am saying or even has experienced something similar because I am quite disturbed by what I have witnessed.  I dont believe any of the logical explanations I myself have come up with up to this point.  I truly hope some of you can.  The speed at which it entered, the precision of its stopping, the duration of motionless hovering, the lack of any audible sound, the lack of any recognizable aircraft-llike features( blinking lights, movement, etc. ), the strange light lowere! d from it, the strange reddish glow that seemed to make up the object and the immediate absence of its presence are all a mystery to me.

It moved slowly, and never changed speed or direction. It seemed to be about 1000 feet in altitude and moved over me traveling toward the South East around 8PM. I watched for more than a minute and it appeared larger than a traffic red light but smaller than a golf ball at arms length.  It had no wings or fins.  It was saucer shaped and somewhat rounded or spherical.  One side was very dark, perhaps black.  The other side was brightly lit.  The sun had set but it was still very light out.  The sky was clear, no clouds.  There was nothing hazy or fuzzy about the sighting.  The ship was very plain to see and it looked like a solid object just like a house or car or any other object. It might have been as large as a house. I am not sure of the size.  The UFO rotated so the bright side and the dark side became visible during each rotation.  Each rotation was about 2 seconds.  It did not rotate on any axis you might normally think of.  It just tumbled along.  The light it gave off was very bright but not as bright as looking at a 75 watt light bulb.  The light was white but as it rotated, sometimes I could see a bit of red. I was alone.  I called the local police and the Asbury Park Press to see if anyone else reported it and the answers were negative. This was a very unusual object.  I called the small local airports, nothing. Last summer, I and a neighbor, saw a blinking object go from horizon to horizon in 3 to 5 seconds.  Since then, he said he saw it 3 more times.  I thought the blinking might be a strobe, at that time.  The blinks were elongated into streaks.  Now I am wondering if these sightings were of the same object.  The July object if traveling fast could have appeared to streak because the light was rotating and sometimes faced me and sometimes did not, like a rotating beacon.  As I watched the July object, I became aware of many many little spots in my vision dancing around. I looked away and saw from the object into the clear sky and little spots were dancing all over my eyes.  I continued to watch the object until it was out of sight.  A short time later, I realized that the little spots were all gone.  I had never seen spots or little dots before or since. I am a 55 year old Electrical Engineer and I work for the Government.  This object just defied gravity as it floated along, slowly rotating.  I wonder who it belongs to and what it is doing.  Our Government knows a lot more than me and I know what I saw so I am wondering what the Government knows. I am wondering why they are so quite on this subject. I am inclined to think what I saw was not part of a black project.  I just want to know what the Government knows about this.  I want to know if our Government has any knowledge of these objects or if ETs are working with us.  I got a good look at this thing and it was a solid object.

The light was not like that of an airplane's because it gradually brightened and slowly faded, and lit up the entire craft and some of the sky around it. We both ruled out reflection of sunlight because the reddish glow would have been constant. My friend saw the first flash and both of us witnessed 3 more (total of 4 flashes seen). The first flash was a very bright one, seen by my friend. It was followed by 2 less intense flashes. The final one was very bright and dark reddish color. The object then disappeared behind the distant treeline. Note that the flashes were slow, gradual, and varied in intensity and length. Each flash occurred at non-consistent time and remained lit for about 1-2 (long) seconds. The lighting was totally unlike that of an airplane. The object remained in view for around 15-20 seconds.

Jet was right on planes tail a plane was twisting back and forth in an evasive manner. Plane fuselage was skinney almost non-existant. Both vanished in clear blue sky in 10-15 seconds getting smaller as thay went off in the distance. My wife,2 children and I were on our way to visit relatives in Lancaster, PA. heading west on Route 30(Coatsville-Downington By-pass)about 7-10 miles east of Octorara Trail (Hwy 10)when I saw a very dark black jet chasing what at first appeared to be a propeller powered plane with an extremely long wing span. Both planes were heading almost due north from the south side of Hwy 30. I first caught sight of them when they were slightly off to the left and about 30 degrees above the horizon. They were about 1000-2000 feet away(and maybe at an altitude of 800-1200 feet) and moving extremely fast( I would guess at between 1000-1500 mph. My guess is based on seeing passenger jets go over at about 3000 feet and knowing their speed to be about 650 mph. However I am not too confident of my air speed estimates, but they were moving much faster than what I'm used to seeing. The black jet was right on the tail of the other craft( if my previous guess of their distance from us was correct at 1000-2000 feet then these craft were no more than 100-200 feet apart and maintained that distance thruout the sighting. The jet appeared to be chasing the plane. The plane's wings were rocking back and forth(twisting)giving me the impression that the plane was trying to evade the jet, however the twisting seemed not to effect the direction that the plane was heading. The twisting motion was as though its very thin fuselage was rotating on its axis which caused the wings to pivot up and down.Howver, that this did not effect its flight path! In fact the entire apparent pursuit was virtually a straight line from left(south) to right(north)where the 2 craft quickly receded into the distance. From the time I first saw them until thay disappeared 10-15 seconds had elapsed. They disappeared from sight to the right of my first sight of them and they had traversed about 45 degrees of arc(based on 360 degrees)during the 10-15 seconds.As soon as I saw the craft I called them to the attention of my family, my wife(43), daughter(11), and son (! 7). My wife and daughter saw it within a few seconds but my son didn't(he wasn't wearing his glasses and didn't immediately start looking when I called out to them.)I was driving and had to look forward several times during the sighting to make sure we were still on the road. Therefore I did not get to take in as much detail as I would have liked. My daughter watched from the time I called out until the craft disappeared. She atarted watching about 3-4 seconds after I did. I called out almost immediately after I saw the craft because they looked so odd. In fact when I first saw them I thought they might be models- but their speed and the distance they were covering ruled that out right away. Halfway through the sighting I started to doubt that the plane was a plane with extra long wings and a very thin fuselage but might be a long flat rectangle flying sideways! That seemed almost as absurd as a prop plane being chased at high speed by a jet! My wife had little to say about the event when we later were discussing the sightings later that afternoon. Her main comment was that the black jet was a shadow of the first craft. My daughter and I took her to task over that as planes don't cast shadows on the sky! I am a construction Project Manager with both feet firmly on the ground. I do have an avid interest in things scientific and paranormal-including UFO's. My wife does not share my interests even a little bit and the sighting left  a little desperate for an answer-thus the shadow. The plane that was in the front had a metallic quality to it-more gray than shiney.",1998-11-21T00:00:00,,

At between 13:15 and 13:30 my son was walking from the garage to the house when he began calling me frantically to come outside to see a jet flying over.  He said that he heard it coming and it had an additional sound like the whirring of a helicopter along with the jet sound so he waited outside for it to go overhead. I was amazed at what I saw, my first thought was that it had to be experimental. The entire craft could best be described as arrow-shaped and a silver-goldish color. Not a chrome silver but not iron gray either. It was flying fairly low like a plane in a holding pattern would do at a small airport. How high that is in feet I dont know. The jet was flying straight north, the direction helicopters fly over our house all the time and only just a little higher than that. It was the size of a medium sized commercial passenger plane. We watched it fly over for almost a minute before it was lost behind the trees, so it was not going fast. I did not hear the whirring sound my son heard, and we could hear each other talking so it could not have been very loud; no high-whining sound like a jet makes, and it was low enough to be deafening. I pointed things out to my son as it was going over and said, ""now quickly go draw a picure of it before you forget what it looks like.""  The front of it was very much shaped like a wide arrow-head, rather than more pointed with what looked like antennas pointing towards the back from the two points. Then there was a very long middle section, disproportionate from the rest. Too thin and too long, and round like a pencil. It didn't seem to make sense. (We had time to talk about what it could be for while we watched it go overhead.) We didn't notice any markings or outside antennas on this section. It seemed to be completely sleek. The tail section was much larger than the front section by at least 3:1 and reminded me more of the stealth design in its shape only the edges were far less rounded. On the back I saw 2 round, large, black shapes (my husband said they sounded like thrusters, I though they were landing wheels but bigger) and I saw a little of what looked like cages on top of each side. (My husband said these sounded like intakes.) I remember seeing an antenna sticking up somewhere and fins sticking up on each side. The back section was more familiar and less remarkable than the rest of it. (The rest of it was very remarkable.) In fact the front of it looked so flat that it looked more like it had rudders on each side of a long pencil than anything else. The back was flattened also but not to that degree.  Nothing like a cockpit was seen. I very much think it was some kind of (fighter?) jet and wonder if it was coming from a military base my son says is south of here.  But why would it fly so low straight into the Gary, IN airport traffic and why at such a conspicuous time of day?  We have been looking for something on line for a few days to see if anyone else has seen anything like it.  We even looked at Boeing and Lockheed's homepages to see if we could get a clue as to it's design and origin and found nothing. We thought you might have heard something about it and it might explain some other sightings in the area that were less visible.

I am a telepath and a clairvoyant, so when I heard the message to ""look up; you I might see a UFO"", the only reason I hesitated was because I didn't want to look silly staring up at the sky while everybody else was looking at the game. I heard an airplane overhead, so that gave me a good excuse to look up. I looked above the plane and saw what appeared to be a white sphere. At this point I removed my sunglasses and put on my prescription sunglasses so that I could see clearly and they are not as dark. At first, I thought it must be a balloon except it remained stationary. Fortunately, three balloons were then released, so I then had the opportunity to compare the shape and movement of the balloons with the perfectly stationary, perfectly round sphere. My boyfriend was sitting directly in front of me. I discreetly asked him to look at the object and tell me what he thought it was. He said it was probably a balloon. I said I didn't think so and asked him to observe it for a while. About two minutes later he said, adamantly, ""That is NOT a balloon! It flashed!"" There was a girl sitting next to us. She asked what we were looking at. I told her it was a UFO, so then she began to observe its behavior, also. The UFO then disappeared for about a minute. It then reappeared, but it was now a little closer. About a minute later, it disappear again. It then reappeared, again. I decided to communicate with. I told them that I loved them and would they please come closer and prove to me that it was actually an extraterrestrial spacecraft. What followed next was truly incredible for me. It made a series of 90 degree angles and zigzags in rapid succession, ending with an exit to the left at an incredibly high rate of speed. It took my breath away. About a minute later, I observed another craft appear in the area from which the first one exited. This one had a flatter or disc-like shape as it moved toward me.

The skies were clear except for the wispy clouds under the contrail. At 17:35, I was scanning the skies for more contrails and pointed my binoculars almost straight up towards the east -- directly over The Colony. I could not believe what I was seeing! There were 15-20 silver spheres spread out across the sky reflecting the sun to my back! The spheres would disappear and reappear moving slowly into different patterns. I would guess these were at least at an altitude of 20-30,000 feet but that is very hard to tell. I could not make them out without binoculars. These soon disappeared and I noticed a larger white craft hovering overhead a little to my east. I focused my binoculars and watched this object for quite a while overhead then continued watching it as it slowly moved toward the area of the contrail to the northeast. It was white, reflecting the sun and appeared to have a red glow emanating from behind it at times. It then hovered again near a wisp of ""contrail cloud"" and soon after was joined one at a time by 5 spheres. These spheres (maybe 1/8 the size of the craft) slowly moved around the craft -- with very smooth and graceful moves -- as the craft moved toward the northwest. At this point they were about 6-8 miles away I would estimate and traveling slowly at about 20,000 feet. Suddenly more objects appeared around the larger craft a few at a time until there were at least 9-15 in various formations above it and to its sides. They all went out of view or disappeared at 18:35. Within 5 minutes, two large military helicopters flew overhead flying from the northeast-- the general direction of the objects.

While in back yard at dusk having just finshed playing with a helicopter type toy we noticed a very bright satelite heading SE from NW.  I then observed a blinking red light traveling across the sky from west to east. I assumed it was a plane but soon realized that it was moving much too fast. The object only blinked two or three times (perhaps once per second) and was gone.  I could clearly make out the speed and trajectory as extremely fast and straight line.  I would guess the elevation to be 5-10K and there was no sound at all. I had apro 90 deg view of sky with trees on both horizons.  The entire sighting lasted maybe two or three seconds.  It was particularly interesting given the two objects in the sky at the same time.  My wife ask me if could have been a satelite and I only had to point to the one going over and compare.  I tried to get her attention to see the fast moving object but it was gone before she could get a look.

I woke up early....I tend to wake around 2 or 3 in the morning, as a habit. I often look out at the stars. This particular night there was a glowing greenish light that caught my eye. It was bright an unusual and unfamiliar. I live close to an airport, but the airport's last flight in/out is not past midnight. There is a cargo plane that takes off every night around 2 am, but I can hear it; it is a familiar sound to me.I also see the planes come in and out and I can not remember a plane or helicopter ever hover or circle around the airport. The light was not familiar to me, so I stared at it for awhile and went closer to the window to study it...it just sort of loomed over the hillside. Then it moved slowly and two other lights appeared. I heard nothing. It is very isolated and quiet where I live. I can hear the planes that take off very well, but I could hear nothing; no rumble of a motor or screem of engines. I thought it was a helicopter, but thought it strange that it hovered in this particular area at this particular time at night. The lights were the size of a melon at my distance and moved in unison now. All together the lights moved like they were attached to something. First they moved 'forward' or my direction (west), then they went up and over further(south) and then back and down and back(east). And, then, suddenly they seemed to just disappear. There was no cloud obstruction and it didn't seem that the object/lights went behind the mountain or that a craft had landed. The lights were too far away from the airport to be able to land. It was very strange. Almost as if they went out all of a sudden. I would not be even reporting this if I had not been listening to Art Bell tonite. All of a sudden I felt this strange familiarity with the reports that were coming in on his show (11/16/98-Monday). I had no idea that other people were seeing this kind of thing. I just wrote it off as 'being tired'; seeing a strange star(s); or, a cargo plan or helicopter I just couldn't hear. Ironically, I've been ! looking for the lights every time I get up late at night...just to satisfy my sanity more than anything...did I really see something or didn't I? Until tonite, I wasn't altogether too sure. Now, I know, that others, during this very same time period really saw something like what I saw. It is both reassuring and eerie at the same time. I only wish I had written down the experience right away or called the air control tower or something. I was afraid to call or report the sighting because I didn't want to be 'wrong' about what I'd seen. The reports on Art Bell's show make me even more sure of the siting, but I still feel strange about what I saw. I'm a teacher and this is a small town and I wouldn't want people to think I've gone nutty or something! But, I am reporting the information because so many others out there seem to verify what I too saw! Hope this helps",1998-11-19T00:00:00,21.977,-159.3911

I have been watching the skies for meteors many clear nights this summer. I have observed many high flying jets traveling to Detroit, Chicago, Indianapolis and who knows where else. I have also seen, at numerous times what appear to be satellites moving in the sky from south to north and southwest to northeast. I use a good pair of binoculars and have seen no running lights or heard any muffled roars when these satellites pass over. Last night I saw a movement near or just slightly northeast of straight up. In the first 2-3 seconds of viewing, I thought I was looking at another satellite. Then about 3 seconds into view the object brightened almost instantly to the apparent brightness of Jupiter and it was seen as about the same size of Jupiter. Approximately 3 seconds after it brightened, it started dimming again. The objest was traveling from the northeast to the south. The half moon was behind some trees to my south as I was laying. There was a row of trees blocking the moon. By the time I found the object in my binoculars ( maybe 5 more seconds ) it had dimmed and then it looked exactly like a dim satellite in motion and brightness. It disappeared from view behind the row of trees in the vicinity of the moon. There was no trail visible and the object never veered from its course. ( If I had to guess what I saw I would say I saw a satellite with the ability to instantly turn on a light source; other than that it looked like the pinpoint of light you see from passing satellites. I live @ 20 miles north northeast of Louisville International airport and am used to seeing various running lights on all types of planes.

I pull the four door sedan into the Dairy Queen in Cave Juntion and we all went inside. After getting our ice creams we got back into the car and before I started to pull out of the drive way of the Dairy Queen and making a left turn onto the highway I noticed some lights up on the hills that were about two miles away as the crow flies. Teasing my wife I said ""Look a UFO"". As I continued to look at the object it apeared to me that it was a large house and I commented that ""that was a neat place to have a house"" since it was at the very top of the hills and looking down into the Illinois Valley directly above Cave Juntion, Or. I remember thinking how big the house was because of what I though were large  picture windows with light coming out of them.  The object was huge. It appeared to be made of equally narrow bars of light and amber colored bars that were not illuminated. Equal in size and spacing in a horzontial line. Suddenly the object began to rotate counter clock wise in a very smooth fashion, much like a merry go round -not fast. The object then began moving north in a horizontal direction and I instantly knew that it was a UFO. At this point I was stopped in the middle of the Highway though no cars were coming and we were in the middle of town. So I took my eyes off of the object and pulled the car across the street. I did not see what took place next but wife saw the object and it began to stretch out and develope a mist around it, and then just disapperaed while it was still traveling in the same direction. My two daughters who were in the back of the car did not see the event. Of course my wife and I were in shock. We continued to head south on Hwy 199 into California. I had a deep sence that we would see the object again, so I instructed them to keep looking for the object. The area is very hilling and forest on the Coast range in southern Oregon and into Northern California. After traveling for about 15 miles just after the check stop at the Calif. boarder you climb a hill that takes you through a tunnel. As we were approaching the tunnel my wife, and two daughters saw a blue fire ball approach the car at great speed before it banked away. I was driving, and did not hear or see it. I turned around to catch a glimps of it, but it was gone. My question is why did it come after us as their impression of it was that it was behaving in a agressive manner?

As I said coming right towards us. It moved very fast, then it began to look misty at the top of the ball and seemed to streak light in different directions. I could see the light through the trees as it dissapated and then disappeared. Needless to say we were just totally blown away. The girls and I all had the sense that the ball was coming AT us. I felt like it was aware of us. We all described what we saw the same way. Our background is: My husband is a pastor. I am a homemaker. The girls are in highschool and are A students. By the way it was a really clear and beautiful night, you could clearly see the stars. We are all just amazed at what we saw..",1999-08-30T00:00:00,,

It was located at about 20 deg due West from Zenith (straight overhead). With my arm fully outstretched, this came out to be about five fist diameters from straight overhead and moving straight west. My right eye just happened to be centered over this spot in the sky and I was able to see the flash move from this pin-point of light to an adjacent star about five star diameters away to the south. I was facing southwest when this event occured. It may be my imagination, but I thought I heard a slight buzzing at the very moment of the flash. (You know how your mind simulates sound when it sees a sequence of lights? Well this is what I mean when it may be my imagination). This is the third time during the past two months that I witnessed such pin-point flashes coming from the sky. The other two occurred within a minute of each other and was just due east of Zenith at about midnight. I was looking out of my kitchen window at the sky (as I do every night during at the top of the hour during Art Bell's program) and I saw this flash. It drew my attention to look in this area closer and I saw another flash from the same spot.

I attempted to follow its path with my eyes on the other side of the trees, only a brief distance, especially at the rate at which the object seemed to be traveling, but did not see any trace.  The light seemed to be quite far away, perhaps 2-5 miles directly south of my view, at about 45 degrees above the horizon from my vantage point.  Its size appeared to be larger than the brightest star, but not much bigger.  The narrow tail appeared briefly as it was visible before the trees, but disappeared almost instantly.

It was very faint, barely discernable, had I not been attentively focused on the stars I probably would not have noticed it at all.  The object obliterated any starlight behind it as it silently glided from north to south.  The leading edges of the object had an eerie faint orange glow.  No lights were visible on this craft.

The object moved behind a tree and I jumped up to see if I could reestablish a visual contact.  As I expected, once the visual contact was interrupted, I was not able to focus on it again. I did notice the red light of an aircraft in the vicinity but probably at a much lower altitude than the object.  This aircraft certainly was not in pursuit of the object and was moving almost perpendicular to the object trajectory.

Then they appeared to stop and very slowly fade from sight (about 4 minutes)  I kept my eyes on them (the two that turned east) as long as I could and they just faded to nothing. The triangle of bright white lights that I saw appeared to be very low in comparison to an airliner flying over head.  The triangle appeared to be an equilateral triangle.  The brightness of each light was about that of the planet Venus. The size was of each was about 3 times the size of Venus.  When I first saw it,  the triangle appeared to be just to the right over another highrise that is across the street.  That highrise has about 20 floors and the triangle was easily as big as the top of the building from my perspective.  I was standing next to the highrise I work in and felt a tingling on my neck and a thought popped into my head to look up.  So I looked straight up the side of the building with my head all the way back and just at that moment the lights came into view.  I thought ""that plane looks low"" then I realized that a plane would have flashing lights and a more elongated triangle with the front point farther away than the back two.  But this thing had all the lights equally spaced like a formation.  I slowly moved from left to right and passed the top of the building across the street in about 20 seconds. I then called to the security guard who came out in time to see the triangle and then a few seconds later the lights on the triangle separated with two lights going left and one going right.

We at first thought that it was a meteor, but the ones that we had seen it the past had never been so bright green. The object passed over our heads and disappeared behind the mountains (near the Acadia National Park area).  We were very surprised and had never seen anything like this before.  This object seemed very close although we could not precisely judge the distance.  This object was so bright that when it disappeared behind the mountains, it left a huge silouette of the mountains behind it. The object was bright green.  No sounds, lights or sparks were seen coming from the object.  It passed from ahead of us literally over our heads then disappeared behind the mountains in back of us.  The object left no trail behind it which seemed odd to us considering the speed. The object was spherical in shape.  My friend Steve is a student in Bangor, Maine presently studying broadcasting.

Then they began to glide across the sky. I was attending a church concert and service on Sunday, June 6, 1999 with a couple of my girlfriends.  Around approximately 7pm, I just happened to look up in the sky for no apparent reason.  I saw what I believed to be a star in the eastern sky.  I then saw another and, then, one more.  I thought maybe I was seeing part of the Big Dipper or some other constellation.  I, then, remember thinking it was awful light out for me to be able to see stars. The weather was calm, very little wind.  It had been very warm that day and as the sun set, it got cooler.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  I was sitting facing the east.  I felt the sun setting on my back.  I was at the John Ansen Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood, CA.  It sits off the 101 freeway up in the hills.  A large cross marks a hill nearby.  A large hill or small mountain scales up behind the stage. I looked up and saw the objects above the mountain.  The first one began to move towards us (WNW) and, then the second and third followed close behind.  I turned to my girlfriend and told her to look at them.  She thought they were balloons.  But then, the first one began to hover.  The second and third kept moving.  I could no longer see the third as I believe one of the lighting structures for the stage was blocking my view.  I told her there was no way they could be balloons because how could one just stay still and the other keep moving.  Then, the first one, which was stationary, started back in the opposite direction.  It was moving a little more swiflty than before but never very fast.  It was moving ESE. Then, the second kept moving WNW and the third came back into my line of vision.  It was following close behind.  The second one kept going until I couldn't see it for the structure of the building and the hills that surrounded.  The third one, then hovered in the same place that the first one had.  I, then, proceeded to show my other girlfriend who thought they were birds or stars.  I told her that birds don't go that high plus they don't hover in one place and that stars don't move.  She no longer paid attention to them as she was more interested in the concert.  She told me to stop looking at them but I didn't. Then, all of a sudden, the first one came back moving as swiftly as it did when it left.  It came back from the same direction it had disappeared to.  Once again, it was travelling WNW.  It passed by the third one (which was still hovering) very closely.  Then, the second one came back into view and they all started back in the ESE direction.  I, then, began to return more of my attention to the concert and every so often I would look up to see if they were still there.  Eventually, I looked up and I could no longer see them.  I don't know where they went after that point. The whole event lasted for approximately 20 minutes.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  I probably wouldn't have believed it if my friends would not have seen them also.  They looked just like moving stars.  They were graceful and smooth, almost entrancing.  I am just a 24 year old secretary.  I have never been interested in UFO's as a study.  Yet, I have always believed.  Now, I know.  I saw them with my own two eyes.  I know.",1999-06-23T00:00:00,,

Soon it seemed to become narrower but very elongated.  A bright pulse of light seemed to travel its length occasionally.  It was observed for 1.5 hrs. The incident I'm about to tell you about took place last night (June 8, 1999) at approx. 10:45 PM until past 1:00 AM (June 9th).  I live in Manchester, NH and was in my backyard. 	Last night about 10:45 I was taking a dip in the pool before going to bed & a bright light caught my eye.  When I looked up (towards the west, about 60 degrees) I saw a bright green rectangle of light behind the clouds.  I watched it for a few minutes then saw other bright green streaks light run parallel to it.  After about 4 minutes the rectangle lost its ""width"" but it was getting longer.  I ran in the house to get my wife, who came out shortly after..  BUT, my son  figured he'd come outside and amuse Dad.  I really figured I'd either imagined it or that there would be nothing there when they came out and they'd chalk it up to senility in the old man.  As soon as we got outside all I heard was my son say ""Oh my God"".  It was still there!!!  We watched it together for over an hour!  It's green light definitely ""pulsed"" & seemed to do a few ""chase"" patterns.  We saw some white flashes of light come out from the side of it.  Yes, we did call channel nine, the local TV station.  They said they'd love to have a look but probably couldn't get anybody to where we were.  I told them to just step out of the station and look up!  Her reply was that ""we're pretty busy here tonight"". 	This was like every sci-fi alien invasion movie ever made.  Two guys see it, no one believes it or checks it out.  I got out the video camera but I couldn't find it or focus on it thru the view finder. 	At times the light would seem long and narrow, sometimes whole, sometimes with a ""dark"" or unlit section in the middle.  Other times it seemed wider and the light more concentrated in a rectangular shape.  But it never regained the severe rectangular shape I first saw.  Another very strange thing was that it would suddenly ""turn off"", then on again.  It was partly to mostly cloudy during this time, but it's light was definitely visible through the clouds. Just before I finally went to bed I checked out the window & it was still there, but had gone from green to blue. 	  Anyway, I was just really grateful that my son & wife were there to see it too.  I'm trying to checkout NASA and the Nat. Weather Serv. to see if they reported anything.  There's no way we were the only ones to see this thing.  If it was a hoax of some kind, it was a good one.  I've seen the Borealis before & this definitely was not it.  It was west-south-west, about 60 to 70 degrees off the horizon.  I did check for comets and found that the Comet Lee may have been visible (if I read this info correctly).  Anyway, I know it may sound like I'm losing it...but I know we saw something, I just don't know what.  Any help you could give me would be greatly appreciated.

I was in my back yard at 1:10 am CDT helping my daughter check on her turtle in the pond.  I looked up at the western sky while talking to my daughter and noticed three, bright white lights in a horizontal row flying slowly to the west which I assumed was an airplane.  Something seemed strange about the lights - they were too big and too bright for a plane - so I watched it while talking with my daughter about her turtle.  Suddenly three bright red lights in a row came from the left side of the object with the three white lights and flew quickly off to the south. The object or three bright red lights flew off at a speed faster than any airplane would fly.  When I first saw the one object ""split"" into two objects, I froze in disbelief. My 13 year old daughter asked me what was wrong and I told her what happened.  She saw the two objects as they flew away.  There were no flashing lights on either object.  The objects were a little larger than the diameter of a dime held at arm's length. Both objects flew low and along the flight paths as planes that are landing at DFW Airport and that's why I thought the first object WAS a plane...until it split into two objects (I estimate the objects would have been over Lake Lewisville at the time they seemed to ""split"" into two objects - about 6 miles away).  These were not two planes crossing paths as I was looking straight at the first object and there were no other planes or lights in the area when the red lights suddenly emerged from the left side of the first object.  I heard no sound but probably wouldn't hear any sound from that distance anyway.  Right after I lost sight of both objects due to the trees I saw a bright flash of light like a beam of light coming from the ground to the north west of the objects but I only saw it once.  I stood outside watching the area for another ten minutes but did not see any more flashes of light or anything unusual.

About two weeks after I saw the UFO on June 7th, my daughter and I saw something flash/explode about 1/2 mile due north of our back yard - it lit up the whole northern sky.  Within 5 minutes of the flash/explosion, a helicopter arrived from the west and circled the area with two bright beams of light alternately circling and landing for over an hour seeming to search the ground for something (video taped it).

As I continued to watch I noticed that the lights did not move and they also were a distinctly different color than landing lights. I got my binoculars and the lights can only be described as a two separate very bright but deep amber in color with one light slightly lower than the other.  There appeared to be no connecting structure between the lights and no other lights associated with the object(s). I initially estimated the distance at about 10 miles (incorrectly). The sky was clear with many stars visible.  Visibility in the Phoenix area is nearly unlimited and lighted objects could easily be seen at night 100 miles on the low horizon. My wife, and daughter also watched the lights as they remained perfectly motionless. Suddenly, one light dimmed and turned off, then perhaps two seconds later the other turned off. Then a moment later both lights came on again in exactly the same location.  My daughter and I decided to get in the car and investigate at this point. We drove in the direction of the lights all the way into Phoenix, approximately 25 miles south while observing the objects on and off.  The separation between the lights widened as we got closer.  During the drive the lights turned on and off at least two times.  Finally, upon rounding the big bend going southbound at the top of the Squaw Peak highway the lights were clearly visible and obviously much closer. My best estimate of their physical location was approximately 3/4-1 mile west of the South mountain antenna farm, and at an altitude of perhaps 3-4000 feet above ground level. At this point the lights were approximately two and a half fingar widths apart at arms length and still at the same inclination angle but higher above the horizon. They appeared to be literally glued in place...no movement whatsoever. All of this was occuring in Phoenix Sky Harbor's very busy Class B controlled airspace!! Certainly the tower operators could have had a clear view of these objects to the southwest as they were only about 3 miles away.  At this time the objects were at an approximate 35 degree angle above the horizon. I am an aerospace engineer and private pilot. I roughly estimate the distance between the lights to be 500 feet gauging from the rate of change of spacing and elevation above ground over the distance. Upon reaching the turnoff to Sky Harbor airport the lights turned off and did not return. At home the lights were perhaps 5-10 degrees above the horizon. Our home north of Phoenix is actually 1000 feet higher in field elevation than central Phoenix, plus we had a clear an unobstructed view initially. The following morning I listened on the radio for any reports of the objects, but unbelievably there were no reports!  People see so much in the air that even if something is unusual it is simply shrugged off.  I would like to know if anyone else has seen these objects. They were visible for over an hour. I know these were not an aircraft lighting system, and they were too stationary to be an aircraft or airship.",1999-06-23T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

At 5:12 p.m. the sphere over the banana tree was gone. I sat for a couple minutes looking the sky over, and I found to the east two more. (Both looked the same as the first sphere over the tree.)  I watched these two spheres as they slowly headed west, stopping directly over an obvious incoming and outgoing flight lane. During that time a plane heading southwest for LAX pasted directly under the two spheres. I took two photos of this, but they did not come out.  I watched these two sphere’s for about 15-20 minutes, as two more planes (separate times) leaving LAX heading east had also passed under the objects. I snapped another 4 photo’s but these also didn’t come out.  A low cloud cover came through the area at 5:35p.m. I lost sight of the two spheres, as they passed through the clouds. When the cover burned off 10 minutes later I spotted directly over the moon another sphere heading west.  The moon was in the southeast portion of the sky. I took a picture of that sphere with the moon.  It came out but it only looks like a light spot with a dark bottom.  A few minutes later another sphere heading east passed over the moon. So now I was watching two spheres.  One is moving to the east, and one moving to the west. The second moving to the east was a lot closer. With the naked eye you could see structure to it.  It was obviously nothing conventional.  I had also taken pictures of these two spheres together. I had earlier in the afternoon seen a couple Mylar balloons drift by and when they became the size of the sphere’s you could still see the strings on the balloons, so I knew that what I was watching was not any balloon. All the spheres at some time went against the wind.  The balloons did not!  The sphere moving to the west eventually went out of sight.  The sphere moving to the east eventually positioned itself in one spot in the sky, and during that time other’s joined it. At one point there may have been as many as five spheres in the sky. It was hard to tell because they seemed to fade in and out. Thes! e spheres were very hard to see with the naked eye.  But once you spotted them you couldn’t miss them.

It passed in front of (underneath) a high white cloud and was clearly bright and visible even with the white cloud as background.  It passed into the cloud and was not visible for less than a minute, then came out of the cloud and continued.  About 7 minutes after I first started watching the light, it stopped in the sky, and stayed in the same spot for about 2 minutes.

The sky was bright and blue with a few scattered high fluffy white clouds.  I was sitting in the shade and wearing sunglasses, so I was looking around very comfortably.  I was looking north (towards the Holiday Inn at 1500 Washington Ave.), and at 4:35 p.m. I was enjoying the lovely sky and watching a couple of high clouds when I noticed a light moving very slowly from west to east across the north sky.  It was very high up and I immediately thought ""oh, a satellite"" like I've seen on clear nights away from the city.  It looked very much like a satellite, but a little bigger, like a small star - as bright, white, and clear as a star on a clear night.  Then I realized it was broad daylight, and I wondered if it's possible to see a satellite (so bright and clear!) in the daylight.  I watched it carefully, curious to make out what it was - but it was too far away - just a light like a moving star.  As I watched it I looked at with and without my sunglasses, and it was clearly visible both ways.  I'd been watching it cross the sky slowly from west to east for about 2 or 3 minutes when it came to a cloud.  I expected to lose sight of it, but was surprised to be able to clearly see it with the cloud in the background.  Even though it was a white light on a white cloud, it was bright enough to see clearly.  Then it passed into the middle of the cloud and I lost sight of it for about 45 seconds.  It came out of the cloud again and I continued to watch it move slowly east.  Two or 3 minutes later it stopped.  I wondered if it was changing direction and kept watching closely, but it just stayed still for at least 2 minutes.  While it was ! just sitting there in the sky, a bus passed in front of me, blocking it from view.  I expected to lose sight of it, but after the bus passed by I could see the light clearly, still sitting in the same spot.  About 1 minute later it vanished.  I was looking at it, and then it was just not there anymore.  I looked all over to see where it had gone, but I couldn't see a trace of it.

Moreover, as I continued to watch it all the way across the bridge, it did not move from its position. At about the half-way point across the bridge, as I observed the object, it did a rather amazing fade-out and became completely invisible. This was not due to cloud shade or the object changing its orientation since the geometry of the object remained exactly as before while doing the fade-out. Immediately after it disappeared, I looked in the sky around the area it had been and at that moment I noticed a commercial airliner flying overhead into the area that the object had just been. As soon as the airliner had traveled a bit out of the area where the object had been, the object did the exact opposite from before and did a fade-in and was exactly as it had been before.

Also, at this point we had been watching it a couple of minutes and it was moving in a straight line, no doubts.  No bird can move that straight. We discussed wether or not it was a plane, of which there was one in the sky to compare with and decided no. Aside from the shape, there was absolutely no sound emanating from the object.  A balloon, maybe, but at times it seemed flat and not round, as if it were a CD slowly spinning.  LET ME POINT OUT THAT THIS ANALAGY IS NOT ACCURATE< IT IN NO WAY SEEMED LIKE A SPINNING OBJECT. That merely describes the transition between the round appearance and the flat. While watching, it appeared once my eyes adjusted to the sky's light, that the disk was not black as first appeared but rather a charcoal grey, my wife however maintains that it was black. As it slowly moved towards a cloud, one with shape, not the usual cloudy Seattle sky, I started telling my wife it was a UFO.  She kept saying no, there is some explanation and was remaining very calm. I however was trying to get her to follow the UFO as it was moving by us. She threw away our trash, and started the car, we headed West on Bailey from Maruta's parking lot, the North on Corson Ave, but saw nothing, it was gone. I spent the next fifteen minutes trying to determine the time and direction of the sighting since we had neither a watch or map with us.  I think the information given here is accurate and correct.  Please call me for any other info you may need.  I will be checking the web sight regularly for further occurances by others.

Another similar light appeared a good distance away. During a severe thunderstorm, I looked out my office window to the West and observed a singular, very bright, orangeish light above the horizon. I have noticed a similar light there before, and thought it to be a planet. However, we were now in the midst of a strong thunderstorm, and there were no other lights to be seen. I went outside to get my binocculars, and to search the sky thouroughly in an effort to verify that there were no other lights to be seen. There weren't, and I became very curious about this one. I went back inside to continue to observe this light. As I was watching, Another light instantly appeared a fair distance away from the first one. This second light was identical in every observable detail. The only exception was that this one began to move slowly upward. It stopped for a while, and then it moved again to left. I was periodically observing this light with my binocculars, and After it had moved as described, it then stopped. Now It seemed to have other features. It seemed to have length, because it had other lights on it that allowed me to discern that it wasn't simply a glowing ball. the first ligh is still stationary at this point. The storm began to subside, and the sky cleared up. I went outside to get a better view. The second object began to ""drift"" away, until it was out of view entirely. Then, to the right of the first object, another light apeared. Very bright, and it was drifting east, (toward my viewpoint) then it stopped for about 10 seconds. The light that it was eminating was more white than orange, and as I observed it through my binocculars, the light, which resembled a spotlight to me, seemed to become more foccused in my direction, as if the craft was rotating slightly. It then began to move again, and proceeded to fly almost directly over my head. (However, these objects were not close at all, and it was very difficult to view any details) The only description I can give you is that it seemed to be rather long, based, again, on the lights I was observing on the craft. This object ""drifted"" out of view. When I turned my attention back to the first light, The one I first saw durring the storm, I noticed a much more interesting flying craft: Seen without the binocculars, it very much ressembled the other lights (Bright Glowing Ball) With the binocculars I observed Five lights associated with this craft: It seemed to be a rectangular object, Very large, with white lights at each corner, and a blinking red light in the middle. It seemed to be flying a large holding pattern over an area where there would be no reason to do this. (No Airport) I observed it repeating this pattern twice. Then it disapeared. The first light was no longer vissible when I went back upstairs. I don't know what all of this was, and I realize that it may be very explainable. But I have never observed such a display. I don't know what was hovering about, but I would love to speak to anyone else who saw this.",1999-04-26T00:00:00,38.7328,-90.1072

Drifted SW towards E.  No flashing lights. Soundless except for once when it seemed to drop shower of sparks or more lights - popping sound, as if fire-crackers. 2nd time it did this (no sound noticed) I had binocs on it - looked like it dropped 3 smaller lights, which vanished. At end, object seemed to go directly South, then faded & winked out. A plane in same general area later made obvious sound. About 1:10 am, April 8, 1999. Night exceptionally clear (and cold by Southern California standards) I was about to go to bed, but I happened to glance out kitchen window, which looks West. Saw a spot of orange light to SW at about 40 degrees above horizon. I went out on front deck, it was still there, but had moved even in that short time, heading East across South arc of sky. As it was cold, I went in house, grabbed my bathrobe and a pair of binoculars. The object appeared to be about 5 times apparent size of a large star, larger than a light of a plane would be. Color was orange - like the color of those supposedly fog-cutting street-lights (if you know what I mean). There were no flashing lights, just a steady glow. Twice it appeared to drop a series of lights from bottom. The first time, with naked eye, it looked like a shower of sparks. I thought I heard popping sounds, like distant fire-crackers. This was odd, because otherwise, the whole display was absolutly soundless. The second time I had my binoculars on it - it seemed to drop 3 seperate small balls of light, same color as main object. These small lights disappeared or winked out. I don't remember popping sounds the second time. The object had by this time traversed the sky from SW to a point directly south of me. The movement was not direct and purposfull like a plane, rather, it was more like drifting. At the end, it seemed like it was heading directly South. It faded a few times and then disappeared or winked-out. The only other detail I can think of to mention here is that I seemed to see several spikes projecting from the bottom of the object - this may be an artifact of scratches on my glasses or the general effect of looking at lights in the sky. The whole episode lasted 7-10 minutes. A few minutes later, a plane flew by in the same general area - compared to object, the plane was swifter, smaller, had flashing lights, and made obvious sound. What might it have been? The only conventional explanations I can think of are: 1-- a hot-air b! alloon (these are common in our area as a tourist attraction, thought not at night - I'm sure there's a law against that for safty reasons); it was silent, the large orange ball effect could have been the fire reflecting off and through the balloon itself, the dropping lights might have been sparks or falling, burning debris. There was no news report today of such an incident - and our local news loves balloon disasters. 2-- a flare drifting on a balloon or parachute, although a flare probably would not appear so large, and why would it be up there in the first place? I was the only observer - only my cat can verify that I was outside with binoculars late at night. Cardiff By The Sea is almost exactly 25 miles North of down-town San Diego and 20 miles or so South of Camp Pendelton, a large Marine Base.

Most aircraft in the area can be heard from about three to four miles up since I often measure time seen over time heard  parameters using my ears and eyes. There are about 10 to 12 lights total making up the object with half of the lights(5-6) making up one line of the V and the other 5 or 6 making up the other line. The angle in the V would be closer to  90 degrees than 45 degrees. The lights very much resembled typical 3 to 4 degree magnitude stars and each light remained equidistant from one another suggesting they were fixed upon a structure. They did not flash.    I would estimate the wing pattern to be about the size of a typical  727-737 jet at about 6,000-7,000 feet high which do fly overhead during the day and early night in the area which are always clearly heard. I had no idea until I looked up your web site that 3/13 was an aniversery date of a sighting. This sighting was 45 minutes past 3/13. I am quite shook about that.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,,

They were floating in space with a slow motion on straight lines, with abrupt change in direction, constant motion with the same pattern while they were gaining altitude, tll we lost the sight of them. At first they were under a low cloud [3,000 feet] making them very easy to see, then they moved on a Westerly direction away from the cloud and we were able to follow them clearly even with the stars on the background. At this point we stopped the car, turned the lights off and got out to get a better view of this weird sight that last for about 5 minutes. What we noticed was a constant size with the increase of altitude, we lost the sight because the brightness and color went less and less. The location was the city of Lihue on the island of Kauai, Hawaii and the lights were SouthWest from us, moving on a Westerly direction.

First I have to say that I NEVER believed in any such thing as a UFO. Never - until last night. It was about 1:30 am and my husband and I were getting ready for bed. My husband decided to let the dog out to do its business before we went to bed. Thats when he saw a bright white light (similar to a star) in the sky. He began yelling for me to immediately come to his side. When I came he asked me to look up in the sky and tell him what I saw. I was in complete shock. There was a light flashing at approx. 1 second intervals with a red light on the left and a green light on the right. The red and green lights were also flashing but not in unison with the white light. My first thought was that it was a dying star, but why were there red and green lights? Then the object began to move in quick speeds, first moving vertically up and then vertically down. The speed of the light was simply amazing. It was not something humanly achievable. Then the light began moving at an angle (approx. 70 degrees NE) with quick speed and again resuming back to its original location. Anytime the light would resume back to its original location, the light would slightly oscilate until stability was reached.  At times the light was at a stand still and did not move. It appeared that the light was not in our atmosphere, but slightly above, hovering over it. Then the light began to move in arch like motion across the sky with great speed and again returning with great speed back to the original location. This was no airplane, helicopter, or any man-made craft. The speed of this light was very quick and swift. There are no airports near me, nor any lakes (this was not a reflection of any kind). I must also add that NO sounds were emitting from the light.  It was silent. The light maintained this pattern for approximately 3 hours. I would also like to add that I was not drunk, under the influence of anything, nor am I an insane person. I know what I saw - believe what you want.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,,

Moved too fast for a STOL. At about 5:00 a.m. July 15 1998, I was walking my babbysiter home to her condo( we live in the same complex ), I noticed that there were two bright stars out, and recognised them as planets ( witch ones they were, I don't know, but am sure one was venus! ), also a half to almost three quarter moon. I showed them to my sitter, and we awed at how bright they all were even though the sun was starting to come up behind them. We were about three houses from the sitters when I looked up and saw another bright light that looked like another star, I told my sitter to look up, and immediatly she said "" hey look another big star! "" , I asked her if she noticed that it was moving in a jerking motion, and she said something silly about how ofcourse it was because everything is moving and orbiting.( ? whatever ) I told her to stop walking so we could get a closer look because even though there are two airports within a 10 mile radius, March A.B., and ofcourse Edwards not too far away that have aircraft flying over our community many times a day, and myself being an Air Force vetran who has worked on several types of aircraft, and familliar with many forigne ones to as part of that then profession, I could not recognize what I was seeing. At first I thought it was a civillian 747 type coming in for a landing with its landing gear lights on because it was so low, but it was going too fast to make a safe landing anywhere. Then I considerd it may be a jet fighter from one of the nearby bases with its lantern on, but yet the light was too bright, and other things came to mind why it couldn't be that. When it got just about over us I asked my sitter to look for any blinking lights, and to listen for the engine. As it quickly flew over us we did not detect any form of navigational, anticolision, beacon, or strobe light on it, and no noise came from it either. As it passed us  overhead we also looked for any kind of structure ( wings, tail etc. )it had none, just a big ball of light. Also when it got over us we could only se! e light, and at every position it was only light, for when a aircraft flys over you with any kind of light on, eventualy when it passes, the light is no longer that visable and you will see the back of the aircraft, this never happened. It maintained a complete light source at all angles. Well we didn't dottle around to see where it went because my sitter began to panic and wanted to go home quickly. I got her home, she went inside her house, and as I turned to leave for home it came back over, only this time it was much higher and faster. I considered that I was misstaken, that what I saw was realy just an airliner, and the second sighting was a sattelite, but it still seems way too odd. I mean the way it moved, the speed and alltitude were way off from the norm of any man made aircraft. I replay it in my mind, and talk to my sitter to confirm what had happened. I also find myself watching the ussual parade of aircraft flying over at different times of day trying to reenact what I saw, and still nothing comes close to it. I'm sure there is probably an explaination for it, but I doubt I'll ever know what exactly it was. I just thought it was real weird, and it went against my years of knowledge in aircraft flight. It may just have been experimental goings on. Who knows? I've never realy been a big believer in E.T UFOs in any case.",1998-11-21T00:00:00,34.15461809338521,-117.30409630350195

We were returning from our walk, about 5 minutes from our home, when my boyfriend pointed to the south sky and said ""look, twins"", jokingly. As I turned to look, I at first assumed they were planes, but as my boyfriend and I continued to look, the two lights stayed in exactly the same spot, parallel to each other and about two inches apart if you were to measure the distance with your fingers.  The objects were about twice the size an brightness of Venus, which at the time was off in the west sky. We were dumbfounded, and even though I kept repeating ""They must be planes"", we both clearly saw and stated that they were not acting like planes.  They stayed in exactly the same place, pulsating but not flashing. Then, to our amazement, a third appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, to form a triangle to the other two. The third was not as bright at first, but then grew in brightness to look just like the other two.  They remained in this inverted triangle formation for some time, a few minutes or so.  At this point, a car with 4 young men in it, all aged between about 18 and 22, drove up beside us, also having seen the sight. They said they'd seen it down on the road, and were looking for a clearer view of it.  At the time, we were up on a hill. We all agreed that these did not appear to be planes, and my boyfriend and myself expressed that we were glad not to be the only ones to see it.  The men drove off, and said goodbye pleasantly. Then, the light in the upper left corner of the triangle began to leave.  It moved slowly to the east, decreasing in brightness rather quickly.  Still the other two remained in the same spot. Then the bottom sphere began to follow the first one, heading in the same path.  The last one remained in the same spot for about 5 more minutes, an we watched, not moving.  Then, it too began to head east.  We ""followed"" it, as our apartment is in that direction.  We thought we might be able to run in the house, grab the binocs, come back out and catch it...but by the time we came out it was gone. My boyfriend and I stayed out there, watching the sky for about another 15 minutes, but saw nothing.  We both agreed that neither of us had ever seen any objects in the sky behave that way in our lives.

It was slide slipping like a blimb with NO noise as you would expect a blimp to do in the wind. It was 18:00 (6 P.M.), on 7/13/99 at Owens Beach in the Point Defiance Park in Tacoma, WA. The sky was clear blue with NO clouds whatsoever. It was late afternoon and my 2 year old son and I were looking at aircraft leaving and approaching Sea-Tac airport. From Owens Beach, airplanes appear to be approximately 5,000 feet in altitude and about 1 to 5 miles away depending on which aircraft we were looking at on a particular moment. All the commercial craft had that late afternoon reflectivity that makes them really stand out against the blue sky. ALL the airplanes we saw had visible control surfaces on them and made the usual jet 'noise'. All, that is, EXCEPT this one. I was looking over my right shoulder. From the South East, coming about the direction of Ruston Way, here in Tacoma, was what I thought to be a Boeing 777. But, it had no discernable wings that I could see. It appeared to be then approximately 3,000 to 5,000 feet in altitude and about 3 miles away, (about the width of my thumb at arms length). I then listened for any jet 'noise', there were none. Then I looked at the tail. The only tail visible was a shorter than usually vertical stabilizer. A little background is due here; I am always looking at aircraft in the sky (I have had a love for them and have been doing so for many years now). The reason I bring this up is to relay to you that I know how they should look, sound, and behave, dependant on the conditions and time of day. Back to what happened; The craft is heading almost overhead now and I can still see NO wings or horizontal stabilizers. There is still NO noise either! It is now about the size of a half-dollar at arm's length. The aircraft is now heading from over head, due north, to the southern tip of Vashon Island. Now I am really concentrating on the physical behavior of the craft as it heads due north from my position. Let's see; 1) Still NO noise 2) NO Wings 3) NO horizontal stabilizer 4) Shorter than normal vertical stabilizer 5) The fuselage shape is correct for a Boeing 777. Blunt nose and a tail that comes to a point, (NOT fat like a blimp, or even the shape of a 747 would be) 6) Speed looks right (much too fast for a blimp) approximately 300-400 mph 7) Consistent forward momentum 8) Pitch is flat, (a little too flat, NOT climbing OR descending) 9) Wait a minute, it's the yaw... That isn't right... What I noticed about the yaw is this; What ANY aircraft does in a turn is bank. This didn't. It would yaw (turn) 30-40 degrees to the left in a smooth motion taking about 5 to 10 seconds to do so WITHOUT banking! The vertical stabilizer is still completely vertical. Then it would turn forward (due north, FOLLOWING it's forward momentum direction) in the same 5-10 second period. Then it would turn right, the same 30-40 degrees at the same 5-10 second period. All turning id done WITHOUT modifying its forward momentum's direction. I have observed a lot of aircraft in my lifetime and NEVER seen anything like this. It was behaving like whoever was controlling this craft was being as inconspicuous as possible and controlling it so it would 'blend-in' with the other commercial aircraft in the area. One final thing about the commercial flight path for this date was that this was the only commercial 'looking' craft that was NOT in the same flight corridor. All the commercial aircraft I saw this day from Owens Beach were traversing from the N.E. to the S. W. (or visa versa). This craft game from the S.E., headed almost overhead, and then headed due North from me.",1999-07-14T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

It was bright orange. It stayed, then left, and they saw it explode far up in the sky. Last night my girlfriend saw a UFO. We live in far Northern California, Humboldt County. She was at her sister's in the yard at 10:30 p.m. They were unloading fruit from the truck. She saw something come from the north. Then it came right over them, rather close like a helicopter. At first she thought it was the police, but then thought that didn't make sense, because there was no reason for the police to come. But she also noticed there was NO sound. Also, it was bright orange. It stayed over them for awhile, then suddenly turned left and took off. She knew no plane could do that. When it started spinning and took off, she said there were many different colored lights around it. It went to the left and went, but then she said something happened. Suddenly it exploded, and she described the pieces falling like pieces of a falling star. She was very frightened from the experience. She speaks Spanish mostly, but fairly good English. I know her very well, and she and her family are very wonderful and reliable people. Her husband didn't want her to say anything because he said people would think they were crazy. She and her sister both saw it happen. They know me real well (as I run a very large Neighborhood Watch) and asked me to look into who they could report it to, or if anything like that was reported by anyone else. (Also, she happens to be pregnant, which concerns me, because I study the subject of UFO's a bit.I am familiar with alien abductions, fetuses, etc. Of course I would not discuss that subject with her. Just want to give you the details.) Anyway, I don't know who to contact about this. We'd like to find out if there were other reports, but living in a seme-small town, the police department is closed Saturday, and we don't know anywhere to call. There are more details that you ask for here, but I don't know the answers. She does. So I'm filling out what I know. Hope to hear from you. I will put you in touch with her. (I will leave a message on your hotline if I find that number on your website, so I have marked the box below, in advance of making the call.) My friend saw a UFO in the sky at night. It came towards them and stayed above them for awhile. Then it took off, and seemed to explode. ((NUFORC Note:  The following text is the first report submitted by the same sourcs.)) Last night a girlfriend of mine, saw an unidentified object in the sky. We'll call her Lucia (she wishes to remain anonymous). Lucia was driving to her sister's about 10:00 p.m. Her sister lives in a trailer park. When Lucia turned into the driveway of the park, there was a very bright beam of light coming from an object that was located ahead of her (north). It was low in the sky and the beam of light shone at a slight degree just above her. She was startled at the light and the object. So she turned left into the trailer park and parked in front of her sister's house. She was frightened and honked her horn so her sister would come out. Lucia's sister, and her sister's boyfriend came out of the house. At that point, looking to the north, the object no longer had a beam of light coming from it, but it came over the trees and then stayed stationary right over the house. It was very hard for me to determine how large the object appeared to them, as Lucia speaks limited English and her sister only speaks Spanish, however an enterpretor was there. Lucia's sister said when she came out of the house, it was about 10:15 p.m. The three speculated as to what the object could be. When she first observed it while driving, Lucia thought it was a helicopter, but after seeing it out of the car, it did not appear to be a helicoper. It appeared to be a large orange-like object. Lucia also noted and said to the others that it made no noise. They all agreed it was not an airplane, as it was stationary in the air above them. They were all frightened. Then after about 10-15 minutes, the object started whirling...spinning, and three lights appeared when that happened. The lights were different colors. When that happened the object immediately headed eastbound, but still at a lower altitude. Suddenly, Lucia said they saw what appeared to be an explosion...like two pieces (like falling stars they said), falling down from the object. At that it disappeared. They thought it exploded, which accounted for why they couldn't see it anymore. They said it did look like an explosion. When they came back into the house, it was about 10:30p.m. The thing I was most concerned with is the fact that Lucia is pregnant. Knowing what I have researched about alien abductions, I am concerned (however, did not tell her that). As we were all talking today about the incident, I asked if anything strange or unusual ever happened to them. Lucia's sister said there have been many UFO's seen in Mexico. Lucia's sister said when she was 14 yrs. old she lived in Colima, Mexico. At about 10:30 p.m. she went outside to use the outhouse. She found herself back in her home at about 3:00 a.m. She didn't know what had happened to her and mentioned it to her mother. She emphasized to me, while telling me the story, that she was extrememly nervous and upset after the episode of missing time. Anyway, her mother said she was imagining things, that she was crazy, and not to talk about it. Still, later in years, when she was about 3 months pregnant with her child (now 10), she was living in Santa Ana, California, in a house that was not well lit by the sun. One day a very bright light shone through the windows, and she collapsed on the bed. She awoke sometime later, and had some marks on her body. Her husband thought they were ""hickeys"" from another man. As Lucia said, it was the main reason her sister's marriage broke up. Today Lucia's sister she said she was very disturbed about what she saw last night. She said it brought back those memories of what I just stated happened to her. She is very nervous now and wishes she never saw the object, because she is afraid. Her boyfriend would not speak about it. Lucia said he is scared. Lucia and her sister said, that once you see an object like that, you will surely see it again, and they are both afraid.",1999-08-10T00:00:00,40.76192392638037,-124.13557055214723

Concerned that a jet craft was in trouble and was attempting to land I went back into the building.  As it continued to approach I got oncerned that it was going to hit the building so I went back outside to the parking lot to get to my car.  I heard an extremely loud hum from the aircraft and relized at that time it was hovering about 300 feet in the air approxiamately 1/8 to 1/4 of a mile from my position.

From the belly of the main craft appeared a probe which dissappeared into the trees.  Eventually the wing tip lights separated from the main craft's wings and one flew East and the other flew West. A few minutes later the main craft flew South West and dissappeared over the mountains.  The entire form of the craft(s) were vague -almost opaque.  The red portal lights were prominent.  It looked like a jet liner on approach in a fog, however, the evening was clear and most important was extremely windy.  Wind gusts in the mountain that day were clocked at 155 miles per hour.

The object had great speed and no sound or light was evident. Over the past few days 1-25-99 until yesterday 1-31-99 I've seen some interesting things in the sky over north Scottsdale in AZ. I wont speculate on what I saw but I will provide this brief explanation. The rear balcony of my 2nd story apartment faces east - north/east overlooking Stone Creek Golf coarse so I've a very clear view with little or no obstruction. The other day I was relaxing on my balcony just enjoying the sky as I am an amateur astronomer. Then I saw a streak in the sky low on the horizon about 10 degrees. This streak was black against the darkening sky, and triangular in shape. The time was around 6:30 pm and the sky was turning a deep low saturation purple as is does here in the desert. The shape almost reminded me of an orderly flock of birds but it was clearly not birds as the speed was way to great and there was no variation in its shape, it was solid. The object covered at least 45 degrees horizontally in about 2 seconds. I estimate the object to be approximatly 2 to 4 miles distant making it quite large about the size of an f-15 or larger. At first I thought this is what I must have seen but there were no lights and no reflected light the only way I saw the object was due to the fact that it obscured the darkening sky. The sky was dark but the object was much darker. There was no sound and what seemed to be a dark streak or trail behind the object. I noticed that I could more clearly see the object by not looking directly at it. As all astronomers know when looking at very faint objects it is best to not look directly at the object due to the make up of the human eye, rods and cones. I've a very clear understanding of aircraft, speed, size and action. Just to the north east of me is the Scottsdale Airpark, an airport that can handle many types of jets up to small passenger jets. It is a very busy airport and at any time you can see 4 to 6 jets on approach from the north. I know how fast a leer jet looks as it takes off and lands and this object was approximately 5 times that. Well after this first sighting a couple days ago I didn't give it much more thought, I don't need to dwell on such things as I've seen many unexplained things in the sky. Well yesterday I saw  2 more such objects in the same place at the same time with 2 friends who also saw something. This time I saw the object for a good 90 degrees horizontally it was not quite as dark so I could see it more clearly. This occurred just after the full moon had cleared the mountains in the distance. Again there was no sound and the shape was triangular. I saw one and then within a few seconds another one. I could clearly point at it and follow it across the sky telling my friends as it crossed various reference points such as houses and the moon. I'll be watching the desert skies at dusk in that area everyday now with my camcorder in hand.",1999-02-16T00:00:00,33.56413757440476,-111.9050830357143

I looked out and immediately noticed a reddish-orange glowing roundish object on the horizon.  I scrambled to put on my glasses.  We noticed that the object was very far and with its size about 50% larger than the sun when it sets down.  The object was slightly obscured (maybe it was its shape) by the clouds.  It was also quickly moving down into the water.  By the time I found my binoculars and a camera the object was 40% into the water/horizon.   It soon dispeared into the horizon.  The whole experience took about 3-5 minutes.   My wife claimed to have seen the aicraft extinguished its lights as it went over the affected area through her binoculars --- I can't verify that. We also noticed a great number of lights blinking on the ocean horizon, approximately 10-25 miles.  These lights were all evenly spaced between each other, covering most of the horizon visible from our window.  The lights were all white with the exception of the two lights, one green and one red, between which the object disappeared.   These lights were also the closest between each other.

The lights were active as we went to bed 2 hours later. I am college educated and well read.  This is a first UFO experience for both of us.

Then again after a few minutes of observation the craft took off straight in the air (the weather was clear over the pass). My friend and I were returning home from dinner near Los Angeles International Airport and were driving on the San Diego Freeway ( the 405) when I noticed this strange light in the sky moving north my guess is near the Pacific Ocean.  It struck me as strange because planes and helicopters have a blinking red light and this object did not. So as we were driving north on the 405 we were watching the object disappear in a cloud bank(low clouds moved in as is usual June weather here) and then we just didn't think of it. We continued to drive and after we got over the Sepulvida Pass(a hill that seperates the San Fernando Valley from West Los Angeles) we saw the object again. (still continuing north in the San Fernando Valley) the as we went from the San Diego Freeway north to the Ventura Freeway east the object just took straight off in the sky.

We had just passed over Lake Mead; I had the left window seat.  I saw Bullhead City, where I often vacationed.  I did not see Las Vegas, so it must have been on the right of our plane. We were probably travelling almost directly along the California/Nevada border.  Judging from my atlas, the aircraft I saw was probably in the vicinity of Death Valley (valley), in California, somewhere in an area bounded by Cima, Shoshone, Ballarat and Barstow. We had just passed directly over another commercial jetliner, much below our altitude.  I looked up to see a black, jagged, roughly-rectangular aircraft slowly rise to our same altitude, going very slow, counter to our direction, gradually stopping relative movement and seeming to stay even with our flight. It appeared about half the size of the other aircraft (737's) we passed, which all shone brightly light in the clear sun.  This craft made a densely-black silhouette; no wings or fins were apparent.  It did not diminish in size as it would have if it were travelling away from us. It was west of us, at roughly ten o'clock out the window. I watched it for a few minutes. I looked away for approximately 1 to 2 seconds, and looked back.  It had totally disappeared from the cloudless sky. I have been a bird watcher for years, so know how to scan for flying things. We were at full altitude, above the haze line.  I estimate it was 2 to 10 miles from us.  I did not know about Area 51 until after the flight, when I spoke with the pilot.  He said we were in that area at the time I described, and that many unusual sightings had been reported there.

Stars in field of view did not exhibit similiar strobing, and lights appeared brighter than usual ICAO marker lights of aircraft.

Sky conditions were clear, and stars in visible field of view did not exhibit similiar strobing effect. Object was much brighter than nearby stars in field of view.  Strobing was brighter/faster than usual ICAO marker lights. 2 Witnesses to this event. Object was observed for app. 30 minutes and remained stationary for entire period. During this observation object was observed through  8 X 40 power binoculars, and the strobing appeared to be a circular, primarily bright white with the blue and red flashes in rotation around the white light. The white light was almost glaring and the object appeared to have a clearly defined/sharp profile, like the light from a lazer pen rather than a flashlight, for example. Observers thought light was curious but attributed to perhaps a blimp or atmospheric phenomena. Observers viewed object until 2345 then returned to residence.

There is a regional airfield to the NE of the observation point approx. 5 miles away, and this airfield hosts reserve helicopters.

Observer of 2105L sighting professional with BS degree currently completing Masters, observers of 2315L sighting (1) degreed ex Air Force Intelligence veteran (2) college bound HS student. Observers discovered mutual sighting event during conversation on morning of May 16th. Observers are familiar with pattern of star motion over residence, and considered if the two sighting were of the same object it was unlikely to be a star or plant, as the object would have had to move south to north. If the observations were of different objects the observers found it curious that other stars/planets in field of view did not exhibit similar strobing effect. And if object was an aircraft then itwas stationary/hovered, and the ICAO markers were about twice the magnitude of those normally observed from passing aircraft. We have had blimps in past years, but the observed strobing was dissimilar to the advertising lights normally seen from them in the past. Of particular curiousity was the fact the the object was completely stationary during observations, and did not exhibit movement as the star field moved. Observers are curious as to what they may have observed; skeptical about supernatural explanation but thought sighting worthwhile for investigation.

There were lights on the three points of the spade and interior lights that seemed to give the craft 3 decks at its thickest point.

However, the lights (and there first appeared to be two or three) did not move from that location for quite some time. These light flashed in a vertical fashion, much like the lights on an airplane. After pulling into our driveway, my daughter and I watched those lights for several minutes....as we watched them, there appeared to be another light of a green color which appeared to the left of the flashing set of lights. This green light (which did not flash or pulsate) shone for maybe 10-15 seconds, then seem to disappear. My wife came outside and she saw the flashing lights as well and maybe thought it was a cell telephone tower, since these lights were not moving and they seemed to be at the same height in the sky. Just after both my daughter and wife went into the house, I noticed a red light which appeared on the right isde of the flashing lights. As with the green light, it lasted but a few seconds before fading off. After about 20 minutes or so, the lights (which had been staionary) appeared to very slowly move toward the west. In the last five minutes or so, the lights seemd to pick up speed and very soon had disappeared in almost a straight line westward. The entire sighting lasted about 50 minutes or so. It was difficult to determine a shape. However, like I stated earlier, the white flashing lights were vertical and just on occasion would either the red or green light to the side show. Twice to my recollection the red and green light appeared at the same time and then faded. There were at least two planes in the sky that night, one directly over our house and another moving from west to east at what looked to be a lower point in the sky.

I previously thought it landed close by. I saw what appeared to be a meteor passing by me at possibly subsonic speed descending at an extremely acute angle to the earth's surface.  Fireball was bluish green (possibly the nickel composition) and a 3 to 400 yard  tail of the same color.  The speed was remarkable considering its acute angle it maintained till it went down.  I thought it hit the ground close to Waples Pond on Route One, but I understand other people saw it land in a field near Lewes; and again I received email from Delaware State News employee saying they saw it pass East of Millsboro, Delaware.  That's about 25 miles difference; it was difficult to judge since it seemed to be so close to the ground and then the intense light went out.  Since it was dark, I might have lost track of it as it past me due to trees, etc.  At any rate, I called 911 to make sure that they new of a possible impact and/or fire; they probably thought I was crazy.  Many people had to see it, because it was traveling approximately 150 yards south of route 1. The fireball was somewhere between the size of a baseball or larger than a basketball...it was impossible to distinguish by the violent ball of fire.  It was just beautiful and something I will never forget.  Maybe some farmer or some hunter trekking through the field/woods will find it someday and we can recall this moment all over again!  I imagine there is a lot of mass left because it maintained such great speed.  Because of such an acute angle, it either skipped across the ground or left a large gash on the earth's surface.  I don't think it can hide forever!  Wish I had time to investigate, check for large burn area, etc...this is a large area to cover.  I talked to radio station and also State newspaper and they're putting the word out, too. Above statement was used to report to other people I know in Delaware. Since then, I have come to the conclusion that what I saw relative to my traveling south in my car was seemingly close, but may have been several miles away and with a higher altitude.  Nevertheless the relative speed must have been faster than I originally thought.  From what a few people have told me, I have rough coordinates...it may have landed in the Indian River, a body of water in Southern Delaware.  I know more people saw this as it was traveling within obvious view of Route One which heads north and south, becoming route 113 by Dover AirForce Base and north. Delaware State News recommended I report this to you. Please let me know if there were any other sightings beyond Southern Delaware. Thanks in Advance!
