On first glance I thought it was a low flying plane then that didn't seem right so I figured it was a cell phone tower with exceptionally bright lights at the top. The shape of the object was horizontal bright lights at either end and dimmer lights in between.  As I got closer to the object it became obvious that it wasn't a cell phone tower because it seemed to be right over the highway.  I was actually able to drive under the lights. As I got closer and was actually under the object the shape seemed different... The bright lights and dimmer lights were still there but I seems to have a different shape...there were more lights and they were different colors. I have never seen anything so strange before, and as I drove under it, the object seemed almost stationary.  I didn't hear any noise or experience any loss of power in my car. There were other cars around me at that time but I have no idea if anyone else saw the object other than me.  As I passed under the object I glanced in my rearview mirror to see if I could still see the object but it seemed to have disappeared.  In an attempt to explain the lights I scanned the area behind me see if I could see where they came from but there was no bright lights or anything that could have produced them...

I assumed that it was a star, planet, or perhaps an aircraft moving straight toward me, and appearing to be mostly stationery. Nothing about its appearance at this point was especially noteworthy.  Then, suddenly, from its stationery point in the sky, the object appeared to drop rapidly straight toward the horizon. The object appeared to simply fall from the sky. It moved far more rapidly than any conventional aircraft could have moved.  Simply stated, it looked like a very bright star that came unstuck from the fabric of the sky and fell downward. It was quite a remarkable sight. I saw it clearly and I am certain that I am not mistaken about what I saw.  As it fell, my view of the object was occluded by buildings closer to the horizon.

(Padre Islands) I was with my family on vacation down on the Padre Islands in the south of Texas. This long, skinny island is fairly close to the Mexican border. We were staying at the Holiday Inn on the southern part of the island. I decided to go out and take some pictures to see if I could get any cool shots. I fiddled around a bit with some settings and took a few pictures, most of which weren't very good. As I was aiming a picture of the waves, I noticed a light shooting accross the sky. It was rather sudden and at first I thought it was a shooting star. I continued to look, expecting the light and tail to disintegrate as a shooting star/meteorite would, however it didn't. I came to the realization at that point that it was something that either entered the atmosphere, or was already in the atmosphere. It had a trail that dissapeared as it got closer to over my head. I continued to watch this spectacle as it shot across the sky at a VERY fast pace. As it flew I thought it was a bird, something simply mistaken for something else. My human curiosity kept me watching this object. I felt my heart drop when the object flew accross the moon. I will never forget the statling image I saw then. A disk shaped object, clearly a disk, shot across the moon, it's color a light amber, glowing as it were, (possibly from entering the atmosphere.) The image continued it's east-to-west flight across the sky. As it flew away I could only think of the possible explanations for the object. All my compiled theories shattered when the vessel banked hard left about a thumbs legnth from where I was standing above my hotel. The vessel nearly stopped when it banked left, and it continued it's path west. I didn't hear any audible engine sounds, only the slight roar of the ocean. The event occured at exactly 9:00 pm and I was only one of a few people on the beach, but when I asked them about it, they said they hadn't seen anything.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,26.0968,-97.3168

Initially, We thought we were seeing a bolide, or a very large meteor, which appeared directly overhead, very near the star Vega, in the constellation of Lyre.  As it proceeded directly northward, it increased, then decreased in brightness, and once more  increased magnitudinally,  and subsequently exploded into at least two parts, each diverging from the other, with the contrail appearing white, and the point of fracture an electric blue.  The time of the transit from zenith, or first appearance overhead, to obscurity, due to local roof tops, ( approx. 15 degrees above N) was estimated to be between 8 to 10 seconds. Now this would normally be considered a natural celestial event, were it not for the events that followed 15 minutes later.  While discussing what we had just seen, and looking straight upward, again, in the region of Vega, and through a thin ridge of Cirrus,  Two objects,  the brightness a bit less of Arcturus, suddenly dropped into the sky, and proceeded on a track Nothward and slightly West of the track of the ""meteor"" we had seen earlier.  These two objects were what i would describe as being a delta form wing,  almost bird-like, yet, gave not notion of being avian in intent or motion.  In fact, they reminded me of old Korean War era jet fighters with everything removed from the cockpit and wing on down...they had no tail assembly.  I thought perhaps they may be geese or something, yet, their light was constant and almost seemed internal, and not reflective at all.  The light from these objects did not change at all due to the ambient city lighting.  There was no sense of fluttering or wing motion.  They simply 'floated', did zig zags, heading Northward, and one always seemed to go off course, then return, as if seeking something.  The two would diverge, converge, and fly in unison.  At one point, within a second, one returned to the other in the snap of a finger, travelling si! deways. Lateraly, at speed.  These were no geese!!  There was no noise, no contrails, just the off white, egg shell glow, and they did travel quickly.  The time elapsed from dropping from the sky overhead to disappearance would be roughly estimated as 40 seconds.   I have no idea of size or speed, other than the were below the cirrus cloud from which they appeared, (20 K?) and travelled 70 degrees of sky withinin 40 seconds.  And  they were in clear sky all the way northward after the cirrus bank.   As my friend and i had discussed at the time, they seemed to be Searching.  Perhaps it was coincidental with the meteor.  OK... AND then, as if it could not get stranger, again overhead,  an object , not 20 minutes after the sighting of the two 'floaters', comes, from the south , a Tube or a Cylinder, again with the same glow, heading perhaps towards Toronto. And the reason i say towards Toronto is because a comercial jet flew its normal track 3 minutes earlier and this tubey thing seemed to fly in that direction.  I do not have friends in,  or access to ATC..but 5 will get ya 10 that either RADAR or one of the pilots saw something tonight.   There are things we see and things we miss, but having seeing this, i cannot dismiss the things that are in my gut.   Something fell from the Sky tonight.  Two things went and looked for it.  Later, a device, either conjoined or unique to itself, flew over my head.  Same colour, yet, as we thought, together.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,43.54310637254902,-80.2533625

I was about one and a half miles east of the 4,020 ft. elevation summit of Loup Loup Pass.  I was approaching milepost 216 when I noticed a fiery object and two distinct, very bright lights leaving a gaseous trail in the pre-dawn sky through the dark, top of the forest canopy and then into the open, pale blue, dawn  sky.  The 2 distinct lights and the bright, fiery, gaseous trail that followed were headed due north over the Methow Valley as I watched while taking my foot from the accelerator peddle to begin slowing down as I approached a curve in the highway.  I initially thought it must be a meteor or shooting star but I realized it was on an upward arc from Earth and going against gravitational pull. This fact immediately aroused my curiosity and suspicion as to what I was witnessing in the sky above myself.  While trying to maintain visual contact with the lights in the sky, I began applying the brakes to my vehicle and quickly pulled over to the shoulder of the highway and came to a stop.  I shut off the engine before I had come to a full stop and proceeded to exit the vehicle on to the highway while still keeping my attention fixed on the 2 lights to the west.  As I stepped out of my vehicle, the 2 lights I was watching became very bright and shifted their course due east, towards myself.  The bright, gaseous trail disappeared with the sudden, smooth change in direction from due north to due east, but the two lights became much brighter as the direction of travel shifted.  The two lights also went from trailing one another while traveling northward to changing positions with one light being on top of the other while they began tracking to the east.  As the lights began coming eastward, towards myself, I noticed they were contained inside a visible oval shape that revealed itself against the pale blue dawn sky.  The shape was a definitive oval, with the previously mentioned lights wit! hin the circumference of said oval shape.  The area within the oval shape was transparent, yet it appeared liquid like or ""aura"" like, compared to the actual sky.   This translucent oval shape was approximately one half mile in length and several hundreds of feet in overall height.  The original two lights I mentioned earlier were the brightest part of what I saw. The light that was in the vertical position over the other respective light was at the ""bow"" of the oval UFO while the second light remained in the ""stern"" position. There were numerous smaller lights attached to or contained within the large, oval, translucent form that silently passed before and above myself and the tree tops in front of myself.  The UFO passed east bound over the  Loup Loup Ski Area, above myself and the tree tops and then kept traveling towards the towns of Omak and Okanogan, as I watched while standing outside of my vehicle in the center of Highway 20 at milepost 216. I was able to maintain a visual fix on the UFO for a total of 25-30 seconds before it passed out of my sight above the Okanogan forest in the pre-dawn skies on Tuesday, July 1, 2008.  There were no audible sounds coming from the UFO.  There was heavy thunder and lightning activity in the area before the sighting.  The skies were clear at the actual time of the sighting.

I was on my cell phone at the time and was looking at the sky at an airplane that was flying near by. Around the middle part of the airplane contrail I notice this silver, metallic/chrome/shiny looking object flying around the trail. I couldn’t really see it up close, but I did notice that the sun was reflecting off its surface and its movement was sporadic and really quick. It went back and forth. It was further back from the airplane and it looked nothing like the airplane so I definitely dismissed it as -- an airplane. It went through the trail and then flew fast upward and then disappeared.  Now, I know what airplanes look like and this wasn't an airplane! It was round -- at least it looked round maybe more like an oval is more like it. It's movement really freaked me out. I told my friend who I was talking to at the time that I had just seen something really strange (remember I was on my cell at the time). I watched it for about 5 minutes and then it did its thing as I described above.

I was just a few miles outside of San Antonio putting gas in my car and after I left, while at the four way stop I noticed an object in the sky above a field. At first I thought it was a U.S. Border Patrol Helicopter tracking illegals. But then it moves rapidly across the sky. The only way to describe how fast it moved and ca,e to a complete stop, is just like the pointer on the computer when you slide the mouse across the screen.  This gained my interest so i tried to use my cell phone video but I couldn't get anything on the screen. So I just drove towards it and when I got close enough to see what it was, it climbed higher in to the sky where i couldn't make it out. I parked my car and went and got my camera out of the trunk. When I focused on the object I still could see exactly what it was but I could see it flashing it's lights. they went from red to green to blue to yellow then all the colors at the same time. I snapped the picture and as soon as the flash on my camera went off the object started coming closer to me.  At this point I thought the safer place to be was in my car. As the boject got closer it began flashing just like a camera flash. I drove away as fast as I could and then the object passed over my car and disappeared. It was only about a minute later that I saw the object slong side of my car. I only noticed it when it began to flash again. I text my friend and let her know what was going on. By the way, she is the one that gave me this number. Anyway, I took an exit an headed towards Cambleton. I figured I would try and drive to the only store there and just kinda let whatever it was go away. There was nothing open in Cambleton and then I saw the object again just over me and it flashed again. Then I figured the only thing safer to do was to get back on Interstate Highway 37. As I was driving down the road headed back to IH-37, the object was there. This time I saw it. It was at car level and just to my side. It is the strangest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. It looked like a helicopter and the texture of it was just like looking at the pavement on the road but it had a white glow all around it. The object passe me up on the drivers side of my car and went up about 100 yards in front of me. I stopped my car as fast as I could and the object came closer towards me .  I just sat there for a few seconds trying to think of what I was going to do next. I tried to call my friend to tell her what I was facing but my phone would not work at this point. I reversed but the object quickly gained distance between us. So I just put the car in park and said enough is enough. I am a police officer and I always carry my side arm with me so I grabbed it and got out of my car. As I raised my weapon and pointed towards the object, it let out multiple stobes of flash blinding me and I must say the heat was quite intense. So I lowered my weapon since I couldn't see then the flashing stopped. I yelled at the thing while gaining my vision back but all I could hear was my car and nothing else. After a few moments of nothing happening just looking at the thing in front of me not moving just floating idle . I raised my weapon again and the flashing began again and just the same stopped when I lowered it. After gaining my vision back I got back into my car and tried to reverse again. It came towards me and flew over my car then I put my car in drive and drove towards IH-37. The object was nowhere to be seen .  After making it back onto IH-37, I drove for a while and then here was the object again a few minutes later. I stayed with me for about thirty more minutes flashing at me and then going away momentarily back and forth. At this point I made the call to your office and left a message.  Then I came up to a thunder storm and the object just gained altitude and I never saw it again. So after getting home and not really sleeping to much when I did wake up in the morning I noticed I was sun burned. That's my weird story . This isn't in any way a hoax or a joke. In fact I wish it never would have happened. However I do want to get some sort of answer or expalnation as to what it could have been.  Please take this serious and if you can not get me some sort of answer then could you please put me in contact with someone who may have some answers for me.  Thank you.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,29.488865917141535,-98.4752404435546

What made me curious was particular groups of these aircraft with red and green flashing lights appearing to be flying in formation in groups of threes. I also noticed Several larger aircraft with the same red and green lights and two larger white lights in the back as they flew over me at very high speeds. These planes were obviously not UFO’s but while I was observing these planes I noticed a star like object hovering much lower than the other planes and traveling at a  faster speed. Occasionally the object would slow down a bit and appeared to wobble in a short circle and speed back up again. I observed this object for about ten minutes until it disappeared behind some trees. I then made several phone calls to friends in the area telling them what I saw. I proceeded to walk home when I noticed several more star like objects move higher in the sky. I then noticed one of the larger planes flying towards one of them at a high speed. The object then appeared to fly much higher in the sky until I couldn’t see it. I then saw a short white streak across the sky moving extremely fast and disappeared. I continued to observe several more of these objects and more airplanes  circling in the same area.

On Friday night 6/6/08 about 12:30 to 1:00am I noticed what appeared to be balloons flying in the air as if they had broken free from say a car dealer lot. This was a huge string of balloons; however as I watched I noticed it had the ability to fly in formation, so I thought maybe it was a flock of birds, but then I realized that it was to late and no birds fly this late. I started watching more closely trying to figure out what I thought I was seeing. Whatever this was it had the ability to fade in and out of sight meaning one second I could see pieces and the next second it was as if it had totally disappeared and then the next second it was visible again. It started off as a straight line then as it moved east to west it changed to a semicircle with the open end facing east. It disappeared the reappeared in a v shape I noticed it was banking to the south. Thats when I could see what looked like a dome shape within the v shape I could only see part of it. The other strange part we live close to an air force base, so I am familiar with different types of aircraft as well as the landing patterns whatever this was it was actually flying lower than the standard helicopter pattern also no engine noise. I have no idea what this actually was, but I can tell you that it was not technology that we are aware of. In truth I have no clue as to what this was in the end I got scared and went inside my home.

However, I began to notice that the “star” was hovering/vibrating. With binoculars, I observed two white-lighted objects, one above the other, shaped in opposite fan-shapes.  The two lights would work together, one above the other, and, at times, go back together as one.  The two ""lights"" would hover and vibrate for a moment in an area, swirl a flash of blue light or send a white streak out or flash a white or red dot somewhere on the perimeter.  It was as if the two “white lights” were in the center of a larger object.  As it would hover, vibrate; send flashes or dots and then move slowly to the next area.  The object was always ""moving""- meaning vibrating/hovering/flashing. It worked westward. There was no sound.  The evening was clear- minimal cloud cover and approx. 75 degrees. I spent from 3:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. watching from my balcony with small binoculars.  I sent a text message to a friend of mine and described it.  I attempted to get pictures and video, but the object was too far away and the sky too dark for my camera to be able to record. During this period, a small plane approached from the north, in a, what seemed, direct path with the object.  I observed the plane continue on its flight path, without changing direction, and fly directly ""below"" the object. (I am a poor judge of distance). After an hour, the ""lights"" had moved far enough west that I was unable to see them longer. I saw a similar object in May.  At that time it appeared that the ""star"" was ""hovering and moving"" and then suddenly and slowly, the star split into two perpendicular objects.  They began to flash a white light  independently- first the right, then the left.  There was no distinct pattern. There was no sound. The lights then stayed lit together and the object traveled slowly above the house and away to the east.  There was no sound. I am a single mother of two, have my MBA, and do not drink or do drugs.  Having very little time to myself, I enjoy a few quiet moments looking at the stars when I occasionally awaken during the night.

It was already dark and I looked into the sky.  It was a perfectly clear night without any clouds and I was so glad to see the stars.  After few seconds I noticed sort of two geese formations in the direction of Orion Constellation.  The first strange thing that I noticed was the fact that every ""goose"" in the formation ""kind-off"" glowed. There was a small formation of 5 or 6 objects in front and a larger formation behind of 10 to 12 objects. Every object glow very clearly in the dark sky making apparent the object’s chevron shape. There was no sound, no air tail, nor any other lights except the glow of each object. The traveling direction was from North-East to South-South-West. At the moment when I saw the objects they were on my left at aprox 45 degrees of my walking direction. In a split of a second my thoughts were: Gooses?  Now in January?  Impossible; and anyway they would have been more like dark pots on the sky rather than glowing. What a heck it this?  During the next 15-20 seconds the 2 formations already passed the Orion Constellation and started to assemble themselves (in a ""goose"" like fashion) in a single formation. At that point I lowered my sight for no more than 10 seconds to check over my dog. When I looked again in the sky, the ""geese"" formation was this times on my right at aprox 45 degrees of the same walking direction. After 10-15 more seconds the formation was out of my sight. At that point I realized the incredible speed that these objects should have to be able to travel more than 90 degrees of the sky in less than 1 min. Continuing my walk with the dog, 2 to 3 min later I noticed a linear cloud or air tail following the direction of the ""geese"" formation.

I immediatly jumped out of bed thinking a plane or possibly a meteorite just crashed in the distance.  At this point my wife also woke up an asked what's wrong.  I told her what I thought happened and proceeded to peek through the blinds.   All the sudden with another flash the entire back yard lights up in bright red color.  My wife jumps out of bed and rushs to the window yelling ""what is that!""  I told her I have no idea and both of us proceed to look out the window.   Then about 1 to 2 min. later another flash of light only this time its green and it appears to be coming from the roof.  Now were both freaking out, I throw some pj's on grab my spot light and gun and head for the front door.  I pause in the kitchen, looking out the front window thinking maybe a transformer blew up but saw nothing to prove that.   Suddenly there's another green flash and immediatly after it the power in the house fades out with a buzzing sound and then returns.  My wife screams ""it's coming from the roof"".

This one lasts about 1 to 2 min. and then fades out.  All the other flashes lasted only about 2 seconds.   After waiting awhile and not seeing anything else we decide to lay back down.  I did notice a couple more flashes but couldn't tell where they were coming from.  We had an ice storm that night and everything was covered in ice.

When this ball of light shot of to the west, it appeared and I firmly believe it was traveling level to the ground as though it was completely parallel to the ground.

THE SPECIFICS: -I stepped outside and stood on my friend's porch to smoke and check out the current weather conditions as it had been snowing hard all day.  It was still snowing heavily and the clouds had to be at an altitude no higher than 2,000 AGL.  I was closely examining the cloud layer in an attempt to predict whether the snow would be letting soon or not.  I was of sober mind when I observed these 2 events witnessed this event and was looking west focusing on the fast-moving cloud layers coming out of the west and moving toward the east.  It is important to note that the weather conditions were such that the stars were not at all visible, flying conditions were IFR only, and there are neither airports nor victor nor jet airways in this area, neither are there any towers or buildings (only flat farmland) in this area.

It occurred July 17 05 very much in coincidence to the fact that I was talking about what I seen in Phoenix.  This night I was not alone my sister her boyfriend and their friend, they had all seen this to but they don’t remember or care as much as me.  I started to talk about these lights I'd seen, and they were actually interested. This conversation continued and I remember saying ""I think its just a matter of looking up at the nights sky once in a while"" and I was looking.About an hour had passed the conversation had changed. I had this feeling or intuition to look and I looked straight at the same three lights. I stood up and yelled "" that’s them"" and sure enough I wasn’t crazy because they all seen them.  We watch the 3 lights move together in a triangle. I said ""lets see if they cross over a star"" I wonted see if it blacked out the star when the triangle covered it. We followed them to not see them do so when I said "" I hope they do something different"". And sure enough the did before I could finish saying it.  I remember the front light shut off(disappeared) then a second and the third in a 123 type of rhythm. I was like Woh that’s different, but they were gone.  My friend spotted them again as they reappeared where they started. to do the same triangle thing traveling in the same direction at the same speed. But they didn’t move as far because the triangle stopped moving forward and then in a manor where it flipped and turned and didn’t look like a triangle anymore. we could  tell that this wasn’t a solid vehicle but three individual  lights.  This all was happening very fast and continued to do so. the three lights moved closer to each other to only to go into a chase that was all mathematically perfect. they chased each other in a perfect circle so fast and so tight to form a perfect bright white ring. then they split into three directions in perfect angles from each other and then disappeared after a very short distance, to not be seen again.  we all went nuts and climbed on to the roof of our trailer house. we were all being very loud and hopeful we'd see them again. but we didn’t and I haven’t again yet.

I was standing on the balcony just outside the room door at the railing watching the sky.  It was very quiet and the only noise to be heard was from small waves rippling against the beach below.  There was a very light breeze at the time.  There was broken, widely scattered, low level cloud cover-- very thin, wispy clouds, and stars were visible for the most part through them.  (It was difficult to estimate the actual altitude of the clouds, as they reflected the glare of the city on the underneath side and it made them seem as if they wer 500 to 1,000 feet up; however, similar clouds observed during daylight appeared to be 3,000 to 5,000 feet in altitude.) There was no moon, and the sky, particularly directly overhead, was otherwise crystal clear.  Horizontally, visibility out to the gulf was unlimited.  This was the second successive evening that I had stood on the balcony watching the sky for any action (I know this area experiences  a high number of UFO reports.)  I suddenly noted movement to my left.  I observed a triangular black craft at approximately at the 11:00 o'clock position to my left.  The craft had a single white light at each corner and a slightly larger, brighter light in the center.  The craft's corner lights were relatively brighter than the other stars.  The craft was approximately 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon and was proceeding in a straight line due west.  I observed it as it crossed my field of view until it was obscured by clouds at approximately the 2:00 o'clock position to my right. The craft traversed this space in approximately one second and was completely silent.  There were no other lights, e.g., red/ green wingtip running lights, otherwise visible.  The craft was flying above the clouds, but appeared to be at a relatively low level of altitude.  Again, it was very difficult to estimate accurately, but if I had to guess, I would say absolutely no higher than 5,000 feet.  I immediately raised my arm to estimate the approximate size of the craft by spacing my fore finger and thumb.  I did this repeatedly and concluded an approximate width of one and 1/4 to one and 1/2 inches.  I continued to watch but did not again see the craft, and within 30 minutes the cloud cover continued to build to the point that further observation was pointless.  During a three day stay in Navarre, I also observed a variety of Navy military aircraft in the vicinity, including ""Huey"" med-evac choppers, Marine Sea Stallion choppers, and an executive jet skimming the coast line.  All aircraft flew at relatively low levels, 1,000 to 3,500 feet.  Navarre lies between Pensacola Naval Air Station and Eglin/ Hurlburt Air Force Base, and a wide variety of military aircraft fly in the area daily, both day and night, including the USAF F-117 Stealth Fighter.  The area is also known for conducting a wide variety of research and development activities, tests, evaluations, etc.  I don't think the craft I observed could have been an F-117, as its shape varied (more triangular) and there were no running lights.  While the Stealth i sconfigured to fly with minumum engine noise, there was absolutely no sound from this craft, and at that altitude in such a quiet setting, I believe I would have heard a jet engine.  By way of background, I am 62, a retired Air Force officer (Lt. Col., 25 years service) and have observed a wide variety of aircraft, US and allied, military and civilian, under varying conditions.)",2007-02-01T00:00:00,30.4467,-86.875

There is a dirt road up the mountain that leads to a clearing where our cars were parked.  From here we walk a short distance up a rock formation to a ledge that overlooks the town.  We called this place ""the ledges.""  We visited the spot almost daily:  It was a great spot to have a campfire and there was a wonderful view of the town below.  I also enjoyed stargazing up here, as it has always been a hobby of mine, and this is the perfect location. 	The night before I saw the UFOs, my friends told me that they saw something weird by another nearby mountain as they were going for a ride.  The whole area is full of hills and mountains, the town is located in a mountain valley.  They told me they saw something strange looking up at the top of a mountain nearby, but only for a second.  They really didn't make much of it. 	The next night we drove up this dirt path and went up to the ledges to try to get a good vantage point if this thing appeared again.  We were really only up there because we had nothing better to do.  There were 7 or 8 of us, like usual.  We stayed up there until the sun started to set, then decided to head back down.  My cousin was in front of me driving, his car full.  Mine was also full.  I was on the phone with him, asking him what he wanted to do when we got back to town.  I was going fairly quickly down the road, and then had to slam on my brakes.  On the line, my cousin made some kind of noise of shock.  He had stopped right there, at a small clearing created by a fork in the road.  My cousin got out in a frenzy and started looking up toward the sky.  The other occupants of his vehicle didn't seem to know what was going on, until they looked where he was looking.  They all had a frightened look on their face, and had stopped their laughing.  Everybody in my car got out too and looked up at the sky. 	When we looked up, we all saw the same thing.  The sky wasn't dark yet.  Up and to the west we saw a bright orange light.  As we were looking at it, we saw two more of these lights come into focus equidistant from the center one, forming a triangle.  They glimmered when they first came into focus, then were solid.  Shortly after that, two more of these lights showed up even further out to the sides, forming a larger triangle.  All of these lights appeared out of nowhere, there seemed to be nothing at all there, and then something.  There was no visible solid mass that connected these glowing lights.  They appeared to be separate entities.  They were not moving at all it seemed.  If they were, it was quite slowly. 	We were all pretty scared at this point, and all pretty curious.  We drove back up to the ledges, hoping to get a better vantage point.  By the time we got back up there, the orange lights had vanished, and it was completely dark.  We decided to just lounge around a bit and I did some stargazing.  I focused my eyes on what looked like a normal satellite, until it did a quick loop, changed direction, and started moving opposite how it had been.  I called the other guys over and they saw it too.  There were two of them, moving randomly, silently, and quite quickly.  They were covering a distance of approximately 60 miles in 30 to 35 seconds.  (This estimate of 60 miles is based on the distance between mountains they were traveling between.)  The only noise we could hear was the sound of eighteen-wheelers down in town.  At one point, these two specks were travelling the same direction, and between them was an orange glow like we had seen before.  It lasted only a second or two, and resembled a flare.  We watched the two dots move around for a while then decided to go home and go to bed. 	The next night, we went back to try our luck at seeing them again.  We saw the same satellite-looking specks arrive from the north.  They only stayed for fifteen minutes or so, then were gone. 	We were all very curious about what we had seen, and discovered that the mountain to the east of the ledges is private government land.  There was a suggestion that it could have been a jet that was being tested.  It could be, but it was unlike anything I've ever heard of before.  The orange lights coming out of nowhere was hard to be explained, as well as the silent flight and incredible quickness and agility of the craft.  This still remains a mystery to me.

UFO Sighting over southeast Phoenix, 10-24-05   I am writing this as a matter of record as to what I witnessed in the sky over the San Tan Heights area, southeast of Phoenix, Arizona, on the evening of October 24th, 2005. It was a cool cloudless and moonless night. My wife and I went out on the back patio around 9 PM to enjoy a fire and stargaze. After seeing the occasional shooting-star we decided to call it a night and head back inside about 10:30 PM. As I took one last look at the sky an object caught my eye. At first I wasn’t sure that I was actually looking at something, but as my eyes began to adjust I could see that there was something there and it was hovering or moving very, very slow. What immediately alarmed me was that this flying craft made no noise on a night that was so quiet that you could have heard a car engine a mile away let alone the engine of a large aircraft. I grabbed my wife and asked her if she saw what I was looking at and after pointing it out she saw it too. When I first spotted the object it was between my location and the southern end of the San Tan Mountains, about a mile and away hovering at what I would guess about a 1000 feet high. As it began to slowly move in a southerly direction I got a better glimpse of this object. It had no running lights and was dark in color and I could see its shape and size silhouetted against the starry sky. The object did seem to produce a light greenish auora at times, but it was very faint. It was the biggest flying object that I have ever seen, much larger than a 747 and shaped like a ""boomerang.""  My wife and I observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared over the southern horizon. It spooked us both and she still doesn’t like talking about it. I went online to several UFO reporting websites and filed a report with one, mainly to see if I would get a response from someone else in the area that might have seen this thing too. The funny thing is a few days later my posting of the sighting had been removed for no apparent reason. At the time I knew nothing about the mass sighting over Phoenix in 1997, but after some research and hearing accounts of what people saw that night, I would say that we observed was something very similar to what they did. A giant, silent flying, wing like object.  I know some time has passed since this UFO sighting occured, but I feel obligated to report none the less.  I still gives me the chills to think about it...",2007-02-24T00:00:00,33.24702,-111.63329333333333

As it was moving to our side we could see that it had a strange shape of something like a diamond, and their lights were flashing around it.  It came right above of us and stoped for about two minutes. We were terrified.  We could listen no sound, but the lights were so stronge that we couldn’t hold our eyes open.  Sydenly it landed next to us and all the lights turned off. We felt deezy, our head was too close to be exploded and we swa about eleven ""people"" walking near our car. I stepped out of the car and took my weapon with me. But my head pane became stronger, so I threw dwon the gun. Then I heard one of the ""thing"" talking to me.  It was like us, it had hair, it was two meters tall and its eyes were covered by something like black eye-glasses. It seemed strong and grey.

My vantage point was from outside my office in Woodland Hills, CA.  I noticed a large (747) FedEx jet flying over my office and I thought it was strange for such a large jet to be headed towards Burbank Airport, as this airfield is generally for smaller commercial aircraft. As I watched to see if the plane would turn into the landing pattern for Burbank Airport, I noticed a bright point of light in the cloud directly behind the FedEx jet.  At first I only saw one object then I noticed there were at least 2 others. The lights I saw were an amber color. Almost as if the object was reflecting the setting sun to the west. I believe I saw 3 distinct objects.  But they were only visible as a group for a short period of time.  Each point of light would vary in intensity.  From very bright (they seemed to expand as the light got brighter), to barely visible.  The lights had to be quite bright because the objects were clearly visible while being either in the cloud or behind it. And the cloud itself was rather dark. Now, these lights were moving in some rather strange patterns.  I would describe the flight patterns as parabolic.  They would move in one direction and perform what I would describe as a 'U-turn' and move back in the other direction.  These 'U-turns' were executed at a high rate of speed.  At one point I saw multiple lights performing these maneuvers. It resembled two squirrels chasing each other around and up a tree. At one point one of the lights was performing the parabolic maneuver (on an off axis) and it stopped in its tracks.  It hovered in that position for roughly 10 seconds.  Then without a noticeable acceleration period, continued the maneuver at the same high rate of speed. All of the movement I witnessed was at a relatively high rate of speed.  I would estimate the altitude to be about 10,000-15,000 feet and the distance from myself to the objects at about 20 miles.  I have never seen an object in the air travel this fast or maneuver like these objects did. At no time were these objects visible outside the the cloud that was moving past. The whole episode lasted 8-10 minutes.  At which point the cloud had changed its shape and had moved off into the distance and the objects were no longer appearing.",2007-02-24T00:00:00,34.168753811659194,-118.61083318385651

I turned my head  and observed one large yellow light with two smaller lights.  One of the smaller lights appeared to be blue and the other a coppery bronze.  There was no observable lateral motion.  All observable motions was either downward (which was my best guess) or directly away from me.  I lost view of them without seeing impact either because they burned out or impacted below a small line of hills south of the Interstate in this area.  The area of observation was dark as the moon was on the opposite side of my car in its setting phase.  The flash of light in my drivers door window surprised me and I immediately turned my head for fear something was coming through the median at me.  It was high enough that I never saw in in my rear view mirror.  I am a retired AF flight crew member.  I recognize that lateral displacement would indicate movement parallel with me and the lack of lateral movement would indicate movement directly towards me or away from me or straight down (which was my impression).  In other words, I have been shot at and knew that if the light was steady on my canopy, I needed to move to get displacement.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,,

The large ones were not dissipating into the air and were left in a grid pattern from north to south and east to west.  I could tell the difference because the usual con-trails were smaller in size and dissipating into the air almost immediately after they were exhausted from the engines.  Then there was a distinct X that was made by these planes.  Suddenly out of no where there were these two oval shaped objects that were floating across the sky where the X was, not leaning behind and con-trails.  They were spaced apart and traveling east on the same trajectory.  I couldn’t see any wings and I thought it was just that they were too far away to tell but then a third plane came up behind them.  This plane had the con-trails and I could distinctly see the wings.  It was traveling in the same line behind the objects. I called the FAA and demanded answers to what was in our airspace and the operations manager put me on hold for about 20 minutes and then reported to me that the planes were an Air force training operation out of Reese AFB in Lubbock TX.  They were T-38 training planes.  Well, my father is an x-fighter pilot and retired commercial pilot and I know what T-38’s look like and it wasn’t them.

You might already know this.  Recently while looking at the night sky I noticed what appeared to be a star fluctuating between red and blue twinkles.  I am no astronomy buff, but I recognize mars and I can recognize a star generally.   My and my father's reaction was alike, we both seemed to notice this 'star' on the same night, and notice how it did not appear to have the usual colors of a star, plus its 'twinkle' was disproportionate to the other stars in the sky that night, as well as other stars I had seen in the past.  It was in the Southern sky, at about a 35 degree angle from the ground.  I have noticed a similar object in the eastern sky as well.  Generally these objects tend to be the lowest 'star-like' objects in the horizon, which leads me to believe that it IS in fact a star, and that the swirling of the atmosphere appears more intensely upon the starry sky background when it is lower in the horizon, rather than when one looks straight up.  Despite this simple explanation, this object could be easily mistaken for something unusual.  Just thought I'd offer this as a theory in case similar sightings had been reported but not substantiated as having an alien basis.  thanks for reading ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of the star, ""Sirius.""

I first thought they were satellites, until I realized they were flashing as they moved across the sky; the very bright flashing continued intermittently for the entire viewing.  Their course changed, zigzagging along from starting point in the high eastern sky towards three different compass points.  They moved about the same speed as satellites I had seen before. But the unusual thing about these was the zigzagging and bright flashing.  All three appeared from approximately the same origination point.  All three were observed behaving in much the same manner, with the exception that they were each moving in opposite directions; one to the south, one to the north and the third eastward.  This lasted for about 5 minutes until they all disappeared.  I am used to observing satellites with the naked eye (it’s pretty rural out here on this island)  and had it not been for seeing the three appear in roughly the same point in the sky and then begin to zigzag across the sky in three completely different directions, flashing brightly as they moved... I might have thought nothing of it.  I suppose they could have been satellites, they could have been reflecting the sun... I don't know about the zigzagging and originating in the same place and moving opposite though.... sure was strange.  These were high in the sky, not a chance they were aircraft.

I got the digital camera but I could not see the lights in it. I asked my wife to come outside and verify what I was seeing. She did and it was still there. Then I got binoculars and went out on the dock for a look. I could see an array of colors which resembled a 4th of July sparkler. The UFO was surrounded in a cloud or mist. Very different from a star and the sky was cloudless. Getting cold, I went back inside and moved a chair to the window and kept watching for at least 45 minutes, going outside twice for a better look and observing another UFO, not quite as bright to the north. Initially I saw this one with the other when I took pictures. I kept watching to see what would happen and kept the binoculars as steady as possible observing that I had to adjust when the craft moved up or to the side which it did quite often. Many colors were visible including blue, red, green, yellow and white. It would move further away from me toward the east then come back and then white lights became more visible within this cloud or mist in which it was travelling. The other craft was similar but smaller and was not as dominant so I paid less attention to it. The land across the Rio Grande is private and there is a road where I sometimes see a car but this UFO was above the mountains. It was larger than any star, much different and had colored lights appearing to me to be circular. Also at times it displayed very erratic movement, zig-zagging across the sky.

I walked quickly to try to see where they were really located, knowing there were no hills or mountains around where they could be mounted upon.  The morning was foggy and cold, not sure what the temperature was but there was frost on windshields so I'd guess maybe 30 degrees.  I wondered if cold fog could create mirages where objects looked displaced from their actual physical location.  As I walked further east, trying to get a good look at them without bare trees in the way they were always behind the trees, meaning that they moved to the north slightly as I walked.  I can't remember for sure but it seemed like maybe 3 red lights and one white light with what looked like tower structures below them (beams?).  I headed south trying to get a look at them without bare trees in the way andd as I walked south they were still behind the trees, maybe 10-15 degrees above the horizon.

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Follow up on report about red and white lights on what looked like radio towers; they were radio towers.

I walked closer to look and saw several smaller, quicker flashes of the same color in the southwestern sky over the ocean.   The light was of such an unusual color that I was concerned, and having served active duty in the Air Force, I considered the rate at which the quick flashes occurred to either be weapons fire or a lightening storm.  I’ve seen several lightening storms, and they were never of this bright yellow/orange color.  My gut felt it was weapons fire of some type, and a sense of dread had me grabbing my dogs and running under the covers.  I don’t scare easily, but I was scared.   I told myself I must be wrong, overreacting, or half-asleep, and that I would see on the news in the morning that it was simply lightening.

I am a truck driver that this morning had my very first UFO sighting in my life.  I don't know if you receive information about sightings and will use this to collaborate with other sightings; or if this is of any interest at all.  However, I was traveling close to my home on Route I-78 westbound just west of the Lenhartsville Exit in Windsor Township of Berks County, Pennsylvania.  It was approximately 5:30 am and still dark.  Approximately 2 miles in the distance I saw very bright lights and thought nothing of it.  MediVac helicopters travel over my house frequently as I live close to Lehigh Valley Hospital and generally disregard them.   As I got closer, impossible as it seemed, the bright lights grew even brighter.  When approximately 100 yards away the shape became clear in the dark.  It hovered over a grassy field on the left side of the four lane highway and was between 100 to 200 feet above the ground.  I could make out the shape and could see that the object was hovering without making the noise that helicopters make.  The shape of the object was like that of an arrowhead and three lights illuminated from the bottom with a red light in the center of the bottom of the object.  The red light didn't flash like typical strobe aircraft lights; it came on and went off slowly. The entire time the object hovered and did not move.  I did not not have my CB radio on as it has not been working so I was unable to determine if other drivers saw what I did. Subsequently my wife checked the local newspaper for anything partaining to a UFO sighting.  Nothing was mentioned; however, a couple of miles after sighting the object I came across an accident where one truck driver rear ended another which tied up traffic.  I couldn't help but wonder if this driver had been distracted by the same object because judging by the degree of damage he hit the truck infront of him at quite a high rate of speed.  I had a tough time keeping my eyes on the road while being awe-struck and disbelieving what I was seeing.  Also, there had been another accident a short distance further down the road. I don't know if this is helpful to you or not.  I do know that what I saw was not a MediVac helicopter or any other flying object I've seen before.

I am the only person here, in my home who witnessed what I am reporting. It was approximately 8pm, I was seated , relaxing with two of my three dogs. I have a full view of the mountains (the San Jacinto Mt. range).  I have floor to ceiling windows which allow me a pretty full view of the sky and the mountains. While seated, I saw an abnormally bright peachy/red/orange light approach.  It was as if it appeared from out in the sky, not from over the mountain top, like a jet or helicopter. It was the color that caught me off guard.  We have many helicopters flying to the Desert Hospital over head, but this was not the same, they usually come from the south.   The item in my view was much higher in the sky, and actually much brighter.  It moved from the top of the mountain range, east, slowly, maintaining its brightness.   The brightness was such that I could not discern any shape.  It was as if I were approaching a car with bright lights on in the evening, a stary glare.   I immediately felt that due to its color, which did not change, that it was very peculiar.  I was tempted to go inside and get my camera, but was afraid I would miss something, movement, whatever.   So, I kept watching it.  It moved from the mountain top to approximately 1/3 - ½ across the sky.  It stopped, as if hovering, as if it was a helicopter, and then, it took off, perpendicular to where I was standing, out into space and the very bright light was gone in  less then a two seconds.   I tried to garner any fragment of light available by using the light sensitive area of the outer peripheral portion of my eye, but it was gone.

Last night on March 19, 2008, I was coming home from the grocery store and was about to turn onto my street, when I observed a really bright light up in the sky above what used to be a field next to my neighborhood. Now, there is new construction going on every day and I wasn’t sure if the bright light was atop a new cell phone or radio tower that may have been built next door or if it was a search light on a helicopter. At first, I couldn’t tell whether the light was stationary or moving very slowly so those were the two possibilities that immediately came to mind. I parked the car in front of my house and was about to unload groceries when I noticed the bright light was gone. Instead, an object was moving very slowly and steadily from the north, where I originally saw the bright light, to the south and it passed directly overhead, quite low in the sky. If I had to guess, I would say it was perhaps 20 stories from the ground. I couldn’t tell whether it was triangular or diamond-shaped, but it was one of those, judging by the half a dozen or so red and blue blinking lights on the underside of the craft. I can’t stress enough how slowly and how low in the sky it was much lower than a plane would fly. The other unusual thing I noticed was the sound it made. It was a humming sound that repeated in a circular fashion. It was definitely made by a machine, but it didn’t clank metallically, and it wasn’t high-pitched. It’s difficult to describe, but it was certainly rhythmic and repetitive. I am not sure how big it was because I couldn’t see the entire outline of the craft, but it was much larger than a helicopter and probably smaller than or about the size of a football field. I wasn’t afraid as I watched the object make its way slowly southward. Instead I was curious, trying to figure out what I was looking at. Unfortunately, my camera was in my upstairs bedroom and my camera phone is virtually worthless at night. It wasn’t long before I lost sight of the object and went into the house with my groceries. The time was exactly 11:30 pm when I walked in the front door. I estimate that the entire sighting took about five minutes. I awakened my housemate and told him what I’d witnessed, and then called my sister to tell her, too. I mentioned it to my boyfriend the following morning and he said that there are now planes that can hover, but that they would have no business doing that above a residential area. All I know is that it didn’t look or sound like any kind of plane I’ve ever seen or heard. One second it was there and the next, it was gone. The night was cold and clear. There was a full moon with little or no breeze in far south Austin, Texas. I was completely sober and have no history of mental illness or attention-seeking.

Close proximity. July 21, 2007 Approx. 21:00 Central Time Northwest of Madison WI Traveling Southeast on RT 12 and while turning East onto RT 19. Partly cloudy skies, dusk light, slight breeze.  My wife, son and I were driving home from a walk in the woods.  It was dusk.   I was driving, my wife was in the front passenger seat and our 3 ½ year old son was in the back child seat (not a very reliable witness, I'm afraid.)   While heading southeast on rt 12 shortly after crossing the Wisconsin River we were driving up the hill leading out of the river valley.  My attention was on the street in front of me when I “felt” something trigger in my peripheral vision vertically above my line of sight.  My gaze moved strait up and I found myself seeing a saucer shaped object with a high dome centered on top.  The object appeared to be relatively close and at a low altitude.  Between the visible horizon  and our location.  If I were to guess a diameter based on the perceived distance of the object I would say it was similar to that of a medium size commercial airplane, but that's really a shot in the dark.  The object radiated it's own light, which appeared similar to the Sun.  A high energy orange-ish yellow, but did not appear to be flickering or com busting, appeared very stable.  As soon as my direct vision registered this object it promptly disappeared.  Just sort of blinked out of existence.  I barely acknowledged it.  Although it did seem extraordinary, it was so quick and I was the only observer so it seemed almost useless to talk about and I promptly stuffed it to the back of my head. In addition to the above reasons for not dwelling on it is that I have been doing some fairly in depth research into the ufo disclosure culture recently and it could easily be interpreted that it was what I *wanted* to see.  It would have been left at that, except about 3 – 4 minutes later I was making a left hand turn onto WI HW 19 east and out of the left edge of my peripheral vision I saw the same color in the sky.  But before  I even had the time to turn my head and look at it my wife GASPED.  “Did you see it too!!?” *Now* I was excited.  Before explaining at all what “it” was or indicating my observation, she described the same object, color, including it blinking out of visual perception as soon as her attention was drawn to it. She actually got a better view of it than I did.  It's possible this was a second object separate from the one I witnessed, but I doubt it.  It seemed like it had been stationary relative to our change in location.  When we got home she drew what she saw and her drawing matched up perfectly with the shape I saw.  The most curious part of all of this is that it's only been for the last few weeks that she and I (to a greater extent, me) have been researching available data on the web pertaining to ufos/technology, attempting to find only the most credible sources and hard data.  It's amazing how much is out there, buried in disinformation, noise and junk claims, but the credible stuff is mind blowing and almost incomprehensibly important.  Regardless of what we saw tonight, it does feel like we are on the verge of something trans-formative as a species.   We better be, or else we'll just been a sedimentary layer of interesting archaeological artifacts soon enough.  I'm interested in speaking with other rational people about these topics.  I will see if the site admin here is willing to connect other with me without publicly disclosing my information.  Otherwise check out Craigslist or myspace for “madison wi exo-politics” in some form or fashion.  +m",2007-08-07T00:00:00,43.066514168714164,-89.38736175266175

It was strange because there isn't a road passing directly from that angle to get a light from that direction.  Looking low across that way we saw a very small area of light shining on the lake, definitely not a moon or star shine, very direct and focused, like a very high powered flashlight shining on one specific spot of the water for probably about 15 seconds.  We were stopped in the road previously, but pulled over at this point to the no parking, jogging lane.  We thought it was a helicopter with no thought of it being anything more than the police looking for some convict who idiodicly jumped in a freezing lake.  But there was not a sound to be heard, literally nothing but wind and the sound of ourselves walking and breathing.  I was then focused on how intense the beam was on the water, by that I mean that I could actually see some detail beneath the murky water, which I never noticed before on a clear day, yet alone at night.  This didn't last much longer before the light dimmed significantly and moved towards the edge of the lake, past the top of a pavilion close to the edge of the lake and moved off over the trees in the opposite direction.  I'm just guessing time but this whole period was very short, enough to for us to pull over and walk out of the car to move closer by moving over the guard rail and towards the lake thorough the narrow line of trees.  Then my friend said that the light is over there and pointed up above the trees, I felt like an idiot for not noticing until now but the source was right above us just barely over the treeline on the opposite side of the lake, which was only about 200 yards or so from where we were standing, if that.  Now I don't know if it really moved away as it seemed and this was another one, or it was the same with a roving light source  The thing itself couldn't have been large enough for any norma! l sized human being to even come close to fitting inside of.  It was miniscule, not much bigger than the size of a large streetlight and it definitely was not part of a larger object.  It then turned from white to a darker amber shade, but was still bright and very noticeable, but there didn't seem to be any noticeable direct light shining off onto any objects around us at this point.  The only point that was noticeable now was the source itself  Then it slowly started to move off to the side, moved down below the treeline, back up above, then moved slightly faster, but still slowly, away from us.  I'm not sure if it just turned off, disappeared, or we just lost sight in the trees at this point, but that is the last I saw of it.  We drove over to the other side after this and went right down below where it was.  Maybe we just couldn't notice in the dark, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary to any of our senses.  Literally, it passed barely over the treeline here, but nothing was out of the ordinary to direct sight or smell.  The three of us were 100% free of all intoxicants except for diet cokes (caffeine) from dinner at a local restaurant at this point.  The one glass of wine I've had to this point has only been half enjoyed while I am writing this.  I thought it very strange by the size of the light/object and now that I've had time to think about it I'm wondering if the light we saw on the lake was in fact this object itself, or a light shining down from this object while it was above the trees.  I've only read about strange objects this size in connection with crop circles, but we've never had anything remotely like that in this area and this didn't seem to be causing that type of phenomenon in any way whatsoever.  If anyone has seen these in the area, or knows more about what this might be we would be very interested in hearing about it.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,40.5725,-79.9579

Well, last Sunday night at the stated time I saw a bomerang shaped object moving do West.  The object looked like it was crudely cloaked (could only make it out because it distorted the stars behind it).  The object made no discernible noise.  It gave off almost no light (maybe just a little gray light).  At first I thought it was a Carnival or search light, but this object KEPT a constant course across the sky (I watched it cross the sky to the western horizon).  Assuming this object was at typical jet altitude, I would say it was 3 to 4 times larger than a jetliner and traveling around 3500MPH (it traversed the sky in approx. 12 seconds, etc..).  If I was looking for bright objects in the night sky (as I've done until recently), I probably would have missed this event.  I wonder if this object was extraterrestial, or an experimental government stealth aircraft. Did anyone else see this object?",2006-05-15T00:00:00,39.7559,-77.5778

Beecher is located next to the town of Monee and very close to Chicago Heights, etc. and I have noticed several reports in the last couple of months. In particular, I was shocked that not more have been reported (regarding these crazy lights that fade and appear again) but I read the Monee report and felt relieved that someone else had been noticing this.  This has been going on for MONTHS and I just am now getting around to reporting this. Who else do you report this to?? At any rate, this is what I have been experiencing on a REGULAR basis.  I work in Kankakee and live in Beecher. Every night when I travel home, I take a certain route (typically I-57 North to the Peotone/Wilmington exit and then take Cicero [Rt. 50] North until I get to ""Beecher Blacktop"" Road and travel east on that road until I get to ""Will Center"" Road I believe it's called.  Since it is dark out where I live (mostly cornifelds and some houses but no street lights for long stretches at a time) I can see all the stars very clearly and helicopters on occassion or small aircraft flying along with commercial aircraft flying at higher altitudes in the distance.  I would say at least 2-3 times a week back in October, November, December of 2007 I have noticed these ""lights"" that appear in a ""V"" formation but are spread pretty far apart. It's like they are ""pointing"" towards the race track (Balmoral Race Track). The lights will sometimes be 2 or 3 and the most I have seen was around 7 lights that are very distinct and very bright. And then all of a sudden, it's like someone turns the lights out. But they fade out typically.  It is really hard to describe. The one night, I was on the phone with my boyfriend and I saw these BRIGHT lights that were not moving, they were not planes, the only thing I could think of was maybe a helicopter or two (or 6) but they were just hovering. Not making a sound. But when I pulled into the area where I live, I got out of the car and there was NO SOUND. I know when a helicopter is in the area because you can obviously hear it coming/going. There was NO SOUND coming from these lights and they were constant.  One light in particular (on this night back in October 2007) seemed to be ""leading"" the other lights. There was a dominant light and it remained constant in its shining and brightness. The other lights (from what I remember 6 others) had formed a ""V"" shape and it was perfect spacing and it was pointing towards the race track. One of the lights in the V formation would fade out slowly - completely disappear. Then another one would go out. Then another. Then one of the lights that ""went out"" would come back on.  IT WAS SO STRANGE!!!  Like I said, I was sitting on the phone with my boyfriend and he was asking me to tell him what they were doing. He said to stay there and observe them. I didn't like the feeling I was getting of ""being watched"" but I stayed and watched a little more. I knew they weren't stars as I know where all the stars are and how bright they are, etc.  I couldn't stand it anymore and went in the house, all the lights in the sky remained where they were.  Very weird.  Other nights when I have driven that route (traveling towards Balmoral race track in Crete, IL) the same thing would happen where there would be 2 or 3 lights one night, 3 or 4 the next night and then they wouldn't show up at all. The light would be VERY BRIGHT, constant, and then ALL OF A SUDDEN they would shut off.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,41.3436,-87.6171

They both turned right, finishing the loop, and as far as I could see...disappeared. I don't know if these were military craft being tested or what, but they definitely were nothing normal to our area.

I was outside around a fire with my Niece and Nephew. The sky was clear, weather nice. I looked to the sky and seen a triangular shaped UFO/Aircraft at about 2500-3000 feet up flying low speed. It's belly was lit up with approx 7 white lights (in a V shape) and it was virtually silent (it was very silent). It's direction was north I believe, following the Niagara River towards Niagara Falls (30 Km away). Our sighting was with 3 people and I would say it was 2-3 minutes duration as it disappeared into the night and tree line. This is the 3rd time in 1 month I have seen it. I visit my friend regularily who lives in Ft Erie, he has seen it with me a few weeks back. It was an awsome sight to see and next time I WILL have my camera on hand to video it. It is as if I can set my watch to this 'thing'. I also know it can be seen from Buffalo, but do believe it was in Canadian airspace the three times I seen it.  My take on this mystery Aircraft/UFO is this. I believe it to be a B2 Spirit Bomber patroling the border, I may be wrong though. I am a true believer in UFO's and an Aircraft buff, but to the untrained eye... this is one very freaky sight and confuse/scare someone by it's appearance. It is ghostly in nature and it blends into the night sky perfectly. Added all that with it's silence and I am sure it is a B2 Stealth. Anyone reading this who is in either Buffalo NY or Fort Erie Ontario areas, I urge to set out with your video camera at about 10 at night to be sure you catch it. Keep a watch west into Lake Erie. The wait is worth your time. I only assume this Aircraft is flying easterly over Lake Erie then onto Lake Ontario. Our area here is big time internation border with numerous bridges crossing into the USA and I am certain it is a secret border patrol tool. Very intimidating!

However, I have.  Earlier in the Summer or late Spring, after many years of neglect, I rekindled my interest in listening to military aircraft communications. Technology has brought many changes, however there is still opportunity.  As I began to search for the aircraft I was listening to, I started watching the daytime skies with more frequency.  Early on, quite by accident, I discovered that planets were visible during the daytime. I found this quite interesting. I have, in the past, spent much time watching the nighttime sky.  I have never before seen anything terribly unusual.  As the summer progressed, I spent 30-40 daytime hours with my binoculars watching aircraft. I discovered eight or so high-level flight-paths visible from my vantage point. Additionally, dependent upon wind conditions, there are approach and departure paths viewable . Three airports are involved for these paths.  During peak travel periods, it is not unusual to see 6-8 planes traveling at 'altitude' at any given time.  On this particular day, I walked to get the mail at curbside and decided to grab my binoculars from my car and spend a few minutes looking at aircraft. Normally when I watch, I take a folding wooden chair out to sit in.  My observation is limited somewhat due to trees, however the nearest provides a nice shade from the sun to my South.  In addition to aircraft, there are many birds-of-prey which are fascinating to watch.  So, after a summer of daytime sky watching, the discovery of planets viewable and nothing else much interesting, this is what I saw.  24 September 2007  Nikon 10x25, 5º binoculars  No clouds were observed in the sky during the five hour period of observation. There was a light haze in the sky.    Observation #1 12:30 While viewing what appeared to be a pair of dragon flies with my binoculars, I noticed an object in the background that was somewhat reflective although out of focus. I was looking directly overhead and without lowering the binoculars I immediately refocused onto the object.  The object appeared spherical, although due to the altitude, this is uncertain. The reflection on the object from the sun was not intense or bright. The reflection was more 'dull', almost a non-reflection. Color was grayish.  Initially, I thought that the object was stationary, however I realized that I was craning my neck further back to keep the object within view.  The object initially traveled in an East to West direction. It traveled about four inches (arms length) toward the west.  The object then made a 90º turn toward the North and I viewed it for an additional 1.5"" of travel. I moved slightly, less than one second, as the object passed behind the AC power service lines into my home. I was unable to locate the object after this.  Total viewing time was six-eight seconds.  I am quite certain that I would not have been able to see this object without the use of my binoculars.  I have no idea what this could have been.    Observation #2 12:40 Having seen the previous object 10 minutes earlier, I was focusing my attention in the same general area of the sky. That being directly overhead.  Without the use of binoculars, I noticed a brief flash or reflection of light. Once again, directly overhead.  I immediately brought my binoculars up and into focus and was able to follow the object as it traveled.  It's path was in a North direction. It traveled about 20"" (arms length). The object was a definite cylindrical, rectangular or oblong shape. It was light in color and after the initial bright reflection overhead, it did not appear to be highly reflective.  As the object traveled, it appeared to be tumbling and or rotating, not quite end-over-end. I was able to see dark areas on the rather light colored object as it 'tumbled' indicating to me that these were shadows produced by the movement.  I was able to view the object's entire path which lasted six-eight seconds at which point it simply faded from view.  The diameter or width of the object appeared to be about 1/7th it's length. The length was approximately 1/3 the size of a full sized aircraft flying at a 35,000 - 38,000 foot flight level at a 45º elevation.  These estimates are highly questionable due to the altitude and short duration of observation.  My best guess as to what the object could have been, is that it could be one of many rockets or boosters that are in a decaying orbit overhead. I am not certain if it is possible to actually see shape in these objects as they travel through the daytime sky ?  An online attempt was made to determine if there were any of these rockets / boosters in orbit at the time in question, however there are so many objects that it appeared to be a futile attempt.    Observation #3 13:35 Again, directly overhead, an unaided observation of a flash or reflection was seen.  I immediately, brought my binoculars up and into focus.  The object was traveling in a South - North direction. It seemed to have form of a typical plane or a 'plus'(+)shape. It seemed to have form on the ends of the + shape. It was far too high to be able to maintain a steady view through the binoculars. The object was not highly-reflective as it traveled. It did not spin or rotate.  I was able to watch the object from it's position overhead for approximately 10 seconds. During this period, the object traveled about 30 inches (arms length) until it traveled behind a tree about 200 feet from my position. I lost sight at an elevation of about 35-45ºs.  In comparison, a high flight-level plane at an elevation of about 60 degrees to my North, travels about eight inches (arms length) in a period of 35 - 40 seconds. At this distance and altitude, the shape of the plane is quite discernible and not in question!  This object was high and traveling VERY fast.  After contemplating this object for some time, it suddenly occurred to me that it was probably the ISS. A quick check determined that the ISS was traveling at this time over Southern South America.  I have no solid idea what this object was. Again, I'm not certain of the ability to see form in objects that are in low earth orbit during the daytime.    Observation #4 16:00 I noticed a bright point of light in the South Eastern sky at about a 45 degree elevation. Raising my binoculars, the object appeared to resemble a planet as viewed during the daytime with binoculars. There was some form to the object and it resembled a large balloon. It appeared that there was some sort of appendage on the lower side / bottom of the object. Due to my movement however, this is uncertain.  There was a gradual movement that seemed to be toward the NNE.  Travel was about three inches (at arms length) in a period of about four-six minutes. After this movement, the object began a gradual movement in a ESE direction. Object was in view for approximately an additional 15-20 minutes until it reduced to a very fine point of light and I was unable to relocate the object after taking a 'movement break' for a few seconds.  At this point, depending upon actual altitude,the object would most likely have been over Western Central NJ.  Although interesting, I assumed that due to the duration, altitude and travel of the object, that it was most likely a weather balloon. I had never seen one.  National Weather Service(NWS)indicates that weather balloon flights are able to last in excess of two hours and travel about 125 miles. Altitudes attained can reach 115,000 feet. Balloon releases are normally scheduled at 00:00 and 12:00 UTC with exceptions for additional releases for specific storm concerns. The diameter of the balloon at it's bursting point can be as wide as 20 feet.  As a footnote to these events, at 17:15, I saw a bright lime-green balloon with a curly tail rise above the treetop about 200 feet from my location. It began it's northward travel and I watched with and without binoculars for about 12 minutes until it became non-viewable.  This added some perspective to the preceding events of the day.  Again, after spending the amount of time I have this past summer watching planes, I find it improbable to have witnessed these four objects in a single day.

I went outside and observed that it was not a missile (not the usual engine rumble and the trajectory was wrong). The aircraft was moving south at a good clip but not anything super fast, and it wasn’t rotating. I kept watching as it flew directly over my home. It was dark so I could not gage altitude, but I would guess under a thousand feet. It seemed to have a round cylindrical shape, with red and green lights. I was thinking it was an airplane-- it had to be, but with no engine noise? I saw what looked like a shooting star just to its left and thought that was a strange coincidence then, I saw another. I tracked it until it was over the city of Lompoc then I saw it stop. A white light was coming from the top. This light had a strange look though. Instead of just a solid light it looked like it was a very fast strobing light. I was considering it might be some experimental, Air force thing. Then I saw what appeared to be an aircraft with a single white light coming from the direction of the VAFB flight line (that aircraft made a jet engine noise) and was headed toward the ""floating"" craft.  The first craft then resumed its clip heading down the coast followed by the other craft until I lost sight of both. I've lived on or around AFB’s for over 40 yrs and never have I witnessed anything like this, so I just wanted to tell someone.  I’m curious if anyone else saw any thing odd tonight?

At 8:12pm, I saw what appeared, to me, to be something akin to an irridium flare or bright plane landing light dim and go out about 12 o'clock high.  One minute later at 8:13pm, to the west, I picked up an orange light approaching at 2-3x the speed of the incoming airliners (on flight path to PHL from West to East).  Initially just orange, the light pattern of the object became a clockwise rotating orange beam, similar to a ""bow tie"" rotating clockwise.  I payed close attention - no blinking lights and it roated about 40-50 RPM (one clockwise rotation per second or so).  Initial thought was it looked like a recent viewing of a flyover of the ISS.  However, it got interesting at this point.  After viewing the craft for 5 seconds, it stopped.  Stopped! This is where my heart started to beat quickly.  I did not take my eyes off of it and in a very short time, it reversed direction from due-east to what appeared to be almost a 180* direction change and it appeared to start heading up.  It changed direction again 2-3 more times, going east again, then another zig back to north west where it dimmed and disappeared.  The point it disappeared was not too far from the point in the sky I had seen the flare-type effect at 8:12pm.  It had done this activity at about the same time I caught, out of the corner of my right eye, the bright headlight of a commercial airliner traveling from East to West on an opposite path toward the object (a normal flight path from PHL outbound to the West).  The object appeared to have ""sensed"" the airliner heading its way and it made a choice to zig zag away and then out of sight ""upward"" in a course correction effect.  The object didn't seem too out of the ordinary as a rotating orange bar of light.  What was astounding was that it stopped and changed course a number of times in a matter of seconds.  The size of bar of orange light would have been 2-3 times the width of a commercial airliner at 25K feet.  Possibly just under the width of my pinky fingernail held at arm's length.  I do not know if I can judge the height of the object but would approximate 15-20K feet.

Working into the wee hours of the morning I was really tired and left my backyard office to go into the house and get some sleep. I happen to be walking into the house (roughly round 4:30 a.m.) but a light caught my attention as I stepped up on the back porch. I looked up at this light and it was very strange looking as I can’t recall seeing anything like it before. The light was just hovering off in the distance toward the East. At first I thought it to be a star or planet or something of sorts but then I noticed even further that the entire skyline in that direction was totally blacked out. No stars, planets or moons or nothing. There appeared to be a high cloud cover which prevented all the other objects you would normally see at night to be obscured from vision. Just that one light up there. So I thought to myself it’s kinda odd that one star would show thru and not any of the others. Then I happen to notice that the light I was looking at was getting brighter and then dimming again as in a pulse and it kept repeating, bright, dim, bright, dim. Then I knew something wasn’t right about this hovering object and went inside and woke up my wife. I told her about what I had seen and asked her to get the camcorder for me so I could film it. She got the camcorder for me and we both went out on the back porch to see this light. The object did not appear to move other than a slight rocking motion. But the bright, dim thing kept going. I pulled out the camcorder and shot about 4 minutes and 20 seconds of footage when I was just too tired and shaking to continue. There was no sound from the object. The only sound I recorded on video was passing cars on the hwy. I deleted the audio on my footage upload later so the file would be smaller for upload. But I went to the edge of the porch to get the best view and started video recording. My wife had seen UFO’s before and she wasn’t too thrilled about them so she wen! t back i nto the house. This was my first encounter of a hovering, illuminating light. The skyline behind the object was completely dark. Nothing else was visible in the video as a reference so I couldn’t determine size, or shape. It appeared that the clouds had all reference points blocked. I couldn’t even see the trees that were located to the left and right of the object in my line of sight. It was very dark. But I continued to record and zoomed in and out a few times to try to get a good shot of the object. I held the camera up about a 45 Deg angle to record. It appeared to be hovering over a Georgia Power Electric Sub Station which is just down the road from my residence. But it may have been farther away. I couldn’t really tell without the reference points. I have no clue what the object was. I got tired of filming and went inside to go to bed. I layed down for about 20-30 minutes but couldn’t stop thinking about it and went back to the kitchen window to check on it again. It was still there. I went to sleep and when I awoke round 12 noon on 11/12/07 it was gone.

It was a dark evening with no moonlight.  We were talking and an auto siren from somewhere in the distance went off.  My daughter asked what the sound was and I turned.  When I did, I immediately saw 2 extremely fast flashing objects in the sky.  The flashing lights on the objects were nothing like I had seen before on any airplane.  The primary light was white but there was also a red light.  We both were shocked as we never had seen anything like that. As we watched the objects, at first they were close together and seemed stationary and then started to move.  One object seemed to move diagonally very quickly and then to the northwest passing over our home.  The other went in to opposite direction and disappeared. My daughter ran into the house to get a camera.  The object was lower in altitude and when it passed over the house, I tried to get a good look.  It seemed to not make any noise at all.  It looked to be sphere shaped.  The lights were now not flashing as fast, but there was a pattern of white, red, and green lights that continued to flash. My daughter couldn't find the camera so she came running back out and tried to get a picture with a cell phone camera, which didn't work. When we were over the shock, we kept looking into the sky and realized that we counted over 6 airplanes in different courses.  They were very recognizable as we could recognize the airplane lights.  We live near the Atlanta airport and apparently there was numerous planes flying at the time, even though I’ve never seen that many at one time where I live.  However, the 2 objects we witnessed were not like these airplanes.  The lights were very different.  The only way I can describe the quickness of the lights is that it was like Christmas Tree Flashing lights turned up to the highest speed.  Extremely Fast Flashing.  Then when the one did a diagonal zig zag, we both almost panicked. Neither my daughter nor I have ever experienced anything ""paranormal"".  She is a college student and mother herself.  I am a 38 year old Real Estate Professional.  We have a family of 5 and live a quite simple life. Since that night, I’ve been out each evening trying to see something similar, however I just see airplanes.  This is just reinforcing that the 2 objects we saw, were not airplanes.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,34.05107468354431,-84.67985569620254

Goddard and other towns west of the city this morning because of what Westar officials are calling ""a transmission event"" at the utility's substation in west Wichita.  ""We don't know for sure exactly what happened,"" Westar spokeswoman Erin La Row said Tuesday morning. Reports of multiple transformers blowing at Westar's substation at 226 N. Hoover may not be accurate, La Row said. ""It's been described as a 'transmission event,' "" she said, though she could not provide more details yet. Widespread power outages were reported west of Ridge Road in Wichita, as well as in Goddard, Garden Plain, Cheney and Pretty Prairie, she said.  The outages are affecting homes, businesses and schools, officials say. At least four schools in USD 259 lost electricity and went to backup generators, district spokeswoman Susan Arensman said: Peterson Elementary, 9710 W. Central; Wilbur Middle School, 340 N. Tyler; McCollom Elementary, 1201 Waddington; and Levy Special Education Center, 400 N. Woodchuck.  ""We might have more schools"" lose electricity as the morning progresses, Arensman said.

""Pretty much all"" of the traffic lights in northwest Wichita are not working as a result of the outage, a Sedgwick County dispatch supervisor reported.

There was very little light pollution and the sky was the clearest I had seen for at least a week.  The Object was a ""round"" greenish-blue ball that moved from the North to the Southeast not in an arc, rather in a straight line.  This was not a shooting star as it moved extremely slow, I would estimate the altitude at 13,000 ft, and as I indicated earlier the trajectory was not in an arc.  Judging by the trajectory, this object may have landed in a nearby Tennessee State Park.  Upon following a truck to the Hurricane Mills, TN exit at a fuel stop there I asked him if he saw the same object and he indicated as such that he had seen the same object.  I travel a great deal in my Job Duties, often at night due to the lighter traffic around metropolitan areas of Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville, TN.

PD)) UFO more than a glow  10-19-2006  From the Plainview Daily Herald 10/19/2006  By KEVIN LEWIS  Herald Editor   Mark Harmon promises he’s not crazy, despite what some of his family and friends are telling him.  Harmon, a 48-year-old grain elevator operator at Providence Farm Supply, believes he had a close encounter with a UFO on Monday night outside his home in the 600 block of Wayland.  “Never in my life have I seen anything like this,” Harmon said. “I really don’t know what I saw.”  Harmon was in the middle of watching Monday Night Football when he stepped outside.  “I stepped out in the backyard to smoke a cigarette and happened to be looking up because it was such a pretty night,” Harmon recalled.  From out of nowhere, Harmon encountered lights like he had never seen before.  “From the edge of the house, something came over. It was in a perfect V-shape. There were seven distinctive yellowish-white lights,” he said. “I’ve seen UFO programs where people have drawn this exact same picture.”  Harmon said the lights weren’t flashing or changing colors, and “weren’t moving real fast.  “Unless it was a mile wide, this thing was pretty close to the ground, maybe 1,000-2,000 feet.”  Harmon said he saw the object, which was moving east, for about 4-5 seconds before it disappeared behind a tree. He hurried around the tree but never saw the lights again.  “I don’t know if you had to be right under it” to see the lights or what, he said.  Harmon found it especially interesting that whatever the object was did not make any noise.  “The thing that got me the most was it was dead silent,” he said.  “I was dumbfounded.”  Harmon immediately called TV stations in Lubbock to see if they had heard of any strange object in the skies over Plainview.  None had.  “I was truly curious if anybody else in the area saw anything.”  Harmon was supposed to call the person at KLBK back after the 10 o’clock newscast, but after telling his two teenage sons and brother-in-law about his encounter, “we got to talking about it and I never called them back.”  And what did his family think about his story?  “My 16-year-old (Dustin) said he had never seen me act this way about anything before,” Harmon said. “My 18-year-old (John) was kind of looking at me like these farmers have been.”  Those farmers were customers at Providence Grain Supply on Tuesday morning when Harmon was telling his story to anyone who would listen.  “I feel like the person on the (TV) program” trying to convince people they saw something. “These farmers are getting a kick out of it, but I know I saw something.”  Harmon did a good enough job convincing his boss, Glen Graves, that he saw something. Graves did some research on the Internet and found a picture taken Oct. 16 in Croatia that Harmon said “was the same-looking deal, just a little fuzzier than what I saw.”  Harmon, who moved here about a year ago from Dallas, was married to the late Lisa Daffron, a Plainview native who died July 26, 2005.  “My wife used to be an (astronomy) buff. We had a couple of telescopes.”  Harmon is hoping somebody else in town saw what he witnessed Monday night, if for no other reason to confirm to disbelieving friends that he, in fact, saw something up there.  “I’m starting to doubt myself a little, but I know I saw something.”",2006-10-30T00:00:00,34.0946,-101.683

The observations that follow took place while I was standing approximately 30 feet above the ground, on the back staircase of my apartment in San Francisco, California.  Almost immediately after walking onto the staircase, I noticed what quickly revealed itself to be a large bird, probably a bird of prey, flying from the Northwest to the Southeast, perhaps 100 feet above me. It was an unusual sight; as far as I know, birds are diurnal creatures. I could see the bird clearly and made a mental note that this was probably a result of the city lights reflecting. I watched it pass above my head.  Just as the bird had passed directly above me when I was distracted by something in the sky traveling in almost precisely the opposite trajectory as the bird. My most immediate thought was that I was looking at an airplane. The object passed directly over the bird I’d been watching, traveling in what looked to be exactly the opposite path.  It’s difficult to reconstruct the order of my impressions of the object. I will do my best.  My first unusual impression was that I couldn’t identify the sound.  At the time I thought little of it, but in the way that one tries to identify the sound of an aircraft (""Is it a plane?"" vs. ""Is it a helicopter?"")  I came up empty. The sound was a mechanical, aeronautical sound that (I am trying not to characterize this retrospectively) that was close to that one would expect from a jet airplace than that of a helicopter, but was not the sound of an airplance nevertheless. It was an industrial, aeronautical sound that I could not decisively identify.  I had what I must in fairness describe as a mild sense of confusion driven by the fact that in addition to my inability to precisely identify the sound I was hearing, there was something not familiar about the color and intensity of the lights themselves. Given the volume of the sound (Again, I am describing as best I can thoughts and impressions that occurred in fractions of a second in real time) I had the impression that the aircraft was higher than the bird I’d been watching but low enough to make a strong sound--less than 3000 feet for sure. The lights seemed duller (less bright?) than they should have given the other variables. They were a dark red, or a blurry red--it was like a dulled orangeish red.  I have made dozens of attempts since the event to draw the distribution of the lights I saw on the object. The best description I can come up with: The representation of 5 on a standard die, with an additional light in between the two rightmost dots. ((NUFORC Note:  The formation did not survive the transfer from e-mail to our database.  PD))  •• • • ••     This pattern of lights moved from Southeast to Northwest for roughly 4 seconds. The part of the experience that was truly extraordinary came after the 4 seconds. As I watched with mild interest, the following happened; what I would call the lead light (the light farthest to the side of the direction in which the object was moving) reversed its postion. It took less than 1 second to do so; in that time, the lead light traveled clockwise until it occupied exactly the oppose position it had before. The object now looked like this:  •• •• ••   Then, in a fraction of a second and from my point of view, the object seemed to tilt in such a way that the western or leading edge went upward and the eastern or trailing edge downward. I say this not because it was directly visible as such, but because that was impression in the moment: the leading two lights disappeared from view, but I could still see the rear 4.  Almost immediately thereafter (much less than 1 second), the entire object vanishedfrom view. Watching, I did not have the impression of something speeding away. It seemed simply to vanish.  That is what I saw tonight. I have never seen anything remotely like it, and I have never before had a disposition one way or another vis a vis UFOs.

On May 22nd at about 20:10 (8:10PM) my wife and I were out in our front yard.   I looked up in the western sky and at about 40-45 degrees (above the treetops) saw a dark object that at first looked like a boomerang and I thought was a flock of birds flying in close formation.  I could not estimate distance from us, altitude or size, but was at least as large as a quarter held out at arm’s length. The sun was down below the tree line and the sky was mostly clear with high cirrus clouds.  Right away, I noticed that the object was changing shape, almost like it was rotating or tumbling.   It looked like a dark tube or rod that was bending and reshaping itself.   I pointed it out to my wife and she observed it also.   While we were watching it move from South to North-Northwest (with the direction of the wind), our neighbors came out on their front steps and saw it also.  After about 20-30 seconds it had moved out of our sight behind trees to the North West of our location.   All 4 of us stood around for a minute trying to figure out what it was and making jokes about it being the beginning of the alien invasion.  We thought it probably was a kite or a banner or something that had broken loose, since it was traveling with the strong South wind. At no time did we notice a sound from it.  My wife and I then walked into our back yard and heard jets accelerating.  When we looked up in the eastern sky, we saw two F-16’s from the Iowa Air National Guard wing at the Des Moines Airport turning to the northwest and heading in the same direction that the object was moving.  We remarked that it was odd, since the National Guard usually flies on the weekends, not on Tuesday nights.  My wife immediately remarked that they must be going after the thing, since it looked very solid and they must have spotted it on radar.

I was walking outside around 10:30 pm and glanced at the northern sky.  In the northwest, a dim steady light point was moving in an easterly direction.  I assumed it was a satellite and followed the light in hopes it was an Iridium flare, a satellite that brightens quickly when it reflects sunlight.  I have seen dozens of these Iridium flares over the past few years.   After traveling for a few seconds, the light gradually turned north and headed for the horizon.  This struck me as very strange, because the curve was too steep for typical plane and the fact that the light had no resemblance to a plane.  The light soon died out, much like satellites commonly do.  I then heard a jet sound emanating from the direction of the light, but saw no jet.  This could be a coincidence. 	 	Next I saw a bright reddish flash closer to the horizon, but where the light’s trajectory should have placed it.  This flash was like a sudden brightening, similar to a meteor, but slower and more controlled.  I then saw two simultaneous flashes and for the next few minutes I saw two flickering lights travel in many directions, usually fading away and then reappearing in a new location, always in the northern sky.  The flickers were at first somewhat rhythmic with a double flicker followed by a single, but soon became more irregular.  Every so often the lights would simultaneously flash reddish.  	The lights next appeared in the north-northeast and traveled westward, one slightly ahead of the other, flashing irregularly the entire time.  The front light faded, but as the second light continued westward, the other appeared at the original starting location.  This time it traveled eastward, and both were traveling on the same horizontal line.  Finally, after a short time (appx. 1 min) of nothing, I saw the reddish double flash occur.  This time the flashes were very close together (less than a degree probably) and hooked from left to down to right in a tight arc.  	I’ve been an amateur astronomer for years and have never seen anything like this.  I am also college-educated with a science and engineering background.  Several reports of near identical situations have been reported out of Lafayette in the past few days.

Two nights ago my girlfriend and I were on our way back from Columbia, Missouri and traveling south on Hwy. 63. As we were approaching Ashland, Missouri we noticed four bright yellowish white lights spaced evenly with a red light in the middle that were very low in the sky. The lights were constant brightness except for the red light which appeared to dim at random times. At first we thought it was a plane because there was an airport near by and we thought it was so low (about 150 to 200 yards above us) because it was about to land. But then we realized that we had already past the airport about 3 miles ago. As we got closer we realized the craft appeared to hover and was moving to slowly for it to stay in the air. There was also no sound like that of a helicopter and was also to big to be a helicopter. If I had to guess its size I would have to say it was about 70 yards wide and was symmetrical in a diamond shape. We turned around and put the pedal to the floor to get a better look at it but by the time we got to where it was it had disappeared. We went on the outer road to see if it had landed somewhere but didn’t find anything. Then tonight July 2, 2008 I was driving home and from the road by my house you can see across the river to the area where Ashland is. I noticed the same lights and couldn’t believe my eyes! I put the car in reverse and watched the craft float back and forth for about 4 minutes like it was searching for something (hopefully not me). It was also thunder storming so every time the lightning hit u could see the out line of it. Then all of a sudden the lights almost looked like they disintegrated and lightning hit two more times and there was no outline. The craft had just disappeared. And I’m not making this up I never really believed in ufos until now and if you knew me you would no I wouldn’t waste my time to make up a bogus story.

Time of sighting:  9:43pm Central  My daughter, two sisters-in-law, and I were walking down our driveway tonight as they were preparing to leave.  Because the stars are so bright, and because sometimes you can see a satellite, I always glance up at the sky when I am out at night.   What I saw tonight was the first time I have seen something I could not explain.  It was a large, bright, white light, flying from West to East in a somewhat wavy pattern. (Not a ruler-straight line)  There were no flashing lights to the side as you would see with an aircraft, nor was there ANY SOUND even though it was flying about the same height or a little lower as a small plane would fly. My sisters-in-law were getting into there car. I called out to have them look at the odd light too.  We watched it for about 45 seconds trying to figure out what we were observing, before one of my sister-in-laws ran inside to get my husband. My  daughter went in at that time also.  My other sister-in-law reached into her purse to get out her digital camera.  As she turned it on, and pointed it towards the sky, the light hesitated, and seemed to hover. Before she could focus and take a picture, it shot off directly towards the South/East, straight up, and disappeared within 3-4 seconds.  My husband made it outside to find me shaken up and nothing to see.  It was gone. I reported the incident to our local police, who directed me to the county police. They took a phone report, and offered to send a car out.  Since there was absolutely nothing for them to see, I didn’t think that was truly necessary. They called St. Louis Lambert airport, but was told they don’t track radar this far from the airport routinely.  I was directed to call our small, local airport tomorrow morning to see if anything was indicated on radar.  The sergeant I spoke to also mentioned it may have been a stealth fighter. I don't know if I buy that, because at the low altitude, it really seems like we would have heard or saw something besides the bright light. One more unusual occurrence was with our dog.  Anytime we are outside, he is right by us, trying to get us to pet him or play with him. Usually he is jumping up at us. During this time, he ran into our garage and was acting skittish, and trying to get inside our house.  Really strange behavior!  I have lived in this area basically my whole life, and have NEVER seen anything I couldn’t explain. I even have laughed at people who mentioned they’ve seen something odd.

The craft was totally silent and we could clearly see that is was a solid object.  The craft had about 8 dim pin point white lights across the back edge of the craft, no other lights were apparent on the craft. It was traveling from the southwest to the northeast.  We were able to watch it for approximately 8 seconds before it disappeared behind trees. The speed was comparable to a normal commercial jet flying over our home on an approach to Boston Logan Airport.  We have commercial aircraft fly over frequently, and if this was a commercial or similar sized jet we would have easily heard the engines, as we always do - yet at the time this was the only craft in the sky and it was completely silent.  If I had held my hand out at arms length, and trying to estimate the size, it would have been close to, or a little larger than, the size of an American quarter.  There was a definite thickness to the triangle shape, the thickness being roughly about 5% of it's length.  The sky was not completely dark yet at this time, and it was easy to see that the craft's color was a very dark gray, not quite as dark as the clear sky behind it.  It was being slightly lit by the ambient light left over from sunset and the lights of the town, and it was not shiny but more ""semi-gloss"" in texture - there is no doubt that it was a completely solid perfect equilateral shaped triangle, and very large.  The weather conditions were completely clear, not a cloud in the sky.  Immediately after the sighting I came in the house and contacted Brian Vike of HBCCUFO Research by telephone and made a verbal report, which can also be seen on his website at www.hbccufo.org.  This is not my first UFO sighting, but it was my first triangle sighting.

This area of our hike was also the most silent and darkest.  A report that was submitted on 11/30/06 mentions that ""SETI wanted to put their Scientific Instruments near the Pinnacle National Monument area"" and that ""their was reports of local boys in the Pinnacles area that even reported seeing UFOS"".  Indeed Pinnacles seems to be a hotspot for this kind of activity.  My brother and I saw the same lights that he and others saw two years ago.  The first set of lights were observed around 8 PM as we traveled toward the top of North Chalone Peak.  We were on Chalone Peak Trail looking eastwards and down towards a large uninhabited canyon.  My brother had told me about strange lights in that same area and I wanted to see them for myself.  I tried to convince myself that I was just seeing something natural but after several minutes, I saw one of the lights kind of float and move southwards in a very slow but deliberate manner.  The blue light seemed to move just like the star-like light I had observed much later in the sky.  This blue light on the canyon would stop and then move again after several seconds.  About two other lights appeared later but up further towards the south.  As we walked further, about two lights also appeared below us but in a southwest location between Jackass Canyon and Divide Canyon.  Incidentally, about 2,000 Native Americans were slaughtered and buried below that area.  This is where we observed one of the lights also float in the canyon except that this particular light seemed to very slowly travel in a parallel direction toward the trail that we were on.  We then continued our ascent to the top.  After about 40 minutes, we then began to travel back on the trail to head back home.  We again saw the same light continue to travel and float but we then continued on our journey.  It started to rain a few minutes after we ! began ou r descent.  After it had been lightly raining for a few minutes and we were making our way on Chalone Peak Trail toward the bottom of the mountain about 10 minutes before Bear Gulch, we saw a normal-looking white light--the kind emitted by a light bulb--in the distance.  We took the wrong trail near Bear Gulch Cave when we noticed the light directly below us in the northwest at the bottom of a canyon.  I thought it was a light from the national park's employees' living quarters.  After a few minutes, my brother commented on how the light seemed to be a guide for us since we had trouble finding our way back.  The most surprising incident occured when we were nearing our way towards the end of the trail.  This is when I saw that same light traveling passed us in the opposite direction, through a canyon that was to the left of the trail we were on.  The light seemed to be about 70 feet directly across us to the left and at the same height of our  heads.  I only noticed it slightly but my brother asked me if I had seen the light to which I answered, yes.  I quickly thought it was another hiker but realized that we were the only ones on the mountain, plus it was around 11:30 PM.  Why would a hiker be traveling up the canyon where there are no trails on that canyon at that time?  It was too late and it was raining.  I later learned that the light didn't just pass us as I thought.  My brother saw that same light floating and then disappearing in an instant.  He didn't tell me that then because he said that I might have gotten scared.  I then realized that the employees' living quarters was far away from the canyon where we had seen the light.  I never felt any fear but I don't think I will ever travel there at night unless I do it with a group of people.  I hate to think what would have happened if we had come into contact with any of those lights.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

It looked like a helicopter or plane headed my way but the more I looked it wasnt moving in any direction. SO i figured it was a helicopter hovering (we had a large ice storm with powerlines down) checking for damage or drugs.  However after a minute of sitting there the light starts to dim as if its turning then moves to the left a little bit then shoots straight up into the sky, through the clouds.

We weren't sure, and looked in the sky for another aircraft as a reference speed and found one.  When we looked back, we noticed it had started to go from left to right in an upwards direction.

I was driving east on I-70, about at least five miles west of Vail, with little traffic or light pollution in the area at the time.  I had napped previously, so was not drowsy.  I happened to look up at the bright stars in the clear sky and noticed what looked like a group of shooting stars coming down from the extreme upper right cornerof my field of vision (traveling fast, from SW to NE).  I expected them to fizzle out, but, instead, they halted and a globular formation of probably five to seven bright, white balls appeared, perfectly spaced.  They hovered high above the highway, to the south of it,  each ball appearing much larger than an aircraft, smaller than the moon, not blinking but shimmering somewhat. I pulled the car over and watched as they hovered there, appearing to be at about the height of a helicoptor, with no apparent change in color and no sound.  Suddenly, the group of lights disappeared, then reappeared very quickly to the north side of the highway--as if they had just shifted in unison, apparently not changing configuration at all.  After a few seconds longer, they just shot off abruptly to the NE, rising at about a 45 angle--just as they had appeared, but reversing the pattern and looking again like shooting stars.  It left me awe-stricken. I reported this on another site, but never heard back from them, then finally contacted a group headquartered in Denver and have just been told to check your site for the many other sightings of similar ball-shaped lights which occured over Colorado at just about this same time.  I was stunned to read all of these reports, but also gratified to have some confirmation that others may have seen the same thing. I have never seen a UFO before, but I firmly believe that to be the only possible explanation for what I know I saw.  I am a high school teacher who works in Denver but I commute on weekends to my family home in Montrose; I know the route well.  This area is agricultural, with few buildings around but is near the Eagle River and about 10 miles from the airport in that county.

Egg shapped saucer, very glossy gun metal.  I would say 12 clear lights in a circumference. Other lights not in a particular pattern that's recognizable, but other lights of different luminescense.  The color of these guide/spotlights were white-yellowish. I think I did notice 1-2 of the same sized lights with red or blue colors. No light was larger then the other. They all had the same base lighting I guess.  I came home I assume around 6:30 pm, and it was sitting above my home hovering. It moved in its on axis and didn't seem to be limited by any direction. I could not hear any engine at this point.  As it got darker it lowered itself, and I thought I was going to make contact.  I watched it for the whole 30 minutes (or until 7:15) when it became dark, and then a light appeared to open from the front like a flash light ahead of itself. It quickly closed, and then it finally had a sound. It sounded like tubes with a myriad of propellers pushing hard against the wind, and then it began to leave the ""southern"" sky, and move straight towards the north Eastern sky, slowly speeding up.  I chased it until it was at a point that it was intersecting traffic at the top of my hill. It had one guiding light as it flew. It flew flat and straight.  I took two pictures when it was evening with my sprint cellphone. There's one photo where you can barely see the lights on the leftside, and the other picture I have yet to transfer from my phone.  Nothing was around. No one was around. No cars going up and down my street. It was like the perfect day for me to just witness this large craft, and have no reference but my self, and my ""unbeleiving"" grandmother LOL  I drew a sketch of it how it looked when it hovered, and how it looked in flight. I will draw more detail with how the whole scene looks, if the picture I send cannot be seen.  Someone has to do some ""buffing"" to bring the whole craft out because the photo is PITCH black.

WNW at approximately 80 degrees elevation, I saw a slow moving light (or sunlight reflection).  With 7x50 binocs, you could see two yellow disks tangent to each other. A silver white probe extended out from the lead disk in the direction of motion (toward the NE). The probe like extension was about the length of the two disks diameters. There was also another shorter extension parallel to the silver white one. The objects were in view for approximately 2 to 3 minutes until they were hidden by cirrus clouds in the NE. During the sighting, a commercial jet airliner flew over from East to West. The UFO appeared to be much higher than the jet. Because the UFO was above the cirrus cloud when it “disappeared”, and because of the resolution in the binocs, it’s my opinion this was a huge object or objects at very high altitude (60,000 to 70,000 feet).

Over a period of about 15-18 minutes I watched as lights emanated from that spot, I’ll call point “A”, and two other spots, one to my west, I’ll call point “B”, and a third location just north of the first sighting, point ""C.""  The three points looked to be on the same plane. The lights did not waver in position.  The lights were bright white.  They came on in a series, in a straight line as if from a large flashlight being turned on.  In other words they did not fade in and out but came on suddenly and brightly.  The line of lights emanating from point A, as they came on, seemed to radiate toward the SW.  When they went out they just blinked out one at a time.  It was not a quick flash like warning lights on a tower, they did not strobe or flash but appeared in a slower “on”, “on”, “on” pattern, in a straight line.  When the last in that series was lit, the lights then went “off”, “off”, “off”, starting with the one that had first come on. Occasionally I saw one or two lights at point B.  No two of the location series lighted at the same time. The lights that appeared over the river (points A and possibly, C) increased in the number of lights each time a series would light up starting with the initial 3 lights then 4, then 6, then 8-10 and as many as 12 or more.  I couldn’t count fast enough. The series of lights from point C began after several series from A and B had taken place.  The first series from point C included 6-8 lights in a sequence whereas point A started with 3, those emanating from C appeared to be roughly radiating towards NE.   The longest series I saw looked as if it could have had 12 or more lights. I saw approximately 4-5 series at point A, 3-4 at point B and 3-4 at point C. The weather was clear, few or no clouds, no sounds heard, no airplanes seen at that time. On 12/13/07 I e-mailed our local weather station (WGAL TV) to see if anyone else had seen sightings like this.  Their answer was negative. Later I spoke with a person who saw on Dec. 12, the three low lights becoming two then three again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Friday the 7th/December/2007, 20.55hrs.  A Woman,58 yrs old, in Launceston, Tasmania, sitting in her lounge room at 20.55hrs noticed two lighted objects, moving from the east toward her house.  These objects, only seconds apart, lost altitude and elevation from 30degrees elevation, to 20degrees elevation, before rising again to about 30degrees and made for a steady course and altitude in a southern direction, and accelerated away.  NOTE.....Two other witnesses were present, and both describe the same event (report forms are being expedited, and information to be added here)  The woman then picked up a cheap pair of binoculars from no more than 1.5 mtrs from here window and focused on the objects, for a better view......  As the two objects moved south, it was noticed that two stationary objects were hovering, one above the other, at a reasonable altitude towards the southern end of the first 2 objects trajectory    Approximately 30 minutes later, two objects moving north were seen on the same flight path as earlier, but reversed.  When the objects returned to their point of origin in the sky, it is said they accelerated and gained altitude until they disappeared from view.  These objects are described as being of a triangular configuration, with a white/blue - green prism type colour effect, at each point, and a thin white line of light between each point.  The sky was clear of clouds, apart from some weather moving in from the horizons to the east and north, and the moon was not visible.  The sighting occurred in an area of sky not usually known for air traffic, by the witness, her family and some of the local residents, 2 of which have lived in the area for over 20 yrs.  The witness describes her state of mind as frightened, and then curious and moving more to a state of acceptance.  She has always been a believer that we are not alone in the universe, but has never before had a sighting of her own.  The witness is a full time carer, of her elderly mother, and a professional therapist.  As an avid artist she also has a good eye for detail, and her memory seems not to fail her in conversation.  The Witness also has a good knowledge and deep interest in the area of astronomy..  Saturday the 8th/December2007, approx - 20.55hrs  In approximately the same position as the previous nights sighting started, a stationary object became visible, described as being three straight lines of light, hovering in a partly cloudy sky.  It is said that the lights seemed to give the impression that they were only part of a lager object, of an ovoid nature.  The same three witnesses then moved to the outside of the house, on the eastern side, for a better view   This object was visible for ten minutes, until clouds moved in and obstructed vision.  At this time it was noticed that there were approximately 12 other objects, slightly bigger than stars and bearing the same colours of the previous nights objects, peppered across the sky.  The colour of these objects was noted as not being normal for stars, even with the light pollution from the city.  There were some small fires burning around the state, high altitude smoke haze could have caused some alteration in the appearance (colour / aura etc.) of some brighter stars.  All the usual contacts (air traffic control, police, councils etc) drew blank on alternate explanations.",2008-04-17T00:00:00,,

PD)) The original report is as follows minus witness personal  information:   Date: 01/20/08  Time:05:58 am  Duration: 7 minutes  Sighting City: East Dublin  Sighting State: Georgia  Sighting County: Laurens  # of witnesses: 2  Shape: Oval  # of craft: 1  Description: Landing of a 3 lighted, fairly large craft with pulsing red to amber lights. No sound at all. Description by witness narrative:  I  wasn’t going to report this until I saw that someone else from this exact same city experienced something similar just two months ago.  So,I decided to also write a report since there must obviously be something going on here that is unexplained and I would like answers.   Earlier this morning (Sunday Jan. 20th, 2008) at approximately 5:58 AM I decided to look out my front door to see if the ground was covered with ice( we had a lot of rain last evening and freezing temperatures overnight) , and as I was looking out the front door I noticed something completely strange to my left.  It was floating above the tree line across from a field approximately ½ mile from my front door. The lights were pulsating from red to orange (similar to flames from a forest fire) as this thing or craft was slowly receding behind the tree line behind the open field ""  ""It seemed to have three large lights from the side I was seeing. And judging from the neighbor’s house down the road and the distance this craft was from their home and ours, it had to be at least the size of 4 or 5 homes combined, possibly even larger. A truly amazing sight and a camera was the last thing on my mind."" Anyway, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, so I went to wake my wife up to verify what I was seeing. She quickly awoke when I told her that she had to see something that was going to blow her mind. I was hoping this thing wouldn’t be gone before we made it back to the front door. When we both got to the front door it was still there and was now half way down behind the tree line. My wife said, ""Oh my God, what is that?""   We both looked at it in awe as it descended behind the trees and seemed to have landed. The area it seemed to have landed in is near a creek in a swampy area.  In a place people wouldn’t  normally go or have good access to. All I could think is why would someone or something be landing there."" My wife and I stared in the direction for nearly an hour to see if it was going to fly away. She described it as being similar to the sun going down behind the trees due to the brightness it displayed and the red and orange colors, but this definitely wasn’t the sun, it was only 5:58 AM and was in the north west during the dark of night. She was only able to see the top half of the object and the lights as it was already landing as I awoke her. We both couldn’t believe what we had just seen. This definitely was like nothing I had ever seen, especially this close to our own home.. I must mention that I am prior military (US. Army Veteran) and I am very observant and have an IQ of 138. This definitely didn’t seem like any modern day aircraft that our military would have and even if it were, why would they land in the middle of the swampy creek area at 5:58 AM on a Sunday morning?  As far as the shape of the craft, it seemed to be an oval shape and had no sound at all as we stepped out the front door to listen as it was landing. Another thing that was real odd was that this is in a suburban neighborhood with lots of yard animals and none of the dogs were barking at all and the air was dead silent”. ""As big as the object was and as bright as the lights were, we were expecting to at least hear the neighborhood dogs barking, but none were."" :After waiting on the front porch of our home for close to an hour with blankets to keep warm, we finally decided to go back into the house. We were hoping this craft would come back up from the wooded area and would show itself once again while leaving, but it never did. And no, I don’t plan on going in that area of the woods and swamp to see it close up either. I will be keeping a guarded eye on that area for the next few nights and even months to see if anything else happens there."" ""All I can say about this is that we’re definitely not alone and these things are making themselves known. I’m just wondering why they aren’t trying to communicate more clearly if they are superior life forces. It\ almost feels as though we are like the ants living in the ant farm and they just observe us when they want to. A little food for thought there."" ""Anyway, thanks for allowing me to vent about this here, because I surely can’t tell me friends(sic) about this. I’m not sure how they would take it."" END OF ORIGINAL REPORT!  Upon receiving the permission of Mr. Peter Davenport to investigate this sighting report he sent this Field Investigator for MUFON the witness contact information. I contacted the witness by phone and set up an appointment at his home for January 31st, 2008 at 3PM. The primary witness is  married with two children, a boy  and a girl . He owns his own business. His wife  works at a local business. Their residence was very clean and modern.  East Dublin, Ga. is a very clean and prosperous appearing town located in Laurens County, Ga. long: w 82.9 and lat: n 32.5. This FI arrived at the witness’ address at 1PM on 1/31/08  and spent the next hour scouting the area of the sighting and getting the lay-out of the community/neighborhood surrounding the residence.  Moving West past the residence on the road they live , on the right side of the road at approximately 100 feet distance from witness's driveway is a high-end subdivision  made up of approximately 1 acre parcels with large ,modern homes which are located in an open, spacious property with a view across its expanse of approximately ½ mile in most directions. The road upon which the witness lives dead ends 1.10 miles into another road that runs in a South to North direction.  100 yards to the North on this road is a Georgia Power Company grid line of tall electrical towers. On the South side of this road the grid can be seen running at the foot of a long ridge (hill) approximately 250 to 300 feet high in a South to North direction. This power line grid crosses over this road in a  Eastern direction where a creek crosses under the roadway at a bridge and the creek and the grid together runs into and through a swampy, mixed forest area of several 100’s of acres. The creek has created a boggy, wet-land area and there are no roads, paths, or other entrances into this location, which is the direction of the witness’ sighting from his residence of 1.10 miles from of the creek.  Heading back East on the witness’ road I went to the junction with another Georgia highway and headed North for 3 ½ miles. This road led me to a power substation in 2 miles from the resident’s road. I also noticed the other side of the ridge and swampy wet-land with several tree farms and cotton fields for the 3 ½ miles. Back at the residence, directly in front of it is a tree farm . This appeared to have a road that runs around the North border of the subdivision but aerial maps indicate that it does not run far enough around to give access to the presumed landing area and falls short at least  ¾ of a mile from it, ending in the forest  behind the subdivision. Another road West of residence of witness does give access through a home owner’s property, but the witness is reluctant for them to be contacted at this time.  Leaving the neighborhood I drove back into East Dublin business district and decided to have lunch at a very small, one room restaurant . I enquired of the owner if he had heard of any UFO sightings. He had not.  I arrived at the witness’ residence at 3PM. He was warm and friendly but was still plenty excited about what he and his wife had witnessed the morning of 1/20/08 and began immediately showing me the area and recapping the event. Inside the home I conducted an interview and at first brought up the issue of the time of the sighting at 05:58 AM mentioned several times in the original report, inquiring  as to what he was doing up at that time of morning after a cold, rainy, stormy night, on a day most would ""sleep in."" The witness stated he arose to check for ""snow"" as the local weather provider had said it was a possibility that night and he wanted to show it to the family.  This FI having checked the weather report, etc. before my interview, indicating according to the U.S. Naval Observatory Astronomical Department as follows: For the East Dublin area 1/20/08 @ 04:21 AM EST- winds had been out of the NW with gusts up to 20 MPH. There had been rain/sleet over the area for several hours: humidity averaged 81 % .  A severe weather system with lots of lighting activity had moved across Georgia the evening of 1/19/08 and on into 1/20/08. Temperature averaged around 47* F. No snow recorded in the area. But witness indicated there was ice everywhere 1/20/08 Sunrise 1/20/08 was @ 7:32AM/ EST. The Moon was waxing  Gibeous with a (95% disk surface showing/ illuminated and was 2 days before full which set at the ""exact"" time of 05:58 AM that morning 1/20/08(Thanks to MUFON ASD GA. MARK AUSMUS for exact moon charts) Charts on file. Witness said the sky was clear at the time of the sighting.  Please note that the lack of animal activity (barking of dogs) that the witness originally reported as unusual does not seem to this FI to be in anyway connected to the sighting as most family yard dogs would be bedded down after such a weather system that lasted around 12 hours  and 2 hours before sunrise.  Nothing appears unusual of this time frame(at this time) and the witness remembers seeing the exact time of 05:58 AM on the DVD player near the front door from which the sighting took place, which he showed me. The witness had viewed the object as he looked out of the decorative glass, front door panel, noticed the lights and opened the door.  Recapping ( again) the sighting as recorded in the original report to NUFORC, I had the witness go over the statement about the size estimate . I discovered that what he actually saw were 3 large, bright red/orange lights encapsulated inside a half ""dome"" shape, rounded part to the top, and the 3 lights were inside, tapered back from the bottom to the top as if they were  3 panels of light. The panels of light appeared ""fire like"" the sun, rather than pulsating. Estimating the size of the object by the witness was based on a neighbors house approximately ¼ mile West on his road. I had him do a measure at arms length exercise and we determined the object to be 1 ½ inches to 2 inches at arms length. This FI using www.ufotools.com their website calculations estimated the size at a ground distance of approx. 5000ft.(1524 m) at an angle of elevation 10 degress based on the terrain lay-out from the witness’ front porch at eye level. The estimated length of the object at the base of the ½  dome was approx.93.624 ft.(28 m). The altitude estimate was 882 ft (269m). FYI/ this FI is comfortable with the distant from the witness calculation of 93 ft. due to the fact the object could have been as close as ½ mile and as far as 1 mile due to the angle in which it was viewed across various landscape/terrain. There was no way to get an exact measurement from either side of the objects landing area. One being a neighbor’s yard that the witness didn’t want me to contact and the inaccessible swamp on the  other . The entire time period of the actual event was 7 to 8 minutes. Google maps of the location will follow at a later date.  Next the witness took me outside to show the exact location ( again) where he saw the object and where his wife joined him on the porch. The direction was North, North West,  as originally reported. It was NNW across the open area over the subdivision at approximately 3/4/ to 1 mile (approx. 5000ft) distance according to my compass readings and previous drive through observations. If the object had been floating down behind the ridge line off the other road north of the location, it would not have lit up the trees, like the witness stated to this FI, and it did light up trees located closer to a small pond located on the North West side of the subdivision. It appeared to come down behind the silhouette of one specific, large pine tree near the pond about ¼ mile away but the distance  of the object was probably closer to a 3/4  to 1 mile away in the swamp land. The witness stated that the object maneuvered ""blimp like,"" moving very slowly and drifting down from about an 80 degree flat , right to left angle above the large pine tree and there was sky line well below the object estimated at about 100 to 150 feet above the large pine tree. Again, I wish to emphasize, as this FI viewed the exact angle of the object’s dissent seen by the witness, it would have had to go down in front of the ridge line located on  the  other road to the West , not behind it. Again, this ridge is  approx. 1.5 miles from the residence and an astronomical object would have went down behind the ridge. That would put the object going down into the swamp off the Western border road. I next spoke to the second witness, the wife, by phone at her place of business and her description was as the original report, but reiterated that ""It looked like the Sun going down at Sunset."" I asked if she had noticed anything unusual since the sighting. She stated that their house lights had been surging up and down over that day and a few days following. At this phone interview (on speaker phone) her husband recalled with her that the automatic, dawn to dusk, mercury vapor light in the driveway had gone out as well during that time and had not come back on. This driveway light has sense been repaired and both bulb and sensor had to be replaced. The witness also remembered at this time that he had been having all the rechargeable batteries in their cell phones, remote keyboard to his business computer and the children’s electronic toys in his home office being drained of their charges. He would charge them up and next day they would be discharged. This FI after returning to Savannah discovered that my brand new camera’s batteries were completely drained and I had put new ones in that morning before leaving for East Dublin. Coincidence? Maybe! Witness had also noticed an  intermittent  humming sensation/noise  in his and his wife’s ears for 3 weeks after the sighting. I had the witness file a formal complaint with the Georgia Power Company and at first the customer service representative said that they are not able to look up  previous  power problems. Instead they did a new report on the fact that witness was experiencing humming noise and ""possible power surges sense the 19th-20th through the end of January 08. No mention was made of the battery drainage to Georgia Power Company. A Ga. Power technician was dispatched to the residence that day. The witness inquired if they could explain the humming sensations and the power fluctuations, or any other problems for that time period.  The Technician’s log book indicated that 2 power sub-stations went out between January 20th and 21st, in the area. He unlocked the house’s power meter and did a few tests inside the meter ands stated it was working fine. The humming noise was not detected and the technician could only say that what had been happening must have been caused by the 2 downed sub-stations . The  GP Technician could give no explaination for the substations failures. At this writing the only problem electrically , seems to be the continual drain of freshly charged batteries in the home. This FI nor the witness can figure this out at this time.  This FI first speculated that the witnesses may have seen the ""Moon set"" as it did in fact set at exactly the same moment the object seemed to land in the swamp. However, the Moon set in a wooded area directly ""behind"" the residence and was about 90 degrees in the opposite direction in the West South Westerly location at the time of the sighting. The witness stated that the object never rose up after 1 hour . After approximately 30 minutes of waiting for the object to rise , a meteor, which the witness described as normal except that it was very short in duration with only a very short trajectory of about 1 to 2 inches at arms length appearing. They speculated that they felt it was connected in some way with the object. This FI does not.  As the witness’ children arrived from school on the day of the interview/investigation, he introduced me to them and I interviewed them briefly. They had not seen anything, but knew all about the details. The  daughter had had a ""nightmare"" about seeing the lights similar to what her parent’s had described and had drawn a picture (on file) of the object. She slept with her parent’s that night. This FI does not believe this was a ""recall"" experience by the child but simply that this incident has impacted this family in a stressful and negative way.  The witness claims to have a high IQ and so does his  son. The witness has been troubled over the fact that he cannot reconcile what he saw with what he knows to be normal and logical, He has stated to this FI that it affected him as he has become protective and concerned for the families safety more than usual. This FI believes  the daughter has seen and heard her parent’s attempts to explain the incident and became fearful.  I told the witness to consider playing down the incident to help his daughter overcome her initial fears. He agreed.  This FI has 35 years experience as a professional clinical counselor and 27 years as a Christian Pastor and I can say with some certain knowledge that the witnesses (husband & wife) have experienced something that has disturbed their normal life in a dramatic way and this disturbance has spilled over to their children. I have checked back once per week with the witness as of this writing and they are still trying to figure out what they saw.  UFO TOOLS website gives this case with the evidence available at a 57.5% reliability, strangeness 14.29%, info quality 10%, certainty 00.82% Valle classification is FB1 possibly FB2 considering the electrical circumstantial evidence. The probability of the object being a plasma ball  over  the power grid would be highly likely except for the fact that it was first seen moving 100 to 150 feet above the tree line that hides the grid line from line of sight from the witness’ front porch. Along with the appearance of being a ""dome or half a circle/sphere with lighted panels , this probability is slim . This FI contacted FI Brion Trainor/ a retired electrical engineer and team member of MUFONGA/ Coastal Georgia and he advised that due to the altitude the object was first seen and it’s coloration , that indeed, a plasma ball was very unlikely. This FI also personally spoke with all 3 departments of Law Enforcement in Laurens County. East Dublin PD, Dublin PD and Laurens County Sheriff’s Department. None have received any UFO or unusual  aeriel  phenomenon reports as far back as memory serves them. I spoke either to the Chiefs or their Ranking officers and they were very cooperative and want to be contacted in the future regarding any such report and will contact this FI should they receive reports of this nature in their respected departments. Also this FI has contacted a newspaper reporter to look into any media for that area that may have received reports for the sighting’s time frame of 1/20/08. Any information forth coming will be posted as received. FYI/ The witness mentioned the reason he made the report was because of another sighting in East Dublin 2 months prior. This incident also was reported to NUFORC on 11/26/2007. The report is similar at first examination and I can see why this witness of 1/20/08 was prompted to file his report. It was unfortunate that this FI was unable to gain access to the swampy area where the object went down to check for traces of its presence. However, due to the overall evidence of the circumstances and the insistence of the witness to remain anonymous, and the consistency of the testimonies and the adverse affect it had on the them and their children, I conclude at this time that this case should be classified ""unknown."" However, this case will remain open for this FI and contact with these witnesses will continue until I am personally satisfied they have some closure. David I.

The eclipse was hard to see with some clouds interrupting the view, and so we were gazing about at the stars looking for satellites to watch.  We saw several satellites and shooting stars.  Sometime during the eclipse, I’m pretty sure it was past the halfway point, someone noticed something and said, ""They look at that!"" I looked up at approximately 10:00 in the sky, above the height of the moon, but southeast of it.  I saw what appeared at first to be a bright star, a point of bright light.  At first I thought it was a star, then it grew larger and brighter then all the other stars in the sky.  Although it was growing larger, it remained stationary.  My next thought was that it was a helicopter, with it's spotlight on, pointing at, and coming directly towards us.  It made no sound as it grew brighter, then it appeared to turn away and head south.  As it turned, it dimmed considerably.  This I would expect from a searchlight beacon.  Then it dimmed more, until it was no brighter than a star, and no larger.  As it continued moving south it’s path became erratic, the way a star looks through a telescope as you’re trying to center on it.  It moved up and down, in a jerky motion.  It continued this way, worming it’s way through the backdrop of stars until finally it was too dim to see.  The whole sighting event lasted about three minutes. The bright spotlight effect lasted about 20 seconds before the turn or the dimming, whatever it was, happened.",2008-04-17T00:00:00,39.1866,-121.20109999999998

As I watched , it became apparent that this was not an aircraft or helicopter because of it's very erratic movements-first it appeared to be moving north toward me than suddenly stopped and rapidly turned west and went what appeared to be only a few hundred yards, then stopped again and shot straight up returning to the first position I saw it in.

It was probably as bright as the water tower flasher in Seneca Falls… but this was no water tower.   The flash was moving westbound above the interstate.  Within a four or five flashes,  probably five seconds (it wasn’t flashing quite every second) it was passing over us.  It must have been a bit north of the thruway because I could see it by looking out of the driver’s window.   The lights reflected off of some type of metallic silver body of the craft, but I was unable to get a good grasp of shape or size.  My eyes were confused just looking at it.  It seemed to be triangular with two lights at each point of the triangle.   Leaning towards the window and looking straight up, I was hardly watching the road at this point.

I stopped my car and the lights came toward us, above the car, closer.

I looked and the more we looked at it, it wasn’t moving like an original airplane, it was stopped in the middle of the air.  As we watched it the object seemed to have a lot more lights then a usual aircraft. The lights looked as bright as the lights you would see at a pro baseball game shining down on the field.  The object in the air seemed to be square in the front, and that’s where all the lights where as well as the back end that came to a point with a bright red light that was not blinking it was solid RED! Looking as if it was a  bottle cap from the side.  We sat there and watched this object for a good solid two minutes, but no longer.

As we approached the stop sign, I saw bright lights sinking diagonally downward past a group of trees. Jokingly I screamed ""UFO"" just trying to scare my friend. We turned left at the stop sign heading East towards her house. I was staring ahead at the road and, from the corner of my eye, I saw the flying object we had seen before, over a field. I knew it was the same object because from the side it looked like the shape of a flattened cylinder, and the lights were extremely bright, it was as if I was staring at a stadium from a distance. The lights on this object were incredibly bright and , the lights flashed once but, they never flashed again. I told my friend to stop the car, and she put her hazards on. We sat in her car on the side of the road, for about two minutes watching this object, which had stopped in the sky above a field, to our right. The object was about the height of a water tower above the field, so we knew it couldn’t have been an airplane because, airplanes don’t usually fly that low to the ground. After about two minutes, the object started to move away in the same direction it came from, but it went diagonally up at a fast speed, in the almost exact same path it lowered in. As the object was going up, I saw a red light which was not blinking at all. Frightened, I told my friend to just put the car in drive and leave. I knew we couldn’t have mistaken the object as a light from a city because, we were on back roads in the country and there aren’t many tall lights like we saw around, in a field.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,40.8726,-81.8599

In July of 1957, I was a cadet at the Air Force Academy which was then located at the temporary site at Lowry Air Force Base on the outskirts of Denver.  At the time of the sighting, I was taking practice celestial fixes pursuant to becoming an Air Force navigator. The exact date escapes me, but it was in July.  There were celestial navigation trainers in the quadrangle, small enclosures with astrodomes inside, that each of us used with a bubble sextant hung from an astrodome.  The sextants were 1.5 power and were pre-set by the student for azimuth and elevation.  Once the settings were in the sextant, the student would look into the eyepiece and choose the brightest star in the field to set the sextant crosshairs and hold them there for two minutes.  The two minutes was necessary for the sextant averager to arrive at the proper elevation for the precomputed time of the shot. On this night, I had precomputed a shot for Kochab in the Little Dipper, set the proper azimuth and elevation into the sextant, and had set the crosshairs on the bright star in the field.  I began the shot and was adjusting the elevation as the averager was ticking away. The ""star"" I was shooting held firm with other stars in the field for about half  minute. Then I noticed that the azimuth and elevation were changing in excess of what was usual and could see that the supposed star was changing location relative to the other stars in the field.  I took my eye from the eyepiece and watched the ""star"" slowly moving to the right and slightly downward in relation to the other stars. There were two other cadets in the trainer precomputing for a shot.  I tried to show them the ""star"", but they could not easily see it among the other stars and it was moving too slowly for them to notice it easily - so they lost interest quickly and never saw what I was attempting to show them.  I was not excited because the nothing exciting seemed to be happening.  Consequently, the other cadets went back to what they had been doing. I watched the ""star"" continuing to move for a distance of about ten degrees across the sky (perhaps it was less) and then it stopped and just stayed in place with the other stars once more.  I continued to watch the ""star"" for several minutes and checked its location again before I left the trainer (at least a half hour later).  The object never moved again during this time relative the other stars. I thought about this for some time.  I never reported it.  This was before there was ever even a Sputnik.  Later, in the Air Force, I learned of many UFO sightings that were never reported (reporting them was unwise at the time), and I began to think that what I had seen was a ""mother ship"" changing its solar orbit (otherwise, it would have been moving all the time).",,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

At first glance, it appeared in its flying “behavior”* to be almost kite like, moving very slowly in a very mild zigzag type of formation slowly rising upwards. The objects shape was somewhat circular** and its color was stark white. The object’s location was NNE in the sky and about 65 – 70° from the horizon. The size of the object in the sky was about as big as the head of a large nail, or the circumference of a regular drinking straw.  Event: As I was standing outside smoking a cigarette, I noticed in the sky an object that appeared upon first glance to be drifting in the wind. The movement of the object appeared to be in a gentle upward rising zigzag motion towards the NNE direction. Upon 10 seconds of observation, the object made what appeared as a semi-circular loop type of movement sending it further upwards toward a small cloud in the sky. The object passed behind the cloud, hesitated, did another semi-circular loop changing direction towards the NNW again yet maintaining an upward rising movement. The movements of the object itself were not in any way angular, jarring, or sudden; all of its movements were extremely gentle and graceful. At about 25-30 seconds of observation, after coming out from behind the cloud (the cloud itself was dense, yet allowed enough light to pass through it allowing a fairly unobstructed view of the objects flight through the cloud itself) the object appeared to pick up speed moving in a more distinct westerly direction in a more linear flight pattern. It was after that that I ran into my home to grab my camera, by the time that I came back outside the object was completely gone.  * By behavior, I am referring to the way the object moved through the sky itself.  ** The shape of the object appeared to be circular with other features that seemed to be somewhat angular. Unfortunately, the object was far enough in the air that a detailed description of its features are difficult to describe.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,33.414035671514114,-111.92091958939265

Then I started looking at the area of sky where they all seemed to be originating or heading to.  It was then I saw several ""power ups"" as someone else refers to them.  In a span of about 45 minutes I saw at least 6 lights appear from nowhere and become the brightest thing in the sky or as they were traveling become the brightest thing in the sky.  These flare ups lasted no more than about 3 to 5 seconds and then after they went back to looking as though they were just satellites traveling across the night sky.  On two occasions I saw very bright flashes of light that only lasted a fraction of a second but they were bright enough to catch my attention.

I was not without understanding of certain things in life, and as I have grown up, I have talked about this with my parents, and with my grandparents. The story has not changed at all since the events took place. It is not a wild crazy story, but simple and pure. I hope people can see how most UFO stories really happen, and can also see the degree of fear that comes over a person as this happens, especially to a young person like me, who barely understood exactly what aliens and flying saucers were really all about. It was not until I was a little older that I had a fuller understanding. Still, I knew at the time as the events I will describe unfolded that aliens meant people from another planet and UFOs were possibly spaceships. 	I have not altered this story knowingly, and I have written it down before, but not in recent times. I was 12 when I first wrote it down, and I am not even looking at that as I type this account. I know the story perfectly well in my head, and as you will see, there really is not much to it. I just want people to understand, that I did not embellish this in any way, and I do not want any publicity. I want only to share something that happened. I still have dreams about it. Not really nightmares, because I welcome the experience in my head. At the time, I was scared, and shaking. 	This all took place in the summer of 1971 in early July. I do not have the exact date, and it is mostly irrelevant in this case since I do not want a case study done. Nothing would ever be proven in this situation or in this account. This story will stand as the only witness to what happened near my grandparent’s home in the woods 4 miles south of Steelville Missouri. 	It was 8 PM in the evening and the family was playing cards at my grandparent’s house in Steelville, Missouri (just south of town about 3-4 miles off a dirt road into a woods where they had a nice modern house). I was watching TV nearby in the front room, to this day I am not even sure what I was watching. I do remember that at some point there was something that felt like a vibration from a very low frequency that shook the house. The house is made of brick, and so to shake it means there was a real force at work. Then the electricity went out, and then the phone started ringing, and ringing. Then the back yard lit up in a dull orange glow and something very bright was low just above the trees in the woods behind the house. My grandma answered the phone, but it was still be ringing with the receiver off the hook. All our hair by this time was standing on end either from the fright or electrical static charge that seemed to be in the air. It was mom who spotted the orange light in (over) the woods through the sliding glass doors. We all went out back and began watching it, but then it came closer and closer and then I got scared and ran inside the house. I was afraid they were coming this way! They were! I have no idea who they were. I never found out, and the story pretty much ends here, because we saw this light and I mean it was more than a light, it was a huge glow. It was bright, but not over the top bright maybe the woods dulled it some and I was seeing it more or less shaded. It finally appeared in clear view, but was higher in the sky, and went straight up and out of site VERY VERY fast. I did not see it go up; this was told to me by my parents as they came inside, and as we recounted this story. I missed only a few seconds of the show, as it only lasted for 5 minutes or so total time. The power came on and the phone stopped ringing as it left. No one else saw it to my knowledge, and there really are no neighbors close by at all. There were almost no sounds from the light/craft except that low vibrating feeling. It remained always an orange color with no flashing lights. It left, and that is all there is to tell. In a story like this, you will see that I have very few hard details, as there are really none to tell. I can see this all in my head, and it happened. I have no idea what the light was, but it was not anything I would guess is from our current technology. What flies up that fast and goes up and into outer space in a few seconds or less, perhaps as little as 1 second. There are so many stories about people seeing a light in the sky and it all proves so very little in the long run. I have very little to offer, but there is no misinterpretation being made. I have offered this simple story up, and know it is truly a UFO sighting. I hope others who have seen similar lights or craft will be able to gain more understanding from my encounter with a strange light in the sky. There was never anything found in the woods either, nothing burned, no evidence of any kind. We do not believe it landed. It always remained above the trees. Thank you for letting me share this story. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2007-08-14T00:00:00,37.8591,-91.0031

Not a cloud in sight and there was no sun to obstruct my view.  As I was lying out doors in my back yard on my back and looking directly straight up into the clear blue sky I noticed an illuminated thin straight line that appeared directly in my site of view. It shined for a second and looked like it was glass or metallic. At my first sight of the illuminated line it was vertical. It then switched to a horizontal position in a split second and was about 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch in length against the blue sky. I watched the horizontal illuminated perfect straight line tilt up on its right side and move up and down and to the left and to the right. Then I watched it tilt up on its left side and move around the same way. It moved with such speed and accuracy I have never seen anything like this before in my life. It then leveled off to a horizontal position, hovered for a second and then took off crossing the entire south side of the sky in a split second. It had easily covered a 180 degree angle if not more. The object was always a perfect straight illuminated line and never did it bend. It broke every law of physics regarding speed and flight capability. I am very lucky, honored and privileged to have experienced something of this magnitude in my life time. It was truly something that was NOT even close to being of this world or man made. The object sighting lasted for about 5.5 to 6 seconds. If one wasn’t looking into this exact section/area of the sky at this exact moment one would not be able to see what I saw. It was not visible to all. You really had to be focused on that exact area. The speed of the object was like taking a laser pen and pointing it against a wall and moving it rapidly around up and down to the left and to the right. It was moving that fast in the sky. This is only something one could see if they were watching a sci- fi movie. The technology we have in our armed forces and in this world today are (stone- aged) compared to what I have witnessed and I would take a polygraph test 100 times just to prove what I saw was in fact real.

This blueish formation got bigger and smaller, and seemed to hover in the same area and stayed all night.  The next night the same blueish formation was seen again, however this sighting was slightly farther away from the original spot.   The next night it was consistent with the day before's sighting.  Over the last few days, it has been cloudy here so if the formation was there, it was not seen by myself or the other witness.  Tonight was the most interesting of all the sightings so far.  At 9:00 pm est, I went outside and there was a new light, this time it was a bright white/blue light, and seemed to be in a disc formation.  Over the course of 10 minutes, the light got dimmer.  In an effort to take a picture, I let the flash on my camera go off, which in turn, seemed to cause a reaction to the formation, because the formation lit up at least ten times brighter than before.  Over the next five minutes, I also noticed that the original blue formation was visible, but both formations were still very far from one another.  As I was looking at the new formation, I noticed a commercial airplane flying towards the formation, and the airplane was going to fly over the formation.  As soon as the airplane was about to fly over the formation, the lights on the formation dimmed drastically, and seemed to disappear in the night sky.  The most interesting part was that after the plane was out of sight, the formation lit up again, and stayed lit.

I decided to fiddle around with my new cell phone's digital camera and started taking pictures of an industrial park across the highway. It was a beautiful spring day, and the sun was still high in the sky/just beginning to go down in the western horizon. I took two or three photos before this one and there was no spot or other anomaly on the photographs. I only noticed this anomaly IN the camera, as this last shot was kind of facing a very bright sun, and did not see the object when I was taking the picture.  I thought when I looked at the image (after shooting it) in the camera frame that it was a glitch due to pointing it into/near the sun; that maybe the camera didn't like that, but as stated, the other images taken didn't have this very obvious defect. There were no birds, planes, weather balloons, balloons in general or blimps flying overhead. It was a very bright day. I don't know what this is, but it was there and gone in an instant apparently.  I had another strange thing happen with a singular stationary star-like bright light shining VERY brightly over my apartment building the other night as well (about five or six  days ago), but I don't want to send it as it has identifying street markers and I am extremely nervous about sending it via the internet due to the violent/anti-civil rights atmosphere in our government at the moment... I'm not paranoid, but let's just say I am extremely wary of the possibilities...  Please feel free to analyze this image, do anything you want to the photo, just please don't publish my name.

Stopped on the crest of a hill and pulled of onto the dirt from paving. right away a bright red star caught my attention. thought maybe a planet. suddenly, it started moving in a straight line to the south east at a steady quick pace. it seemed to align with another constellation, stop, hover, and then disapeared. I got scared and decided to go back in town and watch from there. drove down by the saskatchewan river, stopped the car, and played some music, and watched another reddish light seemingly apear out of nowhere, and move in a straight line to the north. it moved like the first only this one disapeared without realigning with other stars. My wife then called me on my cell and asked where i was. I told her i was down by the river watching strange lights. She asked me to pick her up, and so i did. We decided to go out of town again because i felt a little braver with my wife with me. We stopped in almost the same place as i had been before, and watched a total of 5 lights appear, manuever across the sky at fast paces, and seemingly change course quickly, zig zag, half circle, usually crossing about 1/3 of the night sky. One in particular began very dim, and at a point in its travel, flared very bright for a count of 1 second or less, then became dim again. My wife exclaimed ""holy shit, did you see that?"" and yes i had, and my reaction was quite similar but i did not express the words. These sightings of these seven lights, lasted 2 hours nearly as we continued to watch the night sky intensly and would exclaim to each other ""Ive Got One"". really quite the eye opener for me, and my wife. We both concluded they were not jets as they moved too fast, appeared from nowhere, hovered in star formations, zigzagged on their flight paths, change light from dim to flaring bright, and disapeared as fast as they appeared. take this for what you will.

While driving WEST on Route 84 @ the Massachusetts & Conneticut border, it was a rainy evening, but it had subsided and there was quite a bit of ground fog.  I kept thinking I was seeing a reflection of light in the fog on the left hand side of my front windshield.  I asked my passenger if he saw that light up ahead and if he could see where it was coming from.  At first we both thought it was one of those giant spotlights that business' shine into the sky to attract customers.  But then as we kept watching it we realized it wasn't moving around at all.  It was like a cylinder of light coming from nowhere.  It didn't shine all the way to the ground, and it didn't go all the way up high into the sky.  We pulled over and turned off all the lights in the car and just watched it for about 10minutes.  It stayed right where it was, this perfect up & down cylinder of light, that was so bright....there were a lot of dark clouds up there and tons of fog...we could not figure out where that light was coming from.  Maybe a plane??  Well, it hasn't moved in 15minutes, it's not going forward & back /in & out either in the cloud cover.  It was just THERE, UP AND DOWN.  So we decided to try to follow towards it and see if we could find where it was coming from, we drove about 8 miles towards it and it slowly just began to fade away.  It was like, ""there it is!! Wait! It's fading away...I can barely see it...it's gone.""  I don't know what it was but it was crazy and nothing like the two of us had EVER seen before.  After we turned back around to drive home we saw a plane in the sky straight up and ahead of us, we looked immediately for any similarities to what we had just seen and there were NONE.  Just as we both agreed on that, the plane was gone from our sight, not even two minutes after we first saw it.  There was no way the cylinder of up/down light that we saw could've been an airplane, we studied it in the same spot for almost 40minutes, and it wasn’t like it faded or disappeared into the clouds, the light just slowly faded.  In your characteristics of objects section I checked that there was an aura or haze around the object, this does refer to the reflection of the light onto the clouds and fog, we did not see any specific ""object"".",2006-05-15T00:00:00,42.1017,-72.0798

When it was going east it was blue/white, when it was going west it was red/white.  When it was red, my dog would look up at it and whine, when it was blue again he would stop.  This went on for a while (I had no watch) then it turned east again after going back and forth, turned very red and disappeared.  It was quite odd.  I checked the iridium paths tonight and saw none for this area of the sky at this time.

I wasn't going to report this but since I see from this site's homepage that there have been others sightings in my area, I tought that I should relate my experience before all the others details are posted.  I live in a community southwest of Portland, Oregon.  While I was outside looking at the night sky my attention was drawn to an object just NE of my zenith near the head of Ursa Major.  The object was very faint, nearly transparent but certainly had some form.  It was difficuly for me to judge it's size but I estimate that it was approximately 1 degree of arc.  It's shape was either rectangular or oval.  The object being very faint, it was my impression that it was purposely difficult to see.  Without it's movement, I may not have seen it at all.  But once ""locked on""  I was able to follow it.  The object was mostly black either because it was transparent against the dark sky or made of a dark material.  I'm not sure which.  But it did have a very subtle green and red glow.  The object moved in a straight line from Ursa Major due east past the ""guardians"" made a quick jog to the north and resumed an easterly course.  I lost it soon after this course correction in the murkiness of the city lights and did not see it again.  I estimate that the object covered about 50 degrees of sky in about the 4 seconds that I tracked it in front of me.  It made no sound.  I can't really explain what I saw.  I googled ""ufo reporting"" in hopes of finding something out and was pleased to see that the Portland area was at the top of your site although my event was a few nights earlier.   I hope this information helps and I'll be checking back to see if any conclusions are made.  I'd love to know what the heck it was.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

I always look at the stars. I love to try to find the different constellations in the sky…On Wednesday January 30 at about 8:45 I was watching the sky and I noticed a particularly bright star in the southern sky that I have never seen...and didn't see the night before… as I was watching it seemed as if the star was getting closer and moving slightly...I did work all day so…I rubbed my eyes and the stars light had expanded into a crescent shaped light. I called for my boyfriend and my father to come out side and see….The more I looked at it there was no way that the light was high enough to be a plane and it seemed to be hovering and moving slowly. I went inside and continued to look out the sliding glass door. There was a light coming from the top of the tree line coming from the north traveling south. The light was not a color that I know but it reminds me of halogen head lights. Sort of blue-ish. But not like a light on a plane…not blinking…just steady…but to clear to be a headlight. The object continued over the tree line and then began traveling towards the crescent shaped light.  As the object passed by there was a series of lights on the back of the object. I again called for my family they also saw the object but could not identify was it was and there was no sound at all for it to be a plane or helicopter….and moved to slow…across the sky…it was so strange. I continued to watch and multiple smaller objects began to appear. Similar to the one that had come from the tree line and but smaller in size moving faster with more erratic type of movements. There were probably 7 or 8 of them at different points in the sky. They seemed to cross the sky in formation…and to move with purpose as if they were being instructed to do what they were doing…..They hovered at a point for a moment and then they began to fly around the sky going in a circular patter flying from west to east passing close to the crescent light and then moving on, sometimes moving in a zig zag pattern. At one po! int an o bject came from the crescent light. There were three small bright lights it hovered for a moment. My eyes caught a bright flashing light coming from the woods. The light was a sort of off white color…it streaked across and then the light went up into the sky….I saw the same object that I saw leave the crescent shaped light begin to move to above where the lights from the woods were. It hovered around there just above the tree line and then it would move back to the crescent light. Then back again….this continued for a while…While this was going on the other objects were continuing to move in their circular formation. They would occasionally dart around. But for the most part they made their circle around the crescent light. I was beginning to become very frightened. Normally you can hear things in the woods…Animals scurrying around leaves blowing….something…..but it was dead silent. No wind no nothing just the cold and these moving lights. I finally had to make myself go to bed this was about 1:30am. But I was so frightened I slept in the living room. I don’t know what those things were….and I don’t know what they were doing but they weren’t planes…and they weren’t helicopters. There is a small airport close to our house…and I see planes and such all the time pass by often….I have looked at the sky at my home every night of my life and I have seen anything like these things that have been happening. The next morning…when I was driving my daughter to school I the clouds were in the sky but I could see little silver lights…while I was driving…as I was turning into her school my car shut of for no reason…my car is in perfect running condition…and has never shut off before….I am just really scared with all the things that have been happening….like this for instance.  I have been noticing these lights in the woods…down below the tree line…but I had been passing them off as light coming from the woods from my neighbors or car lights just to make myself feel better about them. But when I saw the light streak and then go into the sky I know now what I have been seeing is not car lights or light from neighbors….About 4-6 weeks ago I was outside and I saw a bright light flash in the tree line…it wasn’t a camera it wasn’t a car b/c there is about 6 acres of trees that way….The light wasn’t coming from the ground it was coming from about halfway up into the trees….I was even with me and I was standing on the second story of the house on the deck….facing out over our pond….and the light came from the trees on the backside of the pond. I called for my father….and he came out and saw it flash again….I kind of jumped back….he was amazed as I was because of where it was coming from it just didn’t really leave any explanation for what it was.  The type of light it was it really what was so odd….it isn’t a flash it pulsed….grew stronger and then vanished….but the light that we saw that night was the same kind of light that was on these objects….then moments later I was going back into the house to get our flashlight…and the light pulsed again.( from the same place that the light went up into the sky on Wednesday night) there is no way that someone could have moved that fast through the woods its over 100yd from the place the light pulsed the first time to the place where I saw it the last time….its thick wooded area with creeks and tress brush. And there was no sound. Dead quiet. The light didn’t pulse again that night that I saw.  Yesterday I went to take my daughter to see my grandmother. I asked them if they had noticed anything odd in the sky last night. I asked them because they live about 1/10 of a mile from my home.  They both said no….but my grandmother said that the week before she had seen a very bright strange light that had gone down into the trees and then moved back up into the sky….She said that she was so astounded because she had never seen anything like that before.   I don’t know what all of this is….but I know its something…I am having to laugh at myself a little to keep myself from being so frightened…because I have seen what I thought might be a UFO before and thought…oh cool a ufo look at that. But I am really really frightened by what took place on Wednesday night at my home….These objects moved to organized with too much purpose…they moved like they were doing something…. Last night it rained…I didn’t see the lights in the sky because of low cloud cover but I did see the light in the trees.  I am 25 years old. I have lived in this house most of my life. My father is 50. My boyfriend is 22. My grandmother is 83",2008-02-14T00:00:00,35.9446,-80.4391

There is so much going on in my life right now, that the last thing I’d want to do is spend even a moment doing anything that isn’t personally productive.  However, I have a strong feeling that what I witnessed needs to be reported.  Because of a work-related assignment, I have rented a 1,500 sq. ft. condo in an area of Punta Gorda, Florida, called Punta Gorda Isles, since May of 2007, and will be here until mid-December of 2007.  My condo is on the fourth floor of a building in a complex called Fountain Court.  The condo faces the north, and it has a screened in balcony that faces north as well.  The balcony looks out over a beautifully landscaped circular drive area, and beyond that is a street, then a complex of two story apartment buildings, then another building.  For about a mile-and-a-half beyond that are tree tops and, low on the horizon, a couple of buildings, a few broadcasting towers and a high-rise construction crane.  The face of the balcony is approximately nine feet across.  I work at home and, (though I wouldn’t want this known because I’m in the health field) I smoke.  Therefore, several times during every day and night, I walk out onto the balcony, sit down, smoke a cigarette and think.  I also make many business calls out there.  On the evening of Monday, September 24th, I was sitting on the balcony smoking a cigarette.  The sky at the time was a grayish color, and it was a patchwork of clouds (in different shades of gray) at different altitudes.  I was just staring forward as I always do, because there is nothing else to do.  Anyway, while I was sitting there I noticed what appeared to be a dull silver-colored parachute floating downward out of the clouds at an angle headed directly towards me.  However, there weren’t any lines/cords hanging from the parachute, nor was there anything or anyone suspended from what appeared to be the parachute.  I remember wondering why there wasn’t anything suspended from the parachute, and I can remember thinking that maybe the parachute cables were clear plastic and just couldn’t be seen – but that didn’t make sense.  I can also remember wondering how the parachute could be pulled towards the ground by gravity if there were no weight beneath the parachute to draw the parachute towards the ground.  Nonetheless, I wondered why someone would be parachuting at night, and I wondered where they could land at night with all the trees and buildings in the area.  Punta Gorda and where I live here are the most boring places on earth and, therefore, what I was witnessing should have riveted my attention – but it didn’t probably because of the following reasons:  1. I am in the middle of some very stressful situations at work, with which my mind was preoccupied.  2. I was taking a smoke break while working on another book, and I was thinking about what I had been writing and what I would continue writing when I walked back inside.  3. There are so many technologically-advanced things that are happening these days that almost nothing surprises us anymore.  4. And, this may seem strange, but it seems like I wasn’t supposed to see it.  No matter what else was on my mind, I can’t now understand why I wasn’t riveted to what was occurring in front of me.  As the object came closer I realized that the top of the object was flat, its sides were curved like a parachute, and its bottom was flat.  For an instant I thought it may have been an odd-shaped advertising blimp that had broken free.  However, there were no illustrations or writing on the object, and the object wasn't shaped like any blimp I'd ever seen.  In the middle of this, I stood up and walked about two feet indoors to get another cigarette off the table that is right next to the door.  Then I turned back outside and stood there on the balcony watching the object come closer.  I noticed that the wind was gently blowing to the west, however, the object was coming in towards me at a direct and seemingly determined angle – almost as if it were guided by a rail (which it wasn’t) – and it was totally unaffected by the wind.  Therefore, I began to assume that it was somehow propelled.  I then turned inside again (this time to get a lighter – which took about four  seconds) and, when I turned back out onto the patio, the object was traveling east at about thirty-five miles per hour.  I didn’t see the object make the turn, but from its before and after locations and motions, it seemed that it would have had to have made a sudden left turn.  Although the object was obviously propelled by something, there were no sounds whatsoever, nor were there any jets, propellers or other visible or audible indications of propulsion.  After the object made its left turn, it was traveling, as stated, at about thirty-five miles per hour.  It was traveling about twenty feet above the tree tops, and I realized from my vantage point that the object was about the size of a compact to mid-sized car.  I moved to the westernmost corner of my balcony and watched the object maintain a constant altitude and speed as it traveled east.  I watched the object travel east for about fifteen to thirty seconds until it disappeared into the haze of the eastern sky.  I now realize how these types of things can happen and no one reports them.  It was all quite inconspicuous, quiet, and it was over with so quickly that it wasn’t until it was over that I had time to really think about what just occurred.   And, after it was over, I realized all the things the object wasn’t:  1. It wasn’t a parachute  2. It wasn’t an advertising blimp, and there was no advertising on the object.  3. It wasn’t like any kind of craft that I’ve ever seen or heard about before.  4. The object had no windows, no antenna(s), no wheels or pods, no propellers, jets or other visible means of propulsion and it was absolutely silent.  To me it strongly seemed that the object had a mission.  It came down at an exact angle from the sky.  It turned and went in an exact direction to the east.  After it turned to the east, it maintained a constant altitude just above the trees and buildings.  If it had been a government craft, it would have most obviously been a surveillance craft.  After the object disappeared, I became a bit upset with myself for not being totally focused on what had occurred from beginning to end.  I wished, for example, that I would have witnessed the object stop its descent and make its turn to the east.  The next evening, Tuesday evening, September 25th, I was at a small meeting where I had to give a talk.  A very level-headed woman, with whom I work, was there.  I told her about what I’d witnessed the night before.  She responded by saying: “That’s strange.  My mother told me that she saw something unusual in the sky by Punta Gorda Isles last night at about 8:30 p.m.”  I said, “That’s where I live, in Punta Gorda Isles, but I thought it was about 11:30 or midnight when I saw what I saw.”  She said, “No, my mother said it was at about 8:30 last night.  However, you know my mother is very intelligent but she is eighty-seven years old.”  We all chuckled and that was it.  Anyway, I definitely saw what I saw and it was real and not imagined.  It may have been a new type of government craft but, if so, it was unlike anything I’d ever heard or read about.

The sun was setting so it was not completely light out at the time. Two people, whom I didn't see, were walking out had stopped and pointed towards the sky looking at something and then left ( as I was later told). As I was almost in the door i heard  another person say something like "" look at that glider up there."" So I walked back out in front of the store and tried to see the glider. Two other people now were looking at the ""glider."" The object was located east of where I was standing and was high enough to be visible from the light of the setting sun. At first it was hard to find but when I did I immediately didn't think that it was a glider, and by glider i mean hang glider. A glider would probably not be flying that high near a major city (Nashville air traffic flies right over the area) or when it was getting dark. It was high up in the air, somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 feet possibly, and was very dark colored, most likely black. It was triangular in shape. There were no lights on it to indicate it was an airplane or otherwise. It appeared to be moving very slowly north, northeast as best as I could tell. One of the witnesses towards the end said ""look theres two."" The object or possibly objects either moved away or it was just too dark to see them after a couple of minutes.

When it isn't updated for a month or more at a time, why would people bother to visit very often?  It's sad to me to see it neglected the way it is.  I know you must be terribly busy, but surely it wouldn't take long to add a couple or so new reports daily. It's also a potential money-maker for you.  You have national name recognition amoung certain people.  You could be selling T-shirts, hats and mugs with the Nuforc logo on them.  I have a cousing in Oregon who produces such things, and I promise you, that didn't occure to me until just a second ago. Anyway, I guess that's all I have to say.

I live near an airport so Im used to seeing planes coming in for a landing and also going by after a takeoff. I was looking east and was watching a passenger jet going by and above to the right of the plane was a bright light. The plane was at about 11:oclock and the bright light at about 1:oclock but higher than the plane. I thought at first that the light was a star until it started to move. At first it moved slowly at a downward angle like a swooping arc. It came from above and not the horizon which freaked me out. No blinking lights, no noise, no humming, no indication of anything. It came from the east and was heading west at the same time the plane was coming from the west heading east. There was a moment when I saw both plane and object at the same time. As the light was getting closer it started to level out and when it passed over me I could see 3 dimly lit lights on what I think was the belly of the object. I couldnt tell how big the lights were or how fast it was moving but it was moving fast as if like gliding or like slipping on ice and just moving without moving parts. Thats not all. From the same direction that I first saw the light another light appeared. This light was it seems smaller and was a metallic shiny red light that did not emit light but glowed. The red light moved at a very rapid pace and caught up to the white light in just what seemed a few seconds.It looked liked the red light either was swallowed up by the white light or they were very close together. I cant stop thinking about it. It wasnt natural and was quite alien to me. It reminded me a little of  the movie close encounters when the peeps were on the highyway and saw the crafts fly by. I really cant stop thinking of this and am wondering if anyone else out there has seen this.

It moved from a northerly direction to a south-westerly direction, therefore it did not do straight over the house, it kind of moved off to the left but overhead.  This object made absolutely no sound whatsoever, and this is why I can’t explain it as anything other than a UFO.

This event took place on my vacation to Maui, as stated before this happened at 10pm when my girlfriend and I were walking down a path away from the ocean.   Soon enough I looked back to see a little light circle or sphere, I’m not sure it was too small.  The small light from right to left bounced in a specific pattern, the light moved horizontally very quickly in a straight or slightly curved path and then “bounced” a much further distance and appeared to enter the ocean although there was no splash or sound.  I was shocked as was my girlfriend and suddenly the light moved in spiral motion about 720 degree circle and then at an angle it shot up into the sky from left to right.  There was another small pause and then from left to right the light did the exact same thing that it did at the very first time but the other way and entered the ocean the same.  At this point were more shocked than ever, I have no idea how to explain it.  To give you a timeline it was about 2 minutes total: [10sec] ball bounced right to left, [45sec] still sky, [10sec] ball circled and shot into sky, [45sec] still sky, [10sec] ball bounced left to right.  Also I’d like to add this event looked to be quite far out over the ocean and took place at night.  To give you a relative distance, look out over the ocean from the Outrigger Maui Eldorado property, measure the distance between edges of the beach that you can see and about ¼ of that distance was the total distance the ball moved left to right, right to left, and left to right again.  I hope that’s enough details, I looked online a bit to see if I could find a similar experience because I’m not sure what it was, if it was a UFO or an energy source I have no way to explain the event in my head.  There isn’t any way it could be a ball being thrown or a human craft, nothing could move as fast as it did and as far as it did, I’ve compared ideas with my girlfriend as well and neither of us can think of anything that it could have been.  If anyone has a better explana! tion of what it could have been PLEASE let me know, I can’t say I know 100% that it was a UFO but I know nothing on our planet at this time can move like that did in the air, and absolutely nothing man made could move that fast.

At first glance I thought it was a typical aircraft however, it was pulsating from dim to bright very slowly and irregularly.  I gave close attention to it as it began to slow down.  It eventually went out of my line of sight and so I got out of bed and ran outside in the dark.  The object came to crawling stop. After 1 minute of me having seen the object initially, it had covered 90 degrees of the entire horizon, which meant that it was either ridiculously quick, or that it was ridiculously close.  However, the first thing I noticed when I went outside was that there was no noise at all. This object was completely silent.  It stood still in the sky for approximately 3 or so minutes. It looked much like a radio tower beacon at this point as it was not moving, and its blood red illumination continued to dim and brighten randomly.  At this point I was considering waking my parents up, or running and getting the camera, or even jumping in my car to chase it, but I was frozen.  I am now kicking myself for not having got the camera.   At this point I was also coming to terms with the possibility that I was probably the witness of a UFO sighting.  On closer inspection I noticed that the object was in fact made up 3 distinct lights, forming a triangle.  The object eventually began to descend very gently and then vanished entirely.

This event took place while I was working outside-time is approximate but I would say 7:15 or 7:20. The morning was warm and sunny and the sky was clear. When I first noticed it my thought was that it was a plane leaving a con trail (this was very near the Palm Springs airport) but I could not see any object only a large bright white plume. However, something was emitting a billowing plume behind it. The plume was not like a standard con trail- it billowed or seemed to roll behind the object almost like pulsing out-and also dissapated quite quickly - I would say it dissapated in maybe 2000 feet. Another interesting thing to note is that I could not hear it (I was about a mile from it) nor actually see an object ahead of the plume. Airplanes engines make noise and in this valley you can definitely hear them from much further away. I work around the airport and I am familiar with all the engine sounds that our air traffic makes, but this did not make any sound. Mount San Jacinto is approximately 12,000 feet high and was the background setting as this object went by, close to the mountain, heading west to east at an altitude of approximately, based on the height of the mountain, 8,000 feet. I also used the height of the mountain to estimate the length of the trail. I have to believe that tons of folks also witnessed this but found no mention of it on any of the news broadcasts. I have never seen an airplane leave a con trail at that altitude here nor seen a con trail like it. I had my binoculars in the car, unfortunately not around my neck, so I couldn't get a better look at whatever it was. But, as I said, I was working at the time and the work was time sensitive and demanding of my attention so I had to focus back on my work. When I had a chance to look for the object, about 2 minutes later, it was gone or out of sight. Has anyone seen anything similar or perhaps witnessed this same object?

I noticed, over the nearby parallel north-south runways, a very small black object moving in a straight line under the clouds going in a direction from northwest to southeast ..perhaps at an altitude of 1000 to 2000 feet...its speed was that of a slow moving airplane not a jet...but not as slow as a bird...The winds were gusting to 35mph which I had checked on our company's weather information page prior to taking the elevator to the top floor of the building and the airport was closed at this time for takeoffs and landings. The clouds were literally swirling in 3 directions overhead and windshear must have been pretty strong  ...all air traffic on the ramp had come to a halt and no planes were landing.  This object was big enough to be noticeable but too small to determine the exact shape which was so frustrating though I want to say that it did not look aerodynamic for some reason.  There was no wing flapping motion and even though one of my friends told me it had to be a bird, I'm not certain a bird could hold it course going through a severe thunderstorm without being tossed around or altering its flight path . I would think at this point it would be blown all over the place as even we were being buffeted and pushed around by the winds. Nor could a bird traverse the entire airport In 1 minute as it had crossed the field in a straight line neither moving up or down and as it traversed the airport going south east I could see that the object neither moved to the right or left but continued on this straight axis to the end of the cloud build up....possibly 2 miles away then swung up at the end of the cloud bank and went into the upper clouds in an extreme parabolic path....its flight path was neither typical of a bird or a plane. 1 thing was puzzling and that was even when it was at its closest to terminal A we could not make out its shape yet even when it was far away we could still see the black object....",2006-07-16T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

I was standing at that bank of windows when, to my north-east, I saw two oval objects seem to rise together out of the trees in a nearby neighborhood. What impressed me were two things:  1. The difference in altitude remained very constant. The forward-aft distance changed slightly, but they seemed fixed to each other in altitude from each other.  2. Both objects looked identical, but with variations in color/configuration. These changes were seen in unison.  Also, we have a lot of traffic to and from Ellington airfield, including formation flights of the local Air National Guard. These were most definitely F-16's as the ANG unit uses, and their relative position/speed was much slower than that of any plane at the apparent alititude.  As for a description of the objects:  1. Somewhat oval in shape with possibly points to the side. 2. The main bulk was white, the bottom black, and some red on the top surface. The shape and relative proportion of these features changed periodically during it's visibility to me.  I watched the objects transit from their position along a rough vector west to possibly north-west. After Two minutes, the objects passed beyond the corner of the building. I was not able to re-aquire the objects in view after that.  One more side note, probably coincidental: I saw flying along the same basic vector, shortly after the objects were obscured from my view, a small aircraft, possibly a helicopter.

They were flying from the NW to the SE. We were able to watch them for a minute or two before they were not visible to the naked eye any longer. We heard no noise, and they did not leave a contrail.

Hello Mr Davenport,  I am a former CBS reporter that is living near Dallas, TX, and not too far from Stephenville, TX, where, as you know there was a very dramatic sighting.  (I actually did a report for you a couple of years ago about a sighting I personally had in Amityville, NY that was very clear).  I did not see the incident myself. But I thought you would enjoy a compliation of what has been reported on mainstream media about this since it is getting a lot of coverage from both radio and TV stations in this area.  KRLD radio has had comments about this incident in almost every newscast since the 8th and has reported that they had a flood of calls about it.  WBAP has been discussing it also, and there have been several TV News reports (I no longer get tv/ cable service, so I cannot tell you as definitively about that coverage, only what has been on radio and websites.)  I have compiled the following details from the news reports over the last week that were not mentioned in the report on your front page.  These notes are taken from several news reports over the last week (1-8-08 until today 1-15-08).   Many talk shows have been encouraging callers to call into their stations. (KRLD news dedicated 2 hours to this topic today – and had several credible witnesses including a pilot and a Constable who witnessed the event.)  Many others, including a fire fighter, and other police officers reported seeing the object (and several others). Witnesses have been describing the object as being either a dark brown, black or a grey color ranging from a white to dark grey.  It is possible that it may have been changing color, or to have had different colors on different sides of the object because witnesses even in the same location disagreed about the exact colors. All witnesses agreed that there were orange lights on the object, but reports of white, red and yellow have come out as well.  All reports agreed that the lights were numerous, very bright and flashing or changing.  Several witnesses described something that could have been flames, and one person heard on KRLD said that she believed the object had “dropped” something behind it that appeared to be on fire.  Most witnesses said the lights were moving or changing position  Some reports have said there may have been a smaller second object, but the majority has said one.  The size largest size estimates described the object from ½ mile wide and 1 mile long, the smallest I have heard said “bigger than a football field” It was estimated to be flying at about 300 feet. All agree that the object was smooth on the outside (no wings, no tail or protrusions of any kind) with a shiny surface, but again the color is in debate – All reports agreed that the object had a somewhat cylinder or oval shape to it. The Joint Reserve Naval Air Base is not far from Ft. Worth which does have significant flight activity, however their first response was that they had no knowledge of any aircraft in the air at that time.  There are some witnesses who spotted military planes in the area after the object had been spotted; some say there were chasing the object. The next day there was a statement denying that the military had launched any planes at all.   Monday the naval base reported that this was “probably an illusion created by two commercial planes in proximity,” and again denied that they had launched any of their planes in response to this object. There is a small airport just outside of Stephenville, however it is a small private airport which does not have capacity for anything larger than a twin engine plane.  The closest airports that could have ability to land a commercial jet would be Dallas Love Field, 110 miles away from the sighting, or Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport, 100 miles away, and there are no matching reports of commercial airliners coming close, or flying that low in that area.  (Which would be needed to verify the naval base comment that this was an optical illusion)  Witnesses say the object moved very fast, and appeared to disappear and reappear a few minutes later.  Most say it moved in a straight line, came to a stop and remained stationary for a moment, but it accelerated very quickly and turned sharply, or even appeared to be moving in reverse.  Witnesses report hearing noise from the military planes, but no noise from the object itself. If I may add my opinion:  The military claim that this was an illusion is not plausible for several reasons:  Tthe Object is consistently reported as being the wrong shape; there is a very large portion of the witnesses who are pilots or public safety officers of different branches – all of whom would be able to easily recognize a plane’s shape; and it was after sunset and the witnesses are consistently reporting the lighting as being dark.(i.e. the “reflection of light” wouldn’t have happened.  Finally, the object has been consistently reported as being not more than 300 feet above the ground, at that distance it is clearly visible to see the details on any airplane.  KRLD reported they had tried to confirm this with military bases throughout North Texas and even as far as Oklahoma but had not gotten any confirmation of any kind as to this being their air craft. I will also add, that WFAA  http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/wfaa/latestnews/stories/wfaa080114_mo_ufospotting.21892ccb.html  is reporting that there were several sightings over about a week which may be why there is some inconsistency as to the date of the sightings.  I believe that the majority of witnesses are talking about the sighting on the 8th, but that there have been similar objects seen over Stephenville over the last few weeks. I hope this is helpful to you. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the young woman who submitted the information.

I first wanna say that there are many sightings being reported that are probably farce. I have been a police officer for 17 yrs, have seen many extraordinary things, but I am still in shock over what my 2 sons and I witnessed.   On the 8th of January, 2008, at approximately 1920 hrs. I went outside to gather some firewood, looked across my property which sits on a hill facing the northeast, with a view of approximately 8-10 miles.  I noticed these extremely bright orange or flame colored lights rising 300-500 feet above the horizon.   The lights were horizontally aligned and spanned an area quite wide.  I noticed they would disappear for a few seconds and would appear again at different heights as if they were in sporadic rows.  The lights would come and go in various numbers ranging from as little as two and as many as 12.  I became intrigued with the lights and called my 15 yo son as well as my 18 yo son to come outside and view them. I suggested to my sons that it might possibly be a fire off in the distance, but recanted as the lights progressively reached greater heights.  I went as far as calling the Williamson County Sheriffs Office to see if a fire or something of  that  nature had been reported in the area of the lights.  This call was documented and a Deputy was sent to check the area around 1941 hrs.  We attempted to get photos of the lights but where unable.  The lights disappeared shortly after the call to Williamson County S.O.  I would like to re-iterate the size and brightness of the object rivals nothing of man-made proportions, and my 2 sons could somewhat compare the brightness to the oil drilling rigs you see far offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.

A very bright and very fast moving object was observed entering the atmosphere arriving from the south-south west quadrant at approximately 09:20AM Mountain Standard Time on the Morning of January 09,2008. The object descended towards the western slope of Pikes Peak and visually passed over the Peak in the direction of Colorado Springs,Colorado. It produced no noise. However it created a contrail which was approximately five(5)Miles in length and approximately 5ive(5)Miles in width which suggested to the two witnesses that it was not an aircraft of any known type and that it was unusually large. It did not appear to have wing nor engines. Guess: Approximate size/about the size of a small town. Both observers are ex-Military, and one is a retired Commercial Pilot with more than twenty twenty years flying experience, and holds an Airframe and Power Plant Mechanics License from the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA).  Perhaps this was a large fragment of a Meteorite that skipped off Earth's atmosphere upon entry (because it left a contrail) and then continued back into space on a new trajectory. The closest description(from the retired Pilot) is that the leading edge was extremely bright equal to kooking at the sun. it was more flattened in appearance than any other aspect of shape and wa irregular in shape.

Two Pairs of Stationary Lights over Tualatin seen near a Helicopter,Tualatin,OR,2008-01-09T07:03:00,light,2 Minutes,"Occurred : 1/9/2008 07:03  (Entered as : 01/09/2008 07:03) Reported: 1/15/2008 5:59:26 PM 17:59 Posted: 1/21/2008 Location: Tualatin, OR Shape: Light Duration:2 Minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60885.html,"Two Pairs of Stationary Lights over Tualatin seen near a Helicopter This event occurred on Wednesday, January 9, 2008 at approximately 7:03 a.m.  I was driving N on 65th Avenue at the crest of the rise which coincides with Frobase Road.  It was still quite dark (sunrise that day was at 7:50 a.m.), but it was the first dry morning in some time.  The view at this point in my daily commute is one of the best views I get.  I can see west to the foothills, east to Mt. Hood, and north to Mt. St. Helens on an ultra-clear, summer morning. But on this dark winter morning, I was happy to be able to see the city lights so brightly.  These lights reflecting up at the flat thin clouds gave them a rosy glow. I would estimate the level of the clouds to be about 600’-plus. I base this on the elevation of the road at this point, (topographic map on-line gave elevations between 450’ and 500’) plus about 100-150 ft. of clear skies above me.  The road behind me was clear of cars, so I topped the rise at about 35-40 mph and let the car coast. I immediately notice, just a bit east and above my line-of-sight, four distinct sets of lights grouped in a small amount of airspace, and note that the rest of the skyline is empty. This immediately makes me think “news copters”, and something must be going on near the I-205, which I will cross over in a couple more minutes down the road.  My initial number of four includes a small airplane, furthest on the right, (quickly apparent by motion and lights flashing, gradually moves south out of my view), then two stationary pairs of lights in the middle, and finally, a helicopter, furthest on the left. The helicopter is easily identified by its motion and the main light (plus red and green flashing lights as I get closer).  My assumption is now, “Three News Helicopters” and my thought regarding the two stationary, level “helicopters” is, “Damn, those two guys are GOOD.”  It looked like the helicopter on the left was arcing around, or towards, the two others, at about the same altitude as they were. The movements of the helicopter emphasized to me how dead-set the other two were by comparison. The only distinguishing thing about the stationary lights was that they were round, white lights, set as a pair, side by side. The two objects were level with each other the entire time, and seemed to maintain the same distance from each other. I can only guesstimate: 50-75 yards?  I could perceive no shape behind the lights.  The road drops down gently but steadily, so even with coasting, I had a clear view of the skyline for a maximum of 9-10 seconds before trees blocked the view.  For the next couple of minutes I really didn’t think of it specifically, knowing that I would see the I-205 up ahead, and maybe figure out what was going on.  By the time I actually came to the overpass and dipped down over the freeway, I was more concerned with something happening on the ground rather than in the sky.  There weren’t any bright lights apparent, but as I came up the hill to the Stop Sign at 65th and Sagert, I did look up into the sky again, knowing I could linger just a bit, since there still weren’t any cars coming up behind me.  I really craned my head forward to look up as high as I could, and amazingly, I could make out a hazy pair of lights. But just as I really focused on it, the lights seemed to dim out, and the clouds obscured them completely. So now my thought was, “S#*%!, What timing,… just in time to NOT see it!”  But, just a few seconds later, as I was making my left turn onto Sagert, I figured I’d be able to see the other pair of lights if I looked back over by left shoulder, which I was absolutely right about.  I could just make out the other pair of lights, and once again, just as I focused on it, the lights dimmed out quickly and clouds almost instantly obscured them.  Right about now, I think, was when I sensed that things had changed.  As if the first one disappearing into the clouds wasn’t just bad timing after all. And I would have easily let the first one go, if seen only that once.  But seeing the same scenario, repeated just a few seconds later, in a completely different direction, was hard to write off so easily. It now felt purposeful.  I told two people at work that day, and my husband later that night.  I felt compelled to share my experience, but also compelled to make a diligent effort to eliminate obvious explanations. Since this is my normal work route, it was easy to return during daylight hours and take photos of the surrounding area. I parked and took photos from the intersection looking in all directions. I then drove behind the medical buildings and power substation and took more photos toward the intersection.  I could find nothing in the vicinity that is the right shape of light fixture, and/or tall enough to be seen from the initial distance of almost two miles. I also came back with my husband when it was dark enough to distinguish whether there are any other permanent lights in that particular view from the top of the road. There were none we could see.  I would have reported this sooner, but the only person whose opinion I would be interested in hearing on this subject, happened to be on vacation until Monday. He quickly recommended this site as the best place to report what I saw.  My background includes no special skills or training, but I’ve always been a sky-watcher. I pay attention and take note.  That’s my skill.  Now, what I really want to know is: What did the helicopter and/or airplane pilot see? They were much closer than I was.  I look forward to your call.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,45.3653,-122.7579

There was no noise, no vapor trail, and no perturbation of its straight flight path. It traveled from the northwest to southeast at a very high altitude.

Out my drivers side window at approximately 10 o'clock and about 30 degrees up I saw an oddly shaped black craft traveling directly Southeast.  The instant I spotted it, I leaned down and watched as it traveled in a straight line from NW to SE directly over my roof.  It was in my sight for 2, maybe 3 seconds at the most.  The reason it caught my eye was due to its low altitude and odd shape.  There was a low ceiling and patchy dense fog in the immediate area.   Judging from the apparent altitude of 100-150 feet, the craft was clearly visable and appeared to have a very flattened fuselage 15-20 feet in length, 6-8 feet across with short canards 2-3 feet long approximately 5 feet from the aft end.  It was traveling in the range of 125 to 150 knots would be my best guess.  I saw no lights on the craft in the brief time it was in my sight.  There were no visible means of propulsion and my first impression was that it resembled a shortened cruise missle.  I tried to see it as it passed farther to the SE but my view was blocked.  I did have the radio on, but didn't hear any loud noise I would expect from an aircraft at that altitude.  I continued to look in the general SE direction to see if there were any sudden flashes of light but did not observe any. My location was approximately 1/4 mile West of the Olive Branch airport and 8 miles SE from the Memphis International Airport.

No strobe light, no red/green wingtip lights, no colors, no flashing.  No turn, bank, pitch up or down.   No way to judge size or altitude.  Traversed about 45 degrees of the sky while it was visible, at an elevation angle of about 75 degrees, from west of my location to east of my location.

Disappeared rather suddenly, but not instantaneously, as it moved away from me.  I speculate that it might have been a B2 ""flying wing"" bomber if they had no typical civil aircraft running lights, an array of between 7 to 11 soft-white lights on the leading edge, and were capable of virtually silent motion.  I do live just a few miles NE of Luke AFB, AZ.   I was in a spa (hot tub) at the time, so its noise could have been masking quiet sounds from the object, but I routinely easily hear normal propeller, jet and helicopter sounds when they fly nearby while I'm in the spa.

It moved in a straight line very quickly and them stopped.  Then it moved back to where it started very quickly and stopped.  Then it moved in a downward direction, stopped, then moved in an upward direction and stopped.  It then did a few sharp 90 degree movements as if it were testing the craft to see if it were at peak performance or showing off.  It did some really wide circular and egg shaped manuvers that seemed to be a few miles in diameter.  This looked like only a few inches to me but as far away as they were, I'm sure it was at least a few miles for them.  It then started to do a random mixture of manuvers, accelerating very quickly and just having a ball, playing around. This went on for a good hour with a few rests in between. I am obviously not the only one to observe this behavior because all of the commercial air traffic stopped crossing the normal route.  I walked down off of my back porch into the middle of my back yard and could see a few of the aircraft doing a wide circle back in the direction of the Metro Airport and did not see any aircraft in the area of where the UFO was cutting up.

It also had an aura around it.  It was coming twords my house.  It the distance, I saw a round orange ball with an aura around it going in the opposite direction.  (Moving south of Vandenburg.)   I called for my husband to come outside.  By that time, the orange ball was gone and the orange teardrop was moving away from us and getting smaller, looking like a ball.   Then out of nowhere, another bright orange teardrop UFO shot up into the sky.  By this time I was on the phone with the police department asking if anyone else had called in about these sightings.  (They said ""no"")   We watched as the second UFO was out of sight and the third, follow in the same path of moving twords the house, hovering a few times, then moving away from the house going south, turning into a ball with an aura around it and vanishing out of sight.

Ever since young age, these potential entities have perplexed my mind.  There were points in my life where I was almost literally addicted to the investigation of these phenomena.  ACCOUNT:  I witnessed, for the first time, a UFO at approximately 4:00 AM on the date of May 24, 2007 in the city of Chandler, Arizona.  Not being able to sleep, I decided to do some stargazing in the front of my home.  The object, which first appeared to resemble a star, moved at a steady rate.  The pulsating of light (which appeared to be spontaneous), was one of my determining factors that this was some form of advanced technology.  The UFO seemed to move at an almost constant rate of speed toward the southern hemisphere.  Then, in abrupt fashion, the object disappeared.  Almost immediately after I lost track of the UFO, a helicopter passed by overhead.  Do these two have any correlation to each other?  I’m not sure, but I think it is definitely worth mentioning.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,33.29885793871866,-111.86506392757661

I was sitting outside on my front step and noticed an object in the sky, southeast. I had been watching some planes overhead, and my first thought was that this object looked like something had fallen from a plane – it was silver and seemed to be “falling” in the sky.  I kept my eye on it and as I focused on it, it appeared almost “M” or “E” shaped, but rounded - hard to explain.  It then seemed to stop “falling” and seemed to hover in place for a bit, which made me think maybe it was some sort of balloon or some sort of toy or something.  Almost like when you’re at the beach and watching people flying kites in the distance – how they just seem to hover and rock in the wind. But then it moved again, and came more towards the northeast – that’s when I noticed blinking lights.  I also noticed a plane seem to fly right over it.  (We live near several airports here.)  This is when I decided to run inside and get my video camera.  When I ran back outside, I had trouble spotting it again, but I did manage to catch something on video as it lowered out of sight behind my neighbors rooftop. I have to add - the little bit that the video did pick up did not look the same as what I had seen with the naked eye.  On video, it appeared sporadic and quick, as a silver object, round in shape, seemingly jumping around until it disappeared.  And it’s hard to catch on the video at all unless you go frame by frame.  I’d say the whole “sighting” lasted about 5 minutes from the time I first noticed it to the time I ran outside with my camera and captured a few seconds of it on video.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,40.9233,-73.9984

It was positioned above a contrail.  I watched it for about 5 minutes and could see it was definitely NOT an airplane, helicoptor, hot air balloon, parachutist or other typical aircraft.  I could see it was colored orange and white, was rectangular and was in an upright position, with the narrow sides of the rectangle being the top and bottom of the thing. I could also see it slowly rotating to my right.  After that I ran inside to get my binoculars and was frantically calling my other two sons to come outside and see this thing with me.

I told my 12 year-old son to go get his telescope.   He brought it out quickly and I fiddled with trying to get the thing to focus on the object but it had gotten so high in the sky while traveling westward it was impossible to get the telescope balanced that high although I did get it in view several times only it lose it.  However while I was busy focusing I did see what I thought were white things shooting out of it or something shooting out that disturbed the atmosphere.  I passed it off as my eyes were playing tricks on me while I was trying to focus.  I had seen 4 or 5 of the things shoot out - toward the south.  It looked like white things of various sizes followed by streaks of heatwaves or that clear mirage type of thing.  Then my 12 year-old son said:  ""Mom, I see things shooting out of it!""   I asked him to tell me what they looked like, he said they were white things.  I asked him what direction he saw them go and he said to his right which was the south. I then knew I had indeed seen things shooting out of it.  I gave up on the telescope and used the binoculars while the object then moved south.  We watched this thing for a relatively long time, about 45 mintues total.  Then it just disappeared, vanished.

It was partly cloudy around the horizon. Clear blue sky above. I saw a white or maybe somewhat reflective object in the sky above. At first it looked like an airplane but I noticed how fast it seemed to move. Almost a strange movement, not quite linear. As l looked, time passed and perspective changed it seemed almost as if it were falling. I couldn't exactly say it was falling, but it gave the appearance of a falling object because of the speed it was moving at or the path it was traveling, however the perspective distance that my eye could report told me that it was in fact moving away from the ground at least in an overall direction. There were two dogs that were wandering over towards me and their owner was calling for them. I was distracted for a couple of seconds. When I tried to spot the object again I had lost it. I kept looking and sighted it again in a few seconds. The object was further away, heading NE. It almost seemed to float. While I was questioning what it was I thought of a bird, a seagull hovering in the convective wind high above. That is the first thing I could relate it to because of the nature of it's movement. After gauging it's path through the sky I realized that did not make sense. I was tracking it and it was too far away to be a bird or a floating cotton seed. My eyes focused more on the object and still could not make out an exact shape. I would say it might have been oblong. I don't want to describe it more than that because I just can't say for sure. My eyes are good with contacts in. I can see far with them. I kept tracking this object until it fades away. I know for sure my eyes were focused on this object. I can tell it gained in distance from the ground or my point on the earth. I knew this by watching it's visible light reflection dim by the volumetric blue atmosphere. That is what tells me how high this was. Volumetric atmosphere. Like judging distance in the fog. I am not saying what this was with any certainty. What I will say with absolute certain! ty, sani ty, focus and highly preceptive judgement is that this was moving fast and seemed to leave the atmosphere.  It's that simple. I was at work walking through the parking lot to go back inside. It was only about 2 minutes of observation. A co worker asked what I was looking at (after I was distracted by the loose dogs). I pointed but he could not spot it. It would have been hard to spot because of it's distance and color. For whatever it's worth I am sure it wasn't a balloon, bird, cotton seed, or anything ordinary like that. I am confident in my mind and perception. Weather ballon? Who knows, it always seems probable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",2008-07-05T00:00:00,64.84527636363637,-147.8347387878788

Tonight I was rinsing my mouth with water/salt for my mouth sores, and I looked out my kitchen window which was on top the sink I retrieved the water from.  At first glance, I saw a blinking light in non-stop motion.  I thought of it being a low-altitude plane, yet the light was too small (giving the appearance of a high-altitude one), plus at the given time, it was twilight, and I could not see the silhouette of the aircraft, which you would be able to normally.  After witnessing the flash, I thought of the object being a meteorite.  I looked back in curiosity, and I saw another quick streak of light shoot off in a different direction, near the point where the first light disappeared.  I aroused suspicion, and watched the sky longer.  The streak moved again, this time, heading westward, the opposite direction from which the first shot of light advanced.  And about a second later, another flash ensued, going in the direction making a complete box if the light were to move continuously, without an intermission.  Possibilities I assumed to which the lights could be were:  A helicopter Fireworks Or meteorites falling coincidentally to form four 90 degree angles.

And being an Air Force brat I always enjoy the ""light speed is faster than sound speed"" phenomena. So when I see a high aircraft I like to watch it before I hear the sound.  Although, this was different. I could hear something. It was familiar.  And as I was looking up to see if I had missed an aircraft passing over (because of the sound I was hearing), I saw the red light. I looked like it was heading in the direction (although very high) of where I was observing it. But each time it blinked it seemed to be getting much closer very quickly. Faster than even some of the military jets we see up here that do exercises.  Then, after about 3 or 4 blinks it veered 90 degrees to the east and went so fast that it literally appeared to be just a streak in the sky. It was nearly like a shooting star. I've seen plenty of shooting stars and satellites.  I sat still for about 10 minutes trying to digest what I had just seen. Came in, drew a picture.

F. Bay in high atmosphere, momentarily stationary On Sunday June 8, 2008 my friend and I had just gotten out of a local museum, and were lying in the grass in Union Square (downtown San Francisco) from about 4-5:15 pm soaking up some sun. As we were lying there chatting, I noticed what I first thought were balloons (or a balloon) directly up into the sky close to the position of the moon.  After watching it for about five minutes wondering what it was, I determined that it wasn’t moving around like balloons might on a windy day at high altitude (it’s been fairly windy in S.F. these past few weeks), and it was also too close to be a star or planet.   I finally pointed it out to my friend, and he also suggested it was a balloon.  As we continued chatting, the object slowly began to pick up slight velocity drifting towards the horizon (towards the south), away from the position of the moon.  After about 10 minutes of drifting, the object appeared to look like a hyphen (it looked like a ball before), and I pointed this out to my friend.  Eventually we lost track of the object, and kept on with our conversation.  A few minutes later, I again looked back up towards the moon, and the object (or another object) reappeared to the location where we saw the first object.  I again pointed it out to my friend, and we both thought it was odd that earlier it had slowly drifted towards the south, and was now instantly right back where it started.  We left shortly after, not thinking too much about the whole thing.  The reason why I am posting this is because this morning on the news there was a short segment on an object that was observed (by whom I don’t know) Sunday afternoon over San Francisco Bay, and the news clip featured a video of the same object that we had seen.  The segment didn’t say much about what the object was, just that the F.A.A. had taken notice.  I am assuming many people had seen it if it had been featured on the Monday morning news, and was described on the news to have moved from above one city to another.  From my own observations, I can describe the object as white (non-metallic), not emitting light, larger than the size of Jupiter or Venus in the night sky, and fairly circular (upon our first observation).  The object appeared stationary at first (the object did NOT get smaller as a balloon would upon rising), but later drifted across the sky (faster than planets and stars appear to move at night, but much slower than man-made satellites move).  The object did not appear to change change size as it moved away, but did appear to look more liner as it drifted away.  It was definitely not an airplane (it was close enough so that we could resolve its outlines and determine a circular shape from our perspective), and looked very solid.  The whole experience did not seem very normal, and I am greatly wondering how many other people saw it, and what it may have been.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

Bright stationary circular object in high atmosphere in broad daylight gives way to five smaller moving crescents,Albuquerque,NM,2008-06-08T19:30:00,other,approx 10 min,"Occurred : 6/8/2008 19:30  (Entered as : 060808 19:30) Reported: 6/8/2008 10:16:20 PM 22:16 Posted: 6/12/2008 Location: Albuquerque, NM Shape: Other Duration:approx 10 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63774.html,"Bright stationary circular object in high atmosphere in broad daylight gives way to five smaller moving crescents June 8, 2008. Approximately 7:30 PM -- While playing in the backyard with my children, my daughter called my attention to what she called the first star tonight -- she was excited because at this time of year it is still very light, with the sun well above the horizon -- essentially still daytime. I initially took it to be a star, located about 2 degrees NE of a crescent-shaped moon. The size seemed about right for a star, but I quickly realized that it was WAY too bright to be a star, as it was still daylight and no other stars were even faintly visible. I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look. It appeared to be a circular object in the high atmosphere, with a dark spot in the center -- exactly what one might expect from a weather balloon with something suspended below it, such as a basket with equipment. And the brightness of the object seemed consistent with a balloon reflecting the sun. What was strange was that the object maintained it's position relative to the moon for about five minutes, which is not the behavior one would expect of a high-altitude weather balloon that is subject to strong air currents. After a few minutes of observation, the object simply disappeared in a blink. For a good minute I thought it was gone, but with more scoping with binoculars I saw five smaller points of light in the same vicinity. These were too small to be seen with the naked eye, and they were barely visible with binoculars. The mind tries to make sense of things. I speculated that a weather balloon could have exploded into smaller pieces. This time, unlike the initial round ""star"" object, these smaller points were crescent-shaped, and they drifted SW until they moved past the moon, growing more faint as they traveled. It occurred to me that a spherical object in the sky would reflect sunlight in the same way the moon did and assume a crescent shape. This suggests the smaller objects were spherical. This does not explain, however, why the initial ""star"" appeared perfectly round. Forgive me for a flight of fancy, but a flat, round shaped object -- such as a pie tin -- situated at just the right angle would reflect light across it's entire surface and appear round to an observer. I can't come up with an obvious explanation for what I observed. What I saw was certainly not an airplane. Very unlikely it was an exploding weather balloon (how could the intact balloon remain stationary while it's exploded parts drifted in the wind?). Puzzling indeed. One final observation. Seems like an odd coincidence. While observing the crescents in binoculars, a Southwest airline flying at what appeared to be a MUCH lower altitude passed right in between two of the crescent shapes. What are the odds that a commercial airline passes through the tiny window of observation -- relative to the rest of the sky -- visible through one's binoculars at just the right moment under any circumstances? Quite a coincidence. The entire sequence took roughly 10 minutes. Crescents faded from view within 10 seconds of the airline passing through my field of vision. Again, Helluva coincidence. Nevertheless, I really don't think the airline was related to the objects. Airline was low altitude (either landing or taking off from local airport), and the objects were really high.

As I was hanging up the phone waiting for entry, I glanced up and noticed some very paculiar clouds that were looming of to the S.E. at approx. my 10/11 o'clock position.

I was looking in a northwest direction as I walked along Chalone Peak Trail.  I was about 3.3 miles away from the Bear Gulch Visitor Center when I stopped to see the moving ""star"".  I'm really skeptical about martians or people from other planets but this was very strange.   Then I observed what I never imagined I'd ever see.  Too strange and kind of eerie.  The way it moved was unlike anything that humans have made.  A ""star"" barely visible and twinkling just like a very distant star--moved sideways, stopped for a few seconds...slowly moved in another direction...stopped.  It seemed like a little bug with no particular direction or course.  It happened several times and it seemed to have a life of its own rather than a manned craft.   Then it moved suddenly downward at an incredible speed; kind of like a slow-moving shooting star but without a trail or sudden brightness.  It slowly went up a little and stopped.  It continued on a very slow-moving course.  I'm sure it continued to travel but I began walking and it was impossible to see if it was moving.   I've seen satellites in California and Canada smaller than stars move quickly in a north > south or east > west direction but this was somthing else.

I was on 150 East in Davidson County and just happened to be looking at the sky out of my driver's side window when an object seemed to streak out of the sky towards the trees an undetermined number of miles away... without falling from all that far up. And it didn't leave a residue trail like something that large would leave. It fell from (roughly) south to north at a steep angle maybe a couple of thousand feet, nowhere near tens of thousands, or from orbit. All this happened very fast and I would have discounted it as a meteor except that right before it disappeared from my sight into the trees or whatever it landed in, a really bright tinier flash of green emanated from it and it looked like it actually slowed down. I observed no impact sound, vibration, or light. After that I kept looking at the sky around my car. I noticed a few minuted later that heading from my north and east was a craft that could have been an airplane--it looked like it was up there a few thousand feet and it wasn't flying erratically or extremely fast. What caused me to pay attention to this craft, though, was that its ""headlight"" (white) was blinking in a signal pattern I've not seen airplanes use. As it flew above me I observed that the placement of the port and starboard lights as compared to airplanes I've seen was... well that thing either had really short wings or it was triangular in shape.

I stared up at it and saw one person sitting in the front through what looked like a window area.  I saw a large steering wheel like that of what we have in a car or truck.  The person had both hands of the steering wheel of the circular craft.  It was travelling slowly above but towards my direction.  It had lights all around the bottom of it.  At first I thought it was a round, man made, blimp with lights around it, but was not sure.  I kept looking up at it as I drove forward down the Wampanoag Trail.  As it continued to head towards my direction, I began to get scared and my heart started beating very fast and I was about to make a decision as to whether I should turn my car around and head in the opposite direction away from it.  I stopped my car for a moment and looked around and I was the only one on both sides of the highway.  As I was about to turn my car around, I looked up again and the person operating the blimp or whatever it was, looked over the steering wheel and down at me and I think he realized I was afraid, so I saw him look over the steering wheel down at me and he then turned the steering wheel in front of him and the round floating objection turned around and headed slowly in the opposite direction towards Seekonk, MA.  I thought this was probably a blimp or a manmade craft with lights around the bottom of it. If this flew at night, someone might just see the lights around the bottom of it and think it was a UFO.  It might have been, but I thought it was a man made blimp like round object with lights around the bottom of it.  I did not report it to the police because it turned around and headed out of site over Seekonk, MA and I thought it might have been a round blimp with lights around the bottom of it.  I know the difference because my cousin and I saw a real UFO around 1968 while driving on the highway in Portmouth, RI which I have already reported at this site.  That one was nothing of this world, it was a bright luminous tilted circulor object hovering over the water.  It moved sideways over the water and was to the right over our car.  I looked up at it from my car window. It was tilted, luminous, sauser shaped and had a haze like ring around it and it was just moved sideways over the water and stopped up in the air to the right above our car.  I looked to the right through the car windwo up at it and saw it in close proxsimity and it was disc shaped, tilted luminous with a hazy ring around it like the planet Saturn.  It did not look like it was made of anything of this world.  It then suddenly shot in an instant across the hemosphere to the other side of the sky over the water.  But I wanted to report this because there may be some man made blimps or flying objects also shaped round with lights around the bottom of them and I did see this about 3 or 4 months ago.

I looked up and over towards Cassiopeia and spotted a huge glowing orange object. My wife ran over to where I was standing and we watched it flare up and settle into a consistent magnitude. Comparing it to a couple of stars, the object did not appear to move for the first 4 minutes or so. I ran and grabbed my binoculars and upon closer review, the object seemed to be spherical and above a 30,000 foot ceiling. I am assuming this because I could see a slight hint of atmosphere distorting the light. The event lasted approx. 6 minutes. At the end, the light flickered and faded rapidly. It did not look as though it was moving away, but rather that it lost its illumination much like T.V. set turning off in slow motion.

Silver saucer/disk shaped object hovering in the sky completely motionless at about 6000 feet. This is the description of what I witnessed on Wednesday morning, January 17th, 2007 at approximately 10:30 am.   Let me give some background, I am married, 40 years old, 2 children, I am a general contractor, self employed in the construction trades and have worked in the northern Lake county, Illinois, area for the past 19 years.  Prior to the 17th, I remained skeptical on the whole UFO issue, since I had no direct experience to justify any existence of such phenomena one way or the other. I was driving to the jobsite about 10:30 in the morning, heading eastbound on route 120 in the Hainesville, Grayslake area I turned onto Alleghany road southbound about 45 mph. the stretch is perhaps three miles to Peterson road, about halfway I noticed something in the sky at about 45 to 50 degrees south-southwest of my position, it caught my eye I believe because it was not moving, just floating-hovering stationary my best guess at about 5000-7000 ft. . I drive a G20 Chevy van with a large windshield; it appeared about ½"" in size as I watched through the windshield. The object was saucer- disk shaped and very silver, the sky was clear and its definition crisp, no movement at all; it appeared as if someone held up a silver plate in the sky. I watched the object for about a minute or more until I reached Peterson road, when I turned east it left my field of vision. I have always had sort of a photographic memory and as the minutes progressed it started to hit me what that may have been, I then regretted I did not stop to observe it further as I never saw anything like it, motionless just sitting stationary, I think back and believe now I should have stopped and called the police because it was close enough to plainly see it was not any recognizable aircraft or a balloon, it was a silver saucer. I suppose I was in a state of denial at the time but it just keeps coming back to me and I can still see it. That night I remarked to my wife and kids that I saw a flying saucer on the way to work in a matter of fact way as if the reality of what I saw did not quite compute, it seemed ridiculous in a way, I tried to shrug it off.  In a strange way it has taken some time to process this, because silver saucers don’t just float in the sky. I told a couple of other people about it, one person mentioned that UFO’s were recently sighted over O’Hare airport, so after about 10 days of still picturing it just hovering in the sky I googled  ""“O’Hare UFO"" and came up with a photo someone took over the airport, and I thought to myself that that was what I saw, except more crispy defined and silver. Its been a few weeks now and I decided that I have to tell someone who could possibly make sense or use of this, I am trying to reconcile the fact that I really don’t believe in UFO’s with seeing this thing, this just won’t go away, silver saucers don’t just float in the sky and its starting to mess with my mind, I am a very rational logical person not given to superstition or the like so I pass this information on to try to lay it to rest. I do not know what good this will do but to possibly validate other like sightings in that area, in any case the above I affirm to be as accurate in fact as I can testify. If for any reason you need anything that I did not think of here feel free to e-mail back to this address.   Sincerely,  ((initials deleted))",2007-02-24T00:00:00,42.3316,-88.0545

Upon examination of other aircraft flying in the area I could see that this was much too high to be a light on top of any pole.  What was floating was about three times as high as any other aircraft in the sky was and about three times as bright as anything else in the sky also. I had my boyfriend look at the object.  He agreed that it was unlike anything else in the sky (and he wants to be a pilot so trust me he knows what should be in the sky).  It did not twinkle like stars nor did it move like a plane, and again because of its position in the sky and the area we live in we knew that there are absolutely no polls around that are that high in the sky. Upon us moving closer in the direction of the light it actually began to descend if you will.  While not moving forward or backwards it was dropping altitude.  Once it was just above tree level (below all other aircraft in the sky) it began moving forward (we were heading east on the highway so forward for the craft was southwest).  As it went over our truck (which had a sun roof so we were literally right under it!!!) we noticed what appeared to be a triangular shape with lights along the outer back points of the triangle (on the sides and bottom).  These lights on the wings (if we can call them that because they were attached to the body and not like airplane wings) flashed on both sides at the same time.  They were a band of lights that flashed simultaneously on both sides alternating red and the blue/green color from front to back. Also on the underside, located where a cabin might be for someone to fly the craft or the landing gear might be was three circular lights, like spot lights, that were giving off the glow.  There was absolutely no light coming from inside the craft.  These lights would have been in the way of any landing gear, so we could not understand how this craft could be a plane and land.  These lights were pointing down at the ground! Not in the direction the craft was going!! There was absolutely no directional light!! The lights were allowing the craft to see the ground perfectly but did not emit a beam glow down towards the ground but rather a glow around the object. Once the object did start to move and travel over our vehicle, it moved at a steady  pace, yet quick enough to remain uncatchable by our vehicle upon turning around. I am a 24 year old property tax consultant and my boyfriend is a 22 year old aspiring pilot.  In our free time we like to observe the stars and planets as well as go to the local airports to watch plane come and go all day.  We are not two people who would call just anything in the sky a UFO.  This was honestly a craft that almost appeared to be like a delta yet far superior to any delta ever seen by either one of us and that apparently had no landing gear due to the placement of the lights.",2008-04-17T00:00:00,41.0036,-72.5458

What i saw was a triangular shaped group of lights that stayed fixed in position but were coming more clearly into our field of vision (traveling south to northwest across vision). If these lights were at regular airplane flying level, the triangle object should have been at least 3 times bigger than a 747. At this time i was doubting what i was seeing because it was so unbelievable. It was not until the large object had passed bye us that i realized that there was absolutely no sound being emitted, and it in fact seemed quieter, as if all ambient noise was being hushed. The total time of this sighting was about 45 seconds. I would have to guess that the object was triangular and flat because when i saw it in the southern sky four lights were visible but as it passed by other lights came into view on the rear. The lights also would shift in brightness probably due to the angle which it was being viewed at. The object kept traveling until out of view.

I was getting on Toll way I-355 north, from west bound Route 6 in New Lenox. I noticed the strobes while on the ramp and watched them for the next several miles (minutes) as I headed north on I-355. The objects were northwest from the Toll way and about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon. The weather was dry but overcast, I have no idea what the ceiling was at the time. The three objects appeared to be identical in the fact that all three had the same varying intensity, and frequency of the strobe effect, but the objects were not in sync with each other. Since they were identical in brightness and appearance I assume they were of the same size and distance from me. There was also many strobes on each object with some slightly more intense than others, making each object look like a continuous varying strobe. There were no other lights, no red or green or landing lights, no steady lights of any kind, just very white intense strobes. I could not see any discernable shape of an object or objects, or tell how many strobes there were per object since the strobes on each object were very close to each other. My best description is each object was like a cluster of tightly packed, very intense strobe lights. The objects also appeared to interact with each other, meaning as one moved another would follow. This dance went on for a minute or two. Then while two of them were more or less stationary the third one headed away then quickly, amazingly quick, turned around and passed right between the other two and came to an abrupt stop shortly after passing them, making all three the same distance apart. Shortly after that maneuver the three objects got in a straight line with one another (north to south), were equidistant to each other, and appeared to be heading south (remember I’m heading north at 65+ MPH)  and then climbed away slowly at a 45 degree angle. At this point they were now due west of me. I never did see them enter the cloud deck or if they changed direction due to my vantage point while driving, and a strong desire to stay on the road. As they were climbing away the distance between them slowly increased but they were always equidistant to each other, as if in formation, and their appearance and strobe intensity although fading, remained constant between them. I am an aircraft technician and I am very familiar with various, not all, aircraft and helicopter lighting. I see airplanes almost everyday and night, going into and out of Chicago’s Midway and  O’Hare airports, and several smaller airports, as I travel over 100 miles roundtrip every day (or night) to and from work. I am very familiar with the traffic and holding patterns too. In fact I did see airplane traffic in their usual routes, north and east of my location (for the given wind direction at that time). These objects were not in that vicinity, they were alone. I am also aware that there was a Hotel fire in Lockport Illinois, to the south and west from were I witnessed these objects, and the local news teams did have their helicopters up covering it, but these objects were nowhere near that location. I have never seen helicopters with so many intense strobes. I have never seen helicopters or any other aircraft accelerate and decelerate in such a short distance(?) and time. And, I have never seen them “play” with each other for a lack of a better description, and depart in single file and climb at a 45 degree angle. I am not saying it couldn’t have been 3 identical aircraft or 3 identical helicopters playing cat and mouse in the predawn hours, all I’m saying is I have never witnessed anything like it in my 30 plus years in aviation.",2008-04-17T00:00:00,41.6,-87.9381

I stopped taking pictures around 20:10 because clouds were starting to move in. I never saw anything out of the ordinary while I was taking the pictures. After I downloaded the images I noticed a rainbow colored object in the lower left hand corner. Out of the 34 pictures I took it’s in almost every one. Even the shot where I made the mistake of using a flash. I’m sure it’s not a light refraction. There is clearly a saucer shaped object with a full spectrum of colored lights wrapped around it. You can clearly see that the colored light wraps around the object. You can see how the light glows out into space kind of like a flashlight beam. My only guess as to why I didn’t see it is that the light must pulse at a rate that makes the object invisible to the naked eye.

I was outdoors watching the lunar eclipse come to its climax.  After the moon was completely eclipsed, I took a few minutes to myself to think how beautiful a thing it really was.  I was taking pictures but failing in my attempts.  My digital camera kept stalling on me, shutting down and then restarting again.  It was a mere 9 degrees Fahrenheit outside and I had been outdoors for about 20 minutes.  I began to wonder if the cold was making the camera malfunction or if something more scientific as the eclipse was causing this mishap. I began to think to myself how I should start heading indoors (since the eclipse had occurred) but something compelled me to stay a bit longer and linger.  There I stood in my backyard suddenly looking about the sky and watching all the planes take flight.  It was a busy travel night I gathered since I had seen at least 7 aircrafts flying about the sky (I live roughly15 miles from a major airport).  I watched how graceful they appeared and then noticed the stars out (which is rare being so close to city lights, pollution etc.)  Soon there was nothing moving about for me to look at. All was quiet in the night sky.  I took one more glance to the eclipsed moon and looked down to the ground, being careful to not step on ice and fall.  Something caught my attention to look up one last time-straight up-.  It’s hard to describe what made me look and what even I really saw for it occurred very fast and was nothing I had ever seen before.  I saw this silhouette or shadow type blob appear out of the thin sky, grey in color, almost invisible. Around it was the brightest light I’ve ever seen.  If it wasn’t for this bright white light, I would not ever of made out the silhouette in the first place.  The light streaked across the sky, so quick and so straight I just froze and stared up trying to follow with my eyes where it could have gone.  The streak was thick (diameter but not length) and left no remnants….it simply vanished as quickly as it appeared.  I frantically searched the sky and started to walk around searching for where this light could have possibly gone. I could not explain it, I was dumbfounded.  There was no cloud in the sky for this light or object to disappear in to and the speed of this light was unreal!!  I was stunned as to what just happened.  My first reasoning was a falling star.  Witnessing many falling stars over the years I compared and contrasted the facts and visuals and knew in my heart there was no way that was a falling star.  The flight pattern of the light, the diameter of the light, the sheer brightness and speed was unexplainable.  Plus, the grayish image I saw split seconds to the light illuminating around and or hovering near it was also unexplainable. My second line of reasoning was a plane (since I had seen so many out).  I laughed at myself when my brain tried to suggest that one.  Planes do not hover, come out of nowhere and jet to nowhere.  I have yet to see a plane travel at the speed I saw this light move.  Plus, the fact how this all occurred in less then 4 seconds.  I’ve re enacted this event in my minds eye and when I do I get this sense of awe and estrangement.  My brain just can’t wrap around it.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,,

It was not emitting any light at first but a faint reflection of light pollution making its shape apparent. I was facing east; it passed by at about 20-30 degrees above the horizon moving from south to north. I noticed it first coming into sight from the right behind a few trees. It was in plane sight for approximately 90-120 degrees, for 5- 10 seconds.  For the last 3 seconds of my observation, it was emitting a neon-blue light. There was no apparent source of the light, meaning no visible bulb or bulbs, it looked like it was projected off of the surface or the surface itself was emitting the light in sporadic pulse. Only parts of it were making light, not the whole object, it was not in unison or uniform. It was like an imitation of lightening or the reaction to some form of stimulation, comparable to bio-lumination. It stopped making the blue light just before it fell out of sight behind more trees. It did not slow, stop, accelerate, or alter course for the duration of my observation.   I am within 5 miles of a municipal airport, and within 10 miles of a naval station, that holds near constant helicopter operations, this was not a helicopter, I have military training in identifying and reporting surface and air “contacts” and identifying standard light configurations, I am very familiar with the helicopters I used to observe in the military and watch fly over the house every day and all hours of the night.

All were perfectly aligned and distanced. Reviewing the enlarged image, the red spheres appear to have 2 red objects or lights attached.  The 2-white spheres bypassed the other spheres, taking the lead.  All spheres and flight paths were captured in the image.  Photo frames 2388 and 2390 did not contain the spheres which means they had to appear/disappear within 2 minutes.

Only one missile used -- 6 spheres shown.  One speculation it could be satellite remnants re-entering atmosphere but unlikely due to the exact alignment, precision of distance between objects, and mere number of objects.  Other possibility would be meteors but precisioning of objects and containing white as well as red spheres may rule that out.

As I watched it traveling north and as it approached a dark area of space (no stars readily visible without aid), the object reduced its luminicent value very rapidly as though as only seen here on earth, that someone turns off a household lightbulb and as you watch it, it fades until no light emminates from it. The  first object did not initiate any further display of light.  Continuing my scan of that area for another 15 or 20 seconds, I noticed another light approaching from the southeast, somewhat less in brightness than the first observance, but bright enough to be able to follow it with the naked eye.  As the second lighted object approached the nearly identical position of the first lighted object, where it had faded and then dissappeared from sight, the second object abruptly disappeared. No fading light like the first object, just instant darkness.  The observance of these two separate objects lasted for less than 1 minute.  As I observed the first light moving to the north, and fading as it did, my initial thought was that it was a satellite or similar object of man made origin. That was my thought until I observed the second lighted object. When both objects terminated their visible light at what I estimated was nearly the identical place in space, my estimation of what they could be now was unquestionably changed.  Were these extraterrestial in origin, or was one terrestial and the other extraterrestial?  Unknown at this time! A scan of some star charts will help identify the location in space where these two lighted objects intersected. That will be my next step and further reporting once clearly identified.

I would willingly testify under oath that the following information is true, correct and complete:  At approximately 3am CST, while driving Eastbound on Interstate 70, at approximately milepost 129 (within the jurisdiction of Trego County, Kansas), an object which I can best describe as two spheres about 20 feet or so in diameter, connected to each other by some type of rectangular device, dimensions unknown.  The object had no discernable color, and my high beam headlights seemed to partially become obsorbed by the craft and part of the white headlight field simply illuminated the object.  From my very brief encounter, all told about 6 seconds, I could also not visualize any portholes, antennas, doors or other openings or protrusions.  My bearing to the craft I am estimating to be 35 feet AGL (above ground level) and about 35 to 50 feet horizontally from my vehicle.  My angle of view out of the windshild was between 30 and 45 degrees upon initial visual contact and, of course, became markedly closer, as I estimate our closing speed to be around 175 mph...I was driving 75 mph and I believe the craft to be crusing at around 100 mph (this is a purely conjectural guess on my part).  Please note that the very first thing I did was to telephone the McConnell AFB Command Post (located in Wichita, KS), and inquire as to any Military air traffic of any kind in this area, such as Medivac flights, other Helos or fixed wing aircraft of any sort in the known military inventory.  The Airman I spoke to at the Command Post also volunteered that no Civilian Air Traffic was aloft at that time, at my location, either.  I also spoke with a Sgt.**** at the Trego County Kansas Sheriff's department, who checked the comm traffic logs from that time and found no other reports.  He WAS, however, very interested, and did not believe I was anything but honest, truthful and forthcoming.  My background is varied.  I worked for one year as a NASA contractor, on the CCMS program (Checkout, Control and Monitoring Subsystems) in the very early 80's, for the Space Shuttle Mobile Launch Pad, where we designed and tested cutting edge electronics for the Mobile Launch Pad...equipment which handled all data from the Orbiter and Astronauts, and sent that data to both Mission Control and to the Firing Room at the Cape.  I assisted in some elementary designs, and built, along with the other Techs in the lab, the initial prototypes of all the equipment for CCMS, and then, working with the design Engineer, debugged the equipment and finally produced wiring and assembly lists of instructions for the production department.  Note that a good deal of our Prototype Equipment went into use  without building other production models.  My last assignment was to completely revise the ""Approved Parts List"", actually consisting of two seperate released engineering documments...one containing all mechanical hardware (such as nuts, bolts, etc) and the other containing all electronic parts approved for use in the program.  These docs went to all NASA facilities working with CCMS/Orbiter projects, and finally to other contractors and subcontractors.  EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE Note that I have an Electronics background, first as an Electronics Technician,  and then later migrating to Field Service/Engineering for a large electronics firm, working in both the US and Canada. I am also an Amateur (Ham) radio operator and I am an Ordained Minister possessing a Doctor of Divinity Degree. I am also a ""backyard"" astronomy buff.  Finally, Whatever this object was, I have no clue, neither do the Air Force folks or the local law enforcement personnel I spoke with (from two Kansas Counties) before writing this report.  Respectfully Submitted.  All data in this report is true and correct to the best of my recollection. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at some length via telephone, and we were impressed with his sincerity and credibility as a witness.  PD))",2006-12-07T00:00:00,39.0098,-99.906

Even though i know this sighting means nothing due to lack of any photo or movie because in India movie cameras are not so common and i didnt had a mobile camera , still i wanted to report it because i think someone else might confirm it. As we were travelling on road in our car we observed 2 blinking lights which appeared far away but very much in height. They were blinking as two different lights one after the other making it look like two helicopters or planes moving together. But the time was 7:00 pm and it was dark as night so i realised there cant be some air show etc. After crossing baranala city and travelling almost 20 km from initial place of sighting. I could see those lights were not only one . So we pulled over near the village of sherpur and came out to see the lights clearly. The lights now were sufficiently apart. And suddenly i realised there was another 2 lights  placed somewhere between those two lights which blinked in a non orderly fashion. As we were watching two passing by persons also stopped to look at what we were pointing at. And also made me notice there was another red light which was further away from both almost in centre . And than another light started to blink which seemed to be on the opposite of the two. Making it look like a triangular shaped thing. I would like to stress as we could see it from far away it was very very high and it should have been no less than a 1km long plane. And when i observed that with moving from one place to another while watching these lights , i clearly saw that the part between these three rectangularly placed lights i couldnt see background stars!! So it was something solid like a plaine. And above all i couldnt believe why i did not stay there to watch it go . We saw for 15 minutes it was standing still. Than we kept on going on the road and from 20 kms i kept on looking behind till i could see them no more. I couldnt believe what i saw and i couldnt believe that how could i move from that place even when it was there. There is a army air divcision in that area and it was almost exactly over that. Still i dont claim to know why it was there. But as i saw it  ibelieve in it. And i will now on keep a camera but i doubt if i will ever get a chance to record it .The sighting lasted for almost 30 minutes. I am waiting for news paper tommorow lets see if we get any news on that i will scan that send you. Thanks! I am now convinced these things are not only in America but in India and perhaps every part of the world. It is so foolish to see that developed countries and its people believe less in them. And there is nothing that can describe or make u imagine. But once you do look in skies and one day find out you will know.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,,

My girlfriend and I were leaving her apartment to go to the store at 9:54 exact.  She lives in an area where there is not much light pollution. There is some from a near by gas station and some street lights and a liquor store and houses that would emit light.  I walked out first and she was still up stairs locking the door.  I’m an observant person and always look up at the sky to see what stars are out.  I waited at the steps for her to grab her things and lock the door.  We began to walk to her car and I was still looking up and was going to comment on how it would be a good night for telescopes. When I looked up, there were five disc shaped objects flying in a perfect diagonal line heading north east.  I was scared at first and extremely uneasy. The car wanst unlocked yet and she noticed me acting out of sorts and I remember saying, ""look, look, look up!!!""  I was frantic. I ran around the car and grabbed her head and pointed her eyes to the sky where they should have been, but there was nothing. They had disappeared. After the sighting I became tremendously nervous about what I have seen.  I have always wished to see a U.F.O. and now, I wished I haven’t. There were five of them in a perfect diagonal line flying north east. There was no sound and no lights. I believe they were pretty close in proximity to the ground.  They moved very gracefully in formation, they had to have been at least 20-25 feet apart from each other.  I know as well as anyone that balloons do not fly in such a tight pattern. The only way these objects were visible is due to the very low lights in the area; it seemed like five soft balls flying together.  I don’t know any other way to describe them.  I have called the local authorities to tell them about this sighting. I have always believed in U.F.O.s and now I wish I have never seen these tonight.  I am honestly scared and excited at the same time.  I dunno. I wish to get in contact with people that share the same. I am a smart person and I know that these objects were not of anything made by man.  I wish I have never saw them.  I would rather wonder than to know now.

I was 13 at the time and we lived in a rural setting in Cotton County, Oklahoma.  After supper I would be the one to wash dishes and look out the window.  Most nights I was entertained by watching the red lights in the sky.  I tried several times to get my mother to come in and look at them, but she simply didn’t find it as interesting as what was on TV.  She saw them but said it must be airplanes (Even though they didn’t move!).   I have asked her if she remembers this and she doesn’t.  It is very odd to me that everyone I have talked with doesn’t seem to remember seeing them. When we went to basketball games we would gather at the back of the bus and watch these lights follow us.  This went on for months and months. The lights were red and perfectly round. They didn’t glare but were bright.  It is hard to say how big they were, but when I saw one next to a window at a neighboring house they appeared to be about two feet across, maybe less.  They never moved--they would appear, disappear and reappear somewhere else.  The number varied. Most times there was only about five, but I counted about 15 one night.  They would appear up in the sky in perfect geometric formation. If there were four they would appear in a square, evenly spaced. If a fifth light joined them it would appear at ninety degrees. Sometimes they would have a couple of different groups. If one would disappear from one group it would appear with the other one. There was a vacant house about 1/8 mile up the road that had a security light. A light would disappear from the group and appear at different places around the vacant house. It was like something was checking it out.  I never saw one around our house. Often I would go to sleep in my bed by the window watching the lights.  I was totally amazed. What was more amazing was that nobody else thought it was worth noticing. They made no sound. Have you ever gotten any reports like this?  Surely I’m not just imagining this! I have a couple of other things to ask about as well if you are interested.  Like strange marks on the back of my hand, like a brand.

This was about 23:30 hours on August 12th, 1983.  The sky was fairly clear with a few light wispy clouds.  After about ten minutes my wife pointed to the northeast and said ""There's a meteor"". I looked in her direction and saw what appeared to be an airplane. I told her, ""No, that looks like a plane to me, because it has 3 lights.""  We watched the craft come slowly from the northeast to a point nearly due east from where we were standing in our yard. It had made no sound in its approach. Due to the darkness, it was hard to judge how high it was, but it was nowhere near the altitude that normal passenger planes would have been flying.  It appeared to be above the wispy clouds but no higher than a light plane or helicopter would fly.  The craft suddenly came to a complete stop in midair. There was still no sound. When it stopped a very bright light, similar to a searchlight, was turned on and aimed out from the craft. It was pointing to the west. We were both shocked and amazed at this. I told her I was going to get my camera, but before I could even take a step, the light shut off as suddenly as it had come on.  It was on for about 10-15 seconds.  Just as suddenly the craft headed due southeast at an extremely rapid speed. It was traveling much faster than when it first appeared. It just disappeared into the night.  The craft seemed to be triangular in shape with rounded edges, and had three lights. One was on each corner and the third was toward the front. It never made any sound such as a helicopter or other machine capable of stopping in midair. Yet it moved much too fast for a balloon or other gas propelled vehicle.  We told a very select few people of our experience at the time, but most just laughed it off so we dropped the subject.  But we had written down what we viewed: the time, the date, and a general description of the craft. When I found this website, we thought it appropriate to document what we witnessed.",2007-08-14T00:00:00,37.0667,-80.7917

In the summr of 1989 I had been on my new job for about a year.  I'm in to health food products, and a co-worker told me that there was one near my place of employment. She said that she believed it was a small store.  At 5:00 P.M., I left my job and started looking for the store. I figured that it would be nice to be able to purchase items like vitamins, etc. on my lunch hour. By the time you get off from work and travel to these little stores, they're closed.  I walked down the street slowly, looking on both sides of the avenue, trying to find the store.  Eventually, I came upon a small store that I figured had a good chance of being it.  The building above it was abrownstone that was boarded up.  I steped down the one or two steps and opened the door to the shop.  Almost as soon as I walked in, I had a feeling that this wasn't the best place.  There was a man there.  He was my height 5""6"", skinny, dark, but otherwise normal.  I have a very clear, loud voice, and because of my previous vocal instructions over time, somewhat loud.  I asked the man, whether he had whatever the herbal remedy was that I wanted.  He became very angry and said in a voice that was almost as loud as mine""you got some nerve coming in here with all that attitude.""  I immediately answered him with ""what the hell are you talking about atitude.  Without saying another word, He aimed his finger at my heart and something that I coiuldn't see hit me in the heart.  I have ben know for having a lot ot courage so me being me, I just stood there and stirred at him. Then he said, ""I could have just killed you."" I then realized that I was in more danger than I realized. I also knew what I had accidentally come upon.  There was a conversation that followed where I sought of asked where he was from, but he only said that it was a long way from here.There was great emphysis on long. Every time he moved around the store, you never saw him move to another location, he just appeared at that spot. Some how, I was asleep and while still standing, I felt my feet being kind of numb.  I had been standing in that same spot for a couple of hours. When I finally got up the nerve to say that I was leaving, he said"" we are leaving tomorrow to. That would have been Wednesday. I walked to the door, and as I looked around he said, ""when you get home tonight I want you to say xxxxxxx.  I didn't say it then and I won't say it now.  As far as I am concerned, that could have been some password the he could have used to take me aboard his space ship.  As I placed my hans on the door, his face blurred and changed to what he really looked like.  He was still my height, very dark, but his eyes were large but that skin around the eyes reminded me of a crocodile.  Ther was a thin yellow line running from one corner of the eye to the other. And he laughed out loud. He surely wasn't pretty. I really wanted to ask more questions, but thought better of it.  On Thursday, the day after he said they were leaving, I walked down to that store, near the curb.  I wanted to see if there was anybody there.  Would you believe, the place looked as though no one had ever been there.   It was empty.  I rode past on the bus ther other day, and the place had been undergoing renovations. It's now a nice looking brownstone with a store.  I'd like to know who rented it before.  The things that I saw him do, couldn't have been done by anyone other than an alien.  I'm now actually glad that I had the experience.  It told me what I suspected all along, that we are living with these people and cannot tell the difference. When I saw how he just changed his appearance within one or two seconds, I was surprized, to say the least.  This really happened in 1989.  I was sought of afraid to mention it because I didn't know whether or not I should.  Don't know who you're speaking to these days.

We were south of steamboat x number of miles.  Way up in the Rocky mountains of Colorado. The highway was deserted, no other cars in sight, very clear night, all of the stars were visible. Suddenly a big male deer, a buck with a huge rack, was slowly walking onto the road directly in the path we were traveling. I was in the passenger seat. The driver of the car put the breaks on and started steering into the other lane so we wouldn’t hit the deer. That scared me a lot but we barley missed it. Just a few seconds, maybe 5 seconds, later the entire area all around us lit up with blue colored flashes of light.  The flashes were very bright, lighting up everything, I remember the shadows that were casting from trees and rocks and stuff as very noticeable.  There was not a pattern in the timing of the flashes of the lights. The flashes were a few quick ones, a 1 second delay then another flash, then another delay something like 2 more flashes then another delay and then an abundance intense flashes and so on. It seemed to be coming from above car and to the left and high enough to light up everything in the area very well and way out in front of us 1000’s of yards and all directions (front left and right from where I sat).  I was yelling at my roommate, the driver to stop because I knew there was something awesome outside and really wanted to see it.

During those years i rode a mountain bicycle to and from work daily.A bicycle trail that day i rode on my way back home i saw some black figures in the sky .At first i thought they were large raven sorta black birds or something ,thought nothing of it about 1 /16 away .As i concentrated steering my way down the trail and around a corner of the trail one of the objects somehow focused its attention on me and moved closer in front of me , about 30 feet in front 25 feet in the air. I came to a complete /quick stop on my bike. Then i heard noise to my left ,There were two males doing clean up work (raking weeds ,trash,etc.)About 50 feet across large rain channel/ditch, behind  alot of industrial fenced areas.They looked at what was in front of me and they got extremely frightened .They must of been mexican nationals seasonal workers .They were saying prayers out loud tone making signs of the cross and throwing their tools /rakes /shovels into their truck ,to get out of there in a hury.As for me ,i stayed still kinda frightened but ,curious at the same time.I took my riding glasses off and the object came a few feet closer and stayed perfectly still.It was a pitch black color and no sound came from it .A shape of oval or as  a shape of a large eye ,kinda glossy -it became as it moved up and to the right part of the bike trail.The other 4 or 5 figures seemed to stayed away or as to wait for the one close to me  to rejoin them.After a few minutes ,it slowly went back into a formation with the others and then extremely disapeared fast.       This was amazing for me to see those objects ,on that day ,confusing  although.Because i couldnt figure out what they were . They didnt look like transport ships or saucers ,But maybe a port hole to examine ?Unknown is! what i still call it. But very intelligent is a word to describe that occurance.     After they disapeared i kept riding on the trail back home ,kinda trembling and nervous at what i just saw.When i got home my girlfriend asked me ""What Happened""? I couldnt talk for a minute still shooken up.I drank water then told her .After i told her she and i noyiced a scent on my clothes.She asked me was i working with fuel or around a generator motor.I told her no I wasnt working around any thing like that . A very strange scent ,almost like the scent around a railroad track where metal wheels travel at a high rate of speed like a burning metal smell.    Strange .   And to this day i never seen those 2 workers over there by the trail. But i might consider to advertise in a local paper to get in contact with them ,if there still here in albuquerque.But if i dont find them or they wouldnt want to talk,its ok .At least i know i wasnt halucinating ,they saw it too.And i want to see the objects again ,maybe to communicate .

He lived up in the country above my village in Sion Mills, Co. Tyrone so it was a really dark road with no street lights at all. We were walking along the road hand in hand talking and I was looking at the ground just to see where I was going when I saw what looked like two circles of light on the ground about a foot in front of us as if someone was standing over us pointing two torches at the ground. As soon as I saw this I squeezed my girl’s hand in fear and we both looked up to see what looked like two suns flying over our heads at a good speed. They were only in view for about three seconds but I still remember them to this day as they flew over our heads and over the hill at the top of the lane. I cant remember if they made any sound although I don’t think that they did and I’m not sure how high in the sky they were as I don’t know what size they were but they were about the size of two suns and that’s  the only way I can describe them. They were bright and orange in colour though not so bright that they lit up the countryside just bright enough for us to see them shining on the ground.

Appearance / Description of Object(s):  Black triangular objects with no markings, lights, reflections or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.).  Size of Object(s):  At arms length, the objects appeared to be less than 2 inches across. The actual size appeared close to that of a private or fighter jet. The objects appeared to be equilateral triangles with less than 100 feet per side.  Distance to Object(s) & Altitude :  Directly overhead. My guess would be around 7500 feet in altitude.  Description of Area / Surroundings :  West Los Angeles (urban) just west of the intersection of Pico & Sawtelle Blvds close to Santa Monica airport.  Full Description & Details :  In the summer of 2000, I was driving with my then girlfriend late one afternoon before sunset westbound on Pico Blvd. just west of Sawtelle Blvd.. While stopped at a traffic light, she pointed to something she saw in the sky which was almost directly over us. I had to lean forward to be able to see up through the windshield to observe 3 identical black triangular objects. I observed them for less than 30 seconds. The objects were motionless and we could not hear any noise from the objects. There were no markings, lights, reflections or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.), just a solid black object. The objects were in a loose triangle formation separated from each other by a distance of approximately 5 times their individual width. What struck me most was their stillness and almost silhouette-like appearance.  My impression is that the objects were the size of private jets or fighter planes. They were significantly higher in altitude that the normal Santa Monica airport traffic that occurs regularly in that area, enough so that a closed fist at arms length could have covered two of the objects (were they spaced tip to tip).  While observing them, I moved my head to change my viewing angle so as to verify that this was not caused by debris on the windshield or reflections. These were definitely airborne objects.  Once the traffic light changed to green, I resumed driving, but was unable to see the objects again since they were nearly directly overhead. Once we had driven a few blocks so that the objects should have been easier to view from a shallower angle, the sky was empty where they had been.  Given the shape of the craft, their hovering behavior and sudden apparent disappearance, I assume that these were solid objects under some sort of control, though not any type that I am familiar with nor aware of.  Witness Background:  At the time, I was working in the entertainment industry as an artist for an internet animation studio. I have a bachelor's degree in Fine Art and am currently self-employed as an illustrator.  Views on UFOs, before and after sighting:  I have a strong interest in UFOs, both before and after my sighting. I have read several books on the subject and seen several documentaries, as well as listened to the Coast to Coast, the Paracast and other paranormal-related radio programs. I have found that this interest and the knowledge I have acquired has made me more of a skeptical observer than I was before since I am more aware of the conventional sighting explanations.

The sky was sunny and clear.  I looked to my left and there was an object that appeared to be an airplane, but it was pointed downward at about 120 degree angle.  I was concerned because I did not know of an airstrip nearby and the angle looked too severe to be anything but landing.  As I watched, I noticed that it was not descending, but rather flying in a straight direction roughly parallel to me, maintaining a consistent distance from the tree line below it. At that point, my phone rang and I answered it.  After a minute or so I looked over to see where the object had gone and did not see it immediately.  As I scanned the area I saw a dark dot on the horizon and in the matter of a couple of seconds the ""dot"" grew into the object, as if it had been a great distance away and then shot back to my location.  It then began to travel parallel to me again at the same unusual angle.  At this time the object seemed to flutter and I was able to briefly see that it was disc shaped, no wings, with a smaller, raised, flat area on top.  I could not tell if this part was also disc shaped, but it definitely was not dome shaped.  Throughout the sighting It seemed like the object was slightly blurry despite the fact that the surrounding area was perfectly clear.  The color was dark and metallic looking. I continued to view it for about a minute until the terrain began to get a little hilly and I lost it behind the tree line.  At no time did I hear any noise.  The distance was difficult to guage, but the trees looked to be about .5 miles away.  It appeared to be about the size of a cessna aircraft.  There were no other aircraft spotted at the time.

I likened the purplish haze to that of a nebula – the colors, patterns and shape of the mist resembled photos of nebulae I have seen. Unfortunately, my mother was inside the house and I was the only one to witness the whole thing. I posted the story on a couple of UFO websites, hoping to find someone who had witnessed the event as well yet received no response. The entire event happened very quickly, but still after all this time, it still leaves me unsettled and baffled. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My mother observed the blinking object for approximately 10 minutes.  Suddenly, the object ascended straight up within 3-4 seconds.   Immediately, the object changed direction going directly west and downward toward her at a speed that would compute to be thousands of miles per second.  Within 2 seconds the object appeared in her yard  before her as she looked through her storm door.  This object filled the whole area in front of the door and in front of her entire sight.  She felt like she saw only part of the entire object at this time. My mother felt like she could reach out and touch it.  She saw motionless oars or blades - like looking pieces of machinery of the object which she assumed was the bottom of the object. One area  was green among the blades.  There was a circular red light to right 10-15 feet from the main part of object. The red light appeared to be 4-5 inches in diameter.  She stated that the intensity of the light of the object at the time of close observation was equivalent to looking into a well - lit store window at night or of television screen. My mother’s overall impression of her close view of the object was as if she were looking at the inside or bottom of an enormous machine.  Everything appeared to be constructed of shiny metal which was thick, heavy and extremely large. Within 2 seconds, the object disappeared w/out movement or sound. My father was sitting in the same room as my mother but was unable to observe because of his immobility due to medical issues.  He can confirm that my mother was awake and communicating this information to him. My mother and father are of sound mind and can produce witnesses of this from relatives, doctors, town librarians, neighbors, friends and others. She is very gifted and well read.  She also is known to be conservative of thought and in her communications with others.  We would be interested in talking with a contact person who also lives in Coventry, CT.

I would have thought that it was nothing more than a wisp of cloud except that it was moving extremely fast. I can not make a fair estimate, but its speed was orders of magnitude faster than a prop-plane. I witnessed a plane flying much closer to me (I was passing a small airport at the time) and the speed of that plane seemed almost nill compared to the UFO.

The weather was foggy with a fair amount of snow beginning to fall, accompanied by a moderate breeze.  I'd stopped at a stoplight, located near the old Colorado Springs airport.  To my left (east), about 50 or 60 feet above the ground, I saw 3 identical, white colored, down shining lights (appearing similar to those housed in recessed ""can"" lighting fixtures); they were very, VERY slowly, smoothly hover-gliding forward, together.  Two slender blue-colored bars of light were positioned behind, and perpendicular to the ""nose"" light, but within the boundaries of the triangular configuration formed by the larger 3 white lights.  There may have been a small red light located between and/or just behind the blue bar shaped lights.  Due to the time of night and poor weather conditions, I could not see the body of the craft... just the lights on its under belly.  At first, I thought the lights were reflections on my windshield, but I couldn't determine their source.  I looked at other drivers around me to see if they had noticed the lights but they appeared to be oblivious as the weather/visability was poor and the drivers were concentrating on the stoplight, waiting for it to change from red to green.  The thick fog and snowfall reflected the street and city lights to provide a sort of overall orange glow.  Thinking that the lights were reflections, I remained still, using the frame of my windshield to verfiy that the lights were indeed moving, and that they weren't reflections.  The lights continued to glide, VERY slowly, foward.  The 3 lights formed an elongated, triangle configuration; one round light in front (""leading"" the direction of movement), with 2 identical round lights behind.  The overall size was approximately the size of an USAF F4 or F15. Since all the lights moved with identical speed and direction at the same time, it seemed probable that they were attached to one body.  There was no noise and the craft's movement left the fog and snowflakes undisturbed.  After moving forward, the hovering craft paused, then VERY slowly, smoothly made a slight banking action to it's right, then slowly and smoothly, (without rotating)it drifted in an easterly direction, to disappear, uncerimoniously into the fog and snowfall.  The craft's hovering was steady and constant, without bounce, shake, waver, list, or yaw; it moved much smoother than a helicopter, seemingly unaffected by the poor weather conditions. It reminded me of a British Harrier, but, again, its movement was much, much slower, unwavering and smoother than that type of craft. The only movement that I can equate this craft's with are those displayed by some 3D computer generated and animated ""futuristic"" design aircraft... only this one was real.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

Specifics are that a US Navy prop refueler flew an approach overhead for possible landing at the NAS, Jacksonville, FL, less than 1 minute prior to this sighting. Also a commercial air carrier was heading approx. 005 T degrees, some 25,000+ ft. altitude, 15 seconds before this sighting. The elevation of the object was difficult to estimate however it was higher than the refueler and appeared lower than the commercial jet aircraft. I could hear the engines of both identifiable aircraft however the UFO was completely silent traveling 4 to 5 times faster than the commercial jet. It had 4 round amber lights arranged in a semi-circular pattern with a slight flickers, similar to a star flicker. The lights appeared at a point of about 45 degrees azimuth eastward (facing southeast) and stayed lit to about 45 degrees azimuth southwestward.

I pulled into a parking lot on the beach to observe them to see what they were or if they were moving. I sat in my car for around 45 minutes listening to music and keeping an eye on the lights. They did not move. I proceeded home and was able to see them from my home until daylight a few hours later.

I drove I-95 south from the Ormond Beach to I-4 that night, 5 miles down I-4 about 45 minutes from Orlando in the middle of nowhere I ran into road construction stopping all southbound traffic for 30 minutes or so, which gave me plenty of time on that perfectly clear cool night to observe what I quickly decided were double comets not dual rocket launches since they did not move quickly out of site as do rockets. One comet was larger than the other with the smaller one slightly lower; it’s head almost even with the tail of the larger comet.  The two comets that night tracked near the same latitude line as the crescent moon tracked just slightly lower in the sky, at least 3 hand widths behind the moon and sunward toward the Southeastern sky.  Both comets were very close to one another separated by a pencil thickness; both tails about ¾ to ½ the length and as bright as the moon until clouds from a cold front moved into the area as I neared Tampa covering both comets and moon around 6:30 am.

My family and I were driving from Queencreek AZ to our home in Mesa, AZ.  We were on the U.S. 60.   My wife was driving and I looked out in front of me at what I thought was a funny smoke shape about 30 miles plus away.  It had a ribbon like shape and was vertical  thus my thought it was smoke.  However it was in the middle of the horizon and maintained its shape for the entire duration of this experience.  I continued to watch this trying to figure out what it could be.  It seemed to appear and disappear over and over with a waving like motion.  I then saw these round like puffs that looked like something bursting in the air like when you see movies of flack but the ""smoke"" was white in color.  What really seemed strange was that this explosion then seemed to reverse in outward movement to inward and more condensed.  It was then that about 10 Miles away I saw something that looked at first like a hot air balloon going through fog.  It was at that moment that I thought, ""Wow"" there is fog really low going horizontal to the freeway.  Then it appeared again even closer and it the object came into view and looked more like the front end of a blimp, however it was huge.  I thought, wow that fog is alot closer to the ground than I thought and the blimp looked as if it was within 30 feet to the right of us.  It was then that I saw that my eyes seemed to adjust and realize that what I was thinking was a low fog was a very high cloud and around along ways away.  I yelled out loud, ""WHAT IS THAT?  I realized that whatever it was, it was the largest object I had ever seen.  I told my wife to look but she was driving and could not see what I was looking at.  It was at that time that we passed the 202 ramp and the 60 dipped.  I watched the object all the way until the wall next to the freeway covered my view.  My wife kept saying, ""should I pull over?""   I didn't know what to do.  I kept waiting and looking to where I thought it would emerge from the end of the cloud into open blue sky.  It had been! clear a ll day and we where out at our with our friends and so clouds were the last thing I expected.  I did not regain view of the clouds where the object was seen and I told my wife to exit the freeway.  She exited the freeway at power road as I looked into the sky looking back and forth scanning the whole area for a low flying hot air balloon a blimp or something else as the path seemed to be heading toward the opening sky.  We drove north on power until Broadway and never again saw this object.  It was then that I saw  a jet flying in the opposite direction as the object I saw and the jet was still pretty high flying the normal pattern toward PHX Sky Harbor airport.  I gasped when I realized the magnitude of what I had seen.  The object dwarfed the plane like a plane against an upside down mountain.  I continued to reflect back on what I had seen and can only say that it was only the front end blimp shaped in front and the smoke like ribbon was the same object passing through the clouds giving the solid object the smoky like appearance.  It was not a cloud behind another cloud. It was a definite Oval object and I would estimate it from just the nose and from how far away the clouds where that it was bigger than the size of the city of Phoenix.  I don't know what it was, or what it belonged to. I know that I saw something and I know that it was a solid object.  I have never seen anything that big except for a mountain.  It was not a mountain.  The object I saw was skimming through the clouds and because of its huge size it through my perception of the actual distance of the clouds way off.  The planes that flew in toward Sky Harbor were still very high above the ground and the clouds where still higher in the air then they were.  No low flying  clouds.  These clouds where pretty high.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

My husband and six-year old daughter and I were walking south along  the shoreline at Kure Beach, NC (from the pier) and noticed 4 bright orange spheres in a straight horizontal line in the sky out over the ocean...all in a perfectly straight line. North (NYC north, not stratosphere north) of the 4 spheres were three of the exact same objects also in a perfectly straight line, so that all 7 objects were in a straight line moving at the same speed. The objects appeared for about 15 seconds in the sky, moving towards the shore, then they all disappeared at the same time. Less than a minute later we saw the same objects appear over the ocean again. These lights were in the sky, not in the ocean (i.e., not a ship). The lights appeared about 5 minutes after my daughter saw a ""meteor"" over the ocean. I saw the same ""meteor"" enter the atmosphere. It was not a meteor. It was unlike anything I have ever seen... shooting stars, planes, military or otherwise.  It was too big and too close. It was something that swooped down into our atmosphere. I didn’t think much about it until I saw the perfectly round orange bright lights a couple of minutes later. These were not airplane lights...they didn’t twinkle. They were simply bright orange illuminated orbs that moved toward the shore in a supersonic glide. Fishermen and beachcombers along the shore also saw the same incident. We asked them, because my husband and I were so incredulous about what we had seen. Everyone we talked to about the incident reported the same sighting...bright orange lights in a straight line, 4 and 3 in two groups. The night sky visibility was excellent...full moon and clear skies. Our background: My husband has five degrees: MBA, masters, PhD, and others. He is from Minnesota. I am a writer with a B.A. in English from Virginia. We have been married for 10 years and have one six-year-old daughter (who witnessed this with us). We have never experienced something like this...and are somewhat embarrassed to be reporting it now!  But we cannot deny what we and so many others witnessed.

Its movement was almost like that of a glider, and it was traveling in a semi-linear path due north-east. The linear movement was characterized by a sort of zig-zag swaying from side to side.

After taking a second look, I couldn’t help but notice the uniqueness of this craft. It displayed lights of a shade of red that I have never seen before on any craft. Also, the initial shape of this craft appeared to be rectangular, and it flew perpendicular to the ground. The more I watched this object, the more curious I became. I picked up a pair of binoculars to get a closer look. I thought perhaps I could discern a clearer shape. However, viewing it through the glasses did not prove any better than viewing it with the naked eye. All I could make out was that it seemed to be a flying bay of lights. Fully engaged, I walked outside to continue following the path of this object and attempt to detect any sort of noise. At this point, the craft quietly morphed into a spherical shape. When it appeared to stop its forward progression, I called to my wife to have a look. Begrudgingly, she came outside, but within minutes, she too was enthralled with this craft.

While my son searched for the cat, I happened to look up to the sky as it was a clear night and the stars were out.  I noticed two red and blue “Stars” twinkling rather fast and they seemed to be moving.   I went inside to get the binoculars for a closer look, and as I focused on the “Stars”, they appeared to be red/blue circle-shaped objects that were moving southwest.    I would have passed these off as stars had these objects moved together in the earths natural rotation; however these two red/blue twinkling objects seemed to be moving towards a third object farther in the distance and got considerably closer during the 45-50 minutes we watched this.  I compared these particular objects to the other stars in the sky, even the bright yellow planet Venus, and there were no other similar objects like the three we were watching.   We watched this phenomenon for about an hour and the two objects were moving at a good pace towards the third object which moved at a slower pace in the same southwest direction.   Ultimately, it appeared that the two larger objects were trying to reach the more distant third object of the same description.

I do not think I would have been able to see it if the trees hadn’t broken up the shape of the object. It was like nothing I’ve ever seen before. In the movie Predator the predator creature uses some kind of stealth/cloaking technology to remain unseen, and this was very similar in the manner that it was very difficult to visually make out. I know it was not a plane because it was far to large for that, and there were very dim yet distinct lights that were just as difficult to make out on what appeared to be the outside edges of the object. The object was about the size of two football fields in width and one in length, and was shaped like a triangle. The object was rather difficult to discern, it was as though it was and was not there. The lights gave it a shape, but no distinct characteristics were evident. Because of the way it moved with the trees in my field of view in front of the object I was able to pinpoint its location and trajectory, after it passed over the trees I got a more distinct view in open clear sky. 	 At first I thought it was a hallucination or something but when it reached the clear sky I got a good look at it and I knew it was there. Our planes move through the sky and against the pressure of the gases that make up our atmosphere, as a result  you can see some difficulty in how slow they move even though you know they are moving really freaking fast. This object appeared to move effortlessly, and smoothly-like there was no resistance- and I called out to my spouse- What the hell is that- and started running toward the street to get a better look at it due to it’s movement it was going toward a blind spot to- my at that time current position. My spouse did not have an opportunity to see what I was describing because as I ran toward it, it disappeared from my field of vision- strangely enough before it entered the area that would have been the blind-spot in my field of vision.

I am well traveled and have seen lots of oddities in my lifetime. The event I witnessed last Saturday morning was disturbing. An employee and I were standing in the parking lot of my business chatting. It was a bright sunny day with spotty high clouds and a very light breeze. I noticed a large number of small clouds suddenly form in the sky to the north just below the upper cloud level.Curiously, these small clouds started traveling downward in an arc. Other small clouds appeared behind the first, and more behind those, forming a steady stream of clouds. Three larger clouds appeared. These cloud objects traveled across the sky in a straight line formation to a point overhead and remained stationary during the entire event. The steady stream of smaller cloud-like objects continued their downward arc at a slowing rate of speed. As they neared our position, the mist surrounding these objects began to disappear, revealing shimmering egg-shaped objects. The skin of these objects were a bit translucient. As the objects lowered in altitude further, this skin became completely transparent. The objects reached treetop level just over our heads, traveling at a quick rate of speed, approximately 50 mph. Hundreds of them passed overhead. The outer skin of these objects appeared to be a membrane of sorts. Inside this membrane, another object appeared. The inner object was a segmented globe, much like a soccer ball. The outer skin of this object seemed reflective--reflective not of the sunlight but of the sky around it. Struts or wires or something protruded from the bottom of the globe to a pointed horseshoe shaped thing with bright silver flashing lights on the underside. These lights flashed in series from the rear of the object to the front. After passing over our heads, these objects headed skyward.

On the evening of 6/24/06 and 6/25/06 at 2354(E.S.T.) both evenings, my girlfriend and I were both witnesses to an UFO event.  Earlier in the afternoon on 6/24/06, we were cleaning out my closet and found my night-vision moncular and decided it would be fun to look at the stars through the monocular later in the evening.  At 2354 that evening(6/24/06), we turned off the lights in my single-story condominium and proceeded outside on my patio, which does not have a screen.  I turned on the night-vision monocular and looked upward directly above my head (12 o'clock high position)and was looking at a brighter star and then proceeded to focus the monocular.  Once in focus to my amazement, I noticed movement of a dimly glowing circular object in the reticle.  The object gave off a glow as well in the night-vision monocular and I advised my girlfriend, ""Honey, I think there is a satellite orbiting across the sky here!""  I showed her the object that was moving in a west to east straight trejectory across the sky at a phenomenal rate of speed, no turns or deceleration or acceleration were noted, therefore assuming this object was a satellite.  We then proceeded into the house and got online with the NASA website to see if their were any satellites that could be seen in our area but the NASA website indicated there were no satellites visible for our viewing area.  I then assumed the object was more than likely a classified satellite.  To quell my curiousity, we both went out on our patio the next evening (6/25/06) and began to scan the sky in the same area with the night-vision monocular intentionally at approxiamately the same time as the evening before in anticipation of the same orbiting satellite.  We were on the patio, and I told my girlfriend jokingly, ""I wonder if we will get lucky and see my satellite again?""  At 2354, myself looking through the night-vision and my girlfriend looking with her naked eye, she shouts,""Honey, what is that?""  At precisely the same moment, the object that she described as being spherical and red in color, came into the reticle of the night-vision monocular that I was using giving off a dim glow.  My description would be the same as the night before, the object was round in shape but I could not determine any color due to looking through the night-vision monocular.  We both tracked the object for approxiamately 3-5 seconds, which once again appeared almost in the same exact area in the sky as the night before.  Once again, the object was traveling in a west to east trajectory but was moving at a higher rate of speed than the night before, as well as performing two sudden sharp turns, one hard turn right then a second abrupt turn to the left and then disappearing behind a cloud lower on the horizon.  The object had no trailing tail similar to that of a shooting star or made any noise whatsoever.  The sudden dynamic turns the object made was incredible, and being a veteran of the U.S. military, I was convinced this was no conventional aircraft.  In conclusion, my girfriend and I are both left with no explanation of what this object could possibly be.  I assumed from the night before, in my mind, this was an orbiting satellite, now we have no clue to what this was and why has it appeared twice at night consecutively, and furthermore, why has it appeared almost at the same exact time???",2006-07-16T00:00:00,,

I did and shortly after steeping out on the back patio I saw a white round shaped object traveling from the North East to the South West almost straight overhead - maybe 15 degrees off of vertical. The night sky was clear with a few scattered wispy clouds and stars were clearly visible.  The object appeared to be a satellite, but I thought it as a little large to be a satelling and though it might be the space station. It was traveling fast but was very high up so it took a while to move accross the sky. I first noticed it when it was approximately 45 degrees up from the horizon.  I and watched it travel along a straight line until it was approximately 30 degrees from the horizon.  The thought that it could be a UFO came into my mind and I thought ""Well, if you are something not of this world then show me a maneuver so I know for sure.""  I really wasn't expecting it to do anything as I was still sure it was a man-made craft.  At that point I was just about to turn around and go back into the house when it started wavering, then stopped dead and immediately (one second) went back the same direction it came from. I remember thinking ""satellites don't do that."" The object traveled a short distance then stopped. Two smaller objects came out of it and moved downwards, one to the right and one to the left in an upside down V pattern.  I kept my eyes on the larger object and watched as it faded out as if moving away from the earth out into space. It was too far away to tell exactly what it was doing.  I did not find the other objects in the sky after that and don't know where they went. The time on the clock when I returned was 4:05.  I locked the patio door and pulled the drapes but was a little ancy about going to sleep after that.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,39.100835139760406,-94.56447929264118

I (age 59) and my adult daughter and her boyfriend witnessed the same 1 mile long UFO, on January 9, 2008. It was about 6.30 pm, and the sky was already dark. I noticed a few aircraft in the sky, and then 2 cluster of lights, one cluster far behind the first one, but in identical path and following at identical speed. Then I realized that, even though the lights were far away, that it was one very large object, since it took up nearly one third of the sky. It wasn't going very fast, maybe 50 miles per hr. yet, at that height, while maybe only 1000 ft. up, it may have been going faster. It took about 5 minutes to go from the SE to the NW, and that was the precise direction.  2. The curious thing is that while I didn't see any aircraft around it, there was maybe 9 or 10 aircraft in the sky, about 10 minutes later (I had went inside for about that long). These aircraft were going in various directions, as if searching for the object (as if they could miss it -lol). Then the following day, there was nearly as many jets in the sky, -all producing contrails- and all day long. This was near Okmulgee, Oklahoma.  3. I didn't consider reporting this until I saw the news article at the ""coast the coast"" website, in reference to the West Texas sightings. I had hoped that more Oklahomans would have reported this. I had saw two ufos many years ago, around 1983, at nite, about 30 miles west of Okmulgee. These were similiar to other reported objects, which traveled and then stop at the same time, and then shot off in opposite directions, going extremely fast, leaving long smoke trails. I was a total non-believer until I saw these objects. I haven't actively sought seeing such objects, and didn't think I would see another ufo, especially one that was at least 1 mile long. And curiously, though I was in awe of the object, I did not have any fear (though I cannot say the same for my daughter's boyfriend). I had hear about a very large object being seen by others, while listening to ""coast to coast."" As well as the TV report of the large object in Phoenix several years ago. (I had wanted to see such an object, but very much doubted that I would. So this was a major surprise, as well as a wish fulfilled. And while I realize that psychologically, some would say that I subconsiously sought such, the fact that many others in Texas also saw the object confirms that this was not psychologically based. As well as my daughter and her boyfriend seeing such.)  4. And though I have told some people about these 2 incidents, I haven't had any experiences that have been disturbing. I do not seek to investigate such phenomena. I prefer to think of the ufos as being explainable, viz. part of the earth, or some advanced technology by human geniuses, or natural esoteric realities, such as angels and ghosts. Some relatives have seen the ufos that dance in the nite sky (while vacationing in northern Arizona), though possibly these may be remote controlled objects, or some intelligent phasma. They had not seen any unusual objects until recent years. To be sure, I have been a non-drinker all my life, and have never been ""on drugs."" Nor have those relatives done so. Curiously, I would say that only 1 out of every 5 people are willing to talk about such, even after 5 persons have seen such objects, at the same time.  Again, I hope there are more reports of this particular object, and detailed descriptions ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

She called me over to see this and it did appear to us to be a meteor shower although neither of us had ever seen one before.  When I got to the backdoor to look out, we noticed an object to the south that was much more out of the ordinary. The first thing that caught my eye was how bright the object was.  This object had to be pretty far away, but it was clear to us that it was not a star or meteor.  We soon also ruled out the object being an airplane or helicopter.  This object was hovering in a small circular pattern.  Then the object would shoot to the east and circle around again.  The object would remain in a small area (small from the distance we were seeing it from), but it would hover and shoot to the east, hover and shoot west and so on.  The object moved very fast.  It was very strange.  Neither of us had ever seen anything like it.  The object blinked with lights and when it moved they seemed to disappear briefly and then re-appear. The distance the object moved in such short periods of time was unbelievable.  This went on for about five minutes.  I called my mother who lives about 7 miles away to see if she could see it.  By the time I got her on the phone, the object started flying directly east in a normal straight pattern.  It took off continuing east, but very fast.  Faster than any plane I have ever saw fly.  The erratic patterns the object made and the speed of it lead us to believe it was definitely a UFO.  It sent chills down my spine and my wife was in tears.

It was very low to the ground and we saw reddish white lights that blinked very slowly. This is when we saw the outline of the object it was long but thin it appeared to have a point at the tip with the brightest light on it. it flared out to either side with much smaller red lights. It had three lights (one on each side and one on the tip) and was kind of smooth looking. It gave off no noise if it was a helicopter or a plane we would have been able to hear the sound of the engines because it was so low to the ground.  We began to get very nervous and started walking very quickly trying not to trip and fall. We walked for approximately 15-20 seconds when we looked over our shoulder at it. It had moved a good ways away and we felt like we had to watch it, like something made us want to see it. We watched it go into some clouds that had just formed as it moved away from us. it had been a relatively clear day with low amounts of clouds and those clouds were very thin. It appeared to hover and it was gone. It didn’t fade away as if it was flying away it just disappeared.  No dogs barked the whole way back to my friends hous house, we took a short cut through some peoples yards and most of them have dogs either inside or outside and not one even batted an eyelash at us. When we arrived at his house his dogs didn’t even look up at us. His dogs always bark and try to attack us if anybody walks in his house even if they know who it is. Immediately when we arrived at his house we wrote down everything and drew numerous pictures of the object.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,40.05,-86.4739

The flashing light was white and very bright it was moving at the speed of my car just below the treetops. It was about 100 feet from my car and the highway. The flashing light stayed at the same speed as my car. I slowed down to 50MPH and the light slowed down, I sped up to 60MPH and the light stayed even with my car.

I could see the light on the pavement outside my driver's side window flashing. That occured for about two blocks until I had to turn east on Highway 59.

This is my second reporting within a couple of weeks.  This sighting seems more convincing than last posting in that the sparkling object has multiple lights, including a blinking series of lights at bottom and left hand side, almost like flashlight strength from helicopter.  The object's location in sky is right at sea/sky's horizon due east of Satellite Beach, lower and nearer than past reporting.  The movement of the object is small darts or pendulum like swings to left, right and up.  The object is not on the same movement/trajectory up into the sky as was last reported of possible Venus/Mars location.  This object has not ascended but has rather remained in a hovering position at same eye level as a cruise ship that would be on the horizon leaving Port Canaveral.  This is clearly not a cruiseliner, but appears to be circular or some sort of patroling device due to the light projectory twinkling like a star and like it is looking intently for something over the ocean.  It is nearer to the surface and to the shoreline than last reporting.  The movement is more pronounced as hovering or observing than ""ascending into the sky"" with Earth's rotation...it is now 31 minutes into my observation and the object is clearly some sort of craft due to the smaller light on bottom left, and movement resembling that of a darting insect, not a star or planet.

The object was a saucer shape with 4 rounded pods protruding from the sides.  It was white, possibly light grey in color.  Under each pod there were alternating dull red/blue lights under each pod.  The craft was approximately 200 feet above the ground, no sound just gliding.  When it came directly over me, there was sort of an emptiness to the environment sort of a black hole if you will.  It hovered over me for a few seconds then came a sound of the engine revving up.  The space craft then picked up speed, travelled approximately 2 miles then disappeared into the air.  After this incident, I looked up the hill where I was and saw a dark figure with a bright blue light that did not reflect light as a traditional flashlight would walking towards me.  My Labrador Retriever kept looking in the direction of this image and wanted to go towards it.  I ran towards my home all the while pulling the dog.  When I came into the house, the dog ran up the stairs and looked out the window and began to bark incessantly with his hair standing on end.  I no longer saw the image.

I watched it sporadically for about a minute when I realized that it was moving slowly west to east and did not display any of the normal commercial aircraft warning lights.  As we live very close to Baltimore-Washington International Airport we are very familiar with the characteristics of normal commercial aircraft, both during the day and at night.  At that time the light was about two times as bright as Sirus is at it's brightest.  I grabbed a pair of 10X binoculars and watched it for about two minutes.  It passed almost directly over my house.  During that time the brightness intensified to about three or four times that of Sirus.  I could see none of the normal aircraft warning lights; there were no wing-tip red/green lights and no strobe lights.  The light displayed by the craft was entirely too bright to be the normal aircraft landing lights we are used to seeing at night.  I ran inside, called my wife to follow me, and went out the front door.  We both watched it for another minute or two before it went out of sight behind some trees.  It passed less than a mile south of BWI Airport at about 19:11. The brightness of the light intensified as it approached my house and lessened as it moved away.  However, the light was a constant white color, very comparable to the color of Sirus, but without the splashes of color that I often see in Sirus.  The intensity of the light was the only variable I noticed. As close as I can estimate, the light approached from a bearing of about 250 degrees (true) and departed on a bearing of about 70 degrees (true).  I would further estimate that the light would have passed almost directly over the intersection of routes 100 and 170 at about 19:10.  I could not discern any craft or shape against the sky.  The weather was clear and visiblity was excellent.  The stars were easily seen; there was no moon.

I saw a distinct green circular shape moving at an extremely high speed from the Northeast to a Southwest direction.  It appeared the object was descending, but this could have been an illusion.  It appeared it was low, approx. 500-1000 ft.  (If I held a ruler up in front of my eyes the object would have measured about 1/4"" in diameter). There was no sound, like a military jet travelling at high speed might make.  I could not be sure if what I was seeing was propulsion from a craft or not.  It was dark and I could not see any shape other than the large green circle. I would estimate it traveled at least 4 miles in about 3 seconds as I had a view of the whole Reno valley.

Attends ((deleted)) At 2230 hrs this date, I (deleted))) went to the front of my yard to walk towards a neighbor with the intent of checking on their dog since they were away on vacation.  Our house lies in the Foothills (North Central) area of Tucson adjacent the Catalina Mountains.   I heard one of my dogs bark and I turned to look back at the house. Directly above the house I observed the object.  The object was flying South to North.  I would estimate that it was directly above I-10 (I-10 runs north and south) I-10 is approx. 7 miles due West of my House.  It was approx. 25 degrees above the horizon. I would estimate, and its only an estimate that from light to light would make the object at least one mile long.  My first thought was that the object(s) were in fact 3 objects strung out together and flying in formation. I assumed they were helicopters flying North. There is a Marine aviation base due north of us. Holding my hand at arms length in front of me, I would estimate object would have been (from running light to running light) 4-5 fingers in length.   The object at its southern point had one non-flashing light, in its approx center was another non flashing red light, at its northern point were two lights, one which was white and non blinking and another light very close to the white light and it was red in color and blinking.  My wife exited the front door and I yelled at her to grab the binoculars and run out with them. This she complied with, retireved the binoculars and she and ((name deleted)) came out to join me.  I brought the binoculars into focus and could see the object, which appeared to be moving fairly slow and continuing North. I could also ascertain that there was a darkened area between the 4 lights and that in fact these were not 3 seperate objects. This horizontal area or structure did not appear to be very high but was flattened and ""line"" like.       I handed off the binoculars to both ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)).   We continued to watch the object as it continued North.   Approx 3 minutes into the observation the object appeared to make a flight adjustment and it began turning into a North-West flight angle.  At this point and through the Binoculars I could now see the rear end of the object. You could now see that it possessed 2 white lights in the rear of the structure.  It looked as though you were watching the rear end of a car that had two white running lights.  The distance between the two rear light would be approx 1 finger held up at arms length.  The 3 other lights (red in the center, white and blinking red up from) were also still visible but at more of an angle.  The front flashing red light was still visible.  At all times the lights remained at a fixed distance from each other, the distance never varied as it would if you were watching a string of conventional aircraft stuggling to maintain position relative to each other.   I was able to observe the object from its new flight path for approx another minute to two minutes until it was lost over the horizon.  The object appears to have corrected its flight path from when first viewed to the point that it turned NorthWest as I believe I-10 makes the same course adjustments.  I believe the object was certainly following and flying directly above I-10, turning as I-10 turned, but Im not completely sure of this.   I could not estimate its speed, but it was not flying very quickly, but I would guess that if these were in fact helicopters, it would appear to be about the same speed as a helicopter at that distance.  There was no sound.  We contacted a nearby neighbor (too late for him to see it), but as we talked in the driveway he related to me that during a ball game this evening, the crowds were witnessing many strange lights in the night skies.......he didnt elaborate.

The view extends clearly down the valley to the Lumberton Moyie area. I had turn the TV off, leaving the room in darkness before hauling myself off to bed.  I looked out the window and saw a bright 'star'. ""I'd wish on you but you're probably just a satalite or an airplane"" I thought to myself, since there is an airport between Kimbeley and Cranbrook. The light was very bright and so I watched it for a moment. Before long I noticed some faint spark-like spray coming from the bottom of the light, like the way a boat cuts through water in a triange behind a boat. Slightly alarmed, I thought I might be witnessing a plane in trouble.  The light didn't behave like a plane, it just hovered, then moved in a slight circular formation. I almost felt like it was looking back at me! My heart pounding, I moved behind the window frame out of view. When I looked back I estimated the distance between the light and the top of my neighbour's house to confirm that it was really moving strangely. It had moved from the origional place I had seen it, but was still emitting the faint spark flare underneath. I watched for some time, barely blinking continuing to estimate it's distance from unmoving objects, a telephone pole, another house, to confirm again that I wasn't just moving myself, the light's movement was so small. Finally my heart calmed, and I thought ""I hope that you're not like us, at least not the worst of us,"" thinking about war etc. Then, and I know that this is the craziest part, I thought ""thank you. thank you for showing yourself to me.""

It was without any sort of lights or noises... and was moving about the same speed as a glider would, but with more control - up and down, and around in tight circles, then in a straight line... it seemed to deliberately move to observe us remarking over it, as it circled above us for about 10 seconds, and moved away, then back again... long enough for me to grab my video camera and attempt to get some footage (just has black sky, and voices of witnesses freaking out)  It circled around for about 20 more seconds, just low enough for the city lights to illuminate it to our vision, but high enough to be within the low overcast clouds... Then, quite quickly, rather than get progressively lower as a hang glider must, it moved away, rising up and to the west from us into the darkness...

This event happened on the East End of Long Island New York, in the Village of Port Jefferson on 07/04/08.  I was with two other friends and we were just talking, while watching cars and motorcycles drive by.  It’s a popular hangout spot in town.  First sighting at 10:15 pm, two bright orange balls of light are flying in close formation maybe around 3-5 thousand feet heading from the South.  A few people at this point noticed and we all thought it could have been helicopters flying over. Though, I thought it was rather strange for a helicopter to glow bright orange in color.  The crafts hovered over for a short period of time, then flew a little farther and in the blink of an eye disappeared straight up into the sky.  A gentleman stood by saying “those were definitely not helicopters.  Next sighting at approximately 10:35 pm, this time three bright orange balls of light are flying in close formation from the South.  They started to hover at about the same height as the first sighting.  No doubt watching what was going on below.  These crafts moved up and down in a very speedy fashion, the light would fade as they moved up and would glow brighter as they came down.  These were very fast moving objects.  Next, a plane was flying in from the West toward the crafts and at this point at least 50-60 people were pointing up at the sky wondering what in the world the objects were.  Moments later at the same time, all three crafts dimmed their lights completely (no light at all).  But this time, the objects didn’t disappear into the sky.  As they flew by, you could tell without a question of a doubt what the objects were once the glow was gone.  They were light gray in color round disks (sphere like), not small from what I could tell (maybe around half the size of a football field).  At this point they were moving at a relatively fast cruising speed; one craft flew up ahead while the other two trailed close together but all three in formation.  If it matters, they flew over the water and if they continued to fly straight would have ended up somewhere in or near CT.  Without a doubt, the single most surreal experience I’ve ever had (my friends included). These were not planes, helicopters, blimps, weather balloons, fireworks, or any other known object that I could think of.  My one friend took some camera phone photos, but they’re worthless.

I didn't pay much attention to it at first and just thought to myself that it was a big star.   When I looked at it a few seconds later I noticed that it was actually two lights signifigantly larger than the other stars and also that it seemed to be moving slowly, horizontally across the sky.   So then I thought it might be a plane.   I kept my eye on it and observed that it seemed to be moving slowly then pausing then moving again.  I thought it was wierd but still maybe a plane.   I was eager to arrive at work and park so I could get a good look at it.  I tried to keep my eye on it while I was driving and arrived at work about 45 seconds later.   When I got out of my car and looked up at the object(s) the two lights seemed to shift into a vertical position like stacked on top of each other and then I noticed a red blinking light between the two lights.   Then it started to move vertically straight down towards the ground.  I observed it for about thirty seconds while it slowly descended towards the ground and finally fell out of view behind a building.

It looked slightly smaller than a dime from our view.  We watched this bright light, first it looked like it was hovering, but then it was slowly moving.  Real slow. The light was shimmering, not blinking, but like it would dim then grow brighter, dim again, etc. We watched for abt. 1 min and it just disappeared.  Like a light switch, it was on and then it was off and there was nothing there.   We saw it again about 2-3 minutes later, except by the second sighting it had moved it's position in the sky to where it was directly ahead of us.  We watched for about a minute, and again, like a light switch, it just vanished.  It was totally light out at this point now and there was not a cloud in the sky.  We found it a third time in the sky, and we could tell it was moving slowly again. We followed it with our eyes, and within a minute, the bright light went totally out again, but this time instead of being nothing there, as soon as the bight light went out, we saw some kind of object (resembled a rocket) with three blinking lights running parallel  underneath it ( two white, one red).  It had two small...wings, for lack of a better word, positioned midway on the object.  It looked black or a dark color.  The three lights were not the same bright light that we had originally saw when we first spotted it in the sky.  These were different lights, much smaller. This object just disapeared in the sky, just like it had the first two times we saw it.  No trail, tail, no haze, no nothing.  There one minute and gone the next.

After having a long nap from 7:00 until 10:30 p.m., I got up and stayed awake, while my husband and daughter went to bed.  I was searching the Internet for maps to locate McNaught comet (C/2006 P1) in my place (Latitude: 7° 06', South. Longitude: 34° 53', West), Joao Pessoa, Brazil.  I was upset because I realized it wouldn't be easy to see the comet from here. I went to bed thinking about the comet and stayed observing the nice spot of clear sky I have trough my large bedroom's window (6th floor) which is always kept open during the warm summer season. I have a nice view from here since there are no buildings around and we are only 100 m from the beach - in fact, from my window, I am facing the sea and ""Ponta do Seixas"" - the eastern most point of the Americas. There were no clouds neither the moon and I was observing the sky and the constellations (The Southern Cross, The Great Dog, Orion...) when I suddenly spotted what, at a first sight, looked like a tiny cloud blown by the wind - I felt strange because it was moving quite fast.  When I observed it properly, I have noticed its triangular shape without a clear contour made up of some faint points of white light (I could not count how many points - may be six or seven...).  The delta shaped ""thing"" was traveling soundless from southeast to northwest in a peculiar way with its wider angle pointing sideway (even a delta shaped airplane would not fly with one of the wings heading!).  I then realized that could be a formation of orbs. It was difficult to guess the altitude but it could be compared to a commercial plane flying at 3000 m or more. It soon went of my visual field (passing over my roof) - I run to another room, facing north, and in a second I could spot the triangular shape again. I observed it until it faded into the light sky of the city (away from the sea)  I doubt a person who was not intentionally watching the night sky would ever have noticed that ""thing"" - I had the impression it was traveling camouflaged...  I must add to this report that I have an engineering background and a considerable experience in observing the sky (I was an amateurs junior astronomer while at the university). Since then I have made a lot of suppositions and calculations:  I have taken a time average of many repetitions of my movements again and I found time of observation=20 seconds. Altitude (h): I had to guess - my first impression is (h > 3000 m) = 3 km . Reason: I am used to observe things closer than 3 km by just looking out from my window, boats, people at the beach, cars, planes - at smaller distances I see more details even at night. Length (L): since the thing's longer side comprised approximately a 2º angle (2 full moon size), which equals 0.255 rd and then, L = 3000 x 0.255 = 76.5 m    By estimating angles I could also calculate the speed (s) of the ""thing"":   1. Supposing h = 3 km, then v = 954 km/h !   2. Supposing h = 6 km, then v = 1908 km/h !!!  (In this case the length would be L = 6000 x 0.524 = 153 m !)  3. I don't want to suppose any higher because that would mean faster and bigger!    In fact, they looked like faint stars (+6 magnitude) (as I can see Pleyads M45 with the naked eye) - I was not able to count them but they were more than 5 and less then 8 points of light spread over the triangular area. At that time my street and the region around is always completely silent - just the sea at a distance, no restaurants are open and everyone else at home (2 more people) were asleep.  I would have heard the sound of a plane or anything like if closer. Clear glass windows measuring 1.50 x 1.20 (half of them open), no wind blowing (it is terrible warm by this time of the year) - 6th floor without any other apartment building around (only houses). Good visibility!   There are only 4 commercial flights per day arriving at Joao Pessoa since the main airports in the region are in neighbor cities (Recife and Natal) and even though, the local airport is 30 km to the west away from here.  I don't think this direction (Southeast to Northwest) is a flight corridor - I see some planes from South to North (over the sea) and the ones arriving here, I see at a distance East to West.  I will observe more carefully from now on!  As I have estimated, the ""thing"" was really faster then a plane at cruise altitude. The additional impression I can tell is that at first I thought it was a tiny cloud... when I realized it was to fast and had points of light I was really frightened because I found strange, what appeared to me like a ""flying blade"". I have even said to me - ""Oh my God, what is that?  I just calmed down when I thought it could be transparent, or, less frightening, a formation of smaller points of light.

I was wondering if you heard anything about sightings in that area around that time...  I called Ventura County Sherriff about 20:00, and they confirmed my sighting by telling me that they had another call reporting a possible plane crashing in the hills and were sending a helicopter to investigate. I called the next morning and the deputy I spoke to told me that he was on duty the night before and that there was no helicopter dispatched. I repeated the name of the deputy I had spoken to the night before (Gloria). He put me on hold, and after a minute or so came back and confirmed that a helicopter had been dispatched, and that nothing was found. My wife told me she was listening to the Coast To Coast radio program Jan. 30th, and that you said you had spoken to Sydney Sheldon  last week before he passed away about a sighting in Malibu.

During the game, I didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary. It was a typical day of Airsofting for me. A good time, although a tad bit cold.  After about a six hour game, I proceeded to head home and watch the firefight footage I got during the day. As I began watching the roughly 20 minutes of video that I shot, I found myself slightly disappointed in the video as my cam was pointed a tad higher than I'd thought.  However, in one of the clips, a black circle had been filmed in the middle of the open sky. It couldn't have been anything on the lens as it moved off screen when I turned my head and reappeared as I turned back. It did this for several minutes in the video as well as changing size. At one point, it fades off screen only to reappear and seemingly move off at high speed. It could have been me turning my head too fast, I don't know.

A fireball streaking high overhead from south to north, it was a DAYTIME SIGHTING, the persistent long tail was bright color of electric- arc blue mixed with violet- the color and brightness appearing like lightning from this witness' perspective, the head of the object grew larger as it moved from my right to left high in the sky, directly over the U.S. Capitol and behind the speaker's stage- I was located in the Mall between the Capitol and the Washington Monument, facing east, standing almost directly in front of the speakers stage about 100 feet back when I saw this object streak overhead  about half- way through the scheduled speakers presentations. I was awed and blown away for quite a while, and I wondered whether anybody else in the crowd witnessed this !  I was initially frightened by the streak or dart of light I saw in the sky over Capitol Hill- I thought at first a big firework, then I saw how high up it was- thousands of feet, or several miles- and then I thought missile, and the fireball got somewhat larger as it traveled, -and I actually expected an explosion with sound- but only silence happened, and the tail faded without leaving any smoke or cloud whatsoever. The tail of a normal meteor would have left a thin remnant smoke or cloud trail like a contrail- but I repeatedly sought for a wisp of smoke to try to understand what I was seeing- and saw only CLEAR BLUE SKY AND SUN- BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ! AND my early impression is this was LIKE AN ARROW ! Why ? Because the tail was very long and persisted way too long to be a normal meteor. You see, a normal meteor is colored incandescent white or bright sun- yellow, with a short tail because the tail tracks closely to the head of the meteor ( look at videos of the unfortunate shuttle reentry loss ). But THIS object- the tail continued for at least 20 degrees of sky, the entire display faded all at once, and the color of the tail was electric- arc blue- like an arc welder, but deeper blue- fringed with violet- FULL LENGTH- and I think the head of the object, as it progressed and grew bigger, was more violet than blue. Moving south to north, from the direction of the sun towards north.  I turned and looked at the faces of the crowd together with the media risers close behind me- NO REACTION AT ALL !

The beam light seems as it was coming from the back of the craft, very impressively.  The lights were mainly white.  The craft traveled from east to west.

I walked out back to smoke a cigarette.  Through the tree line behind our home and slightly above the horizon, I noticed flashing lights, like that of an airplane; only these appeared to be brighter even though there was an obvious distance between myself and the object.  They were brighter and more colorful than the simple red green flashing of a plane’s wingtips.  More colorful, meaning that it APPEARED to me that there was a blue and white flash along with the red and green.   I watched the object for about a minute or two, adjusted and cleared my eyes (I have perfect 20/20 vision) and got my fiancé from the living room.  I asked her if she wanted to see a UFO and to come quick.  She ran out, I pointed out the object to her and she also witnessed the object.  We watched it move slightly in and out of view just above the horizon, again, at a distance.  I had to move around a couple of steps to keep in into view; there was also a distant tree on a little hill that I was looking at the object through.   She asked me could it be a helicopter distantly overhead, and I said that I was pretty sure that it wasn’t.  I have some dealing with helo’s in the past and I am sure that isn’t what it was.  After moving around in the sky for a couple of minutes, the lights just turned off.  An aircraft you would see the lights fade away, these simply just went out.  There were no low clouds for the object to have hid behind; they simply went out like someone flipped a switch.  I was so sure that what I was looking at was a UFO that if it had been earlier in the evening, I would have gotten my neighbors to look at it as well, but its kind of rude to wake someone up at just after midnight to tell them you think you have seen a UFO.

The light was a bit bigger than a star, thus the abnormality in its apparent speed, if it were an airplane. The light also seemed very bright and consolidated,  with very faint flashing lights.  At first I thought it was some kind of orbiting satellite, but that seems unlikely due to its visibility.  I live near 2 major airports, JFK and La-Guardia, and see all kinds of aircraft flying overhead at all times of the day.  This was different.  A plane flying at its height would be fainter, the blinking would be more articulated, and it would be considerably slower.  Also, there were other planes in the area, which made it easy to compare.  After walking towards my apartment for a minute I turned around and it appeared not to be moving, and seemed to pulsate. Another craft, flying considerably closer than the first one, flew in from the west.  It had 4 lights rapidly blinking in an L shaped pattern: 3 of the lights making up the rod of the L were white, while the tip of the L was red.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, but it did not sound like one, and I have never seen a helicopter with such a light configuration.",2008-04-17T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I had been talking to a friend of mine and decided to take the conversation out onto the balcony while I smoked a cigarette.   The night sky was clear and the stars were very visible.   As I spoke on the phone to my friend and smoked I looked up at the night sky because the view was spectacular.  At this time I saw a triangular shaped dimly lit object come over the apartment building and move at a steady but somewhat slow pace on a northwest trajectory.  It only seemed to be about 200 to 300 feet above the ground and not very large.  It made absolutely no sound.   I watched in astonishment and relayed what I was seeing to my friend via phone.   I then hung up and thought about what I had seen to see if there was a ""logical explanation"".  I thought of geese because of the somewhat low flight pattern.  However in my experience here in Indiana you ALWAYS hear geese when they fly overhead. HONK HONK!   This also fails to explain the LIGHTED nature of what I had seen.  It was almost like a kite with very dimly lit lights along its edges  Possibly six if you count the point.  It was so dimly lit in fact that if not for the motion of it I may not have noticed it at all.   I called my mother in Louisiana to describe the event to her and once again as I was talking to her I scanned the skies.  It was then that I sighted movement in the northwest and saw the same object taking a ""nosedive"" downward for about 5 seconds and then once again disappear.

I do/did not believe in UFO's. I have never done drugs or drank, not even coffee.  My friend was with me, she hasn't done anything like that either. We're both Freshman at a private University in Idaho. Anyways, my roommate and I went to DQ for some ice cream at about 22:00. When we got back to the women's dorm's parking lot, (22:40) I jumped out of her van to move my car to a different spot. She was still parking her van when I got done. She and I both took astronomy during summer 2007. While I was waiting for her to park her car I looked up at the sky to see if I could remember the names of the constellations. It was a crystal clear night. I was looking westward. Out of the corner of my eye (south) I saw something moving in the sky. It was moving slowly. I thought maybe it was clouds or the Milky Way. Then I looked at it. It was a black, slightly grey color, which made it hard to see unless you were already looking at the sky. I thought it was part of the sky but I realized it was a distinct object. It was gliding northward. It was very high up in the sky, at about where planes would fly or a little higher. It was huge, as in if you would land it, it would have been gigantic! It definitely wasn’t as small as an airplane would be when you see one in the sky. It didn’t have any lights on it at all which is why I kept looking at it. I’ve never seen an aircraft fly without lights. There seemed to be a little blur around it.  My mind couldn’t make sense of what that was around it. Usually when that happens, something weird’s going on. To me it looked like a dragon, but without any arms or legs. It was kind of squarer at the front and gradually got thinner, kind of like a triangle but it didn’t look like a triangle. I drew a picture for one of my other roommates. She said it kind of looks like the shape of a whale to her. I thought it was a dragon, which I don’t believe in either. When my roommate got out of her van, I ran over to her and told her to tell me what that was. We couldn’t figure it out. She thought maybe it was a flock of birds, but it was too high up for birds to fly. We listened closely to see if we could hear it making a noise, but we couldn’t hear anything. We had no idea what it was. We’d ! never se en any aircraft like it before. It was a definite object, I wouldn’t be able to tell you what it was made of, since it was dark outside, and the object itself was black. I would guess metal, but it was so smooth. It didn’t leave behind any exhaust or anything. We watched it until it got further away so we couldn’t really see it anymore.",2008-04-17T00:00:00,43.78304222222222,-111.76394222222223

What I saw, at first glance, I and my coworker thought to be a weather balloon moving from east by south east towards north by north west in a straight line, moving at a high rate of speed. However, I quickly realized it was moving against the prevailing winds which were pushing the clouds in a northeasterly direction.  The object I believe to be small about the size of a midsized compact car. The object appeared to have a shape similar to a light bulb. The front was round and it tapered to a small almost pointed tail. The object was brightly polished gold metallic in color as the front bulbous area reflected the sun as it moved away from us.  The object was well above the clouds, its speed did not vary, and the object did not tumble or roll or vary its direction. We are just about one mile from the San Jose International Air Port. The jet planes that were crossing over at this time were moving much slower than the object.  The object did not leave a trail behind it, neither was there a flame coming out its tail end, it did not have wings, and it did not have a tail that would control its movement.  As the object was moving directly over us its bottoms color seemed to very in intensity like waves in a darker shade that moved from the front to the rear.  From the time we started to observe the object the object remained in sight for about 40 to 45 seconds.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

She stated that they had watched the object stay in a stationary position in the sky for approximately 30 minutes. We discussed the various possibilities, including a helicopter, airplane, balloon, etc. All these possible explanations were rejected by my daughter and her husband. The object was about the height of an airplane coming in for a landing. The possibility of a balloon was rejected because the object started moving in a northerly direction (against the wind) and then moved back into the original position. She asked if I could see the object and when I looked out my window, there it was! I watched it also and we continued to speculate about it. It then started moving North again and then disappeared.

I could clearly see there was no person there, only this golden light. If someone was there with a light I would've seen him or her that close in the bright snow. There was no traffic or reflection, it was glowing a golden color and a little smaller than a basketball size. It was a little bright than a truck headlight. It moved faster than a person could walk. I walked to the exact spot where it was and there was no tracks at all in the snow. There was a very strong odor in the air, like a natural gas well was left uncapped, but the nearest gas well was capped and buried years ago and I never smelled a gas odor since it was capped. We don't have any natural gas for heat, only electric. It was so strong I lost my breath and had to go back inside quickly. The dogs had no reaction whatsoever, they did their business and came back in without barking. The next day the gas odor was gone and there still were no tracks in the snow where I saw the light.

Amelia, Ohio  While on the back deck of a friend’s house, saw an object moving slowly from the northwest to southeast at an altitude roughly between 125 and 250ft above the ground. It was not much higher than the tree line. I work in the defense industry, and I’m an aircraft technician by trade, and consider myself very familiar with many different types of aircraft. However, this was something I’ve never seen or heard about in the industry. This object came within about 100 yards from where I was standing, at roughly the earlier stated altitude of 125-250ft above the ground. This object had a very bright light at the bottom of it, which looked to be encased in a housing of some sort, because it gave off a slight lampshade affect directly above the light itself allowing me to see that it was attached to an object. The shape reminded me of  a canister, similar to an aluminum soda can, but again making out the object above the light was somewhat difficult because the light was so bright. I could see that above the main light there was no sort of lighting on the object. The main light itself was not bright white, but off white to a yellowish white. The light was very similar in color to a set of lights you might see over a highway or large parking lot, not quite bright white, but an off white. My best estimate was that this object was 4 to 6 feet in width and approximately 6 to 8 feet in height including the light. As this object approached just above the tree line from the northwest, it must have taken close to  15 seconds to reach its closest point to me, again roughly 100 yards from where I was standing. It looked to be moving very slowly under 20mph. As the object reached its closest point to me, I opened the back door, and instructed my friends to come look at the object. Four other people besides myself witnessed this from this time on. When the object was at it’s closest, it appeared to stop for roughly 10 seconds, when I noticed a slight rocking motion from it. It looked like the craft stopping caused the rocking motion, which appeared to rock 1 or 2 feet in both directions. The object made no sound at all, during the complete time I witnessed it. After the object paused in place for roughly 10 seconds, it changed it’s original direction towards the southeast, to the southwest. From this point it stayed in a straight line, moving slowly above the tree line, for another 20 seconds or so, when the light suddenly went out for 3 to 5 seconds, and suddenly reappeared for another few seconds then disappeared for good. After the object changed direction, although still moving slowly, did pickup some speed possibly 30 to 40mph until I last saw it. My impression of this sighting, was that it was very likely manmade, and reminded me of some sort of surveillance craft. It was not like anything I have witnessed or heard about in the industry, but did not do anything beyond current defense technology. I was however very surprised that it did not make ANY noise whatsoever.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,39.0131,-84.2049

Around 1:30 am March 23 I was walking past my hall window on my way to bed when I noticed how bright the moon was.  I stopped to look out at the night sky and I noticed a twinkling bright light in the sky that was much larger than the stars.  I thought it might be a plane or planet but its movement, size and the blinking multi-colored lights suggested otherwise.  I watched it for about 45 min.  The lights were blinking from side to side and were red, white, and what might have been green, blue or purple.  It was hard to tell what the colors were as the object was pretty far away but they were clearly multi-colored and extremely bright.  I steadied myself against the wall and put a finger on the window because I couldn’t tell if it was moving or not at first.  My finger was on the window just under the object and as I watched, it moved in all directions.  It went left, right, side to side, and diagonal and at times got closer and farther away.  It seemed to be just hanging out in one particular area of the sky but was moving around in that area.  I have noticed this object before in the same spot as much as a year ago and didn’t really pay much mind to it.  I also saw it following night around the same time but this time I saw it more clearly.  It seemed slightly closer. While I was watching it on the first night I saw something else.  It was a glowing orange thing that appeared to be much closer and larger though it was hard to place exactly where it was in the sky as it happened very quickly.  It appeared out of nowhere, accelerated and disappeared into thin air.  All I saw of it was the orange glow and the tail that seemed to form when it accelerated.  It was either moving too fast for me to see after it accelerated, or it just disappeared, I can’t say which, but this object was just over the tree tops and was very large.  Far too large to be a comet or something like that and it was moving in an upward arc.  I would have never seen it had I not been watching the sky already.  I had a clear view of the sky in front of where it appeared and it really just seemed to come from nowhere. I am a 25 year old college student and mother of one.  I have never seen a UFO before and frankly didn’t think I ever would but when I saw this object I knew it couldn’t be man made just by the way it was moving.  It was really pretty startling to see how it moved and I have never seen anything like it before. It was high enough in the sky that it would have been easily overlooked.  I also noticed on the second night, closer to 2 am, that whenever a car happened to drive by on my street the object almost seemed to follow it with a light, as though it were watching the people below.  This could have just been my eyes getting tired but it really looked like the lights on the craft were pointing in the direction of my street whenever a car would pass and the object seemed to move around more.  It seemed to be more active when cars passed, almost as if it were trying to get their attention. Neither the blinking object or the orange object made any sounds that i could hear and there was no smoke or anything like that following the orange object.  I was unable to tell the shape of the blinking object because all I could make out were the lights.  The second night it looked closer but it was a slightly cloudy night and the object seemed to be in a clouded or hazy area.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,,

It was at 55 degrees to the horizon facing and moving SW to a NE direction heading over and towards the north slope of the Sandia Mountains north of the city limits of Albuquerque. What I observed was what I though was a seagull or white bird catching thermals at a high altitude…the more I looked at it I notice a unusual side to side flight as if it was fluttering like a butterfly might fly. It was moving slow in a NE direction and notice it was blinking every one to three second intervals but at a location different from the other and no sound was heard, giving a fluttering appearance. At arms length the flash was the size of a button. The sighting seem to last two to three minutes before it was beyond the horizon from my view.  It was defiantly below the clouds and my guess is about the same altitude of private single or twin engine planes? I attempted to try and take photos with my cell phone but was unable to.  My second sighting was in August or September? of 1992? (unsure of date and year) on Albuquerque’s Westside at the apartment complex I was living at.

Just hovering about 500 metres from us. At first I thought the Northen Lights were way too low in the sky and my wife agreed, and mentioned that the shape and non-movement could not make this the Northen Lights. The gold/ green sheen flowed in a rhythmic motion from front to back. I looked around to see if any other motorists would stop to see what we were looking at. No-one else was on the road at that hour. My wife said ""Advertizing Balloon?"" I grabbed a handfull of road shoulder gravel and one by one threw them to see if I could hit the ""balloon"". It was too far to hit. We stood there for about 4 minutes looking up, and out at the highway to see if other motorists would also stop. Not a single car passed nothbound or south. With no noise, the cylinder moved south west for about 200 metres at slow speed and at the same altitude, then flew straight up at a fantastic speed and disappeared into the distance. We stood there for another 4 or 5 minutes. Looking up, and to the direction where we had originally seen the object. We had a good deal of speculation and commenting on what we had just seen.

Saw manta ray or triangle object flying very slow,whooshing sound My sister and I were in the driveway getting out of our car going into the house. I noticed 2 bright white balls of light hovering over the tree tops about a quarter mile away.There was no noise. We couldn't figure out what they were, so we walked across the road and all over the front lawn and driveway trying to get a better look. We saw one of the lights shoot down a pulsing like red ray and white lights also flashed and moved around at the same time. It also looked like a huge beam of white light was coming down from underneath both of them. This went on for 3-4 minutes.  All the while these 2 things stayed absolutely still and made no noise at all. As soon as we both took out our camera phones and took a picture, both lights immediately brightened and became much larger. It was as if they saw us and were talking to each other somehow. Then one started slowly moving toward us while the other one slowly moved off to the side and rose up a little higher. We watched this light move ever so slowly toward us. It flew directly over our heads as if in slow motion. It was so low and only made a low whooshing like sound. It was like a manta ray shape or some kind of rounded triangle.  It was shiny, black metallic like. The underside had some kind of square indentations, like a grid almost. There was a red flashing light in front and 2 white flashing strobe lights in the back. It had 3 white lights underneath toward the back of it. On each side were 2 rocket like things that were a lighter color like gray. We watched both of these things fly ever so slowly and quietly until we couldn't see them over the mountains. We looked around for 1-2 minutes then heard a very low noise unlike any plane or helicopter. We turned and saw the same 2 bright lights hovering in the same exact spots! By now we were extremely freaked out so we woke up our brother. We all live near a military airport base so we are used to different aircraft and how they sound. The 3 of us watched these things for a few minutes silently hover above the tree tops. When my brother shined a flashlight toward them they did the same thing. The light immediately became larger and brightened and it started to move toward us. Only this time it was up a little higher and off to the side of us. The other one rose up and over and hovered behind the tree tops. We couldn't see it clearly like the first time, but I did manage to get a few seconds of it on video tape-mainly the rear lights. We are in our 30's, have children and jobs. We are regular people who saw something strange in the sky that night.

The lights did not project a beam like a landing light will often do, and the lights were a clean white versus the yellowish tint associated with an incandescent light.  The aircraft itself must have been black because I could not make out the shape against the dark clouds other than the shape that the lights produced.  I estimate that it was approximately the size of a commuter jet from front to back, but it was definitely not a commuter jet.  It was moving from east to west at approximately 40-50 miles per hour and at an altitude of about 2000 feet at the most.  I did not notice any strobe or other colored lights associated with commercial aircraft.  I also was unable to hear any sound, and I had rolled my window down to see if I could hear anything.  I turned around in a driveway to follow it and see if I could get a better look and by the time I got back on the road it had apparently sped up enough to get out of my sight or had gone into the clouds.

This flashing from left to right went on for approx. 5 or more minutes. There was no sound, no flashes, no type of trail as though from any form or flare or fired round. The lights stopped for a couple of minutes and then reappeared more extravagent. I personally witnessed the light appear over the ocean and then another orb seemed to stretch out of the original. The cloned orange orb moved faster than light to the far right and then in a quick spinning type motion the light stretched and lines appeared in it. Those went away and then suddenly 4 different ones appeared with the last one to remain being in the same spot as the one that had spun. That one two spun and they all vanished. This lasted from the time we noticed it for about 34 minutes central time. There were no planes, no helicopters, no jets, etc. and no sound at all. I never believed in anything and am still not sure of what it could have been except that of a UFO considering the fact that we can not identify it.

One morning while getting ready for school in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, around 7 a.m. on a totally clear day back in 1980 or 1981 I went out on our balcony with my little sister to get our school uniforms out of the dryer which was on the balcony.   I looked at the horizon and saw a ship or saucer level with the ocean and thought it was a new cruise ship or even possibly a military vehicle because of how big it was, this craft was very big.  The object proceeded to move upward and at that point I knew it wasn't a cruise ship because I could see the ocean and the sky seperated underneath the ship.   The craft then proceeded to move upward  and move slowly in a triangular shape in the same area.  It was more diamond shaped and had an off white or cream color with 2 rows of green lights.  At that point I turned to my mothers room which I could see into from the balcony and told my mom to wake up and come look at this thing floating above the water.  By the time my mom got up and looked it was gone.  If I had to make a comparison as far as size I'd say as big as a cruiseship.  I went to school and told my classmates about what I saw and they all laughed at me so I stopped talking about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It had lights beneath it in a variety of colors and when it decided to leave it went from a stand still hover to the size of a star in a matter of 3 seconds.

Neighbors also saw it. I reported it to the police, but nothing cam of that.  After all these years I decided I want to let the sighting be known for whatever good it might do in the search for the truth.  I was living on Normandy Drive, Pisactaay, N.J., at the time.  It was 8pm and at that time of year the sun is low in the western sky, but the sky is still bright and clear.  I usually went out back at this time to watch the sunset.  My yard ended at railroad tracks and power lines that went east to west.  Across a field on the opposite side I had a clear view of the distant Watchung Mountains in the northwest direction from my yard.  It was a cloudless clear sky.  I was facing due west.  The sun had just gone behind the mountains so it did not obstruct my vision.   After a while I noticed a small oblect in the sky coming from the west to east, not far from and paralleling the power lines.  It was coming directly towards me.  I thought nothing of it at first.  As it got closer I noticed it had an odd shape.  At first I thought it was a hot air baloon.  But, as it came closer and grew larger, I could see that it was in the classic shape of a flying saucer.  It came almost directly  overhead and it had to be at least 100 ft. in diameter or larger.  When it was nearly overhead, aboout 350 yards at its closest point to me, it made a 90 degree turn and went north gaining in altitude as it went.   I ran to get my neighbors.  Four of them came out and saw the saucer, but only after it had gained some altitude and distance so they did not see it nearly as close up as I did.  They were none the less amazed at what they saw because even when they saw it, it was plain to see that it was no known conventional aircraft.  There was a small local airport not too far away and my house was under major flyways for the N.Y. and Newark City area airports.  Usually at any given time you can go out and look up and see various normal aircraft or j! et trail s in the sky.  On this occasion, the sky was oddly empty except for one small private plane coming from from the direction (west) of the local small airport.  The small plane came to a distance of about half way between me and the departing UFO.  Even at these distances the UFO could be seen to be well over twice the size of the plane.  The plane looked like it was a two or four seater.  The plane suddenly made a 180 degree curved turn about and flew back in the direction of the airport.  I thought that was a strange maneuver.   We watched the UFO until it faded from sight into the distance.  At no time did we hear any noticable sounds at all coming from the UFO.  I told other neighbors later on, naturally, they thought I was crazy.  My neighbors who saw the flying saucer with me would not talk to any one but me about it.  To this day I regret that I didn't get any photos of the UFO, for that would have made it easier for meto tell this story, if I had photos to show as back up.  But that doesn't mean others in the general area didn't see the UFO as well.  So, someone may have photos of the incident after all.  I owuld like to know if anyone else has reported this sighting in May 1982. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
