As I watched the great display of celestial lights, I seen a particularly bright flash of light, like a large bright white strobe light.  It flashed at regular timed intervals of what seemed to be 3 to 4 seconds, but what was amazing, was the distance it traveled between each flash.  The distances varied, and seemed to be from miles, to hundreds of miles, depending on what it's height was, which I could not determine. This flashing and traveling continued in a  large circle of  what appeared to be from 15 degrees above the horizon, in the south, going overhead, to that same angle in the north, then returning more to the East, and back to the south again, and going out of site behind the trees in my south west.

At first I thought it was a plane with the landing lights on, but realized the lights were far too bright and that it was traveling the wrong direction.  Also thought it was moving too fast to be a commercial airliner.  I then suspected the space station due to the size (maybe 15 to 20 times bigger than the largest star in it's traverse).  I looked away for just a second and when I turned back it was gone!  I could not believe that it had disappeared so quickly as it was not near the horizon or mountains the last time I saw it.

I, along with some friends have seen something we cannot explain. This is not a hoax, yet may be easily explained.  The event took place in Western Kentucky some time in approximately 1974.  My friends and I were walking to a camping sight at night.  We were in a large open field, approx 30 acres.  We had a good view of a clear night sky.  One friend says: ""look at that!""  In the sky was an orange light that looked like an ember from a fire.  Its movement also resembled an ember rising up off of a fire.  We looked around 360 degrees and saw no fire anywhere.  We watched this ‘ember’ fly across the sky, rising and falling and looping around until it had flown out of sight behind the tree line. Observations:  It looked and moved like a glowing ember off of a fire. It was not close to the ground and appeared to be extremely high in the sky, or even in space.  We really couldn’t tell for sure what its altitude was. There was only one. Its color and brightness didn’t appear to change, though it did have tiny sparks flying off it, as if  wind was blowing on it. Though we live in the quite countryside, we could hear no sound coming from it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

For obvious reasons I never reported it.  Traveling cross country from Houston TX, to San Diego, CA, I slept in El Paso Texas, then headed west on Route 10.   About 25 or 30 miles into Arizona, I stopped to stretch my legs in the desert.  The weather was exceptionally clear, stars were almost on the horizon and there was a full moon.  One maybe two cars passed in the roughly 15 minutes I was there.  Looking South to Southeast, I saw an array of lights just over my right shoulder, close to Zenith, slightly to the West. I listened for a sound but there was none. I first thought it might be a helicopter. Its overall shape was indeterminate except for the elliptical/oval array of lights which were sharp and distinct. There were two (2) colors of lights, evenly spaced, alternating blush red, and a sort of mercury blue. For a minute or so it was motionless, perfectly stable as I tried to make out an overall shape, determine what it was and it’s altitude. Not knowing its altitude or size I couldn’t estimate either. I guessed that the elliptical shape of lights could be circular depending on its aspect or tilt.  It then moved purposefully but slightly to the North, then back just a little toward the South, and stopped. From a full stop it then instantly accelerated over the Eastern horizon in what I estimated to be about 4-5 Seconds. Its path was perfectly straight without any random motion or bobbling. I stood and waited for about a minute believing I’d hear a sonic boom but there was no sound, sonic boom or otherwise. A diffuse blue contrail was left in its flight path, perfectly illuminated by the moon. This gradually turned to very thin white puffs and disappeared. No other aircraft were in the area.  I thought about what I’d seen.  Thinking the Eastern mountain ranges were maybe 5K to 8K feet in altitude, it seemed to clear them by about 5K feet (estimate) so I assumed the craft was maybe at 12K-15K feet altitude. My confusion was how a craft or a missile could go from a full stop to 3 or 4 miles per second without any sound.  I’m not exactly an untrained observer.  For 10 years I worked on the development and launch of more than 20 rocket-borne and reconnaissance aircraft systems.  After that I worked on Apollo instrumentation systems and was at the Flight Control Operations Directorate at the Johnson Space Center in Houston during Apollo 15, 16 & 17, and Skylab I, II, and III.

I am a professional who works in the medical field radiologic imagery (not X-ray).  This incident occurred when I was 14 years old. It may seem strange to describe the exact circumstances of my observation, but you have to see this through the eyes of a teenager.  I had a cassette player which was the type that your regular portable unit which was about the size of an elongated cigar box.  My parent's house was about 5 blocks from the ocean.  At night, the next door neighbor would come over and she would sit at the dinner table with my mom and talk for hours.  So, to play my music and get away from my surroundings, I would take refuge by easily ascending to the rooftop by clmbing a palm tree via the ac unit. One evening after dusk, 9pm, I was listening to music, not to loud on the rooftop, when suddenly, the tape stopped playing.  At first, I thought the batteries died, but I could see the rollers were still moving.  I fiddled with the volume wheel, but it was not that either.  Perplexed, I sat there for a minute thinkin that the tape was bad or my player was going bad.  I honestly do not remember why I looked up, but I did.  Then I just leaned back and stretched my arms behind my head.  I noticed something odd, but I could not figure out what I was seeing.  Something to the east and to the North was moving. I saw a dark triangular object that looked to me at the time like a black hang glider up in the clear star lit sky traveling from North to South at a speed of maybe 300 mph or more.  It was dead quiet and it was definitely up there.  No lights but it was so clear out, that I could see its shape.  Now, Ironically later in life, it seemed to me to look more like an F-117 stealth in its overall shape, but this was in 1983.  Whatever it was, it profoundly etched itself in my memory.  About 30 seconds after traversing the peripheral of my view,  the tape player started playing music again. It was playing the song as if it had missed the part where the track was silent.  Before this incident, and after, I never had any problems with the tape or the machine, until I got rid of the player a few years later. I do not claim to have seen a UFO or a secret military craft.  But what I saw defied any satisfactory explanation to this day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At first I thought there must have been a test from Lom Poc as they did launch many test missiles from this location throughout the time I lived in the west valley and they often caused some very strange displays in the sky.  But as this ""light"" approached our position leaving no contrails, it suddenly made a 90 degree turn, shot straight up through the clouds and rapidly ascended out of view.   The cloud cover parted in its wake in a perfect circle which continued to expand like a smoke ring.   I wasn’t quite sure if I had actually seen what I saw.  My mouth dropped open and I turned to my husband as we both spoke at the exact same instant:  ""Did you see that?""   Neither of us could explain what we had just witnessed. I’ve told this story to a few people over the years when the subject of UFO’s would come up in casual conversation and to this day it gives me chills yet I can tell my listeners want to dismiss my story as just that; a story.  The overactive imaginings of youth.  I have never claimed the object was extraterrestrial; however I always do remind them that UFO only means the object was unidentified and flying.   I am still a practicing skeptic, but I just don’t have any rational explanation for what we saw that evening and as of yet no one else has either.

The following is how it was seen. While unloading my shopping bags, I heard a helicopter in the distance. After a few moments it was within view. The only thing obstructing my view was the roof of my house. The helicopter then cleared the roof and continued moving southeast. At this moment in time,I was returning for my second trip to the car for the last of shopping bags. The noise of the helicopter was loud enough, to make me look again. I looked towards the helicopter and spotted another flying object near the helicopter. There was no noise from it, as far as I could tell. The helicopter continued moving southeast until another object appeared about 200 yards ahead. I say ""appeared"" because I did not actually see the craft arrive at that point. I was still focused on the first object; the second craft fell into my view as the helicopter moved into the space. At this moment my wife was also starring at this strange sight. She said she was wondering what had grabbed my attention.I explained to her what I had seen so far. My daughter then came outside where my wife told her to look towards the sky. Craft 1 started to pulse from a dull yellow to a color of that from a BMW headlight, a bluish-purple.Within a few seconds Craft 1 left at an unknown speed heading north. This is the last I saw from Craft 1. While Craft 1 left the helicopter was still heading souteast and Craft 2 was now about 100 yards away. At this point I believe the pilot saw this object. The helicopter quickly, sharply turned due east towards Sunrise Mtn. The Craft hovered for a moment while the helicopter continued moving.The Craft then got in front of the helicopter, again baout 100 yards. I did not see the craft move as I can describe it is more of a blink and then it was there. At this moment I was aking both my daughter and wife if they were seeing what I was seeing. The helicopter quickly and I stress quickly; turned head directly south. I saw the tail of the helicopter whip around and a higher exhaust note from it. The helicopter continued moving south with its nose down,tail high moving fast. The craft at this point moved along the side of the helicopter still 100 yards away. This mirror image of the craft and halicopter lasted about 10-15 seconds. The next thing that occured was that the craft stopped and redirected towards the north. It moved slowly at first and zoomed away. The craft were long about the same size as the helicopter. The pulse affect of the craft was as that of a squid when it is under stress. The speed was awe inspiring. There was no known sound if any coming from the craft. The helicopter was not a police or military aircfart,it seemed to be a medical helicopter.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

As I was staring out the window I saw this white ball of light that didn’t leave a streak in the sky nor in my vision like an ordinary light would, and it didn’t make a sound.

I was driving Northwest on US 60 from Phoenix to Wickenburg. At about 8:30 pm, appx, I was in the area of US 60 and Jomax Rd. There, there was a racetrack off to the west side of US 60. Above the lights of the facility, though probably a mile or two beyond, I observed ""dancing"" lights, which seemed to move up and down. This motion resembled lightning initially, though the sky was absolutely clear. Then, at the top of the ""dancing"" lights, 9 horizontal lights appeared, then 9 more lights appeared just to the right of those. The width of these horizontal lights were about as wide as a full moon. After 30 seconds or so, they disappeared, and I did not think too much about them, just appeared to be something odd, but distant. Then, a few minutes later, and a few miles further up US60, the horizontal lights re-appeared on the west side of the Highway. Again, they seemed fairly far away, probably 1-2 miles. This time, however, the horizontal lights would blink from left to right, in rapid succession (one at a time). After all 9 lights blinked on the left, they would blink on another object about 1/3 mile to the east. It gave the appearance that there was only one object, but that it would simply move instantaniously from one location to the other. I got this impression because the lights would not blink simoultaneously, just one object at a time. This went on for 3 minutes or so, long enough for me and the car in front of me to slow down to a crawl, and watch the events occur. Finally, they disappear again, only to reappear a little further north, just before the Morristown overpass. Here the lights reappeared. This time, though, the object was very close, at least it seemed. Now, it was close enough for me to faintly make out a shape amongst the now solid, non-blinking lights. The object appeared, from my angle, to be oval shaped. But, the once vertical lights were now elevated in the center. This gave me the impression that the object was actually flat on top and bottom, and round around the! edges ( Disk chaped), but I was just slightly underneath it. Otherwords, if you were to look at a plate from the side at an equal altitude, it would appear flat and straight. But, looking at it from directly underneath, it would appear perfectly round. My view was something in between. But, this third and final sighting lasted a couple of minutes, and the lights appeared steady, and not blinking. Again, the object would appear on the left, disappear, then reappear on the right (a little further away), never illuminating at the same time. But, the object was still, and I had plenty of time to now count the lights, and there were no flashing beacon lights! None whatsoever! By now, I was alone on the highway, and the car in front of me had long sped off. This last sighting was frightening, since I was now alone, and in the vicinity of the object. The object appeared large to me, maybe the size of a blimp. But, it is hard to tell, since I could not judge its' distance from myself. Maybe it is much smaller, but was also much closer? Honestly, I tried to make a good judgement of distance, but I simply do not know, so I hate to specualte on the actual size. The size of a blimp is just the impression I got, so I will go with that.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,33.9883,-112.4486

Date:  10 March, 2008        Time: 0730 MDT	        Weather:  Clear, about 35-degrees, no breeze   Location:  In the Buckhorn Canyon near Deadman Gulch about one mile ENE of Moody Park in Roosevelt National Forest and roughly 15 straight-line miles west of downtown Fort Collins, Colorado. Description:  I had just started my morning commute to work and was by road about three miles from home which is located in Paradise Park (that’s on about any recent topographic map of the area).   The sun had just broken the higher peaks visible from the canyon bottom as I noticed a glint toward the top of the windshield.  I slowed to take a closer look as the sky was beautifully blue and clear and there should have been nothing in that area of sky.  I’ve driven this route for over 10 years and know it well.   What I saw was an ellipsoidal object lit from beneath by the sun.  It was slowly and noiselessly moving toward the west at, I would estimate, about 10 mph.  It was moving level and in a linear manner.   My first thought was a weather balloon; yea, sure, Uncle.  If so, it would be moving against any prevailing breeze which would be from the west to east.  There was no breeze at ground level that morning.    It did not change shape or direction.   I had it in view for about three to four seconds and watched it move behind an unnamed ""hill"" which is a small but quite obvious peak from the bottom of the canyon.  On the topographic map the hill is noted at 6897’ in elevation at the top.  I would estimate the object was just below the peak and travelled just south of the peak as the ellipse disappeared ""behind"" the peak from the canyon bottom and road.    Based on the spruce trees on the peak, I would estimate the major axis of the ellipse which was horizontal to be about 25’ to 30’ and the minor axis to be about 1/3 that.  It was clearly lit from below by the early morning sun and appeared the white ""color"" of the sun, a highly reflective surface which added no spectral modification of its own.  It was totally opaque.   The linear distance from the road, my observation point, to the object was about 0.20 miles.  This is estimated from the topographic map of the area.  If I had been home and looking out the south-facing windows of the house, I would have been looking down on the object and had a much longer sighting Too bad!   Just for interest sake, this was by far not my first sighting nor, hopefully, will be my last.  It is the first I have reported to NUFORC.

There were times the UFO appeared to have no lights on at all but would then start in again with the streaming tail of white light.

It moved in mostly circular motions including figure eights, dropping, and rising at steep angles.  The object finally disappeared below the tree line and I didn’t see it reappear.

My friend and I were golfing on the 3rd hole of Mount Hood Golf Course located in Melrose, MA. The time listed is exact.  Weather was sunny with some clouds. While waiting for golfers in front of us, and watching golfers behind us shoot to the green we noticed a dark, oval object in the sky. The color was nearly black with a tint of brown, no lights and no reflection from the sun.  The object was a good distance to us, fairly high in the sky. It was completely circular with no apparent wings or propulsion. We saw several low flying Jetliners from Logan Airport afterwards, and this object was much higher. It moved at a constant speed, remaining at the same altitude the entire time it was visible. I attempted to take a picture with my cell phone but I am sadly not well versed in using that feature. We pointed the object out to the golfers behind us on Hole 2, whom were just as mystified as ourselves. The object seemed to be more over northwest Melrose and Wakefield as Hole 3 runs south by southwest (I Believe per google maps), and we overlooked hole 2 to view the object. We lost sight of the object after 2 minutes behind a cloud. After seeing so many planes that day at different altitudes from just taking off to extremely high (35,000 FT), we both could tell this was no aircraft. The first debunking ideas after viewing the object that came to my mind were the following: Dark colored balloon, Blimp or or kite. I can rule out the blimp, as we saw the Hood Blimp returning from Boston from the Red Sox game that afternoon fly over us later that evening. The balloon is possible, but what is difficult is that a balloon would wobble with wind. This object stayed on-course and was unwaivering steady in its course of movement. Finally the kite theory is hard because it traveled such a distance (at least a mile) while we were viewing it.

What was odd, was that it seemed to be a long enough object that it had quite a space between it's lights. A very bright hot pink burning light at the front of it, and a bright turquoise blue light burning at the back of it with a decent sized space in between the lights which gave it the appearance of being a long object.

It seemed large in proportion to the normal air traffic I see in my horizon.  I yelled to my guest...""____, Come here quick!"" and it was still visible while I said that after I spotted it, so I know it had to be visible for at least 6-8 seconds before it just disappeared.  I've seen lots of meteors in the daylight, and the colors of this object and the distance between the bright colors made me think for sure it was an aircraft going down.

On Easter Sunday April 16  (2006) I took 40 photos of the moon directly over St Georges terrace (a major street) in Perth city, Western Australia. Pics werew taken from the western end of the city looking east. Of particular interest was the last frame shot at about 8 pm. I did not see this image at the time. I discovered it only when downloading the photos. It is about 3/4 up from the horizon, This frame (heavily cropped here) almost separately depicts the foreground and buildings, the moon, an elliptical image of apparently regular dimensions, containing a delta, or cone shaped object (image) concentrically disposed to the elliptical shape. Lens flare and lens dirt are eliminated by comparing this frame with others showing the ellipse, but not the inscribed delta image. The sky was clear and the evening cool and dry. The 8 megapixel camera was tripod mounted and triggered by IR remote. Exposure time of about 7 seconds was automatic, tungsten white balance, natural colour, 100 ASA, focal length about 50mm. Extra fine JPEG recording format.  2560 x 1920 pixels. (Web pics are low resolution 72 dpi)  In this photo the moon has a blurred image due to earth rotation during the camera exposure time. This may be explained as follows. [To observers rotating with the Earth, the moon appears to move along the Ecliptic at ~15 arc seconds per second. That amounts to 1/120th a moon diameter per second, or a full moon width (0.5°) every 2 minutes. The apparent direction of the moon's motion depends on which hemisphere you're in. The moon's apparent motion is real enough to smear its shape and blur its surface features when telescopes or long exposures enter the picture. Courtesy http://dpfwiw.com/moon.htm#motion] Therefore, during 7 seconds camera exposure, the moon has moved 7/120ths its diameter  nearly 6%. Small wonder the moon is blurred. The buildings did not move. Neither did the cone/delta shape. This raises a question. An object at 30,000 feet or less is within earth’s atmosphere and will fall due to gravity unless it is held aloft by some means that overcomes the force of gravity, such as wings on an aircraft. The photo shows that the delta/cone did not move in 6-8 seconds while the moon did. It follows that if the delta/cone image is about distant from earth as a jumbo jet and did not move relative to earth, it must have had some means to hold it stationary. Anti gravity technology is evident. Conversely, if the (image) object is so far distant that it may be in geo-stationary orbit (like some satellites that from earth appear as stars), then it is HUGE!",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

The wind was blowing pretty good so the clouds started coming together where I was looking at this thing. I fumbled in my purse for my disposable camera that I always carry with me but I didn't want to take my eyes off the sky. I finally had to because I couldn't find the darn thing in my purse.

Every nite we went on the balcony,3rd floor of the 3 storey building, to look at the moonrise and nite sky. My husband was on the balcony and as soon as I joined him, I looked out and saw a flashing lite off to my left coming off the point at Cape Canaveral which was about 10:00 with due East being 12:00 and about 30-40 degrees above the horizon. I of course assumed it was a plane but immediately noticed that the light was flashing more like a strobe lite. I was amazed at its speed, faster than any aircraft but slower than if it had been a meteorite; it also had a red flashing strobe light appearance simultaneously with the bright white strobe flashing.I ran downstairs to watch it at ground level. From the time I spotted the light, ran downstairs, and saw it again, it had moved across the horizon to where the moonrise had been the previous nite, approx at 2:30 with 12:00 being due East, and then was out of site. My husband had stayed on the 3rd floor and saw what I had seen and I rejoined him.  I then spotted another lite, identical to the first and starting in the same location. There were 2 more following behind it for a total of 4 including the first one. The subsequent three followed the exact path across the horizon with the same incredible speed and flashing bright white, red and occasional green strobe-like lights.  Then there appeared in the south east of the horizon an orange glowing orb  and the 3 rapidly moving flashing objects disappeared into the glowing orb. The orb then faded and an object of numerous colors came from this area and sped off at a high speed in a westerly projectory over the coastline and disappeared. My hushband pointed out that the lights seen resembled a frequency of brightness and color as seen from gaseous ionization.

Clear sky/no clouds … good visibility.  The two objects were first seen when directly overhead.  Visually appeared to be at a fairly high altitude.  Visually appeared to be traveling at a very fast speed towards the east and in a straight path.  There was absolutely no audible sound generated by the objects during the entire time. The objects traveled in ""formation"" keeping maybe one to two widths apart from one another.  One of the objects traveled slightly ahead of the other. The objects maintained one rounded end of the oval shape pointed in the direction of travel.  There were no trails behind them and no apparent lights shining out from any part of the objects.  One of the incredible aspects of these objects is that on one, maybe two brief instances, they smoothly and quickly changed/switched positions in the ""formation"" so that now the other object was slightly in the ""lead.)

This light appeared to burn green and streaked downward toward the horizon in a fast streak, changing to yellow as it fell.  This was much more vivid in color than any other meteor/shooting star that I have ever seen, but it did follow the same trajectory.  It was just much lower to the ground than anything that I have ever witnessed, and it was bright enough to be seen against other bright lights from the businesses at the interstate exchange including a convenience store, a closed heavy equipment company with many outside lights and one smaller convenience store as well as headlights from oncoming cars (I think two were coming at the time).

I've seen this object or craft many times throughout the years in 3 different locations where I've lived in Fredericksburg. Object appears high in the sky, appearing higher than most planes fly and definitely higher than any helicopter. (and moving FAR differently than those crafts.)  At a glance it appears to be just another star but if you set your eyes on it, you begin to notice movements not unlike that of an insect of some sort. It will start in one spot, hover around in circular motions and end up back in its original spot.  Although I've seen this object many times, tonight is the first night that I've noticed the lights. I always thought it was just putting off one beam that stayed in place but tonight I can see that the lights seem to be rotating around the object.  Very bright like the light from a large star but definitely not a star. I dont know anything about weather balloons or satelites but I dont think they operate like this. I just want to know if anyone else in the area has seen this.  The last thing I'd like to say is... a few years ago, I was living with my parents and saw this object (or one like it)early in the morning, about 2am. My dog began barking loudly and fiercely soon after I spotted it. Not barking at the object but something off in the woods almost directly under where the object was located. Needless to say, I was alarmed quite a bit. Soon after, he got worse.. howling and I looked in the direction he was barking and saw, from what I could tell, was a man running in some sort of metal armor but was so quick that he was gone within seconds.  About 3 days later, I got home and my dog had broken his chain and was gone from sight and didnt return. The next day, I went riding around to look to see if he had been hit by a car on the main road. Sure enough, it appeared he had been hit. The strange thing though is that, any time previously when he had gotten loose, he NEVER strayed nearly as far as where I found him. Maybe I'm just paranoid but my instinct told me that the night with the object and the barking had something to do with it.  So maybe i'm just paranoid but I'd love to hear from some other Virginia people about this. Thank you.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,38.28988855325914,-77.48740445151034

At exactly 11:00 P.M., I was driving home on Cheyenne street,(1 street away from my house) when I witnessed a flying disklike object hovering over the trees.  I stared in awe at the object because of its two very large, bright yellow lights symmetrically apart from each other, but definitely attached to the disklike object. I began to slow my truck down and pull onto the side of the road because it looked as if it were very close, almost as if it was going to land in the forest. I was in a rush to get home and seeing this object made me pull over because of it's size, lighting, and location it was hovering. It remained hovering for 2-3 minutes and suddenly vanished.

I was stopped in the right turn lane, two or three cars back from the stop bar looking east at the intersection of 38th St. and Pacific Ave. in Tacoma, WA.  It was approximately 4:40 p.m. and the weather was overcast with some sunbreaks but mostly low, billowy gray and white clouds and a light gray cover that completely obscured the Cascades and Mt. Rainier from my view.  As the traffic began to move, I saw a yellowish orb (shaped like a tic-tac from my vantage point.) exit a gray cloudbank to the north, and move at a constant velocity and altitude above what I presume were, the foothills of the Snoqualmie forest in the Enumclaw vicinity.  Within seconds of seeing the object, I made a quick glance to my right to make my turn onto Pacific Ave heading south. I looked to the east and fortunately I was able see it again, between the telephone poles, in about its last 1/3 of visible travel before it entered a white cloud bank to the south.  I had no time what so ever to try to grab my cell phone camera and miss the opportunity to witness and/or try to identify what I was seeing. I estimate the distance from my vantage point to the object at approximately 15 to 20 miles, (using Google Earth).  At that distance, I could not make out any surface features, hear any sound, or observe any contrails or changes in its color, shape, or trajectory.  When the object disappeared into the white cloudbank, I immediately looked at the clock in my truck, which is accurate to a minute or so.  It was 4:40 p.m.   I started to write down this info as I drove south down Pacific Ave.  From my vantage point with the hills visible behind it, the objects trajectory and size reminded me of one of many film clips I have seen countless times on television, of jet aircraft flying nearly nap of the earth, dropping ordinance with the desert hills in the background.  In contrast, less than 5 minutes down the road at the intersection of 72nd and Pacific, I looked up and saw a 727 looking jet liner very high in the sky, but obviously low enough to clearly recognize as an commercial aircraft.  I grew up in Lakewood WA, very close to McChord AFB.  I have observed many aircraft fly at varying altitudes around Tacoma for over 30 years.   I soloed a crusty Cessna C-150 at Shelton Airport in the summer of 1986.   I became proficient at recoqizing aircraft, especially F-16s, F-15s and F-18s by their vertical stabilizer orientation at very long distances.  I feel I would have recognized the profile of the object as a fighter jet or a light plane at that distance except that it travel much to fast to be a light plane.  Also, even though there may have been a break in the clouds, a glint from an aircraft windscreen does not look like a yellow orb.  Fighter Jets don’t fly along the Snoqualmie Forest.  My conclusions are that it was either:  1) Ball Lighting 2) Super secret Boeing aircraft developed over the decades from captured Nazi plans and prototypes. 3) An example of the yellowish appearing, cigar / orb shape UFO seen and filmed throughout recent history.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

After about 20 minutes, I noticed it had not really moved, but now seemed to be flashing in someway, so I figured it was just a helicopter hovering, then again I wondered why it was there for so long. One thing I know for sure, it was not a star, and I’ve been gazing at the stars since I was a kid using my telescope. Upon arriving home I saw nothing more of it, but here is where it gets interesting. My 12 year old daughter was coming back from a birthday event in Newton (at aprox 10pm), she and 3 other kids, along with the mother saw a ""very bright"" light and it seemed to be near them, perhaps following them (of course this was according to the kids being that the mom was driving and could not tell for sure).  Ok, so my 12 year old daughter pulled out her 7.1mp camera and took several photos of this object. The first one is ""very interesting"" (you be the judge), but the next few photos were not so great, (i.e. look like a photo of a star perhaps).  I wanted to send both photos your way just in case you felt it was news worthy.  Again, I did not see the object as clearly as my daughter did, but her photo seems to look alot like a ""UFO"", well at least from there perspective, it was an Unidentified Flying Object, right?  Please review the photos and let me know what you think?  Thanks.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,35.5779,-81.1677

Sighting approx. 3 minutes; return path 1 1/2 hr. later On Monday, 17 Sept, 2007, myself, my husband, and two of our out of state {W. VA} friends were at our pond on our property in Southwest Virginia, bordering Hawkins County, TN. We had fished for a couple of hours, then built a fire, had some supper, and eventually gathered the lawn chairs around the fire and played music. The other three were all picking various acoustic instruments, while I sat back listening, watching the sky occasionally, and enjoying the music for an hour or so. I stretched out, and just looked over my left shoulder while flexing my neck muscles. A bright yellow orange light caught my eye, coming from the north over Clinch Mt., and moving in an easterly direction. I immediately sat up, turning toward it. It was stationary at first, then moved forward slowly, hovered, and then moved back again to its original position. I knew then it was not a plane. I grabbed my husbands knee, as he was picking a banjo, and pointed to the object. He looked and stopped playing immediately after watching for just a couple of seconds. He then told our friends, who were sitting with their backs to the object, to ""stop now, and get a look at this"". It was that quickly apparent that this was out of the ordinary. The time was approximately 23:15, on a clear night, no clouds, and no background lights, as we live in the country.  We watched this light go in a controlled yet occasionally erratic pattern for about three minutes. At one point, it went from a 1 or 2 o'clock position, to a 7 o'clock position, then back. It would hover, then go forward slowly, deliberately, and had occasional almost jerking movements back to its previous hovering point, then jumping ahead slightly, and then moving smoothly.  I had a Nikon D50 with me, and a Hitachi digital dvd camera. Neither of them would work. They both had fully charged Li ion batteries. [I had both of these present, and fully charged, to record some of our annual get-together music]. I was very surprised about my digital SLR, as I quickly changed settings, wondering why it would not work, as I had taken several shots previous to this sighting. I tried to just fire the flash of the camera, to see if there would be a reaction of some sort from the object. The flash would not fire. I was torn between trying to figure this out, knowing I'd be missing part of what this object was doing. I tried the the video cam...nothing. It would not record. I put them both down, deciding to just watch, while mentally cursing the manufacturers of what I thought was fairly good digital equipment.  By this time, the object was halfway between Clinch Mt. and Pine Ridge. We continued watching its movement, fairly slow, deliberate, with occasional moments of hovering, until it could no longer be seen over Pine Ridge. No blinking lights were seen by three witnesses. The fourth thought he might have seen a blinking red light, but not at all times. There was absolutely no sound. The estimated time of sighting is three minutes. I knew something extraordinary had been seen, and we were all fascinated, not really knowing what to think, except that it was definitely not a plane or helicopter.  About 1 1/2 hours later, we were still around the campfire, still playing music. I was listenening, still watching the sky occasionally. The approximate time was 00:45. What I believe to be the same object came around again, this time from the south, traveling north. Easy to see, and still absolutely no sound, and definitely no blinking lights. Same bright yellow orange color. The movement this time was just as slow, though not as erratic. Short periods of hovering were observed intermittently, then a continuation of a fairly straight path. This second pass took about two to two and one half minutes to cover the area, where it disappeared over Clinch Mountain. We all agreed that this was the same object seen earlier. After this, we called it a night and came home.  While the event occurred, it seemed to me personally that I was seeing it, yet at the same time not really believing that this was something I could not explain. Just remarkable; I really can not find the perfect word. Totally amazing falls a bit short.  For informational purposes, about 5 minutes later, I picked up the Nikon to see if I could take a shot; it worked perfectly, still showing a full battery charge.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

She yelled downstair's to me to come and see what she had described to me as to what her and her sister had seen.  I ran outside with her only to see nothing.  She said it was right over our barn.  I was not skeptical of her because i do believe there is life out there, i just wished i could see for myself  a U.F.O.  So I stared at the sky for about 10 minutes, then all of a sudden a huge orange light followed by four more consecutive lights appeared due West of our farm.  When the fifth one came on they all shut off and as soon as they all shut off they started again only maybe two ship lengths ahead. (I am calculating ship length by the length of the five lights together).  At the end of the second array of lights I observed two individual lights (at what i will call the front and back of the craft).  I observed these lights for about half an hour.  In that time they turned color,(from red and back to a dull white to disappearing altogether. At one point it appeared to shoot out a wide angle light on it's southern pointed light).  At this point now i had started to notice several airplanes.  It is uncommon for me to see this kind of commercial traffic.  Two in particular were a pair of blinking lights coming out of the south.  One was following the other in a very close proximity.  There were no green or red lights, only a single blinking white light on what i think were two fighter planes flying in formation.  They were flying in a north westernly direction and soon turned due west.  I don't know if one turned his lights off but the one in the rear over took the one in front and it became only one light.  I watched that light fly right under the ""two lights"" that i thought were a craft and kept on going till it was out of sight.  I also observed several satellites which is also uncommon.  I am an intelligent person and am aware of! all mil itary and commercial aircraft.  I do not make rash decisions and I think before I speak.  I am not saying that this craft was from outerspace,  what i am saying is that if this craft was human made it would be as long as roughly 15 747's and equally as wide. This was unlike anything i have ever seen.  It was not a commercial airline or strange gasses in the sky,  these were five lights that came on and then went off and moved without sound.  The airplanes observed made sound, this did not.  I know what I saw and i would laugh at the governmen if they said it was a weather balloon!!!!",2007-10-08T00:00:00,42.9596,-95.0199

I turned around and did'nt see anything.I asked him what it was he saw and he told me that he saw a pulsating light beyond the trees. I knew he saw something because he's never reacted that way before. About a minute or two later, for no reason at all i turned around and looked at a clearing through the pine trees and looked up. There was a bright light up in the sky and a dimmer light underneath it. It was over tree top level. Maybe 100ft to 175ft high. Just as i saw the lights they both started to go dim until they just went out completely. I could see a black form moving very slow above trees but couldn't make it out due to so many trees in the way. It made absolutely no noise what so ever. About a minute later we heard what at first was the sound of a plane, but as the sound came closer it was definately a helecopter. I told my friend that i'll bet him the helecopter was following that object in the sky. Sure enough it flew right above us and towards the same direction as the flying object went. We both just stared as each other and i said to him if this really happen? Nevertheless after this experience, we went to sleep for the night. I hate to admit it, but i was a little nervous that night because i figured that the flying object would come back later that night.....to my knowldge it didn't....P.S.The day before this happened we were invited to a camp fire get together and i over heard the camp host that he had seen a ufo all lite up the night before......posssibly what we saw......can you keep me posted if anyone else has seen anything peculiar at hawley lake? thanks..! ........ .",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

Through my windshield, up ahead I saw what I thought was a jumbo jet in the sky.  It was metallic and very reflective.  Larger than ""normal"".  I didn't notice it moving in any direction so I assumed it was going straight ahead or away from me. It was in my sight for a good 10 seconds and I noticed something looked a little ""weird"".  I reached over to my radio to turn down the volume, momentarily taking my eyes off the road and the object, and the object was gone!  At first I thought it merely changed direction and stopped reflecting the sun.  But upon closer inspection it was simply gone.  There was no way it flew out of my line of sight because there was nowhere the object could've went to.  It was a clear twilight sky on a straight highway!  I immediately called my girlfriend to explain the whole thing.  During the conversation, for a moment, I clearly saw a ""streak"" going up and to the west. That's it!

The strange thing is that it disappeared the moment I got this strange sensation that something was amiss (probably influence from my previous sighting years ago).  Then it was gone!  30 seconds later I'm on my cell phone and I saw a streak in the sky (extremely fast.  Hardly perceptible). I'm not sure what else to say.  So I guess that's it.

The  sky was clear around the object with dark clouds on the horizon. The object was of a large glowing white sphere shape.  As we looked, the middle main lights of the object stood still while it was turning and spinning lights around its edges.  I would say that its edges were shining and spitting somewhat like a ""4th of July"" sparkler would be shooting/sending out lights.  After we watched for about 25 to 30 seconds, all the lights went out at once and the object disappeared before our eyes.   I made a quick grab for my binoculars and looked around the entire clear sky but could not find any dark object whatsoever.  This object never moved from that spot nor made a sound (that we could hear) while we watched. We have lived in this same condo unit for 19 years and have seen many planes and helicopters fly over the water every day and night, but we have never seen another object like what we saw on this night.

It was around 5:20pm when I was leaving work to go home. As I was going around toward the driver's side of my car, I happened to look upward at the sky. It was then that I saw two round disks or saucer shaped objects gliding through the air side by side. They did not move any faster than if you were watching a bird fly against the wind. They appeared to be very dark in color, not reflecting any light from the sun which was now setting at the horizon. The two disks were gliding side by side with only what seemed like a yard or two of space apart. They glided over the two story building that I worked at, traveling west to east making no audible noise that I could hear over the sound of traffic nearby. I was trying hard to make some sense of what I was seeing. Not birds...not balloons...certainly not any conventional airplanes. Perhaps, they were very large round kites that got away from someone who was testing them out. But, there was hardly any wind at all. What is keeping them a float and moving along steady without much wind, I thought.  Satisfied with the idea of some new kite invention that went astray, I unlocked and opened my car door.  Before getting in, I looked upward once more just in time to see the two disk shaped objects begin tumbling through the air and then occasionally spinning around each other at a very rapid rate of acceleration and then in opposite directions. Obviously, this was a complete shock. Despite the crazy tumbling and rapid acceleration of spining around each other, the disks avoided a collision as though there was some kind of invisible force field that kept them from hitting each other. ALL the while, they still maintained a steady course in an easterly direction. This sighting took place in no more than one minute before it passed out of view behind nearby trees. I would put the height of these objects at the same height you would see most small planes fly. I would give my best judgement that the diameter of these twin disk if at ground level could have been between 9 to 11 feet. The last few seconds of this sighting convinced me that these objects were controled by some kind of advanced technology, because of the unusual accelerations and manuvers of the objects. Possibly, a new generation of nerds working on a special project for a start up company may be behind this. Time will tell!",2007-11-28T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

However, it was impossible to tell how far from me the objects were because of the intensity of the lights. Each object had the same kind of lights; that is,  three very bright lights organized in a triangular shape. I observed these lights for about a minute or so until the lights of one object faded into darkness like the fade in a movie leading from one scene to the next; a minute or so later the other object's light's faded into darkness in the same way the lights of the first object faded. About 30 seconds thereafter, a new light came into view slightly to the west of where the lights of the other two objects faded. Then a second object appeared to the east of the lighted object and then a third light appeared. I immediately woke up my wife, and she observed the three lights. Within a few minutes, the lights of one object faded, then the lights of the second object faded and then the lights faded on the third object. The skyline was dark for about a minute then each object appeared again, about 30 seconds apart. At one point there was five objects (maybe six as I veiewed in a kind of mild astonishment. Three of the five objects appeared to be next to each other and the other two above the other three. I started to toy with the idea that the I was observing one object with different lighting sections. This was a distinct possibility but I can not be certain one way or the other. The whole situation lasted about twenty minutes. At no time was there significant movement of the lighted objects, but there was definitely slight movement. The objects stayed hovered in the same area with lights fading in an out. The fading of the lights did not suggest the object moved away at a fast speed. The lights were either turned off or  covered over by clouds. I would vote for turned off. But I can tell you this for absolute certain: the lights were very bright and they must have been observed by many people. I could find nothing in the newspapers about it. So I got on Google to do a serach under the caption: Strange lights over coast of San Clemente. Ultimately my search lead me to this website and the posting of the above description.

I wanted to share with you what happened to me last night. I live in a cabin in the woods in a fairly rural area. Last night, just before I was about to retire, about midnight, I went outside. When I do so afterdark I usually carry a flashlight and shine it just long enough to make sure that there are no snakes in my path, as we do have a few types of vipers here, including the quiet and lazy copperheads that would just let you step on them before they would move. A rattlesnake would make it's presence known....... anyway, I am digressing. When I turned the flashlight out I quickly noticed that there was another light source coming from over my head. It was quite bright, bright enough to leave very distinct shadows on the ground from the leaves on the trees. I noticed that the light source was moving, and looked up in the direction from which it seemed to be coming. Flying quite slowly, and very quietly, directly coming from behind my cabin there was an orb about the size of a beachball. It was a vivid golden color, and it flew nearly as low as a crop-duster airplane. It shone a light that was most definitely aimed directly at me. After it had passed over me for a very short distance it turned off the light, and it simply disappeared. There was never any sound whatsoever from it as it passed and then vanished into the dark of the night. I have a friend that is currently staying here with me, so I came back inside the cabin and told him about what had just occurred. He quickly came back outdoors with me. We both heard a sonic boom far off into the distance as I was giving him the details about the object's trajectory. I do not know if that was related to the orbs flight. Needless to say, my retirement plants were dashed. I was just a wee bit too excited to go to bed. I would like to add here that I am in no way an U.F.O. fanatic. I'm not even an x-files fan, for that matter but, I have pretty much always believed that there must be other intelligent life forms in the universe, and that they may very likely have visited our little planet in the past, and still do so in this day and age. Nevertheless, I had not expected to have such an up-close and personal experience, as personal as I would ever like that to be. It was directly spotlighting me from an overhead distance of perhaps two to three-hundred feet. That, good enough for me, thank you! Anyway......

Moving stars that lost their light and reappeared.,Seminoe Lake,WY,2006-06-14T23:00:00,unknown,15 minutes,"Occurred : 6/14/2006 23:00  (Entered as : 06/14/06 23:00) Reported: 6/18/2006 9:58:07 PM 21:58 Posted: 7/16/2006 Location: Seminoe Lake (near Rawlins), WY Shape: Unknown Duration:15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51009.html,"Moving stars that lost their light and reappeared. I love to watch the night sky pretty much anywhere I go.  I am educated on what jets, stars, planets, meteors, and satellites appear as in the night sky.  I have never seen anything like what I had saw that night.  It was a beautiful night, not one cloud in the sky, so what I had seen was in plain view and was not obstructed in any way.  I was looking up at the sky frequently because there were many meteors in the sky.  Then something struck me as odd; a faint star, but it wasn't twinkling like a star should, so I thought it was a planet, but I noticed similar ones close by it.  That struck me as odd because I had never seen so many that close to eachother.  Suddenly, one just stopped emitting light, and I could see it move away while its light was fading until it became too dark to see any more.  It moved very smoothly.  The others soon quit emitting light (seperately) as well, although I could see that only a couple had moved like the first.  This is when I got my mom's attention.  I took her away from the glare of the fire and told her to look where I had been looking.  She soon saw what I had seen and grabbed her boyfriend to see.  I began to look where the things had moved in the sky.  I caught sight of what may have been the same ones that had started emitting their lights again, or completely new ones.  I hadn't noticed one particularly bright one (not twinkling) forming a pentagon with the cup portion of the big dipper.  The first faded sightings didn't give me enough proof within my own thoughts to label them UFOs, but this one shook me.  When it was emitting light, it was completely motionless.  It stopped emitting light like the others, but that one was so bright, it probably took a full second for it to completely fade out.  It began moving away from its position as soon as it stopped emitting light, and for that split second of fading light, I could clearly see structure.  I have absolutely no doubt that that structure was emitting the light I had mistaken for a bright planet and that it moved on its own accord.  They could not have been stars because they were not twinkling.  They could not have planets because they were too many, they turned off, and they moved.  They could not have been jets because they did not blink, and they were motionless for a long time.  They could not have been satellites because they had stopped emitting lights for a long time, and they were motionless.  They could not have been meteors because they could last for a matter of minutes, as opposed to a few seconds.  Once again, I am educated about what shines in the sky.  My mom, the other witness, was the one who had taught me these things.  I am 17 years old.  My mom is in her thirties and is an eighth grade teacher.  I don't lie and I don't mislead.  Also, just so you know, there was no alchohol in that portion of the trip and I wouldn't drink it anyway.  I usually doubt myself about things like this, but it was so blatant.  With all the information at hand, I have come up with three theories.  The one that would not go beyond what is normally accepted as normal would be that, for some reason, there were many planets out that night, and that there were clouds that I hadn't noticed.  Then those clouds, blown by the fast winds of Seminoe, blocked those planets; maybe creating some sort of optical illusion that the planets were moving.  This is unlikely because I am sure that there were no clouds out that night and once the things stopped giving off light, they disappeared for good.  Also, because they were so close together, it is unlikely that a tiny cloud could blot them out one at a time.  My second theory is one that is always considered when you think see things like this; visitors.  Their ships were in or just outside our atmosphere, using either their own powerful lights, or reflecting the light from the sun (much like the moon and the planets do) to create the illusion that they are only stars.  My final theory has to do with a state of the art government spying weapon.  This would be the perfect spying tool.  Our enemies would never think that the stars were spying on them.  If these things were man-made, one can only hope that they are those of our own government, and not an enemy's.  I hope I have made things as clear as they can be made on paper and helped you do whatever it is that you do. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

ON January 1st 2008 at approximately 11 am. in Santa Barbara California I noticed a bright object in the sky at about 75 degrees above ground level if one were to consider 90 degrees directly overhead. Weather conditions were bright and clear with blue skies and some very patchy, high, thin, hazy and mostly transparent clouds. The clouds were not as high as cirrus clouds but they appeared quite high and were much higher than what one would call coastal haze. The brightness of the object caught my attention through the window as it was quite intense somewhat like a bright star at night or the landing lights on a plane at dusk. This was however quite out of the ordinary as it was a very bright sunny day. The object also appeared to be still in the sky. After staring at it for a while and asking my friend to take a look and tell me what he thought it might be  I went outside for a better view. I was visiting my friend and asked it he had any binoculars but he didn’t so I was left to scrutinize the object with my naked eyes. I am a visual artist and an avid birder so my observation skills are fairly strong. It was to the north of my position and the sun would have been to the south east. The object was moving in a straight line from east to west very slowly. I could observe that it was traveling just beneath the high clouds as it would occasionally dip slightly into them. When I was viewing it through the some what dirty window I noticed that it would disappear and then reappear with the same intensity. I thought that perhaps it was becoming obscured by the clouds. However when seen from outside the house I could see that when it was not shining with a bluish light it would turn completely black as in pure black and not at all grayish as it might have been if there were some atmospheric interference. In it’s black phase I got the impression that it was shaped somewhat like a very shallowly curved fingernail clipping with the con caved side down, the convex side up and pointed on the ends. I am not an aviation expert but I believe I could safely say that no conventional aircraft could fly that slowly except for an ultra light and I don’t think that ultra lights fly at such high altitudes. There was an airliner flying above it and it’s rate of movement across the sky was much faster than object in question even thought the air liner was at a much higher altitude. I considered that if it were an ultra light the top side of the wing might be made of a highly reflective material such as a blue tinted mylar while the bottom was either non reflective or simply not catching the light. In that case it would have had to be changing it’s degree of tilt in relation to my point of observation in order to cause the on and off effect. However it’s trajectory looked straight, slow and steady. When lighted it seemed to be emitting light just like a bright star but I wondered if it might not simply be reflecting the sun. As the object moved far into the west and eventually went out of sight it continued to appear as thought the light were emitted from it. Im not sure if anything could change it’s position that much relative to my point of observation and still reflect the sun with the same intensity directly to my eyes. I have never seen anything like it and I’ll be watching for other reports about it.

This is a daily ritual for me on the weekdays before I start work in the area. The sun had risen, and there were a few light clouds. There was no wind. The area is in the flight path of jets landing at Orlando International Airport, which is approximately 10 miles to the south. I was staring out over the lake when I looked up and noticed a black form flying towards the lake from the west. At first I thought it was a large bird such as a vulture or eagle circling over the lake. The object was dark, big, silent, and was not traveling at a high rate of speed. As I examined it more closely, I could see that it was not a bird. The object descended, and for a moment, I thought it could be someone parachuting into town, but I didn't see any evidence of a person beneath the object. It stopped descending and began to slowly fly to the northeast, towards the Casselberry area. Despite the object being very dark, the rear of the object reflected in the newly risen sun as it flew out of sight. There are some cypress trees by the lake, which obscured my view of the object as it flew away. When it was shining in the sun, it appeared to be spherical - I'm not sure if the object actually changed shape as I watched it, or if I had misjudged its shape when I first noticed it. A few strange things about the object: It seemed to be flying low. It was difficult to determine its exact shape. It was completely silent. It seemed big, but I was unable to determine its size without a nearby sufficient frame of reference. The moon was still visible in the sky - if I had to compare it to the moon, I'd say that it wasn't big enough to have obscured the moon had it flown over it. Also, it seemed to appear from the west - it was just there over the lake somewhat suddenly, but it's possible that nearby trees obscured it from my view. My only thoughts on what it might have been is a balloon, but not a hot-air balloon. It seemed to be following a definite flight path - not randomly being carried by air currents and ascending and descending. Also, the shape seemed to be off. I'm wondering if anyone else saw this object today. It flew towards a very busy road during morning rush hour traffic - Highway 436 in Winter Park - when I lost sight of it.

I have nicknamed this light ""flying silk"" because it moves across the sky at a seemingly effortless pace that I would estimate to be about 400MPH.  It emits no noise that I have ever heard, it has no strobes, nor aircraft navigation lights of any kind that I have ever observed.

I thought it was a cluster bomb or cruise missles at first until I saw the entity looked connected/swarming and to be composed of black triangles. We saw dull red lights blink on the perimeter of it and it seemed to change shape between a rotating triangular mass and then rectangular with imperfect corners. It flew silently and the sun was just setting so there was plenty of light and the sky was completely clear. It was as high up in the sky as a fighter jet and about the size of a football field. We tried to take a picture of it but it didn't show up on the phone. Triangular specks kept coming off of it and then would catch up to it as well. The mass hovered parallel to the horizon slowly and drifted off however relative to its size it was moving extremely fast. Another person I was with said it faded away at a much different time as I continued to see it with another person. It did resemble a balloon or parachute at times until it would break apart into a triangular pattern. I would estimate the entire mass was made of between 60-70 triangles.

I said whats wrong and he says ""Tell me what that is."" pointing to the sky over the treetops.

The balls of light were on the edge of whatever it was to form a circle so it appeared. It fluttered around like a frisby or like a leaf falling to the ground or something blowing in the wind (seemed unstable). It would dissapear into the trees then reappear above them for a few minutes at a time at treetop level. We at first thought maybe it's a toy or something but then it rose very slowly thousands of feet up into the cloud cover then came back down then dissapeared into the trees. We then were perplexed by it. We waited for it to come back up but it never did so we went back plowing. I again though on the opposite side saw it popback up and hover in the same area as did my friend. Then it slowly rose up into cloud cover then was faintly visible then dissapeared into the night. I attempted video of it on my camera phone but the light from the school blocked it out so the background just looks black. I know what a plane's lights look like I know what a satelite looks like it was not any of this.

It was very clear and moving fast.  Then I noticed another object flying in an exact opposite path that appeared to be a bit lower.  Its lights weren’t as bright as the planes but it had the same shape and size.  It looked like one object with a light on the nose, wingtips, and tail.  The tail light was red and the others where white.  I thought it was another plane until it moved sideways as it was going forward.  Not turning with the front light staying in front but more like drifting.  It also didn’t make a sound.  By now the jet was long gone.   This really caught my attention.  As it moved away, the lights on either side began to move inward into a single file line, still moving forward with the entire line shifting to the right all at once and continuing on its forward path.  I watched it for a few more seconds and then  it just vanished.  No noise was ever heard from the object. I am a 36 year old male.  My wife and I own a karate school and a cabinet shop.

The sphere then paused again and seemed to remain in its new location, for the remainder of the sighting. I had viewed it through the telescope also which made it that much more clear, only to reveal a spherical shape just completely covered in this constant changing, almost electrical light. It was blue,purple,red,yellow, green, and it just kept cycling through these colors over and over again. To be more precise on the shape, it looked exactly like the big Epcot center ball(with the same outer texture or paneling,whatever) in Disney World, just bigger and luminescent. I also found it pretty peculiar that at no time during this sighting was there even a trace of any other aircraft in the sky, and the air traffic is usually constant.

It looked, from what I could see, to be just a dark black surface- no lights on the object but with clear lines defining its triangle shape against the lighted surface of the moon.  About 5 minutes later another black triangle moved over the moon's surface from bottom to top.  This second black triangle moved much quicker, about a second or less, with the same black surface and clear lines.  Approximately 3 minutes later, another black object moved diagonally across the upper left hand side of moon's surface from left to right, very quickly, faster than the first two objects.  The third object was moving so fast that it looked to be more like a sphere, but with the same deep black color.  It was the color that I could clearly see against the moons surface.  All three objects had clear lines against the backdrop of the moon and dissapeared once they had passed the moons surface.  The first two objects had a clear delineated shape of a triangle against the moon's surface.  The third object was more of a definate color, a deep black against the moon, but not having as clear of a shape as the first two, due to its' was moving so fast.  The first two objects were the same size, the third looked a little smaller. I am currently a graduate student in psychology.  I couldn't sleep that night-but I was awake and lucid. I had been up around that time for the past three days writing papers.  I had gotten used to being up and awake around that time, so I wasn't surprised that I was awake.  It takes me a couple of days to get back to sleeping normally after I finish a big project.  Since I was up, I decided to take out my telescope and enjoy the full moon.  I had been looking at the moon, trying different lenses, trying to find different landmarks for about 10 minutes or so when I saw the first black triangle.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

At first I thought it was a bird, but it was approximately 10-15,000 feet up, and I quickly realized two things; one, I probably would not be able to see a bird that far up from the ground, and two, it was moving way too fast to be a bird, even with the heavy winds in the area. I watched the object as it crossed the sky, and realized that it was on a straight trajectory to the North, at a very high rate of speed. The thought came into my head that it must be a Military Fighter Jet, however as I lost sight of it, I realized that given the speed it was traveling, I should have heard some type of sound....there was none. One of my co-workers was also on break at the time, and noticed me looking to the sky. She looked up and saw the object as I did, and wondered if it was a jet. I told her that I wasn't sure, given that there was no noise. I may not be an aerospace engineer, but I have been to every Muskegon Air Fair since the age of 5, and I know that you can still hear the jet engines of a Military Fighter Jet as far up as 25-30,000 feet.

About a week and a half ago I had an orb sighting.  It was a silver ball and there were lots of chemtrails around. I was on 23rd and 6th ave in new york city.  I watched it float for about ten seconds until i lost it behind a building.  There was no chemtrail activity for a week, but then today there was a ton.  And today I had my camera.  I was taking pictures pretty much all day from my apartment living room.  The first out of the ordinary thing I saw was a black plane, flying right to left, along the path of an already laid chemtrail.  This trail then became twisted like a dna strand.  I then moved and went into my bedroom and sat on the window sill with my computer.  About 5 or ten minutes later I saw a bright light hovering in the middle of the 'X' of two trails.  I had to run to my living room to get my camera and then pointed it at the light asap.  I don't know what happened, but my camera didn't pick up the light, but it did get the plane ""appearing"" out of nothing.  I think it was ""cloaked"" because there are very faint geometric distortions, like in the predator movies.  Frame by frame the object moves very oddly.  The camera is shaky becasue i was trying to step out onto the fire escape.  Once i was out the object had already started flying to my right, so i ran inside to my living to get another angle.  I got a few seconds of it. Next sighting was the same sort of thing, but this time the light was MUCH more intense.  I say on camera that it looks like a flashlight.  I couldn't figure out if it was star or not.  It was soo bright though and it looked like it had an aura around it.  And it didn't flicker at all. My camera had trouble focusing on it and at times and it look very much like a disc shaped ufo when it lost focus. It hovered there for about 30 minutes, but it slowly drifted lower and to the right and finally behind a building so i couldnt see it anymore. I had almost decided that it was jsut a star until this same bright light emerged from behind the building and started over my head to the right. It wasnt traveling very fast and it had no blinking lights at all. in fact it was just one light. I could make out all the airplanes, and in fact one flies right by the orb light and you can clearly tell the difference. When it was going over my head it took on sort of a bird like shape but still was just a light... this one didn't turn into an airplane like the fisrt one did. I live on Orchard and Stanton streets in New York City. My living room faces north and my bedroom to the west.

Last night, shortly after midnight I witnessed what I can only describe as a UFO. The area I live is in the very northwest corner of Seattle. In the immediate vicinity there are many lights at play fields, schools, and all along the Highway 99 and I-5 corridors. The light pollution is intense, plus add to that the very bright street lights along most of the streets allow for very few stars to be seen, even on the clearest nights. It was mostly clear last night, with some light cloud cover.  It was windy and fairly chaotic with much traffic noise. At approximately 12:15 AM an object traveling northbound in the sky caught my attention very quickly. There was no noise emitted that I could hear over the wind and traffic, but it seemed close enough that it should have given some report. Initially, I was not paying attention, but caught the movement in my peripheral. I generally pay attention to air traffic, which usually goes from the north to south (Sea-Tac), or east/north east to the south west (Renton?). This object was heading what appeared to be directly north, which usually only occurs when a Coast Guard helicopter is flying along the I-5 corridor.  My first thought was it must be a shooting star.. an enormous shooting star. But the light intensity stayed exactly the same and the path it traveled appeared perfectly straight never varying or arching in the slightest. The reason I thought it was a meteor was because the velocity - it traveled very fast. My view of the east sky is limited on the south and north by large trees and houses. The clear area in which the object was visible runs a good length between the trees, I guess maybe twenty to thirty degrees of unbroken sky. It traveled almost the entire length - from when I took notice and raised my head - to the tree on the north end in a couple seconds. I attempted to follow the path beyond the tree to see if it continued but lost sight, perhaps because my contacts were so dry it forced me to blink repeatedly.  The object itself was a bright light, light yellow in color. I thought it was white at first, but I think there was some yellow in it. It was a circle, maybe a bit oval in shape. I wasn't sure if it was my dry contacts, but it appeared to have left a short tail behind it, like a comet. Like previously stated, I could not hear any sounds emitted from the object. The size of the light was much larger than any airplane lights, helicopter light, or shooting star that I have ever witnessed. The entire incident lasted about 3 seconds. I saw no deviation from a straight path heading due north, maybe north and slightly east. It appeared to be descending, although that may have been it traveling away from my position. If I had to venture a guess based on size where it was flying over I would say somewhere over the north end of Lake Washington, maybe farther east.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

Usually, comes about 20 till 11 and leaves about 11:30. While filming, it also seems to come straight at the camera, then descipate into a starburst or large shadow. You can also see shadows on the video of it zipping by. It comes down and hovers above a tree line on top of a hill across from my sisters house. I discovered it while taking my dog outside for a walk before going to bed. I called to my two sisters to come see. They have no clue what it is. We showed the film to my brother-in-lAW when he came home from work.He has no idea what it is either.I have filmed it about 4 times in 2 weeks.

First I thought it must be Jupiter or Venus, but then I saw that it was drifting slowly northward.  A big, bright light moving to the north: this could not have been a planet or a bright star.  Some might suggest that I saw an airplane; I can only say that all of the airplanes I’ve seen flying at night typically have flickering lights spaced apart from one another on each wing, whereas the object last night was one solid, extremely luminous ball of light.  Others might suggest that it was a satellite, but all of the satellites I have seen in my life have not been nearly so luminous as this object.  Most importantly, neither hypothesis can explain the sudden disappearance of the object.  I have been curious about UFOs all of my life, but this was only the second time I’ve ever seen anything anomalous (the first time was insignificant: probably just a balloon).  For a while I stared out my window, hoping it would come back again.  But (alas!) it was gone.  I only saw it for about 10 seconds before it vanished.  Perhaps someone else in the Portland area saw it, too.  I want to go to McMinnville this weekend to hear you speak, but I don’t have any way to get there.  Greyhound doesn’t go out there on weekends.  Perhaps next time.  That is all.  Thank you for your time and the fine work you do.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

I thought maybe that's what I had seen, but I remeber that the object was hovering, which a jet can't do.  I was kind of puzzled because nothing like this had happened to me before.  I know that it wasn't a helicopter and I know that it wasn't a jet.  What I saw?  I don't know, but I figured someone else may have seen it also.

In the corner of my eye I saw a light appear, thinking it was a shooting star I turned and looked.  It was in the southern sky on a clear night, I quickly focused my eyes on the light.  Immediately I came to the conclusion that the light wasn’t a shooting star but rather something else.  The light grew brighter for about 3 to 4 seconds, resembling a car light coming closer.  The light was not very large; it started about the size of a star and grew brighter.  I asked my date what she thought the growing light could be, she was uncertain but was quick to believe it must be an airplane.  I too thought it might be an airplane because that would be the most logical explanation.  Once the light stopped growing brighter it was motionless for a split second and then began to move from right to left in the sky.  It started on a straight course, which made me think it really was a plane or satellite but then the light began to shuffle up and down.  Moving unlike anything I have seen before.  Immediately when it began moving up and down I told my date it was a UFO.  I asked her, isn’t that a UFO? She was very scarred and reluctant to admit something like that, but once she saw the light move in the way it did she too said it must be unidentified flying object.  It moved across the sky fast, moving oddly for about 4 seconds the light vanished into the sky.  It seemed to disappear from the sky with no trace of it ever being there.

My observing partner was engrossed in watching the storm and had not noticed this object coming right at us. I called his attention to it. “Is that a balloon?” he said. My thought exactly. But, we both quickly realized this object was moving very fast, and in a straight line. “Could a balloon move in a straight line that fast?” I said. We both quickly concluded that did not seem plausible to us. We each looked at our cell phones. It was 8:40 p.m. When the object passed over us we saw a different shape. It had looked round while coming toward us. As it passed overhead we saw it looked like a capital B laying on its side. And, as it passed overhead it tilted slightly to the south showing a streak of gray, but the color was flat, not reflective.

As it passed over us a second one follwing a same parallel path about 40 meters difference approached and passed over us.  Unlike the first object that went over our heads, the second one was more off of the road so we got to see it more from the side.  It seemed to have a slight more of a rounding at the front and tapered slightly like a tear drop point at the rear.  I estimate that it was roughly 1 kilometer in the air.

The entire object was illuminated, there was no single point of light or flashing lights, it was fairly bright and consistent all around the object making it seemingly glow.

Exact incident in Singapore I left work at 7:30pm on Monday and walked up Larchmont Blvd in Los Angeles.  When I got to the intersection of Larchmont and Melrose I noticed the sky lighting up towards the east.  One block east of me is Paramount Pictures and I figured it was filming (battle scenes for Transformers have been shot all over LA the past 2 months).  But the light got brighter and when I looked up I saw three things shooting down from the sky.  I clearly remember seeing green, purple, and a white/blueish color.  It got so bright I closed my eyes and it hit the floor.  Power on that street shut down (and just that street).  The floor shook and I remember hearing what sounded like an electrical voltage sound.  Besides Paramount Pictures, the area around me is mostly residential, including the section of Melrose that the light hit.  I saw several people walk outside to see what it was.  I also noticed that some cars stopped dead as if they ran out of power. About 2 minutes later I saw the LAPD arrive but they had no sirens on... just lights and they were don't anything.  The cop cars (3 of them) just stopped in the middle of the street and the police officers just stood on the street outside the main entrance of Paramount looking at eachother.  Cars continued to drive up and down the street.  My bus arrived about 5 minutes later and I saw the cops and leaving and several black cars showing up.  I also heard some kind of aircraft in the sky.  Once before I had seen a black helicopter in the sky that only let off a humming noise instead of the usual noise helicopters make.  Although I looked around I didn't see anything. When I got home (Wilshire & Western) I told my roomate that something wierd had happened and told him of what came out of the sky and he said he saw the same thing from outside our building.  He said he was texting someone from inside his truck and noticed lights.  He specifically recalled seeing 3 beams of light and seeing green.  He blow it off as electrical transformers blowing up (LA had a Santa Ana winds kicking up that day).  But from my angle and view, no electrical transformer could ever be has high as I saw those lights. Something we both noticed a short time later were hazmat trucks driving towards Paramount. Nothing on the news reported what I saw.  When I looked on the Craigslist, there was no talk to mention of what we saw.  And I know there were other witnesses because not only did I see people walk out of the restuarants and homes, but because it was in the middle of Los Angeles. The next day local news still had not reported anything, neither had the LA Times or yahoo. Today I found a story that on Sunday in Singapore people reported the exact same thing I saw.  3 beams of light or fire, most mentioned they saw green.  And the wierdest and scariest part that my roomate pointed out that I failed to look at, the Singapore newspaper story stated it happened at 7:40pm Sunday (they're a day behind Pacific time). I can't find any more information though.  Anyone else notice it?  Or can find a news report about it??",2007-02-01T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

This morning is January 9th, 2007. Tuesday.  Went to work as usual except woke up with a lingering headache. This worked into feeling terrible like a bug had gotten me.  Was going to punch out right away but went to get coffee and waited to start feeling better.  I was parked sideways in the restaurants empty backlot staring into the sky towards our local Truck Assembly Plant.  There were some dim parking lot lights and some evergreens across the area.  The time was 7:35 or so and the Sun was not upvery high yet. Clear sky and stars. There was only one overly bright star that caught my attention. I looked again and stared. 20 degrees up and bright it was moving. As I looked into the SouthWest is was moving West to South straight across slowly for about 20 degrees  and stopped. At this time I was glassy eyed and head pounding and was trying to decide how good it would feel to fly into bed under a foot of covers. Today was freezing and Windy. I squinted and looked again. The light was still there and now bigger. It looked intense like when I saw Venus thru the planetarium telescope. It looked like there was activity in its brilliance. Like a fire or something molen which was changing as I watched it. The was a thin horizontal line of calm thru the middle which the brilliance was around. As I watched the thing it grew bigger in roundness and brilliance. From the size of a large Michigan star to the size of three large stars. The light seemed to form a horizontal halo thru its center. It moved slightly back to the West and remained. These things are all happening slowly. It has been three or four minutes so far. The brilliance stayed the same for about a full minute and I started looking around the sky. About 3 or 4 fingers South of this and the same distance below it was another smaller light and it was motionless for about five or ten seconds after I noticed it. It looked kind of like Mercury when you see it far down on the horizon only a little higher.   My mind thought O.K. that really IS a star. O.K. now its moving- it is a plane. O.K. now it stopped right under the big one-which is going NOWHERE.---- At around this time I was wondering how this is happening and other things about this-like Good Explanations.  Maybe plane search lights-much bigger than normal-must be Police helicopters-no search light trail though.  No directional beam coming off it at all. If it was Police or Plant helicopters in the sky they hovered without motion way too long.  If it was aircraft and I was staring headlong into their searchlight the time was still way too long. The plane would've covered a few miles coming straight at me. I began filtering thru many thoughts. Is this something I should notify about? Is it dangerous? Is anybody else seeing this? No-no one really looks up and it is still halfway dark out. Am I really seeing UFO's? Are they working with authorities or Who Care's. Could my head hurt anymore than this? The second light was not brilliant. It very definitely stopped right under the brilliant one-or-at least looked like it from my vantage point. This was a steady point of light which was staying-then-it moved slowly three fingers over to where it appeared right under the big one and stopped momentarily. It was ten or twenty seconds then faded off slowly. The brilliant one was still flaring and now it looked like it sprang an arm of light out about half its diameter and a quarter of its diameter in width.Sticking right out at about one o'clock to me. I had to scratch my head and rellok at it. What the-what NOW? It stayed that way for about twenty seconds then in the space of about a second, from the nine o'clock point on it, split into two halves just enough to open like a ""Pac-Man"" mouth and again I could see a dark line forming thru the center of the diameter and disappear as the two halves closed up. As this was happening the whole light seemed to give a shudder or extra volume and brilliance then back to normal. At that point it was motionless again and drifted slowly to a point behind a sparse evergreen limb where I couldn't see it. I sat there thinking-should I pursue this? Can my head hurt anymore than this? I moved the van over about ten feet East and about twenty feet South and there was a light. It was holding steady and brilliant but smaller. There was now also an obvious small Cessna type plane in the area. It was far off in the distance. Maybe flying due South and climbing at a steep pitch because I remember thinking-wow-is he doing acrobatics? But right now? This early in the morning? The brilliant one was still there but small-seemed like holding there again. I put the van in gear and took off out of the parking lot towards the highway (I-75). In the right lane the paved shoulder stops there and traffic at the red light got me stuck. I looked and looked there but nothing left. I could barely hold my head up off the steering wheel. The time was 7:58 AM. Waited for traffic to clear and the one guy stopped behind me to pull around then drove into the fast food place right there and got coffee. After driving the mile back to work I paged my boss and punched out on the time clock. As I look back on this event of about six hours ago it is my feeling the lights were less than a mile away which would put them right over the Plant or Hotel next door. Everything written down in this report is my best recollection, albeit my flu bug and sinus headache. I work on an outside crew and look at the stars alot in the early morning but have never experienced this kind of thing before. In the aftermath of this I had that feeling of a Cheshire Cat grin like you just got lucky enough to experience something few people do. That feeling was intense for several days",2007-02-01T00:00:00,42.64913587786259,-83.28663816793893

While other reports spoke of meteors, Nasrollahi said there were no conclusive witnesses in this regard but he did not dismiss the possibility that the crash has been caused by a meteor. Eye-witnesses assure that the explosion has been caused as a result of the crash of a radiant unidentified flying object onto the ground. Meantime, an informed source told FNA that the object has been on fire and there has been thick smoke coming out of it prior to the crash, concluding that the object couldn't have been a meteor as meteors do not smoke. The source also said that the crash has been witnessed by people in several cities, and mentioned that the rendezvous point is located 100 kilometers from the provincial capital city of Kerman. He said that people in the city of Rafsanjan also reported to have witnessed a similar incident several days ago. Similar crash incidents have been witnessed frequently during the last year all across Iran, and officials believe that the objects could be spy planes or a hi-tech espionage device.

We were at the overlook and what is nicknamed ""lovers Leep"" awaiting a chance to glimpse the Moonbow under the full moon when we noticed the extremely huge object that covered so much of an area it was unbelievable. It was monstrously large in size, The night skies where so bright with the moon we could view every inch of this thing that was presented to us. It was coming in at treetop level from the other side of the river toward Somerset and barely or slowly moving and made no sound at all. Needless to say we where stunned and stood there looking at this thing until it came to a complete stop over the center of the river and still due to its size and us kind of being in a valley we could not see the whole thing at once and it was right there, Right in our face and larger than any object that we have seen in our lives. The only way to describe it is just like the saucer that you would have seen in the movie ""V"" With the exception of the lights in the bottom.  But I am not embarrassed to say when it stop and we where underneath this thing that had rows of lights from big to small encircling each but not bright though just enough to light up the area around them where you could see the surface of the material this thing was made out of.  I yelled for everyone to run and we ran without stopping back to our vehicle, which in itself is a good distance. Once we started, believe me we where so scared that we did not even look back and was very happy to see our vehicle. We sat there in the car for a while and waited for people to be scrambling every where, We knew someone had to see this thing due to its size, We knew that hundreds had to view it because it was so big. But that never happened and after about 30 minutes a Park Ranger was making his rounds through the parking lot in his vehicle and being as excited as we where we ran him down and asked! if he h ad seen it. And this was after we informed him that we had not been drinking. He said no he had not seen it and immediately started telling us about a ghost that he has seen on the bridge that is located above the falls and I knew at that time that we where in the middle of a wasted conversation.  That has been many years ago and I never thought about putting it on the web until now when I was searching to see if there were any other sightings around that time. This could have even been 1989 but I am about positive it was 88. And believe me people this was nothing man made and it still scares me to this day thinking back on it with my friend that saw it with me as it did my X she never did like thinking about it. What I would like to know is they’re anyone else around that area that may have seen this thing on that night? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

One evening he ""borrowed"" a tape from his job and showed my wife and myself along with his wife a satellite launching from the shuttle.  As the launching took place, we could see the earth behind the launching and between the shuttle and the earth we saw at least 3 triangular shapes which glowed brightly flying extremely fast from east to west.  These unknown crafts had a dark line from the point of the triangle to the middle and then to the other points of the triangle. The UFO's then flew north and stopped and appeared to be observing the satellite launch.  The stopped and sat in place for a couple of minutes and then sped off in formation at an extremely fast speed. A couple of weeks later I asked my relative if I could see the tape again and he stated that it was a ""top secret"" tape and was taken by the government. Several weeks after that I again asked him about the tape and he stated,  ""What tape?"". I have mentioned this to him several times since then and he denies the tapes existence.

There was no sound that would attract out attention or anything causing us to look up, yet we did.  The sky was clear and dark, since it gets dark in the mountains quite early.

As I came up onto an overpass on Hwy 33 to the North of Cloquet and to the NW of Duluth, MN and saw about six vehicles parked on the side of the road with their hazard flashers on. Several people were out of their cars and were looking to the East. I stopped and got out to see what was going on. Looking to the East, I saw something very large flying just as it went overhead. It was silent and looked like a black triangle. 	As it passed overhead, I realized it must have been at least 200 feet wide and had some bright white lights on the tips that faced forward. It moved overhead and blocked out a considerable amount of the evening sky. It moved silently at about 30 MPH and was out of sight within a minute or so. 	Details about the evening: Approximately 10:30 PM (22:30), Sometime in September, 1990 (unsure of exact date as it was 16+ years ago), clear skies, new to ¼ moon (relatively dark), temperature in 50-60F range, no noticeable surface winds. 	Details about the location: Hwy 33, North of Cloquet, MN on Northbound bridge that goes over Saginaw Road (County Roads 694+46). This location is about 4 miles West of the Duluth International Airport and there is an airbase at that location, although not very active, just border patrols and Air National Guard. 	Details about object: Speed of approximately 30 MPH, altitude was less than 500 feet AGL, direction of travel was from East to West, visible for less than two minutes, triangle shaped with white lights on front (leading) edge, silent, no exhaust or emissions, no electrical interference. 	I am college educated geographic specialist and have researched some possibilities for this object. I didn’t really think about it for a number of years and finally thought about what it could have been. My first thought was that it was a stealth bomber, but realized that the actual production started later than when this was sighted. I’m sure there were prototypes around, but most likely not flying out of Duluth at this time. Stealth bombers and fighters have never been stationed out of Duluth. This object was also as silent as a bird; no wind noise, no jet exhaust, no turbine whine--nothing but silence. 	The fact that there were more witnesses confirmed that I wasn’t seeing things. I wish someone else would come forward and confirm this besides me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2007-02-24T00:00:00,46.744,-92.5739

I was hanging out in the driveway at my best friend’s house on N. Greenfield Ave. in Waukesha, WI between E. Broadway and Ellis St.  I had parked ""my"" 1980 Chevy Malibu on the curb in front of his house.  As my best friend and I  (and possibly one or two of his other brothers, I don’t remember) were standing in the driveway a new black Lincoln Town Car with tinted windows pulled up behind my car, blocking the driveway.  As soon as it stopped three men (possibly four, I can’t remember) including the driver; got out of the car, walked up to the sidewalk and faced us.  They all were all wearing black suits and dark tinted sunglasses; all of them normal build and physically fit.  The strangest part of the incident that I recall is that the one man immediately addressed me, as if he knew the Malibu was my car.  ""I will give you $2000 cash for your car.""  He was as far as I can remember totally expressionless, as were the others.  As far as I was reading into the interaction, he would hand me cash and drive the car away immediately.  Apparently a title was not an issue.  Still kind of dazed by the weirdness of it all, the only thing that I managed to reply was,  ""It’s not mine to sell, its my dad’s,"" which was true.  That was it, they made no more attempts at trying to deal.  They turned around without a word and drove north on N. Greenfield.  They didn’t stop at any other houses as far as we could see.  At the time I knew nothing of men in black stories nor did my friend.  We both stood there awestruck and after rehashing the event came to the conclusion that two grand wasn’t worth being implicated in a felony acted out by clean cut secret service types.  Interestingly enough my dad sold the car a few weeks later, I think he got less than $500 for it.  My friend may be willing to back up my claim, if he remembers.  I haven’t seen him for almost five years but it was such an odd event we reminisced on it a few times after it happened.  P.S.

Story:  This is one of the most ironic and amazing stories I have even heard of.  It demonstrates the very reasons I have not reported events to UFO center sites,  besides the fact that I would want to do illustrations and 3D simulations to show . In 1992 NASA’s HRMS, High Resolution Microwave Survey, is launched at Goldstone Observatory outside Barstow, California and at the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico.  As I had a colleague doing art for them and was soon to be working with SETI and was also involved with NASA and the other astronomical organizations I was able to get my wife ((name deleted)) and myself invited to the Barstow event and the Goldstone ceremony.  I knew a few people there and a few astronomers I had worked with as well as a couple artist friends.  I felt an outsider most of the time not being able to afford the dinners and hotel events.  I borrowed a friends 8mm video camera and had my own SLR and lots of film, so spent most my time shooting the event.  I was able to meet Carl Sagan and was able to shake his hand and thank him personally for his work in educating myself and the public so beautifully with the PBS Cosmos series.  Just a few minuets with him though. We where bused into Goldstone on the military base for the ceremony where I shot film and video of all I could.  We had a great time participating in the historic event and got photos of Carl, friends and other dignitaries.   It was a good event and history in the making.  When it was over we just wanted to go relax somewhere. As was our tradition at the time, when we are down that far south we always try go through or stay a night in Death Valley, a favorite place to this day, having spent much time there hiking and camping as well as exploring through college and after.  My wife and I spent two weeks just below the monument for our honeymoon in 1980 and I had done several road trips and backpacking high in the mountains in the seventies.  So we where very comfortable in this desolate beauty and powerful nature spot. We arrived in the monument from our Barstow hotel in the late afternoon.  Not wanting to miss a shot at a sunset session there, we went to the sand dunes directly, grabbed our day-packs and photographic bags and a borrowed Hi8 video cam and ran (walked fast) out to the deep dunes. As we walked, my wife and I where having an argument probably due to our depleted neurochemistry from erratic sleep, road-food and stress.  As we stood 10 feet apart and speaking loudly at each other, about nothing I remember, all of a sudden a bright light in the sky over ((deleted--wife)) drew my attention.  I was facing mountain Tucki Mountain looking south across the Panamint Mt. range  The range was had mountains as high as up to 11000ft.   This Tucki Mt. was over 5000 ft. I know because by that time in my life I had climbed Telescope Peak there (11049 ft.) in 1976 and had hiked the valley many times, so was familiar with the distances and geography first hand. As I looked at the light I noticed it was like a super bright flare slowly arching down from what looked like a massive black triangle 70% oblique to me.  I estimated it was close to the mountains and probably we where at or below sea level, observed the object at about 4000ft I estimated.  I yelled at my wife to look!, thinking she missed the ""spark,"" but as she turned, another bright spark came out of the craft and flew slowly down and out.  What we where left with was a view of this seemingly football-field sized or larger black triangular shape with what I remember was maybe many colored lights on what looked like the leading edge.  It was moving slowly, silently and deliberately northward along the range.  By that time it was dusk heading for twilight and the light was going.  I had film with ASA rated for daylight but attempted to get a shot after a few minuets of checking ourselves and confirming we where seeing the same thing.  I could not get any exposure, shot some blanks on the off chance they would show, but no luck.  The Hi8mm cam I had could not even show an image it was so dark.  In retrospect I could have narrated a detailed description on video.  I did not think over the ontological terror of seeing such a thing at the time.  So we stood in the sand dunes for about 20-30 minuets watching as the object slowly moving north along the mountain range until we lost sight of it in the extinction, haze and darkness.  Our legs where like rubber and we where very excited and a bit concerned for our safety as we thought we where totally alone in the vast valley.  So we made our way deliberately to our car parked a mile back through the dunes.  As we reached the parking area we noticed a motorcycle had come while we where gone and parked with its owner sleeping on top of one of the few picnic tables.  I was too spooked and in too much of a hurry to wake the person and ask him if he saw anything or warn him of the possible danger we felt.   We headed rapidly for the Stove Pipe Wells campgrounds with our heads rotating 360 for any other sights. Later at home, I referenced topographic and standard maps of the area and noticed that just the other side of the range but several air miles south from Tucki Mountain was the military test range China Lake Navel Weapons Testing Range.   So the military is all over the place down there. So although I had no visual record of the event we experienced, we had solid memory as you might imagine.   This is the first time I have written about this.  I have told some friends, but that is all.  I am producing a documentary segment for the event in 3D high resolution animations.  I also have a Google Earth KMZ file showing the site.  Much more research also on file. So who would believe such a story?  An artist, a Sci-Fi fan and lifetime UFO interested person coming from a SETI event?  Not a chance.  I could have physical evidence and people would just laugh.  I would probably not blame them either.",2007-02-24T00:00:00,,

The date is approximate and my best guess. Didn't really ever want to tell anyone. After leaving my friends house and proceeding down the driveway, I heard the crows in the tops of the tall pines raising heck. I turned to look because the noise was like that of/or if 1 of their own was wounded. While watching them in the tops of the trees fling around squalking wildly, with a clear blue sky in the farthest background, I noticed a round blue circular object coming into view underneath the high cirrus clouds. Immediately I was overwhelmed as it came closer and to my dismay, began to project the clouds over top of the craft on the bottom. It was easy to follow while moving down the peninsula with the constant movement of the clouds in the path of the craft being seemingly plucked from the sky and projected on the underside of the craft. The craft only stopped two times while traveling down the peninsula, once over apparently Ft.Eustis, the second being apparently over ths James River bridge area, before uplifting at an incredible pace and dissapearing above the high cirrus clouds. The two times the craft stopped it was extremely hard to see. 1 point that I called frantically for my friend or his 2star Admiral father to come see what i was looking at, i looked away for a second while it was stationary, only to have a hard time seeing it again when i looked back. While still stationary, the craft seemed to have a sheen of a very thin line of colors of the surroundings given at it's outermost edges. But when it started to move again, it resumed picking up what was above the craft and projecting it below on it's hull. There was no noise from it the whole time, however the crows stopped squalkin when the craft was stopped almost overhead. Weird hugh? The approximate time for this whole ordeal was about 5 mins. The approximate path viewed was form the Colonial Williamsburg - Camp Peary area down to the first stop over the Warwickriver - Ft.Eustis area then down to the James River bridge - Newport News shipyard area. When leaving upwards and outwards the craft seemed to go towards Chesapeake - Soffolk direction. I have wondered over the years if they had the techonology to project what was above to below, what a perfect camoflauge if the could project below to the above so as not to be spotted if overflown. We'll to sum it up whatever or whoever they were they made me wonder how small we really are. Still, with my faith in Christianity, I guess one day, God will let me know!

On 8/14/95 (remembered only because it was a friend's birthday), at roughly 11pm, some friends and I were on the Union Hill Road (right in front of what is now the Microsoft Xbox buildings).  We saw some truly spectacular lights up in the sky to the south east.  We pulled the car over, and watched for nearly a half hour.  It was clear that these lights were lightening up in some low-level clouds; never striking the ground (maybe 1500 feet? 2000?).  It was a semi-cloudy evening, extremely dry air, and warm (68-70 degrees)--no rain. The colors lit up as red/pink, white, aqua, green and an ivory color.  After about 10 minutes of watching, (roughly 11:15) a Redmond Police officer pulled up and watched the remainder of the ""show"" with us.  Because of the odd lack of actual bolt lightening strikes and lack of audible thunder and the funky cloud cover, some of the lights actually looked oval or round, but it was clearly a reflection of the light off/in the clouds.  It was truly one of the most spectacular lightening shows I can ever remember seeing--especially in Washington.  The air literally felt and even smelled ""electric.""   As you likely know, dry lightening storms are rare in Wa. The ""storm"" appeared to happen in a very localized area of the sky.  Very near Union Hill, but I'm sure it could have been seen by anyone on Novelty Hill and the Redmond Plateau (perhaps even Education Hill) as well and seemed to be contained to one ""group"" of very puffy, white, billowy clouds. For as long as I watched these lights, I have no doubt that it was just a very cool weather anomaly all friends and the Redmond Officer all agreed that is was lightening, albeit very strange lightening.  The color flashes would have been really wild if you were on top of one of those hills which are about 500-800ft in elevation.   As far as I know, the ""storm"" was never reported, which I thought was odd since it lasted for about a half hour and it was so vivid. I recall watching the news the following day to see if it would end up on the weather report, but if it did, I never caught it.  It may be worth noting that the officer got no calls on his radio while he stood with us on the shoulder of the road, and he was with us for 15-20 minutes. I don't recall him radioing anything in either.

All of a sudden the dog started crying put its tail under her legs and hid, and then as if on cue this blinding red light came through the blinds and felt a humming in my body but could not hear anything,  my girlfriend who was right next to me at the time felt exactly the same thing, we were both scared to death i have read a lot of books and seen a lot of documenterys on ufo's and aliens and this has convinced me and definately convinced my girlfriend who was not a beleiver in this. we both tried to peer through the blinds but the light was just too blinding it was just hovering above our house and where we lived in redmond was on the top of a hill over a valley so there was absolutely no doubt that this is indeed genuine.  i now live in london and have done since early 1996 and i hope the zip code i gave you is correct because i do not have my u.s. license anymore and the zip im pretty sure is correct.  this craft if i may call it that was incredibly bright and huge and would be amazed if nobody else saw this craft, i cant stop thinking about this sighting it really has got me hooked on trying to find the truth behind all of these sightings and beleive me they do exist i just hope that a member of the public from redmond also saw this and could verify my story.

Not too spectacular of a sighting, but strange to me none-the-less...  I was looking west from just south of Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, California. It was just after 7:30pm. The weather was crystal clear. It was so clear tonight that I could see more stars than I’m normally able to. There was a lot of air traffic tonight as well, but something else caught my eye.  About 45 degrees above the horizon, a dim white light appeared. It was only as bright as a star, but it wasn’t there before. It seemed to be as bright as the brightest star in the sky. It seemed to turn left. The light dimmed as it appeared to turn and simply vanished. There was no flashing light. There were no red and green navigation lights.  I moved quickly to a darker spot, away from parking lot lights, and kept my eye on the same spot in the sky, looking over in the direction it seemed to be going, and there was nothing there. I stood and waited for a while, looking for any flashing light, no matter how dim. I have good night vision, had been outside for a while, and 20/20 vision to boot. Nothing appeared. I could see other planes in the sky. Even planes further away could clearly be seen with much brighter lights and the tell-tale flashing navigation lights I’m used to seeing working by an airport all the time. This light was not over or near the airport, however. I believe it was very high up in the atmosphere and possibly off the coast.  In fact, I believe what I observed was a “Iridium satellite flare.” It would be my first time seeing one, if that’s what it was. I thought there would be more of a flash… This simply appeared and faded out after a few seconds. It was subtle, but it caught my eye.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,33.12780664961637,-117.30352710997443

Whilst we were there a large almost circular object was in the sky from when we arrived at 8 in the morning until 5 in the evening on around four different days, three consecutive and one the day after a one day gap. When I saw the object for the first time I mistook it for the moon, but I soon realized I was  wrong as the moon was in the sky at the same time as the object. I also checked if it was the sun but it wasn't. The object was almost a full circle but there seemed to be a small chunk missing from its bottom. The object looked to be about half the size of the moon which was visible at the time and was slightly bluer/grayer than the moon itself. As i have said earlier, for the first three days of the holiday the object was visible to the south but did not appear the next day and was visible the day after that to the east, but was considerable paler than before and blended in with the sky much more easily. As we were staying at a very busy ski resort many people from outside our school witnessed this too and an American man showed us a photo of the object which he had taken on his digital camera which when zoomed in looked as though there were hundreds of brightly lit windows on it. Eventually, towards the end of the holiday the object was no longer visible, but my friends and I have many photos of it. One friend of mine has a zoomed in movie of the object in which the object seems to revolve very slowly. Another video taken, in the evening shows there to be about 4-6 small illuminated dots circling the object at what looks to be high speed. A video I have taken, this time not with the object in the frame shows three car sized disks slowly moving over trees in a circular fashion, (they were moving in a circular formation and circling like a carousel). As these disks were flying only a few feet over the trees I managed to estimate they were about the size of a large car (20x20 feet). These disks are very clear and seemed to be slightly reflective. Also gray/black lines are visible on the beneath of the disks. While I was filming I did not notice these disks even though they appear to be flying slowly at around 40mph and were within about 200 feet of me at the time and first noticed them while I played them back on the computer. I assure you that these are not aircraft or light specs because you cannot hear the object on the video and there is a reasonable amount of detail on the disks as my camera is 10mp. Also, I don't know If this has anything to do with the disks or not but on the day I filmed this, everyone I knew , including myself who had taken a camera or mobile phone with them skiing that day had problems with them. For example, my camera wouldn't always tern on or off when I wanted it too and sometimes the zoom had a mind of its own. If you could advise me what to do with these videos I would be very grateful.

The object had horizontal ovals 2 by 5 foot at the bottom of each fluted panel, which extended slightly below the bottom plane of the boxy thing, all the way around. Its overall height was about 20 ft. from top to bottom.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,33.808705515846256,-84.38988231962239

My husband and I were on our way to the movies and heading toward the Laughlin strip on the highway  95 coming from Kingman, AZ when my husband  who was driving said “What is that?” I looked up and there was a plane flying across in the distance  directly in front of us. I told him it was plane, obviously.  He said “Not the plane, where did it go?”, then exclaimed and pointed “That!” I leaned forward in the truck to look up into the sky thru the windshield and  at the upper left side I saw a metallic disc shaped object which was brightly reflecting the sun. It was tilted at an angle toward us and didn’t seem to be moving at all but staying in one place while it tilted at those various degrees. We couldn’t tell if it made any sound or not because our windows were rolled up. I watched it for a few seconds in shock that I was seeing my first beyond a shadow of a doubt ufo , till I realized I had my camera with me and I told my husband to pull over on the side as its visibility was lost from me where I was sitting and fumbling for my camera to turn it on. When we got to an area and pulled over it was gone and no where to be seen anywhere in the sky. We stayed there for a while looking for it and hoping it might come back or maybe still be there and show itself again, but nothing. I asked my husband about it and he said the reflection of the suns rays reflecting off of the shiny silver metal caught his eye and he look up  and saw it. At that time it was completely turned on its side so that he could see it was a perfectly shaped round disk. It was so close that it was about an inch in size and we could see the grooves where it had a small bump in the middle of it. As my husband was looking at it and asking me what it was, it turned “right” side up where he lost it for a second then it became “visible” again (and when I saw it), when it tilted at an angle and the suns rays reflected off of the metallic body again. The only other ufo that I, personally have seen and video taped was when we lived 30 miles out of Kingman, Arizona which was oval shaped and light in color but was pretty far away and was reported on the news that day to be seen all over Arizona (phoenix, flagstaff, Kingman etc) but it was explained as being a weather balloon. Now that one I would accept a lot more easily as possibly being a weather balloon but this ufo we saw yesterday was so CLEAR, DETAILED and in broad DAYLIGHT on a nice sunny day that we both (my husband and I) know it was real and like nothing we both have EVER seen before that could be logically explained.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,35.10574736842105,-114.70477894736842

The children all concure that the craft was very large and as described by my son as at least as large as two houses.  They also said the craft had four green lights on the underside or belly of the craft. I tried to determine altitude by asking the children if it was traveling at a height were commercial jets fly.

Both my friend and I are experienced sailors and have spent considerable time on the ocean in and around the area.  Neither of us had ever seen anything like it.  It was triangular in shape (as best as I could tell given the extremily bright lights it had), and was moving in erratic patterns at reasonably high altitude.  Given the high speed and erratic movements, we determined it was certainly not a helicopter or any conventional civilian aircraft.  The lights it emmitted were red and white.  Didn't notice and noise or sounds that could be heard over the din of the ocean.  I've never seen anything move so fast and change directions so abruptly.

We went to Wal-Mart to get some stuff that we needed and to stimulate the economy in any small way we could.  When we were driving back, and neared the Military base, we saw three black, triangular shaped objects.  All three aircraft had round, bright lights at all three points.  They were moving slowly and rotated at the same time.  There was no noise being generated, it was completely quiet.   I pulled the car over, got out, walked around the car and into the field.  It was awesome, I was so happy to see them.  I wanted to run out into the field to get a better look, but my wife started freaking out, telling me to geat back in the car or she was going to leave without me.

All the lights were the same color, a bright white with a tinge of yellow.  They were four or five circular-shaped lights very close together so they almost appeared as one bar of light.  None of the lights blinked or changed color.  I was watching it for a little less than a minute when suddenly all the lights disappeared and a new set appeared in a vertical formation, bisecting the horizontal set of lights if they had remained visible.  The change occurred while I was watching and there was no smooth transition: the horizontal lights simply disappeared as the vertical lights appeared.  The vertical lights were the same color, intensity, and spacing as the horizontal lights, with each light just far enough apart from the next that they did not appear to be a solid bar of light like a fluorescent or neon tube.  Shortly after the vertical lights appeared, within a second or two, the top light quickly became much brighter.  A few seconds later, the vertical lights disappeared leaving only blackness.  The vertical lights were only visible for about five seconds before disappearing.  The entire time the lights were visible, just over a minute, they were completely stationary.  Had the lights been on at the same time, they would have resembled a cross (+).  There's no way the lights could have been attached to a radio tower or any other antenna.  I've made the same commute from Little Rock to Jacksonville almost every night for several years and am very familiar with all stationary land beacons.  Partially due to my familiarity with the drive and the fact that the bridge across the river is completely straight, I could devote a lot of attention to the lights.  It was too dark to make out a shape of whatever the lights were attached to.  Unfortunately, the night was too black and the lights too bright for me to make out any kind of shape the lights may have been attached to.  I never heard any sounds from the lights as I was driving on the freeway around 65 Mph in a cheap, poorly sealed car.  Because of this, it was impossible for me to conclude if the lights made any sound at all.  Note that for number of craft seen, I've selected 1-10: as few as one if the lights were all connected to one craft, and as many as 10 if each light was attached to its own craft.  I remain unsure of if there were four or five lights comprising the horizontal row and vertical column as I could barely make out the shape of each light.  However, I'm positive one of the numbers is correct.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,34.737536276849646,-92.3631923627685

It was a clear calm cool night in central Idaho, when I received a phone call from my nephew who lives about a half mile away. He said there were strange lights outside and that they had been moving around the northern end of the valley from east to west. I went outside while still on the phone with my nephew and he said look to the WNW and we both saw one large lone reddish-blue silver light glistening in the WNW Sky. It appeared to be 3-5 miles away, however I am not certain. He said he and his father had been observing for longer and said more would appear, that they had been visible and then not, just then one light appeared and then several seconds later another appeared then several seconds later a third light appeared. These three lights were in a near perfect triangle, not an isosceles but flatter with approximate 45-degree angles. They remained that way for maybe 30 seconds with all four lights glistening the same sharp reddish-blue silver light. The fourth light appeared closer because of its brightness also it was positioned higher and to the left of the triangular formation of lights. The lights appeared to hover and move very slowly to the left, keeping their same distance from me. The lights forming the triangle then vanished into the westward sky and left the remaining fourth light that slowly drifted to the left and west over the horizon of mountains. No sound was ever heard form these lights. Ten minutes later a large plane came from the ESE and crossed directly over and directly in line with the west ward direction of the lights until out of sight. This plane had a deep roar of motors had no normal colored airline lights, but several large yellowish orange lights marking its body. Not sure if plane was in support of the light formation or in search or niether. Do not know if lights were military training or just what they were.  All I know for sure is lights were very unique in appearance and behavior of any thing I have ever witnessed in nearly 50 years of living in this area.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,44.652,-114.1543

In fact, our view of the object was blocked because of the numerous trees that surround our area.  Although it is more difficult to estimate distance and size at night, the object could not have been far away because the light was very bright and noticeable.  According to my husband, the light mimicked the movement made by a ping-pong ball.  At one point, the light became brighter and after that we lost sight of it.

My girlfriend and I were on our nightly walk around our neighborhood, clear skies, relatively dark, consellations were very visible, very little light pollution (as the majority of the street lights were not working). Typically, there are a few commercial airliners passing over per night, very high and easy to recognize, usually off in the distance enough for the sound of the jet engines to be very faint. We noticed what we thought initially was an aircraft, flying uncharacteristically low. After a moment, we realized that this aircraft was far too low to be a commercial jet, and the sound it was producing was unlike anything I had heard come out of any aircraft previously. If I had to put words to it, one could compare the sound to a very low pitched buzzing, almost as if the sound, whatever it was, was being projected out of an aluminum garbage can. It was audible, however if a person was inside one of the homes, they would not have been woken up by it. The noise, however, was not the definitive characteristic that really threw us off. The shape and the lighting...primarily where the lights were on the body of the aircraft. There were three lights on the bottom, in a straight line. Two lights, very far apart from one another, on the 'front' of the craft, vertically aligned, spread far apart from one another; at first they acted as what seemed to be spotlights, however when the object passed overhead, we realized that the lights were projecting 360 degrees, which seemed downright impossible. There were also lights that strobed around the aircraft, not circular, but more on the lines of a diagonal 'connect the dots'. The craft was changing course steadily, however the lights did not move from their original place, making it clear in my mind that this aircraft was moving without banking to make a turn, implying there were no rudders, nor jet propultion required to pilot this aircraft. Eventually, visibility of the aircraft was obstructed by trees, allowing us to see the lights only. The aircraft broke off to the right, and left our line of sight.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,42.5804,-71.087

At first I suspected these lights to be aircraft flying to Robins AFB, as both were traveling at a speed that I would estimate to be faster than civilian aircraft or helicopters.  I could detect no sound.  Three things in particular caught my attention enough to question what I was seeing: 1)  The lights of both craft (I am assuming that there were two) appeared to be flying in perfect tandem with each other, not uncommon with military aircraft, with one light trailing the other by perhaps 750 to 1000 feet...far enough to make it too large for both lights to be from any one aircraft I have seen. 2)  The lights from both craft, at the distance which I saw them, appeared much larger that typical aircraft lights.  They were approximately the luminosity of aircraft landing lights yet not blinding, and did not appear to shine light in any specific direction.  What I mean by this is it didn't create any sort of beam of light in the sense that aircraft landing lights do.  The color was a deep red, almost of the sort that you would see on a tall radio tower, but much brighter. 3)  This is the one that got me thinking...both lights blinked in perfect unison with each other.  I would estimate that the light would illuminate for 1-1/2 to 2 seconds, then disappear for the same duration.  When the lights were off, there was no indication of any other wing lights or other illumination.  Both lights blinked in perfect unison with each other for the 20 to 30 seconds that I first saw them, which I thought was unusual, as they did not once get unsychronized.  At this point, I was curious enough to change my vantage point.  I moved to the side parking lot of my office to try to catch another view, and saw an aircraft in the distance probably 4 to 5 miles away, but clearly identifiable as an airplane from the light array.  Thinking that I had just seen an airplane, I began to go back inside,I turned my head and saw both lights again, still blinking in perfect unison.  They were now moving in a southerly direction, and still exhibited no other running lights.  Suddenly, and in tandem, both lights appeared to change direction to the East, and then to the E-NE.  This was a very fluid movement...not sudden, but quickly enough to make me think that it was a very maneuverable jet.  Both lights executed the maneuver without growing closer or further apart from each other, as if was a single craft, yet too far apart to be a single craft.  Also, the lights did not appear to alter position, such as if wings were turning.  They maintained their luminosity throughout the turn...the blinking pattern remaining constant throughout.  I watched this for another 10 -15 seconds before the lights simply vanished.  Interestingly, a second or so after the two unidentified lights changed course, the distant aircraft also changed course, though in a much more leisurely manner, in the general direction of the other lights.  Conditions: Night, with scattered clouds, yet clear enough to see at distance.  The cloud cover appeared to be above the lights at all times.  According to Weather Channel online, visibility is currently 10 miles.  As I said, this is probably just an aircraft sighting, but there were enough curiosities to this incident to report this...if for lack of anything else, just in case someone else reports something.  I'd be curious if anyone else saw this incident.    I am familiar with watching aircraft, day and night, and this was different from any aircraft I have seen.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,32.849716789667895,-83.67467029520296

PD)) Star appearance with rapid accelerations and instant major changes of velocity for over two hours witnessed by 5 people with some video We were night fishing at lake norman near the duke power plant and mcguirre nuclear station very early in the morning,  more for fun than fish.  The first witness discovered the first object by laying on the sub deck on the bow of the boat.  looking at the stars, one star in paticular, bright and over head.  He called nine year old son to lay on the bow with him and asked him to just look at the one star.  The boy said "" oh my god, it moved! ""  We had the radio on, myself witness #3 heard their talking abruptly and stearnly turn into,  it's a UFO! and several whooos and oh my gods and you got to see this from both of them.  At first I blew them off for five minutes or so as I continued to make my leader lines for casting and made sarcastic comments with,  Witness #1's wife, who is witness #2's mom and herself witness #4.  Their voice and concern grew greater as he insisted for his wife to grab their low memory digital video recorder.  I soon realized that whatever they were seeing, they were seeing at the same time.  He said to me "" come up here and lay still and dont take your eyes off that star for at least three minutes.  I believe in UFO's and government technologies, and I concider myself to be very sientific, very good with spacial reasoning. I'm familuar with referencing to stars, earth, moon, and ground effect.  Let me add belated that we were at anchor with a good catch of something at 40 to 50 feet in gauge with my 100' rope and depth finder.  I own the boat so I was very attentive to making sure we were not drifting, however, as you read on, drift, is not a factor in this equation.  There was ofcourse some light movment if positional swinging off our 50' pivital point, but we were at a cove so the direction was within 15 - 25 degrees variance at the maximum.  NOw to continue with what happened.  I climb up on the sun deck of the bow with my friend and his son.  I laid my head flat with vigorous attention on this star.  My friend said "" do you see that,  it's slowly moving side! wats, no w watch.  It will change direction.  I did notice some unusual kind of movement but nothing conclusive at all.  As a scientist and engineer I imediatly use my fingers and hands to position other stars and hold as a referrence.  As my friend did as I did, I explained to him that the muscles in the human body can move so slowly that you never notice the difference making an unreliable frame of referrence, but for now well see if we notice.  He said  "" watch, I saw a light at the end of it and it moved much faster and the suddenly stop and suddenly make total direction changes.  As he is telling me this, I'm recalling in my mind the video of the NASA Shuttle in orbit that filmed what I think they called debris floating along one direction and then a sudden small flash and it darted like 120 degrees if the direction it was heading.  He's got my interest but not yet his wifes or our friend the 5th witness.  As promised this object definetly made sudden fast burst of movment and then totally changed velocity.  I watched in amazment as we witnessed a few of the longer traveled burst that could not have, in any way, been any sort of misguided frame of reference, drift, pivot or spin of our boat, or ground effect or our eyes becoming lazy and moving.  Partly because we all saw they same movments at the same time.  At this point I am confident my friend's claim correct.  I start to report to his wife what I'm seeing as he is begging her to start the vidoe recorder for him.  I then also grabbed my phone with short video and tried to record what we were seeing.  His wife at this time was still giggling and joking and really didnt take anyone seriously.  We both try to capture the object on film as it starts doing far more aerobatical phenominons.  I guessed that this object if it were the size of a commercial airliner, would have been approximatly 25,000 - 45,000 feet AGL and at one point I had to trace the object while holding my video phone pointed at around 50 degrees in the sky to 85 - 90 degrees in less than 1 ! 1/2 seco nds and then suddenly stop.  My friend has the very bright idea to then signal this UFO ( I am calling now a UFO because all 5 people on the boat are now convinced ) with a mag light.  I do not know if it was coinsidence or if his signaling actually provoked very rapid and major changes in velocity.  It started to look like a ping pong ball ( a little exsadurated but you get the point ) moving in what appeared to be erratic behavoir.  My friend says he suspects there is another below by 40 degrees and left by 60 degrees.  As we watched it as well, it appeared to have less abrupt and frequent similar movments.  We all concintrated on the first sighted UFO more do to the show it was putting on for us.  Because of the less amount of interest in the sighted UFO #2 we ended up noticing that it appeared to be getting closer and with my no-fear friend still flashing the light at it every so often,  the rest of us were starting to get pretty frightened so we all agreed to get out of there as fast as possible.  We fled to the North side of the Hwy 150 bridge.  It was still visable to us and maintained the erratic behavior until we stopped following it until around 5-6 AM.  It was by far the most unusual and appreciated experience of my life.  I almost forgot, could very well have been the shock and rush to catch this on video, but my PC phone by verizon, frooze up more than once and had to be restarted while trying to get to the video menus so I could record and the footage I did get was only two five second shots.  My friend appeared to have issues with their equipment too, however, they were new to their recorders functions.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,35.57407703349283,-80.8602961722488

She acting strangely and was just staring with the dog back inside already, so I asked her what she was doing and she said something about looking at a star, but she thought it was twinkling too brightly.  I said,"" it's probably just Venus or something. I looked at this star for a moment which seemed to be in our N by NW sky. The bright moon was behind me and I tried to see if I could see any other stars in the sky and or if I could see what I thought were planets versus stars so that I could explain it to my mother that it was probably just nothing. When I looked behind me I saw what seemed to also be a bright star but it was moving and then slowly at first then seemed to speed up and then resume previous speed. It  moved in and out of the clouds as there was some medium cloud cover. Then I noticed that there were two objects, then I noticed there were two objects the second was behind the other but not following directly behind it but to the left and behind to the indication of about 12 inches if I put my fingers apart as an indication as I looked up in the sky. The objects looked to be of similar size and brightness to the planet Venus when it is the biggest and brightest in the sky. I thought that was strange so I decided to go around the house into the backyard to get a better look without the roof of the house obstructing my view of the sky. I was looking for navigation lights and strobe, so I was looking for green, red, or strobe of normal aircraft that fly over our skies as this is a heavy traffic area, but I saw none. Then I scanned  sky to my left to again see if I could locate any stars planets etc or anything else to compare these objects to, and I saw another object slowly moving through the sky as the others and identical, I was  looking south southeast  I could see no other stars just these objects in the sky an a very bright moon that was partially obscured by clouds. Now I was looking at three objects that were different than the one I originally witnessed that had the attention of my mother. It is hard to judge distance and altitude if you have nothing to gage by, so all I can say is if I were holding my hands up to the sky out at 45 degree angles and my armpit being a tangent line that would be going straight out then the objects were that far apart. So to better explain if I was holding my hands up in front of me the first two objects traveling west were 36 to 40 inch's in front of the solo traveling object, also moving west. So two objects were traveling west as I was looking south, south west and another also traveling west as I was looking south south east. Now here is the weird part and i have no way to explain how this happened. As I was looking s se at the third object traveling west, I turned to look back at the other two objects and they were right back in the same place they had been when I first saw them and then they started to move west again as if the entire event had been rewound on a video and that disturbed me greatly. At that time my mother had come out in the back yard.  I was asking her to watch them move and I pointed out the other object in that was traveling solo and it too was in it's original position as I first saw it,as I looked back at it  Then I went back to looking at the two traveling west together and my mother was looking at the single object which she said had stopped and then started to move again. I realized at that time this situation was indeed strange to say the least and I immediately without hesitation came to my computer which was on. I entered in the search for peter davenport UFO reporting center and had the number to call within seconds and within one minute was making the report. I was instructed to call another witness immediately and  then proceeded to follow that instruction as best I could. I called a friend that I had been visiting earlier in the evening as said go outside and look. That person witnessed three object as I did and also when she looked back at the two they appeared to be in the original position that she saw them in. So the objects were continually moving west and at varied speeds and then if you looked away for any reason and then observed them again the objects seemed to be where you first saw them, but they never appeared to stop moving,  However when I first saw the single object looking S SE at first it seemed stationary then moved slightly and then moved in a continuous manner. None of the witnesses including myself were under the influence of any type of drug or alcohol and had not partaken in any drugs or alcohol or any stimulating substances as we are all non drinkers and do not take drugs. I am a former Civil Air Patrol cadet squadron commander and held the rank of Second Lt. having served in CAP for five years. I was cadet commander of Squadron 130  Group One  based at Van Nuys Airport  Prior to that I was a Search base radio NCO, Squadron 10 Group Two in Northern California and was based at Reid Hill-view airport, in Palo Alto California  I am a trained CAP Air Search and rescue observer.I have also served on ground teams. I participated in more than 25 searchs in five years and attended flight training school. I learned how to fly at 16 years old, however I am not currently a licensed pilot. What I observed was strange indeed and the objects in the sky did not act or move like conventional aircraft. My opinion is that what was observed can only be filed as unidentified. When I returned back outside after calling the reporting center and my friend, the cloud cover was heavy and not medium and none of the sky was visible which I also thought was strange indeed, as only medium cloud cover was visible during the observations of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this witness for the excellent report he submitted, and for his having done everything right, i.e. for his having attempted to have other witnesses observe the object.

It was spherical, gradually changed from white to yellow (much unlike the flashing of airplane lights) and emitted and aura and lights in hues of red, yellow-orange, white and occasionally blue around its periphery.  It appeared to emit an occasional small beam of white light, though not in any discernible pattern or consistent direction.  The best way to explain the emitting colors would be to compare it to a child's sparkler on the fourth of July.  This craft/light was silent, which again is quite unlike any airplane I am accustomed to seeing, particularly on nights as quiet and still as last night was.  After approximately five minutes, possibly a bit less, the light simply went out and I was unable to see it.  There was nothing obstructing my view of it so it is impossible that its view was obscured by a tree or structure.  The sky was clear and nearly cloudless (I could see many stars) so it's not possible that it went behind a cloud, either.  I came out several more times over the next two hours, camera in hand, but it did not reappear.  Unfortunately my husband was already sleeping so did not witness it with me.  I am quite curious to see if anyone else has reported seeing similar stationary lights in Portland recently.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

The object was on the back of a flat bed transfer truck traveling north on interstate 81. It was covered and wrapped in a teal green tarp very tightly. The object was a disk like shape with two symetrical fins coming off the front or back. The general size was roughly a little larger than a private prop plane. There were two cars infront of the truck and two behind all with different plates. All the vehicles had tinted windows and were white in color. From what my wife and I could see all the occupants of the vehicles were clean cut white males in what appeared to be white button down shirts. They made efforts to stay closley grouped as not to have any other cars come within the formation. The shape of the craft had a similar shape to that of the ships depictded in ""Independence Day"". The whole situation was rather odd when we began to think of everything as a whole. What better way to hide something than in plain sight. The object was secured on a steel tube frame and was like I stated earlier very tight. No surface area was exposed and and the object hung over roughly 3-4 feet on each side of the bed. It was positioned at an angle on the truck because of its size. Traffic was rather heavy that day and I am sure others had the same thoughts because several people ahead of me on the road slowed down to take a second look.

PD))  Distant white spheres seen by crowd on college campus I was attending the Stan Romanek presentation at St Cajetan's Church on the Auraria Campus near downtown Denver. Shortly after 4:00 PM (4:15?) a break was called (the program ran from 2PM to 6PM). Many people, including me, went outside. It was a very nice day, mild (in the 40's), partly sunny, very light breeze. I just looked at the sky casually, but then I noticed a lot of people were looking and pointing and yelling about something in the sky. They were all looking north or northwest. I asked someone to point them out to me; it took me about 30 seconds to notice them for myself. They appeared to be white. Most people said they looked like spheres (in fact, some said they were PERFECT spheres) but to me they looked more flattened, like a disc would look; however, I wear glasses and my prescription is 4 years old and I know I don't have 20/20 vision with them anymore. A few people had cameras or cell phones with cameras and were trying to take pictures. I saw that one person has already posted their report and included 3 photos. They do look more rounded in the photos, so it was probably my eyesight that made them look more flattened somehow. A couple of people thought they were balloons, but I did not think so for 2 reasons. First, they did not drift together in the same direction like balloons would be if carried by the wind. They would change direction, go into and out of clouds, and move in opposite directions to one another and stop and hover, then move again. There were 3 or 4 initially, then only 2, then only 1. Then I went back inside because the program was to resume. Either the other objects took off so fast I couldn't see them, or they disappeared, or went behind a cloud or two. Stan was outside for a few minutes and also saw them but said it was hard to tell whether ""they"" were there for him and the crowd, or whether it was balloons or whatever; he didn't watch them for long and went back inside. He asked the crowd later how many people saw the objects and a lot of hands wen! t up, pr obably more people saw them than didn't.

The next day nothing in the news or the papers nothing on the web.  This seems odd to me. I am guessing it was a satellite breaking up and maybe these were large solar panels but they must have been huge.  I am not sure if anyone reading this can estimate size and distance but they appeared to be about an inch or so long in a photograph when entering the atmosphere above telephone lines across the street from my house so looking up about 50 feet in the south west sky.

After a minute I noticed a pair of lights appearing in the horizon just to my right above my detached garage on the east side of my house. It looked like a low flying plane with its landing lights on at first. I was expecting to hear the sound of a jet or prop engine of some sort but it never made a bit of noise. I was facing due east and it was moving west to slightly northwest overhead. A few seconds later I could tell the two lights were actually much further apart than an airplane and they were positioned at the front and back of whatever it was coming toward me. As it passed closer overhead I could faintly make out a dark shadow of a cigar shape behind the lights. The object then went out of view behind a large maple tree on the northeast corner of the house. I jumped down off the porch and ran to the north side of the house to try and catch sight of it again but it had disappeared.  I stood outside for several more minutes hoping to see it again before going inside and looking at the clock.

It's the only one I know of that keeps the outdoor pool open after Labor Day. Anyway, Tuesday morning (9/18/07) I first noticed what I thought was probably a red-eye flight coming in for a landing at O'Hare. The thing is that it never banked and never circled. It was a very bright light -- too high to be a helicopter and too low to be a star -- that would go higher into the sky (I was facing East), straight up, or back a little lower. By 5:50 it started going higher and possibly a little to the South. I leave the pool at 6:20, and the sun hasn't fully risen. It did the same thing on Wednesday.  I didn't swim yesterday, but I did this morning (9/21) and decided that I should wear my contacts to try to get a better look at it. From what I could tell, I saw a faint outline, a chevron shape that resembled a turkey wishbone (but with a bigger center at the point) or even the Nike symbol if both points were the same length. I occasionally saw what seemed to be a ""jet stream,"" but it was broad and short. When the object was a little lower (between 5:30-5:45) it looked as if there was a bit of orange or red at the end, and the stream seemed to retract and then come out. When the object was higher I didn't notice the red and could only see a slight stream. There was no noise that I could tell, and I know it wasn't a plane because one of those did pass overhead, continuing forward with a rhythmic flashing light underneath. This was completely different.  More than anything I'd like to put my mind at rest. I'd like to think that there's a logical explanation that O'Hare Air Traffic Control would certainly be aware of.

I am giving a summary of what has occured on 3 different occasions over the past 3 weeks,  with the latest incident being tonight.  Looking to the north (as the bird flies,  towards Allentown),  a light begins to rise above the tree line.  As the light rises, ever so slowly, it's brightness grows in intensity.  The light will begin to travel east, then, without reason, shift west at an exceptional rate of speed.  At this point the object will hover for about 1-2 minutes with a varied, pulsating level of brightness;  then without warning the object grows real bright and simply disappears.  For minutes I will stand searching the sky with no trace of there ever being anything there to begin with.  What makes these occurences more unusual is that after each sighting,  it has been accompanied with a ""shooting star"".  As rare as it is for one to see a shooting star,  I find it odd that after each of the 3 sightings there was the presence of a steaking light across the sky in the direction of the sighting that one one would normally dismiss as a shooting star.

I was ""naked eye"" stargazing last night (11/07/07), a perfect night for stargazing because of the stillness and clarity of the stars.  I was looking eastward, paying special attention to the flickering stars.  A speck of light in the mid-level eastern sky caught my eye because of the nature of its flickering.  It appeared to be multi-colored, green, white, red, brighter flickers at times. There appeared to be an almost rotational aspect to the flickering.  I began to watch it closely, primarily because of the fact that when I first laid eyes on it, I thought I detected movement.  As I moved my position to be free of neighboring lights, I attempted to ascertain whether or not the object was moving.  Using two objects in the sky which I was sure were stars, the object in question was in such a position with respect to the two stars that it formed an isoceles triangle.  But then the object became aligned with the top-most of the two stars; minutes later it was aligned with the bottom star.  I was convinced the object was moving, but so slowly as to be indiscernible.  As I changed my position, I looked down at my feet for a moment, and when I returned my gaze to the object, it was no longer there.  I looked southward of where I had been looking and I thought I detected it somewhat lower in the sky but the same flashing pattern was evident, so I thought I had re-detected it.  I studied its location in the sky for a few minutes but could not detect any motion, and after awhile I went inside, it being quite chilly out and it was getting late.

It was similar to a typical satellite in its appearance and speed and it tracked rapidly on a heading of about 100 degrees; just a little to the right of due east.  The brightness was steady and there were no rotating beacons, sound, nor change of colors noticed. The object tracked at about 100 degrees for approximately one minute, then angled to a new heading of approximately 120 degrees.  It remained on this heading for only about 30 seconds when it made another angular change to a heading of about 140 degrees, where it was at an elevation of about 45 degrees or thereabout. The object dimmed after about 15 seconds and was no longer visible.  It did not go behind a cloud.  From this, I gathered that it was a reflected light and the object dimmed as it moved into the earth's shadow.  This meant that the object was at considerable altitude and, by the short duration, was traveling rapidly.

The bright light was of an orange/yellow tint.  The object was not moving but rather hovering in one spot.  Shortly after the driver noticed the light was dimming.  After the light dimmed out it turned a very vivid orange color and began to move very fast.  Then as it got further away red lights began to circle the bottom of the craft giving away its shape.  It looked like an upside down top.  While it was moving away we noticed an airplane traveling directly for the object which was so close that we thought they would crash.  Then we noticed three other objects in the sky as the main one got further away.  The other three consisted of a very bright white light that blinked inconsistantly in different blinking patterns, all of which were hovering.  Once those began to move they also began to change color  (mainly red, orange, and yellow).  As they got further in the distance we realized that all four objects were traveling in the same direction.  After the objects were covered by the trees, we began to travel further down the road when the passenger in the back noticed another object towards the left of the road which was a bright red at first and then changed to an orange color.

They were arranged in a very flat triangle quite closely resembling Aries' three brightest stars in overall shape moving from northwest to southeast.  The lead 'star' corresponded to the one furthest from the other two and was easternmost of the triad.  It was the faintest at a maximum magnitude of about 4.0-4.5.  The central object was brighter by about half a magnitude and always was to the WNW of the leading object.  The final object was brightest at magnitude 3.0-3.5 and was always positioned almost straight west of the central object.  Compared to the other satellites I saw tonight, the triad moved more slowly, covering about 10° in a minute.  The spread of the objects was about 1/4 the actual size of Aries, covering maybe 2° in total width.  The objects passed below naked eye visability a few degrees above Sagittarius, possibly blocked by a thin cloud that was covering that part of the sky.  There was no deviation from straight-line flight, nor was there any changes of relative positioning of the three component lights.  Aside from some scattered clouds, the skies were steady with only minimal light polution near the horizon.  The Milky-Way was very clearly visible, and stars were visible to below 6th magnitude.  Seeing was excellent with virtually no turbulence (stars weren't twinkling). I also have a very old record of another sighting I made in 1979, coincidentally in the area of Ophiuchus by Serpens Caput, but that time the objects were definitely not satellites, as they stopped and reversed direction.

On a perfectly clear starry night we observed 4 objects streaking across the sky from the southwest to the northeast. As they approached, all in the formation changed speed and position with the trailing object second from the right overtaking the other 3. As this happened, all four came to a stop, the one in the lead circled back around, making a right hand turn. This stop and turn took less than a half second. All 4 objects then streaked away to the north/northwest at an incredible rate of speed. The entire event lasted less than 4 seconds, all four objects crossed the entire visible sky in this time. The altitude of these objects looked to be at least at the extreme limits of the atmosphere.  To give a relation of the amount of time involved, I saw the objects racing across the sky and told my brother to ""Look at that!"" and before I could say ""meteor"" the objects stopped, one in the lead made a semi circle right hand turn to line itself back in the formation and the other 3 made a 90 degree left turn and raced out of sight. Each object was reddish orange in color and roughly the size of a bright star in the sky. None left a trail, they resembled a satelite as it tracks across the sky, but the speed of them along with stopping, circling and changing directions in split seconds leaves this out as anything manmade.  A few minutes later, a jet airplane took a similar route but took approximately 7 minutes to cover a lesser portion of the sky, I mention this as a speed comparison only. The only other object I've ever seen with comparable speed were shooting stars. None of these stop or change directions though. All the shooting stars I've ever witnessed also left a trail. These objects left nothing in their wake, no trail no sound. Just incredible raw speed and manuverabilty.  The 4 objects were not trailing one another but were in a formation, roughly equal distances apart and varied speed that changed their position as to which was leading. When 3 came to a stop, it was only long enough for the one that overran the formation to circle back, the 3 that momentairily stopped immediatley resumed the speed from before and raced out of site.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,31.8035,-96.0894

I had passed Britannia when I noticed a large red light coming into view from the top of my windshield, travelling in the same direction I was, above the land on the left side of the road. My first thought was that it was moving too fast to be an airplane, and it looked too low to the ground. I slowed my car down and kept switching between watching it and the road in front of me - I was curious enough to want to figure out whether or not it was an airplane or something else. The red light was large and it didn't blink in and out like an airplane - it pulsed, and on each pulse the light grew brighter and larger. It seemed to have stopped in the distance, as the light wasn't receding anymore. I turned my full concentration to driving a few bends in the road ahead and I noticed it started moving again, veering towards the right onto the fields on the side of the road closest to me. While it was turning I thought I could make out a bit of blue light on the side of it. I was trying to keep tabs on it but my view was then blocked by a close tree line. I saw it disappear behind the tree line and thought it had vanished. When the tree line ended, opening onto a long stretch of field, I was amazed to see it hovering above the middle of the field closest to the road, between 50-100 feet off the ground. The red light was still large, I honestly can't remember if it was still pulsing, and I could distinctly make out a strip of rectangular blue lights along the side of it. There was absolutely no noise coming from it, and the shape of it was hard to make out. Other than the lights, the rest of it blended into the night exceptionally well and the surface of it must have been non-reflective. Judging from its distance from the road, whatever it was couldn't have been much larger than a helicopter. It was too small to be a plane, too silent to be a helicopter, and I really don't think it's a military plane. When I was watching it in the field, the car behind me suddenly slowed down enough to make me wonder whether or not they had spotted what I was watching. I kept wondering whether or not I should stop and turn around. In the end, I just kept on driving. The sighting occurred on Tremaine Rd between Brittania Rd W and 2nd Sideroad - the last I saw of the disk it was above the field on the west side of Tremaine between Lower Base Line W and 2nd Sideroad.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,43.38223451178451,-79.82626717171718

While it was traveling, it was a blue-green fireball with a good tail that faded fast.  When it stopped, it kept its blue-green color around it, in a circular shape, then proceeed on a western course.   It had to have been in the upper stratosphere, it had no noise to it. Not even 3 minutes after the object leaves, an aircraft was out circling the area where I had seen it.  At first I thought, well maybe its  just a student pilot, or an aircraft shooting an approach out at Tinker AFB. The aircraft was some sort of jet, i could hear it from the car, and it was more than likley a fighter (f-16's and f-15's are at tinker) because of the high angle banks it was making.   Also, that area where the jet was flying around is not an authorized training point for fighter jets, so all I can think is that this object was picked up on radar and a jet was sent to go check it out.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,35.3482,-97.1996

Complex lighting system and lack of conventional engine noise. Jan. 03, 2008  To whom it may concern:   I would like to report a sighting. The sighting event started at approximately 12:20am this morning January 03, 2008. Before going to bed last night I stepped outside on our front porch. We live in a rural residential neighborhood outside of the Charlotte, NC area. Temperature was in the 30’s and it was a clear night. We are on a cul-de-sac so there was no traffic or other noise. I began to notice on the horizon a bright white light approaching from the south and being familiar with CLT landing pattern assumed it was a larger jet on approach. The light did not appear to be moving towards the airport but directly towards me. I kept waiting for the noise of a jet, but then began to expect hearing a copter noise because of how slow the object was moving. It all of a sudden seemed then to be moving perpendicular to my location in front of me. This craft appeared to be ¼ to ½ mile away from me and an estimated 800 ft. in altitude.  It was hard to get a perspective of the size because it was dark but judging by the lights I would estimate maybe 75 ft long by 20 ft high. I am not sure of width because of direction traveling. The most fascinating observations about this sighting were the lights on the craft and the lack of noise. In regards to the noise, there was a faint hum/rumble, I say rumble because I could tell and felt that it was powerful. The lighting on the craft was very foreign to me. I have been pursuing my pilot’s and flown with my father for the past twenty-five years so I am familiar with plane/copter lighting configurations. On the front of the craft, which appeared to compose ¼ of its height was a bright white light, but it wasn’t white. It looked like one of the H.I.D (High Intensity Discharge) lighting systems found on higher end vehicles these days. The intensity however was much stronger that automobile types. This light appeared to move along the side of the craft from front to half way down the length of the craft in a sweep. It would do this slowly back and forth. In the middle belly of ! the craf t there looked to be a strobe and red light. The main body and tail/aft section had four red lights staggered in a diamond. On the rear there was a bright white/blue light. This describes the craft from what I saw and the light configuration on the craft. Again, the lack of engine noise was very impressive. The craft moved slowly away from my sight and then turned north and disappeared at a quicker pace and I heard more rumble, but not that of a turbine jet engine.  The entire sighting lasted approximately ten minutes.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,35.074,-81.2129

(We are about 15 miles west of O'Hare International Airport and we have a lot of geese this time of year).  Based on the comparison of the geese flight and the airliner, it looked to be considerably higher than the airliner.  The airliner was 15 miles west of O'Hare and continuing west and looked to be about 10,000 feet and climbing.  The object crossed paths with it, so we had a great angle to judge this by.  As for the object's appearance, it was pitch black with no reflective surface on this very sunny, clear day.  The airliner by contrast was very reflective and bright. Because of this matte, black appearance we would only be guessing at the object's real shape.  Because of the distance, our eyes condensed it to ""circular"".  I called the Great Lakes Regional FAA Center in DesPlaines, IL.  They passed me to their operations center and took my name and phone number.  We as a group are certain this was no normal aircraft.  *It was higher than 10,000 feet, ruling out birds. *Because of this height, the size had to be considerably large. *It was matte black and non-reflective, ruling out weather balloons or commercial aircraft. *It was clearly odd-shaped, not conforming to normal silhouettes.  We could make out neither wings nor fuselage. *It left no contrail. (Neither did the passenger jet)",2007-06-12T00:00:00,,

I happened to look in the driver’s side mirror, at the traffic backing up behind me, and noticed something in the distance in the sky. At first I thought it was an airplane or helicopter, as the area isn’t far from O’Hare Airport, but I noticed that it had a sort of orangish-white glow to it, and as it very slowly horizontally moved along across the clear blue sky, I could see it had a shape that reminded me of a thimble. The size of it was from where I was sitting in my car about the size of my pinky-finger nail from about an arm and a half-length’s away.

Dandenong) - but only after seemingly seeing it split  into two parts - with a much smaller (similarly shaped) part splintering off and making a sharp downward trajectory which is where I ultimately lost vision of it as well as the original (larger) object.

Circulating light in sky followed our direction  for a distance of 30 miles.,Logan- Columbus,OH,2008-06-28T23:15:00,light,25 minutes,"Occurred : 6/28/2008 23:15  (Entered as : 6/28/2008 23:15) Reported: 6/30/2008 10:39:25 AM 10:39 Posted: 7/5/2008 Location: Logan- Columbus, OH Shape: Light Duration:25 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64214.html,"Circulating light in sky followed our direction  for a distance of 30 miles. Saturday evening, my husband and I were travelling back to Columbus from Marietta.  As we were driving through Logan, around 11:15 pm, my husband noticed out of his window some light activity in the clouds.   I looked and saw the same thing. At first we both assumed it was a spotlight of some sort because the light kept going in a circle.  For the entire duration of the activity, not once did we ever see a solid beam from the ground.  Not once. We continued to follow 33 west from Logan all the way into Columbus / Canal winchester and for 30 miles,  the light followed alongside our left.  As we lost sight of it, our clock  read 11:53pm    I am a science major and my husband and I are both very reasonable, logical people, raising 4 children which forces us to pay attention to everything. After reasoning that there is no way a spotlight from Logan could have stayed beside us for 30 miles +,    Our next assumption was that it had to be some type of craft, just above the clouds. The light we were watching went in consistently large circles the entire time, 30 minutes, as if it were running along the outside/underside of a circular craft, very large at that. At times it seemed to go faster and then slower, but always in circles. I was seated in the passenger seat.  The circulating light would lag behind our vehicle a bit and I had to turn my head toward the back windows to see it,  then it would jump ahead where I could look out in front of the vehicle and see it clearly out of the window,  in front and next to my husband.  At these times of speed change of the craft, we were driving a straight course of road, so it was not our direction changing, the craft itself was moving. My husband was frustrated that he couldnt get a lengthy glimpse of it to evaluate more throughly what it could be, and so I even held the wheel for him so he could take a longer look for himself.    Again,  we are both well educated individuals.   His father was a pilot, and I am studying Astronomy, and therefore we both have amatuer knowledge normal aircraft.  This was nothing that could be explained by logical events. Because I like answers to the questions I have, I even did a web search to be sure there werent any grand openings in the area. (Even tho there is seriously no possible way that any light could travel alongside of our vehicle for 30 miles,  and have been from any stationary object,)   I did the search , because I wanted to make sure.  There was nothing of the sort, and therefore eliminated that possibility We mentioned telephoning Rickenbacher airport Base to alert them of an unidentified craft approaching their airspace, but when Ive inquired with them before, I didnt get very far.   They are a military installation and so I understand why some information is not public. If I were to assume the size of the craft, around which the light was running,   I would say it was easily the size of at least 2 football fields.      The light did not fade, or stop, or reverse directions or anything.   It went in cirlces,  and looked as if it were on the underside of a giant circular/disk object that was very very large. It travelling just above the clouds so we could not see the craft itself. It followed route 33 into Canal Winchester, at which point my husband and I had to head north, but the light continued following 33 until we could not see it anymore. Very baffling how a light followed our path, in the sky for a distance of 30 whole miles.   I have never seen anything that lasted that long before.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,,

We keep up to date on these sightings and talk about the subject often.  Earlier in the evening, we had discussed what took place at the Surry powerplant just a week or two ago. During the early morning of June 3rd, 2008, My friend and I were out in the street observing what we believed to be either Venus or Jupiter (I can't remember which) in the South-Western sky through my telescope.  After observing for a short while, we began to joke around and just look at the stars. A few minutes later my friend alerted me to the sky directly overhead, where there was a faint moving object.  Upon inspection with my 10x50 binoculars, I was able to observe the object move smoothly across the sky, and then fade away.  It appeared to be very high, and shone like a dim star.  We have witnessed these objects in the past.  We decided to lay on the ground and look at the sky to see if anything else happened. We were both looking at the same area in the sky when a bright, but focused flash of light occurred, which we both observed.  I quickly inspected the area with my binoculars just in time to observe another object, this one a little brighter than the last.  It also faded away after a short period of around 20 seconds.  A few minutes later there was another flash in the same area of the sky (to the North East), but this time I was not able to observe an object. A short time later, we witnessed what I can only describe as a ""skipping"" bright light flashing across the sky.  The light flashed brightly for a moment while moving extremely fast across the sky.  It was not a meteorite, as the object flashed, and then flashed again further along its path, and then flashed 3 more times as it flew further away (from the southwest to the northeast).  It was at this point that my friend's brother (just inside the house nearby) called to see what we were doing outside.  We told him of the situation, and he came out quickly. No activity was present for a while, so we again observed Venus/Jupiter.  After a few minutes, I had a very strange urge to look at the sky.  I looked up to the north almost directly overhead and witnessed a bright spherical object, as bright as the brighter stars in the sky, moving to the south.  I observed it in the binoculars.  All 3 of us observed it as it crossed overhead.  At the moment it was nearly above us, the object's light increased greatly in intensity, at least 2 or 3 fold, until it was the brightest star in the sky, and then dimmed back out.  It was around for the longest duration of all of the objects, 30 seconds or more.  My friend and I were almost ecstatic at the sighting, as we had been waiting for something like this for quite a while. My friends and I are active observers of the sky.  We often sit out at night and watch for phenomena like these.  We have never witnessed anything like what we saw this evening.  We have witnessed a few faint objects before, but nothing conclusive.  These objects were unlike any others that we have seen in the night sky.  Interestingly enough, we often go out to the Colonial Parkway across from the Surry Powerplant to lay on the grass and observe the sky (we have witnessed objects in the sky there, but nothing like what was reported recently).

I hesitate to even admit to seeing what I saw a couple of days ago (for one I am not a believer in that there are UFO's from out of space and secondly I wouldn't call this a significant finding but am curious if anyone else saw this.)   My wife and I were heading out to take the kids to the dentist and while driving my wife and I (without even having to say hey look at that) saw a very shiny silver object in the sky.  My immediate answer to her was, ""yeah, it is an airplane."", especially considering the airport is in the same direction.   Although answering her this away I still was keeping an eye on it because it didn't appear to be moving and we had such a clear view of this as well.  I pulled over into a parking lot to get a better look and NO where could you locate this object.   We both looked every where in the sky and could not locate the object again.  We both know that on some days if an airplane is way way in the sky it can appear to come in and out, this was not way in the sky.  It was high enough to be an airplane but it was low enough to have a great view, especially on a sunny day and no clouds in the sky.   My wife does believe in these type things.  I myself am an IT professional and have been brought up in a manner not to believe in these sorts of things.  Will be curious to keep checking updates to see if anyone else happened to have seen the same object.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,,

It was a very clear night, and I was just stargazing while I smoked a cigarette. I noticed a bright light streak across the sky directly above me.  My first thoughts of the white streak was it might be a missile.  But then I realized it had no sound, and only lasted at most, 2 seconds.  The missile thoughts came to mind because over the past year, and more so in recent months, we have had numerous fly overs at EXTREMELY low altitudes of fighter jets, blackhawk helicopters, and cargo planes.  I actually have a photo of a fighter jet flying over, and as recently as June 1st, a formation fly over occured.  I ran inside and got my 12 year old brother, hoping maybe he could catch a glimpse of something to prove I wasn't going crazy at 23 years old!  Of course, my younger brother mocked me because of what I had seen.  Within 20 minutes of being outside again, we both saw a streak of light go across the sky.  From our vantage point, it moved east to west.  It was green in color, and seemed to skip over parts of the sky, as if it disappeared and reappeared right in front of us!  It covered a large distance in a matter of 6 seconds, at most.  My brother was amazed. We decided to stay outside and try to see even more.  Ten minutes went by, and then we both noticed another streak go overhead.  It was white in color and gone within a second.  We both rushed inside and were a little shaken by the sights we had seen. I coaxed my girlfriend outside late June 7th because she thought I was going insane.  It was a clear night once again.  We watched the stars slowly appear as the sun went down.  We noticed the moon to the west and saw saturn and venus closely next to the moon.  As we panned across the sky, going west to east we noticed what we thought was a star... Moving!  We could barely see it, but could easily see the movement.  It moved very subtle, very slow, and within about 6 seconds it was completely gone. Last night, June 10th, I decided to go outside and sit on our back porch.  It was around 1:15 a.m.  I noticed the green streak again!  It appeared to be moving towards the ground, in intervals like the previous sightings.  It was farther east, in the direction of Holly Springs, MS.  I went back inside, and that's where I stayed. I've gotten curious whether or not anyone else around the Memphis, TN area or northwest Mississippi area has seen the things I have witnessed within the last week or so.

The blinds were about 1/3 to 1/2 open at the time.  The witness said the object was above the one story building next door.  It sat stationary for 15 seconds then it took off in northernly direction in a diagonal upward direction.  It was gone within 1 sec and the observer stated the light left a visual trail during that departure.  Possible visual after-effect.  Witness claims no head movement during this departure sequence as best as she could remember.   The witness reported no change in the size or shape during the entire visual encounter.

The witness then went up to the window to open the blinds futher and then looked and saw nothing more for one minute.

The radius of these turns was small, and very smooth.  As the aircraft approached, I notices green wing-tip lights as opposed to the customary red left wing, green right wing tips.

At this point I went back in my house and called for my wife and nephew to come and see this amazing sight out the back window.  We all three then looked out the back window but only one light was visible at this point so we all three decided to go outside for a better view.   Once outside we could still only see one light which had remained in the same spot since I first saw it and which was still not making any sound.

Dazed deer present. I’ve had 6 sightings in my life, but none as good as this one. I had recently sold my car, where I kept a nice set of binoculars for the sole purpose of looking at a UFO closer if and when I saw another one, and was now driving the family van with my two kids on our way to get gasoline, and then to the store.   This particular evening was fairly clear, and, as I was driving down a slightly winding street to get onto a major street, I saw an orange object just above the tree line that, during the brief moment I had to see it, first made me think of the moon when it's low on the horizon and has an orange glow, the way it looks during an lunar eclipse.  However, I felt that the moon should be a bigger, and also that it wasn't in the direction of the sky where the moon usually is, so I looped around the other neighborhood streets and came back up the same street, slower, to get a second look. Sure enough, when I saw it again, there was no mistaking it, it was definitely a hovering UFO similar to one whose picture was taken on December 21, 1994, by Carlos Diaz, so I turned off my headlights, came to a stop where I had the best view, lowered the windows, and turned off the van. Believe me when I tell you that based on the terrain of this area, even though it's surrounded by houses, businesses, a high school, and a very busy major street, where this UFO was hovering was not observable except for about 50 yards on this one street where I was parked. I told my kids to look at the object, and told them it was a spaceship.  They were 3 and 5 years old at the time, and though innocent, they were very interested in hearing about a real spaceship, especially because they were fans of the movie Toy Story. The object was not a thin disk or cigar shaped.  Honestly, it looked a lot more like a slightly squashed lemon, except with two ""nipples"" on either side instead of a stem on one side and a nipple on the other.  It glowed a uniform orange, and it had white beacon lights, one on top, and one on the bottom, across its perpendicular axis.  It had a row of very small white lights across its horizontal axis, dividing the craft equally above and below.  The beacon lights were blinking about 3 times per second but not in sync with each other.  The object was about 3 stories off the ground, and less than a mile away from us, but I really can't estimate the exact distance.  I would say somewhere between half a mile and a mile.  I could not make out any more detail, and believe me; I REALLY missed not having my binoculars that day. I had a red laser pointer on me that I use at work, and my son asked me to point it at the object, but I ignored him.  He happened to have a flashlight that he'd gotten recently in his pocket, so before I knew it, he had taken it out and turned it on to point it at ""them"".  I moved his arm down, gently, but he could see I was being cautious.  He asked why I didn't want to signal them, and I said that I wasn't sure it was a good idea.  In my mind, I was thinking, ""I don't know if they are good or bad, and I don't want to inadvertently volunteer my kids to become regular abductees.""  I was also thinking, ""Man, if only my kids weren't here, I'd get out of this van and run to get a closer look, but I'm trapped under these circumstances.""  Anyway, to make a long story short, we watched this object for at least 3 minutes, and it was just hovering there, so in my impatience to get a closer look, I remembered a business parking lot that was adjacent (left of the object from our point of view) to the forest that this object was hovering over, and I thought, ""If I time the signal light properly, I can quickly race the van to make the left turn, go down a block or two into the business parking lot, and then drive to the edge of the parking lot closest to the object. Perhaps from there I can see it closer through the trees"", so without hesitating much, that's what I did.  As I raced the van and the trees blocked my view, the last glimpse I caught of the object was that it was still hovering in the same place, so I was very hopeful of being able to get a better look. However, when I got into the business parking lot, I found a big surprise - there were no less than 50, and probably more like 100 deer in the parking lot, and they were in a dazed, almost frozen state.  They moved very little, to the point that I had to steer around a few of them to avoid hitting them.  That in itself was remarkable, and only reinforced my belief that this object was not human-made, that the occupants had somehow put these deer in a trance.   After finally getting to where I thought I could see the object, I was disappointed to find out that I could not see it anywhere, so as fast as I could, again avoiding the deer in my way, I worked my way back to where I was before, and unfortunately the object was now gone.   After this event, my son drew a picture of what he saw, and it was essentially what I saw.  Both my children still remember the event, even though my daughter was so young, perhaps because we've retold it several times, but I certainly don't want them to forget it.

If I ever run into it, I'll scan it and send it to you.   My apologies for not having kept better records.  I considered contacting an investigator from MUFON way back then to check woods below where the object was hovering, but I never did.  I was no willing to put my children in any type of danger.

The tail would grow to about the length of my thumb and then recede back into the star. The effect almost looked similar to that of say, a jet afterburner being turned on and then off. The object appeared to be about the same height as aircraft flying, I would guess around 30,000 feet? However, it did not appear as though it was a star. It made no sound or noise and was stationary during this time.  I watched the object and this tail grow and then shrink slowly (maybe the process of its tail going back into it took about 30 seconds, hard to recall). for about 20 minutes. I then checked into a nearby hotel, the Hampton Inn, and told the woman at the front desk about what was outside. She said people sometimes see weird things all the time and followed me out into the parking lot. When she looked up, she saw the object as well and remarked that it appeared to be changing colors, red, orange, and I believe yellow.  After that I decided to take my 35mm camera and drive west on I-180, back towards the desert and away from any lights, to take some photos of the object. I wanted to be sure that I captured it as best as possible so I took the photos with the aperture left open for around 30 seconds. Unfortunately I did not have a tripod when taking the photos and tried to position it on the ground braced against my jacket. Some of the photos, it is apparent that there is movement from the camera itself. Other photos clearly show the “tail” in question. After taking photos for roughly 15 minutes and beginning to get creeped out (I was in the middle of the desert and it was probably 12:30 or 1:00am) I saw a plane begin to approach the vicinity of the object. At this point, the object started to move in I think was an S type pattern. After that I was too freaked out to stay out “alone” in the desert and headed back towards town and the comfort of my hotel room.  A few days later I arrived in Los Angeles (my destination), and had the photos developed at a 1 hour photo lab. I specified that the negatives not be cut so that they could be scanned at some point.

I know what a fighter jet looks like at 600 MPH and the sound it makes.  I'm surprised I even saw this object but when I looked up for some reason there was this object whizzing overhead and ascending up and out of site away from me at a speed faster than anything I have ever witnessed.

The strangest thing about the lights was the formation.  It was as if they were on a flat surface facing us directly.  To better explain, if this had been a plane, it would have been as if  the plane's nose was pointing directly upward from the ground and we were looking at the bottom/top of the plane.  Even after it had gotten farther away, the lights were still in this perfect triangular shape.

As I walked my dog down the street, I could only see 3 or 4 stars in the sky, the moon (about ¾ full), but the rest was just blackness.  I walked back down the street and glanced back up at the sky at the base of the driveway. Still, only those few stars and the moon were out. I walked about 5 steps up my driveway, taking about 6 seconds to do so, and I happened to glance back up. Out of nowhere, a jet stream-like cloud (?) had appeared and the sky had opened up to reveal 20-30 more stars, including the full constellation of Orion. The whole sky had seemingly opened up with light from the moon (which seemed much brighter for some reason). The line passed across the sky horizontally, slightly curved and bended in some places, but tightly packed and not dispersing. I quickly realized that it was moving to the left, and it was moving quite quickly. I saw that the band of cloud was below Orion’s belt and moving slightly upwards as it continued to move to the left.  Within another minute or so, it was directly on the belt, and not more than a minute or two later, it was above the entire constellation, and still moving fast, not at all like anything I’d ever seen before. On the right, I could see the end of it clearly now, which was dispersing slightly. Looking to the left, I could see that it went on for some while in a solid line, bending here and there, but remaining entirely and completely tight and not spreading out or fading away like a normal jet stream would. I continued to watch it for another minute and tried to get a picture, but it didn’t come out, even with the use of a very strong flash. I saw that the line was starting to look a bit fuzzier than when I’d first glimpsed it, and the end of the line had passed over the house now, leaving all those bright glittering stars as the only things in the sky directly above my house. I walked out into the street for a better view and saw in the distance that the line was very fuzzy now, but somehow still remaining in a distinct squiggly fas! hion, li ke it’d only been blurred, not smudged or erased. I ran inside and tried to look out the back balcony and see if the cloud (or whatever it was) was still moving in the same direction. It was gone, the sky looked slightly fuzzier and not as clear and sharp as when I’d first looked up, but the stars that weren’t there 10 minutes ago were still twinkling shining brightly as ever.

It wasn't a plane beacuse it was a lot bigger and it didn't make any noise. For a few moments I thought it might have been a meteor rite. It was coming towards me and it looked like it was going to fly over my neighborhood, but instead it turned upwards and started to rise towards a patch of clouds. There was a break in the clouds and it flew up through them, and then into another higher patch of clouds and disappeared until I couldn’t see it anymore.  A few minutes after that I heard one or two millatary jets fly over out of the opposite direction in the West over my head towards where I seen the light go into clouds. I couldn’t see them though cause there was more clouds that moved in.  I described everything on the phone to my friend as I was seeing it.  I’m not sure what it was…  It could have been.  A very large falling star... slow moving (for a fallinf star) that kinda fell/flew but then ascended upward back into the clouds.  A plane with a huge bright light bigger then the plane strapped on the front.  I ruled out it being a satellite or the space station cause it was under the clouds and sorta low and in mid sky within the earth’s atmosphere.  To me it’s a UFO… that’s what I got the feeling that it was, by the shape of it, and because it was Unidentified, Flying, and it was an Object.  The best I can describe it is a bright star that looked like Venus does on a good night which is what it looked like at first. Only it got 50 times bigger as it got closer. I could tell it was bigger then a plane it was glowing like a golden bright white light, oval and round in shape. It didn't make any sound. The maneuvers it made by flying towards me horizontally and then it moved upwards vertically into the clouds have to say that there was something was piloting it.

While I was driving it seemed as though I was getting closer to it, and I could see that it was in fact three round, white lights that formed a triangle. It was locked in the sky as though it was stationary, and I wondered if it were a radio tower.  As I drove closer I could see it better. The three lights made a triangle where the point of the triangle was the top light, and two lights were below it geometrically. The lights were very close to each other.  As I got even nearer, I noticed that while the sky was black, I could make out a darker black in between and around the lights. The lights were definitely attatched to something that was darker than the night sky, although I couldn't make out that shape.  Unexpectedly, the three lights seemed to turn off, or go out, or even turn around.  In their place was a single, smaller red light that was not as bright as the white lights. I could still see the darker black form, and it appeared the red light was attatched to it.  At this point, the light started to move away from me.  It was no longer stationary.  All I could see was the red light, and I watched as it flew away, slightly upwards, growing smaller and smaller until I couldn't see it anymore.  All of this lasted about 5 minutes.

It caught my attention at approx. 3:05 am in the western sky in the lower horizon seeming to be going up heading west to north. At first I thought it was someones special effects launch like a Sky Lantern round and brightly colored reddish orange like the color of Mars in the sky but as I directed my friends attention to the object we noticed that it began to move from west to east staying consistent in color and brightness. There were no clouds a slight breeze and was very clear. As we watched it move I noticed and confirmed this with my friend that there was a faint short very fine orange mist particle trail behind it. I have seen many meteorites of all shapes and sizes and have seen space debris burn up upon earths re-entry. I have seen all types of missiles and rockets and it wasn't a helicopter or any kind of current aircraft I have ever seen. This was none of the above! We watched as the device moved across the early morning night sky for approx 3 Min's. It for a moment became brighter and turned slightly whiteish then disappeared in the lower middle of the sky. It re-appeared approx. 15-20 sec later at it's last location for about 30 sec then disappeared again. We continued to watch for it to re-appear but never did again. Around 5 Min's later there was a sonic boom! About 3 Min's after the object disappeared there was a commercial passenger jet approaching from the northwest heading towards where we last seen the object. The sonic boom cam 2 Min's after the jet.

My job is security. At approximately 8:28pm, I stepped outside to lock up a conference trailer on my company’s property. After I locked up the trailer and began to walk away, I glanced up towards the moon, almost directly overhead, and I was surprised to see what appeared to be four red lights crossing the sky at a slow but steady pace. I stopped and stared upwards at the lights. They seemed to be traveling from north to south in a straight line. I couldn’t see what the lights were attached to. I couldn’t see the shape of any kind of aircraft. I couldn’t tell how high or how low they were in the sky, however if it was one solid object and it was very high, then that would meen it was very big as well. The lights easily stretched out to cover the sky about ten moons wide. They were also very quiet. If they made any sound, it could have been the sound of a commercial airliner passing at a very high altitude overhead, a very faint and distant sound, although that sound could have easily been confused with the low hum of A/C units on top of a nearby office building as well. I'm not sure the object(s) made any sound at all. The lights did not blink, nor were they were not very bright. They were almost faint in the sky, easy to miss unless you glance up and happened to spot it. They did not have the normal navigation lights you expect to see on any commercial aircraft. There were no strobe lights, no green lights to show what side of the aircraft you might be viewing. They did seem to be traveling to my left, but keep in mind they were practically overhead too. I still should have seen a green light next to each red light if these were planes in formation. It is possible that these were military fighter jets with an different light configuration than what civilians are used to seeing, but these seemed to move slower than I would have expected to see and I actually am used to seeing fighter jets at night. I was in the Navy and lived near Mira Mar in San Diego. I’m used to hearing the jets clear! ly and s eeing a blue light with a white strobe. At least, that’s what I’m used to seeing over the city at night. As I continued to watch the lights, a few moments into observing all this, I realized I might be witnessing a UFO sighting and so I quickly tried to gather any more information I could before the lights flew out of sight. I was too far from my truck to grab my camera. None of the security cameras pointed straight up. I realized my eyes would be the only thing I could rely on to remember this by. My first thought was to look at each light closely. What each light seemed to be was a set of three lights. There were two bright red lights with a white light in the middle. That white light seemed to be dimmer than the red lights by comparison, but also seemed to be on the leading edge of each set. The next thing I tried to determine before it got too far was if what I was seeing was a formation of aircraft or one solid object. I jogged back a few steps until a bright enough star was in it’s path. I stopped when the upper two sets of lights seemed to be getting close to that star. Halfway between the two sets of lights, the star disappeared for a moment. It seemed to me at that point that what I was seeing was one solid chevron shaped object. The whole sighting took maybe 15 to 20 seconds before the lights went over the horizon and behind the building I was standing near. I ran to the far edge of the building to get a few more seconds of viewing, but the lights were too far gone by that point. I could not see any more. I asked around, but I was the only person who saw this. I reported this to the Carlsbad Police Department and to Channel 6 News in San Diego. I will include an image I drew of the sighting. I am 29 years old, Ex-Navy, a trained observer, and I’ve worked at that location, near Palomar Airport, for at least 4 years. I have never seen lights like this, not here or anywhere else for that matter. I'd also like to note that cloud cover moved in later that night and the direction of the wind seemed t! o go aga inst the direction these lights were traveling.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,33.12780664961637,-117.30352710997443

Report on UFO Sighting 18 July, 2007, 12:45 P.M. M.D.T. El Paso, Texas  	At approximately 12:45 P.M. local time on July 18, 2007, I was riding my motorcycle north on Hueco Tanks Road in far-east El Paso County, Texas. Visibility was unlimited to the north, ahead of me. The sky was perfectly clear with no clouds visible in that area at all. About forty degrees above the horizon and slightly to my west I saw a flat, disk-shaped object. It appeared to be immobile, and that is what attracted my attention. It was precisely on the glide-path to El Paso International Airport, and at first glance, I assumed it was a traditional aircraft. But after watching it for perhaps five seconds, I decided that that was not the case: it did not appear to be moving, though I cannot swear to that, since I myself was traveling at sixty miles per hour. Its shape—a disk, flat top and bottom and squared off at each end, like three quarters stacked atop one another—precluded the possibility that it was any aircraft with which I am familiar. 	I observed this craft for perhaps thirty seconds from this perspective: edge-on. Then a startling thing happened: the craft banked to the left about eighty degrees and presented me with a virtually perfect view of its top surface (or perhaps its bottom surface). Still it did not appear to be moving horizontally. My vision is perfect, conditions were perfect, and I was able to get a crystal-clear sighting of this object. It was delta shaped, coming to a point at one end and flat at the other. It was not an equilateral triangle: the two sides leading to the point were somewhat longer than was the third side, by perhaps twenty-five percent or a third. In simple terms, it looked like an arrowhead. It was metallic, resembling what I can best describe as brushed stainless steel or aluminum. In other words, it was reflective and shiny, but not brilliantly so. There were no indentations or irregularities whatsoever on its perimeter. I saw no ports or evidence of openings of any kind. There was nothing to suggest any leading aerodynamic edges to indicate wings. It was a very simple, delta-shaped object with three flat sides forming its perimeter. 	Safety dictated that I glance down at the road to make sure I was still in my lane. This consumed only a fraction of a second. When I looked back toward the object, it was gone—just gone. Whether it disappeared or flew away at high speed I cannot say. I heard nothing. One fraction of a second it was there, and the next fraction of a second it was not there. If it did in fact fly away, it must have traveled at immense speed, because I could see for many miles in all directions. I scanned the sky thoroughly for quite some time, until I was convinced it was truly not there. There are some mountains in this area, but they are not large, and the object was far too high in the sky to have been obscured by any of them. That is, in my opinion, simply not a possibility. I observed the object in its banked position for perhaps fifteen seconds. As to its distance from me, that is very hard to say. I would estimate that it consumed three or perhaps four solar diameters from my perspective: similar to holding three stacked quarters between your fingers at arms length. My gut feeling is that it was quite close, because I saw it in such great detail. If it had been far away, atmospheric haze would have obscured some of that detail. I could literally see the degree of polish on its surface. This afternoon, 19 July, I called Air Traffic Control at El Paso International Airport. I spoke with an air traffic controller, asking him if anyone had reported anything unusual on radar at the time in question. He told me that no one had submitted a report, but then he went on to virtually confirm my sighting. I made no mention at all of the fact that the object I had seen had disappeared—he mentioned it. He told me that even if someone had seen something, IF IT HAD DISAPPEARED, they probably would have ignored it and not submitted a report. This seems to me to constitute some degree of confirmation. I am fifty-seven years old, a college instructor of Political Science, and had never before seen anything that I would consider a UFO. Frankly, I did not believe that they existed, though I was intrigued by the evidence. I will admit that since childhood, I have believed that we are not alone in this vast universe. But I never believed that we had been visited. I believe it now. 			",2007-08-07T00:00:00,31.7923281835206,-106.3748488764045

Also wish to state that I am not drawing conclusions as to what I saw, but I am documenting this so that other witnesses may corroborate with my account. On my way back to my car after work, I turned my head skyward briefly. The night was a little cloudy but some stars were viewable above me. I focused in on one of the fainter stars (I am not into astronomy – star is a dim orange colour in the high vertical east bound sky of the ACT) and a shooting star happened to fly pass. This did not amaze me much, as I recall seeing what really was a shooting star just a few nights earlier outside my house. What did amaze me is that this object, while appearing to have the same relative looking speed of a shooting star, continued to remain in view without the characteristic fadeout of a shooting star. This suggested to me that the object is upper atmosphere, possibly higher. My amazement ended and astonishment began when a second shooting star like object tailed, accelerated and caught up to the original object. The second object moved in on the first object and produced the trajectory of a side-facing parabola – something like stunt pilots would execute. The first object then circled around at a very high speed in a wide arc, but only completed about ninety percent of the circular turn. As I was focusing on the sudden – and frankly mind boggling – acrobatics of the first object, I lost sight of the second. The first object disappeared in its incomplete turn. The whole experience felt like about ten seconds all up. I have no idea what I saw, but I can tell you it was no shooting star. Yes Canberra has an airport in the vicinity of my eastward vantage, but this event was right above me and these objects were EXTREMLY high. No way it was the air force, balloons etc and I don’t know much about satellites or space stations, but I would guess they don’t move like that. The only other likelihood I can think of is very high altitude lightning, asteroid collision or maybe even aurora, but again I know nothing about these subject areas. I also discount the possibility of my tired condition resulting in eye floaters, simply because these were bright objects. To test this, after I arrived home, I tried staring at dark surfaces, but my eyes were not producing any bright artefacts. The objects in question were just dots but the way they moved! The trajectory crossover and turn did not seem natural. Can anyone who witnessed this event please confirm. This has certainly messed up my scepticism. I am trying to register an account on the website ATS, but my password doesn’t seem to come through. I will keep trying. This needs to get out hence the email.

It was significant to me because of the magnitude of the object and its proximity to Jupiter, which was low to the horizon and getting ready to set for the night. This object was brighter than the star Vega, and varied in magnitude and color. I grabbed her attention when I noticed it was moving very fast and erratic. It appeared to have several multicolored lights and was flashing at an inconsistent pace. The object would do zig zag patterns and ascend and descend at a rapid pace. The most interesting thing is it almost never moved in a strait trajectory, and if its path seemed to be somewhat strait it would vary its speed, moving in a non fluid motion as if it was jerking. I know this was not the asteroid Vesta or comet C2006v13 due to the comet being near Draco and Vesta has not reached this kind of magnitude, and the motions that this object made do not follow modern conceptions of astrophysics. The most interesting thing is, as this object would decrease in magnitude to the point that It could not be seen there where 10 or more objects around and spread out across the horizon that would flash and get bright, these objects would then dimmer and the ""Main"" object would increase in magnitude. At times up to 4 different lights would be visible and would appear to triangle shaped and at times would appear to be cylindrical. This is hard to tell due to the fact that the object was at a great distance. At times you could see a flash of light that illuminate thin clouds near it and always seemed to be in the direction of other objects that you could see flash light at the main object.  Over the period of 45 minutes the object had moved from about 40 degrees altitude in the eastern south eastern horizon to about 15 degrees, back up to about 30 degrees. In our time of observation four lights were distinguishable, and multiple colours from white, blue, red, and green lights. The objects were still in the sky when I left to head home around 01:40. At that time I had a friend from California on the phone listening in on the event and trying to observer using the stars an Jupiter as a reference. He could not see anything telling me it was localized in nature and was within our atmosphere.  I am an amateur Astronomer and part of an Astronomy club that is a non profit educational group. This was unlike any event that I have ever seen. In astronomy we are very attentive to objects in the night sky and see some things that cannot be explained. Satellites and the ISS move fast and with a standard trajectory. This seemed to move with intelligence behind it, interact with other objects. This was the most significant thing I have ever seen in the night sky.  At its brightest point it would reach around A magnitude -1.0 and dim out to where it was not visible. Most of the time it would reach around a magnitude +1.0 . In some cases it would cover areas of around 30-40 arc minutes in a matter of seconds in a jerky motion, at times doing circles and ans S patterns in the sky.

Very windy day with wind gusts up to 26mile with a WNW18 wind.  As I was talking, I was looking up at some buzzards gliding in the wind....I saw two objects that looked like clylinders that were tipped at a diagonal...with the slant going left to right...like this:   \ \ The top cylinder was twice as large as the bottom one. Both were slanted the same way and heading INTO the west winds....I was trying to figure out what the heck these things could be.  They were both stark white and pretty big as they seemed to be pretty far up in the Northern sky.  We get alot of Cleveland and Elyria air traffic, and this was definitely not anything I have ever seen.  They were gliding or flying smoothly and kept the same space distance between them.  The smaller object was below and slightly behind the larger one....and as they flew they kept a precise distance between them.  Definitely two separate objects. No overhead noise and no chemtrails....but as I was watching them, an aircraft flying east and higher than these objects came by...this jet/aircraft made noise and had a chemtrail, just as this aircraft was about over or on top of these objects they just disappeared....or blinked out...right in the blue, blue skies!!!  The larger one must have been really huge because the smaller one was big, and they both just ""stood out"" in the blue skies because they were so big and stark white.  I am perplexed.  As I said they flew against the wind at a steady pace.....faster than normal air traffic and with no noise, no trail...and vanished before the jet was going to fly on top of them....They were very smooth in flight.

The moon was behind me so the light was reflecting off of the object.  I initially thought it was a paraglider, but it was not moving across the sky and there was no sound.  I called my wife out to the yard and she brought binoculars.  I used the binoculars to view the object, it looked like a a group of about 10-20 large white balloons (shaped like a parachute) with a cable pointing towards the ground.  It seemed to be pretty high in the sky, but as it was night I can not say exactly how high it was.  I watched the object for about twenty minutes, it moved slowly back and forth across the sky.  I then went into my front yard and walked up the street about 200 feet, the object was above me and off to the side.  I thought that maybe it was some kids playing a prank, flying an odd shaped kite in the sky at night, so I got in my car and drove to the park up the street.  I didn't see anyone at the park, but I did see some odd flashing lights on or beneath the playground equipment.  I didn't get out of my car so I don't know if there were people on the playground, but I definitely saw some flashing lights on the ground.  I then drove home, viewed the object from the front yard and then the back yard, and then went inside to quickly search the internet for images of weather balloons.  I went outside approximately 5 minutes later and the object was gone.  I awoke the next morning to my alarm clock, it wakes me up to KTAR 92.3 FM, a local talk radio station.  The very memory I have of that morning is listening to a quick story about some large balloons that got loose from a car dealership and a plane almost hit them, and then the announcer quickly moved on to the next story.  I felt like I was awake, but I can't say with 100% accuracy that I did not dream the story.  However, I do have a very clear memory of waking up to that news story.  I searched KTAR's homepage for the balloon story and also searched azcentral.com, but did not find any stories.  The nearest car dealership is about 8 miles away to the southwest.  I have thought of three explanations for what I saw.  The first is that it was someone playing a prank and flying an odd shaped kite or balloon high up in the sky on the night of the full moon.  The second explanation would be some large balloons that got loose from a car dealership.  The third explanation is that it was a UFO.

I noticed a very bright yellowish/orange light in the sky about 1-2 miles away over a cornfield. There was alot of farm land and some trees in the area. I thought it was odd because it was so low, bright and huge. I have never seen an airplane that size and especially not that bright and still in the daytime hours. You would need about 75-100 airplanes to make up the size of this.  I continued to watch it for a few minutes and it wasn't moving, but just hovering over the cornfield. I told my friend, who was driving, to look out her window and she saw it also. We both were in pure amazement because I have never seen anything at all like this except for in the movies. Then the light became a bright whiteish color and we could see a silver lining underneath, like the bottom of a disk or bowl.  I didn't take my eyes off of it. It continued to just hover over this area. A few minutes later, the bright light started to dim. Within a split second, the lights totally disappeared and I saw a flash zip across the sky really fast and totally disappear into the sky. We continued looking all over the place and it was just gone, totally gone. We then noticed approximately 10 jet streams in the sky going towards the direction of the object that we saw. We didn't see any airplanes or helicopters in the area at all while we were witnessing this except for after it disappeared, we saw those jet streams going towards that direction.  The only thing in this particular area was the cornfield/farm land and some trees. There were no street lights, tower lights, buildings or anything at all. We were in such amazement and didn't even think to take a picture of this until afterwards. This lasted approximately 5-8 minutes I would say. I wonder if anyone else saw this or anything odd in the sky tonight?",2006-05-15T00:00:00,39.5372,-83.4343

I was driving and she was in the passanger seat. We were on OLD US 35, leaving W.C.H. and about a mile from the Fayette/Ross Co line.  My friend says to me ""Look, What is that?"" I glance out my window and about a mile or so away is this incredibly bright object just hovering in the sky above the farming fields. (We where out there in the country.)  I've seen plenty of things like airplanes and helicopters in this area and I know one when I see one. This WAS NOT one. I'd like to add here that it was not yet dark at all outside, the sun was still hanging in there and the sky was still blue.  I could see vaugely a bowl shaped bottom on it that appeared to be a silver color, but emmiting from it was the most blinding white light I've ever seen. Imagine if you will what a normal airplane looks like AT NIGHT, imagine the lights. It was like the lights times 100. The lights where so bright that it seemed beamy almost, the sun but a crisp, white color. (The sun was on the other side of my car, BTW. LOL)  So I'm attempting to drive and watch this object that's not moving by my estimations and all the sudden, it's like the lights on the craft dimmed by 50% and I said to my friend ""Did it just dim it's lights?"" and she said ""Yes."" No more then five seconds later she says ""OMG It's just gone!""  So I looked agian and sure enoungh, it had totally vanished. I saw nothing. The car behind me started driving really, really fast and they took off around me like a bat out of hell.  So we drive down 35, cross the Fayette/Ross Co. border and turn around and come back. I look up and I see a bunch of jet stream or contrails in the sky, all going in the same direction where we had seen the craft. My friend counted ten of them in all.

Through the windshield, I saw four or five greenish lights that appeared to be fairly low to the ground, maybe two-hundred to three-hundred feet high. The encounter lasted only maybe 2 seconds, if that. However, from what I saw it appeared that the lights were in a stright line as if attached to some larger object. As I saw them, it appeared that the object on which the lights were mounted was spinning as it moved. I only derive this conclusion from the way the lights moved across the sky. Soon the lights were on the north side of the seemingly triangular shaped object, and they all merged (on a two dimensional plane). After this the lights disappeared and after watching for another few seconds or so, the lights never reappeared. I drove quickly one more block to my house and quickly got out and looked in the direction that the craft was moving, but I didn't see anything.  My sister, who was in the car with me, also saw the object. I think she may have seen it a little longer than I did. All I said to her was, ""Woah."" I didn't describe what I had seen to her, to make sure she had seen the same thing that I did. She also described seeing the lights in the same way that I did.

They were almost directly over the road (or, if further out than they appeared, over the Sonoran Desert Natl. Monument), though how far in the distance and at what altitude I don’t know.  Twilight had almost completely faded.  They were not there more than ten seconds before all the orbs disappeared at the exact same time as though someone had quickly turned down a dimmer switch to ‘off’. Less than ten minutes later another set of lights - same color but elongated in shape and more tightly grouped/farther off - appeared in succession to the Southwest of 347 and quickly disappeared in the same order.  Each would come on and soon fade out as its neighbor within the cluster followed suite.  We followed 347 and then 84 west to the I8 and headed South then East, seeing them further away to the SW yet again on two more occasions for no more than 6 seconds at a time, probably over the Barry M. Goldwater Range at this point.  We turned south down Stanfield Rd., eventually heading into Tohono Indian Reservation (and seeing another quick, stationary-yet fade-in/fade-out series of amber lights directly in front of us, to the south) before turning around.  As we headed back north, the series appeared again (around 8:30pm), this time to our South West, perhaps back over the Goldwater Range.  These were even further out, and as they faded, they seemed to become flickering white lights, far in the distance, apparently unmoving, coming and going from sight.  We had stopped the car, and could hear no jet noises at all, close or in the distance, and the air was calm.  When nothing more happened we headed back North to the 8 and East to the I10 for Phoenix. While the last sets of flicking white lights may or may not have been flares, I cannot be certain either way, as they were so far off.  However the first set of equidistant orbs were like nothing I have ever seen in the sky before, and the succeeding groups were almost equally large and strange, instantly striking my wife and I each time as odd.

On January 27th, 2008 at approximately 6pm, I was exiting my fiancée’s mother’s house in San Diego.  My fiancée was already seated in my car.  As I rounded the car to the driver’s side, I opened the door and proceeded to get inside.  Before I had entered the car, I glanced upwards (in the fluid motion of getting into the car, my head looked upwards) and saw the object.  There was low cloud cover, and the clouds were slightly lit from either the moon or the sunset, although not brightly.  Between the sporadic cloud cover, I witnessed an extremely fast bluish-white light traveling from my left to right.  The object appeared to be relatively low to the ground, but above the cloud cover.  There was absolutely no noise.  The first time I saw the object, it lasted for about 2 seconds.  Since I could see the trajectory of the object during that time, my eye continued along the sky to where it would have been if it were not obscured by the cloud covering.  A few seconds later, I witnessed it again between the clouds in the same color and speed as previously seen.  Since I am familiar with fighter jets in this area of San Diego, I am familiar with the relative speed at which they appear to be traveling to the ground observer.  This was significantly faster, and without the usual accompanying sound that jets make.  Additionally, it appeared that the object was completely glowing, or possibly I could only see the flame produced by the object.  It may be important to note that I have better than 20/10 vision, somewhere approaching 20/5 vision.  In the short time I saw the object, I could not see anything traveling in front of the object, such as a rocket, although this could be possible.  Also, the “flame” appeared the have a gradient of color from white at the top to blue at the bottom, not from end to end as might be expected from a jet or rocket flame.  Also, in comparison to the diameter of the flame, this would be an unusually long flame, as it appeared to have a length approximately 10 times i! ts heigh t.  Also, although observed very briefly, the ends of the object appeared to not be pointed, but rather slanted toward the top of the object.  There didn’t appear to be any trail left by the object, although it was so bright that visually it left a slight optical trail.  This was far brighter than what you would expect even a full moon would reflect off a reflective object.  The moon, however, at that time, was below the horizon and not visible.  Sunset had been approximately 45 minutes earlier.  I will e-mail a diagram showing my best estimate at the distances and my position at the time of the sighting.  The red arrow on the diagram shows my position and direction of viewing.  It may also be helpful to know that I have never reported a UFO, nor do I claim to ever have seen anything unexplainable before.  Honestly, this seemed to possibly be something manmade, perhaps the Aurora which I have heard about.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

They were the kind of lights you would see on a Christmas tree but only one color which was a standard yellow.  I was traveling down Ridge Rd.  when I first saw this object in the form of a cross.  It looked to be hovering about 200 feet in the air and was quite visible.  At first I thought it was just a plane, but it did not move like one.  Then it started heading away from us toward Cross County highway.  It sped off somewhat rapidly but not very fast like in a supersonic mode.  I started to turn right onto Galbraith road to make it to my destination but was still trying to keep it in sight.  It looked very far away maybe 1000 yards and then I caught sight of it again to my left.  It must have been hovering in that area of neighborhood but then it reappeared about 300 yards away behind the Dillonvale shopping center.  It looked like it was hovering at the same height, about 150 to 200 feet or maybe higher.  Then something really strange happened.  It started coming towards us at the intersection of Galbraith and Plainfield roads right above Deer Park High School.  But this time it appeared in the form of a triangle.  It seemed like it changed its lighting pattern.  It kind of looked like a stealth fighter this time; the lights were the same but in the form of a triangle.  In back there seemed to be three propulsion type engines.  They emitted a flame but the object didn't make any noise I could hear.  I did have the windows rolled up though.  There was a policeman stopped with his lights flashing close to the area of Deer Park High School.  He was talking to a male who looked to be about the age of 15 or 16. I'm pretty sure this police officer must have witnessed the object and so did some other people.  The back of the object seemed to be about 100 feet across.  I turned left onto Plainfield Rd.  to follow it a! nd get a better look.  That's when I saw the kid and the policeman.  The object then started to head away from us again and did a very sharp turn and that's when the three engines lit up.  That's when I lost sight of it.

I live in Santa Ana, California, but the object was southwest from my position, into the Costa Mesa area.  The only visible part of the object was a solid bright bluish ring. A storm was approaching in the distance and it was slightly windy, so at first I thought it might be something floating in the wind. It's movement was very fluid, but still fairly erratic. The movement pattern almost looked like a plastic bag caught in an updraft of air. But, it wasn't very long before I realized that it was way too big to be something floating in the wind. It looked to be flying at a fairly low altitude, around the height that a helicopter might fly, but it's maneuverability was beyond anything I've ever seen a helicopter do. It slowed to a hover, then dove in an arc and came back up a few times, both horizontally and vertically. The speed at which it could turn made me think it might be a radio controlled airplane, but I've never seen one a big as this. It had no lights on it other than a blue/white ring on the bottom. When it tilted away from my perspective, the ring was not visible. Conversely, when it tilted towards my direction, the ring shined brightly.  It continued to move around the area for a few minutes, and then dropped it's altitude to a point where I could no longer see it, and I lost sight of it after that.

Saturday morning 22nd.  I'm getting ready to go in for the night and I notice my shadow and I turn my head to see where the lights coming from.. Thought to myself, ""That's an awfully bright star I don't remember seeing one that bright before."" So I watch it a little bit and then it begins to move south away from the lake.. By that time I knew it wasn't a star obviously so I flash my light at it. As soon as I did that it did a complete 180 and was coming my way, I said, ""Oh Sh*t"" what have I just done! It's approach was rather rapid and as it got close to me and I knew it wasn't going to stop  until it reached me I got spooked and took six steps back. By the six step the object stopped..  It stooped as if it knew I didn't want it any closer.  It was directly in front of me. During this time I noted two airlines flying way above  the object and to me that confirmed this was something rather unique.  This craft had no sound to it the only things heard were the sounds of crickets and me saying, ""what in the F is this thing!""  The object was a greenish yellow color like I have never seen before. coming form the bottom were at times two to four beams of light that only went to a certain distance and stopped.  At times these beams would rotate. One time they connected and the craft looked like a diamond.  I moved out to the end of the dock to get a better look and as I did that the craft moved back keeping the same distance it had when I saw it from the beach area. I like that, a UFO that knows it's boundaries. Kind of cool huh? :)  After I got tired of looking at this from the dock. I moved to an area next door to me..  As I did that, with in  10 to 15 seconds the craft moved with me and was once again directly in front of me keeping that same distance.  So I thought I'd try something. When a cloud went under it I would move again..  After the cloud past over the UFO came over to me again. Keeping that same distance.   The distance was just over cloud level.  One time a cloud went under it and I moved and it shout out from the cloud. This thing was just wild.  At one point the craft shot out this green beam of light that came down. half way between it self and the water. I took note that the beam of light did not reflect off the water. The light stayed for five seconds and then traveled back up to the craft. Interestingly enough after the beam travel back up to the craft it left a kind of  mist or residue I don't know what you would call it but it disappeared within seconds. This residue I speak of I just remebered it..  Also I will admit I did feel slightly sick to my stomach that day.  That's just something I took note of.. Could be nothing but maybe something.. Sick to my stomach as if I had a mild flue or you could I felt woozy or something..  This event lasted between 2.5 hours. It was daylight before it actually left.. It left after I had, had enough I guess.. I went and hid behind my neighbors house for a minute or two and when I came back it was gone.. It was like the craft was watching me as I was watching it.  I have video and pictures of the craft. I'm sending you three of the pictures.. I'd like to know you think of the pictures. I want to try and enhance the others before I send anymore.. I also took video. This video seems like classic UFO footage..What I mean by that is while recording, the image in the LCD screen looks different then what I was actually seeing.. It's fuzzy or blurry I guess and it does have like a kind of black outlineing around the object.. These green beams I speak of aren't vissible in the video but they are in the pictures at times that I am glad for. I'm glad those beams are vissible in the pictures..  I have NEVER seen anything like this and it went for 2.5 hours. It was simply amaing.  The lights it gave off I have never seen colors like that.. It was just incredible.. The video's the pictures, they don't give credit to what was seen.. But it does give a pretty good idea of it.. As they say seeing is believing...",2007-10-08T00:00:00,42.1349,-85.8425

Here's the link:   http://www.expres.ro/article.php?artid=329959    ""MiG hit by a UFO above Ardeal  November 9, 2007  by Mihai Soica   A jet fighter from Campia Turzii was hit by four unidentified flying objects   Air force pilot Marius Mitrica declared yesterday that his MiG 21 Lancer craft was hit while flying at an altitude of 6,500 meters by an unidentified flying object. The accident took place last week during a training flight in the area around the city of Gherla, close to Cluj. The jet fighter piloted by commanding lieutenant Marius Mitrica was flying at over 850 km/h. ""I was flying at 6,500 meters [of altitude] and I didn't notice anything particular. Suddenly, however, I was hit by a sturdy object from the Right side of the airplane. The collision broke the Plexiglas covering the cockpit. The pieces pierced my helmet and injured my face. At first, I ducked as much as possible because the air current was very strong and the temperature reached -30 degrees Celsius. I came down to a lower altitude and I slowed down. I noticed that the airplane responded to my commands and I finally slowed down"", explained Marius Mitrica who is an Air force pilot since 1991. Neither a bird nor a meteorite   The pilot is convinced that the object that hit him was not a bird. ""I'm 99,9 percent sure that it wasn't a bird"", he said. Immediately after landing, a committee of specialists from the Air force inspected the airplane hoping to find the rest of the object that hit the MiG. ""When I landed, my first instinct was to look in the cockpit to find the rest but I just found Plexiglas pieces"", added Mitrica who ended up with a Black eye due to the accident. The pilot also added that it is impossible that he was hit by a meteorite because in such a scenario the impact would have been devastating. ""I don't think it was a meteorite because this one has a considerable kinetic energy. Had it hit the airplane, I don't think I would be here talking to you"", said the pilot. He added that he was lucky with the Oxygen mask who helped him overcome the shock quickly. ""Had I not had the mask, I could have lost conscience due to the shock of finding myself without the plastic shield. The biggest danger was hypothermia"", Mitrica said. One of the air controllers from the Campia Turzii Base during the training flight when the accident happened was the pilot's own wife, Carmen Mitrica. She declared that she could not ask her husband if he is all right through the radio because that frequency was used by the other pilots in the air. ""I gave him all the indications he needed to land safely"", said Carmen Mitrica. Every fighter jet has a video camera recording training flights. However, the video analysis did not shed any light on this accident according to the Air force's 71st Base stationed in Campia Turzii. The video clip with the UFO is with the SRI  Air force general Ion Avram specified that the video clip shows four triangles the size of an A4 sheet each coming towards the aircraft from the right. ""We gave the video images to the Romanian Information Services [SRI, N.B. The Romanian secret services] to be analyzed and to tell us what hit the MiG"", declared general Ion Avram. The general also added that birds do not fly during this season at such altitudes because it's too cold. The 71st Air force officials also verified if the ""UFO"" could be an object from another airplane flying in the vicinity. The hypothesis was excluded since the last airplane flying in the area passed by there more than an hour prior to the accident.""",2007-11-28T00:00:00,,

It was about 1:30pm and it was a very clear blue sky.  I could see two wispy white clouds, high above to my right.  I was driving north on HWY 277 near the old PAVE PAWS govt. radar facility. There was plenty of traffic heading South but I was the only one at that moment traveling North. Ahead in the distance, I could plainly see one large tree on the left side of the road.  The road turned a bit to the right and was at a higher altitude than where I was currently.   I suddenly became aware of two disks or cigars shaped objects traveling West only a few feet above the height of the tree.  But they were not as high as the height of the cell tower on the right.   I became aware of them on the right side of the road and could see them crossing over the road in front of me.  I was traveling 70 miles per hour but they appeared to be going slowly.  They were not very big.  Maybe the size of a car.  They were traveling one in front of the other. They were the color of the white clouds near by.  They almost looked invisible but I could make out their shape against the background.  It seemed forever until I arrived to the top of the small hill where the tree was and I slowed down to look toward the west.  I could not see them again on the left side of the road. The rest of the trip, I kept looking at other things trying to justify that I really saw them.  I spotted a big Texas vulture, but it still looked like a bird when I got close.  I spotted a jet across the sky with the white streak behind it but as I got closer, it still looked like a jet.  I spotted a small airplane near San Angelo, but as I got closer and it got further, it continued to look like a small plane.  I do not know what I saw, but it appeared to me like they thought they were hidden as they traveled slowly across the road. Almost like I was not supposed to have noticed them.

Individually each has flickering lights and they hover throughout the night in the same position but move rapidly left-right-up-down and sometimes in circular or semi-circular moves as they continue to hover in the same altitude. Usually couple of hours later 5-7 similar objects/light patterns appear more toward the West, the closest being straight above and the rest of them in some sort of formation stretching few miles apart. These are in much higher altitudes (our guess)50-70,000 ft or higher. These are very well visible once you have trained your eyes to pick each of them out. What is most obvious is that in the early morning at daybreak, the stars start to fade but these are still visible until the sun is almost up. Two days ago we observed a small light travel from Northern direction for about 2 minutes and judging from the altitude must have flown about 10 miles before being absorbed or joining the one parked above our house. The reason it is easy to pick them out is that the lights of all of them align in the same pattern no matter how far they are apart. There is a military base in Key West and we see the military planes fly but lot lower altitude also there are commercial flights.

Silent; two rows of 6-8 dull orange disks in a shallow V shape fixed to chevron-shaped (?) object.,Frisco,TX,2007-11-09T20:30:00,chevron,20-30 sec,"Occurred : 11/9/2007 20:30  (Entered as : 11/9/07 20:30) Reported: 11/10/2007 8:35:11 PM 20:35 Posted: 11/28/2007 Location: Frisco, TX Shape: Chevron Duration:20-30 sec",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59741.html,"Silent; two rows of 6-8 dull orange disks in a shallow V shape fixed to chevron-shaped (?) object I observed this object at approximately 8:30 pm on Thursday, November 8, 2007.  I was walking my dog in Warren Park in Frisco, Texas.  I was standing on the sidewalk just east of the entrance to the park off of El Dorado.  Although there were activities going on at the west end of the park that were brightly lit, it was dark where I was standing and I had paused to see if I could spot Comet Holmes.  I knew about where to look for it; I was searching the sky around a third of the way to halfway between Cassiopeia and the southeastern horizon. I am not a serious amateur astronomer but I have a pretty good knowledge of the night sky from my boyhood interest in astronomy. I have never seen a UFO before. As I was watching the sky, I became aware of an object to the left and above where I was looking.  The object was moving from SSE to NNW, almost directly overhead when I began observing it.  It moved in a straight line at a constant speed and didn’t do anything tricky. I watched it for approximately 20-30 seconds. It was completely silent ...that is, I could hear nothing coming from it.  There was some road noise from El Dorado, which was close by, but jets that were flying at a much higher altitude (apparent altitude – see below) could easily be heard over the few cars that were passing, and when there  was no traffic I strained to hear something coming from the object but could not. It had an angular width of, I am estimating, 2 or 3 knuckles on my fist held at arm’s length.  I am aware that people overestimate the both the actual and apparent size of things they see in the sky and it is not impossible that its angular width may be less than that.  But it was not tiny in appearance – it extended over enough of the sky that it was plainly visible. I am not certain of the shape of the object, but I had the impression at the time that it was chevron-shaped and heading in the direction of the pointy part – like an old Northrup Flying Wing, but more angled than that.  I may be imagining its shape.  I have seen reports of triangle-shaped UFOs, and that is not out of the question.  The sky was dark but not completely black, and because of the light pollution of the DFW area there is not a highly populated starfield in any direction, but there was plainly some kind of silhouette that blocked out the sky and the few stars behind it as it moved through the sky. What I am certain of is that the object exhibited a series of orange disks in a shallow V shape (as though along the leading edge of the chevron), perhaps 6-8 down each arm.  They were distinctive but their “glow” was so dull that I am speculating that they were not self-lit but were reflectors picking up the lights from the ball fields.  Their round shape was very clear and not fuzzy or sparkling, as might have been the case if they were lit up.  The lights were very dull; I would never have noticed them if I weren’t looking right at the object when it came into my field of vision.  The lights were not moving around – they were apparently affixed to whatever was moving through the sky. There were no flashing lights or other typical aircraft running lights on this object. Size and height:  Very hard to say.  Any estimate is complicated by the lack of any points of reference.  In fact, even if there had been buildings or trees in the field of view it would not have made much difference because there was no auditory cue to distance.  That there was no audible sound coming from the object suggests great height.  The orange disks were, although not bright, very distinctive and clearly circular, with hard edges.  And the object was had a fair angular diameter, which suggests closeness.  So either the thing was far away and enormous, or closer and smaller.  Put another way, It had a much greater angular width than the numerous jets that are approaching DFW and that were flying over Frisco at that time, so if it was flying at that height it was very large.  My unsupported “feeling,” however, was that it was not flying that high; the clarity of the shape and outline of the two rows of disks suggests that it was not at a great height, but neither was it anywhere close to the ground or nearby treetops. I’m not sure how it disappeared, except that it did not speed out of sight.  It just kind of winked off (although not so abrupt as a winking), as though it had gone into a cloud bank (but the sky was cloudless).  This would be consistent with my speculation that the dull orange disks were reflectors, and that the angle between the object and the lights of the ballfields had become such that they no longer reflected my way.  I will say that the reflection theory suffers from the fact that I was generally between the field lights and the object, which was moving away from the field, so there was no angle-of-incidence = angle-of-reflection thing going on if the reflector were just a flat surface.  If the disks were reflectors, they were complex enough to pick up the field lights and reflect them slightly backwards towards me.  And they could have been picking up the many other light sources of Frisco. If I had to make a guess as to a terrestrial origin of this thing, it would be a large private aircraft flying at medium altitude with an engine quiet enough to blend in with the noises of the night at that height, with reflectors on the underside of its wings.  Not a blimp. Thank you for the opportunity to make this report.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,33.14455576923077,-96.81782362637362

I went to check it out.  We watched the film at regular speed the first time and saw several little specks appear and disappear too fast to see what they were.  We slowed the video down to a crawl and watched several small flying craft, that looked a lot like flying oreo cookies. A few seconds later this large ""line"" of lights showed up, the way the light hit it a few times made it go from translucent to kind of a plasma looking thing, all that was really clear were the lights. using zoom, we were able to see it was rotating, and the lights were actually pale shades of green pink and yellow, alternating as it spun around.  It didnt fly straight, rather jumped around, the smaller craft looked like they were trying to ""stir"" up the air to keep the larger craft concealed.  After examing the film, we decided to go outside and look at the space it happened in,  at exactly 5 am in the morning of the 17th, we saw it appear on the horizon, again the way the sun hit it, it seemed to ""uncloak"" for a few moments, there appeared to be a shape to this of an egg, the lights going around the middle with the small end towards the top and maybe a quarter of the egg at the big end out the bottom, it was like looking into water. there were a lot of ""sparks"" that appeared in the sky, thats how fast they were, they only looked like sparks to the naked eye.  again we got out the camera and tried to catch some of it on film.  Then a Second large ship appeared behind the first one, they both moved in a south east direction across the sky, the smaller ships were like a whold armada flying around the larger ones, dissappearing and reappearing again,  it appeared like they would go in and out of the big one, but you couldnt see it enter it, only where it would appear again at the top of the big one.  I only know I was akeptical of what was told to me about what they had filmed the morning before, also at exactly 5 am.  And that in the first light of the day, with the sun coming up, it did something to the way they were able to conceal themselves, this was not a jet trail, and were not falling stars.  And it seems they have a habit of hanging out over the top of the power plant at 5 am.  There seemed to be a distortion of the sky around where they were, magnetic field possibly?

It appeared to be black in color, and traveled from the southwest towards the north.  The object moved at a slow speed (about 30 minutes after the sighting, a large commercial jet flew over our house, giving me an idea of the object's speed).  I would estimate the speed at approximately 1/6 to 1/8 the speed of the passenger jet.  As it traveled, the object seemed to roll, allowing me to see a profile and a side view of it.  I was able to continue viewing the object through binoculars for between 5 and 10 minutes, until I lost sight of it in distant clouds.  Each of the 4 of us present viewed the object with bare eyes and with binoculars.  The object did not appear to be flat, based on my view when I saw its profile.  Rather, the part that seemed to stay at the top of the object seemed raised, as compared to the flat bottom of the object.  The object did not have any visible lights.

The best way to describe the light and what it did is to imagine a light bulb 65 watts in the distance just floating through the air. A faint light. Then imagine that light bulb turning and rotating towards you and when it was pointed directly at you it was like a spot light like on a police car. The light was super bright and remained on me for maybe 2 sec. then what appeared to be rotation back down and then very quickly matter of 3 to 4 sec. fade to nothing.

It seemed to have a haze around it not real clear. This is the third Sunday I saw this objects and I compare the brightness to a dim light bulb.  About 1 minute later there were two streaks across the sky. A bright object with a trail to the west of me then I saw another one way out to the east both went in a south direction.  I have noticed that I see this objects on Sundays?  This is the third Sunday I saw this objects and I compare the brightness to a dim light bulb.  I didn't report the second sighting on 5/21/06 about 9:20 PM EST or 01:20UTC and I'm almost sure it’s the same object that I have been seeing. I don’t have a video camera to record these objects but anyone reading this if your near the Boca-Delray Beach Florida area watch the sky to the east on Sundays between 9:00-10:00PM and you may be lucky enough to capture these objects on tape. They move around to fast for a Camera.  I have not seen any other objects except Sunday Night and I think there is a Pattern to look at here. I have looked every Sunday since the first time but some Sundays were cloudy.  I look at the sky every night and these were not a satellite or plane I know what they look like and how they move. Also these objects are totaly silent.  There was a small private plane nearby this time and I wonder if anyone in the plane maybe saw or reported something?  I have seen alot of objects in the sky before but these are real objects from elsewhere besides the 2 sightings I had as a kid in the 1970's. That’s all the info I have but strange that I have seen this 3 times and all on Sundays. I’ll keep watching. Thanks ((initials deleted)),2006-07-16T00:00:00,26.455547430830038,-80.11589308300395

There is light from the street that comes in enough to where i can make out a face. These things were wearing dark coveralls that ere tight and showed off skinny bodies.

Thier beltlines were about level with the bed so i guees they are about 4' tall. I was NOT asleep or dreaming! I was immediately terrified out of my mind and tried to scream but could not even move. It was as if a nightmare was coming true. Supe-sureal as the people who witnessed 9-11 must have felt as the planes hit or towers came down. One stood at the foot of the bed and the other two were on my side. Mywife stayed asleep. they were making strange noises as if breathing through ventilators. Ialso heard mechanical sounds.

I could still feel the skin of my wife's shoulder under my hand and the blanket on top of us as well as open space and cool air below. I sensed movement all around and the room seemed to wobble and spatially distort. I tried to kick at them but could notmove so I tried to lean from side to side in the air. I calledout mentally for God and the Lord Jesus Christ to save me and instantly I was back on the bed and the beings and strange glow was gone. The Lord saved me from those things.

Let me start with I don’t believe in UFO’s but this is something rare that I have never seen before in my life. So I got witnesses to verify that I am not going crazy and everyone saw the same thing. So here is my report.  	I was outside looking at the sky as I do most nights and see the constellations in the winter. When I saw what looked like a very bright star. But it was flashing different color lights; red, blue, green, and white. The longer I watched it I noticed that it was not just sitting in one place. When actually it would sit still for a little while and then dart to the right, then sit still and dart to the left. The one thing that I did notice is that it did not have a certain pattern in the movement so you never knew which direction it was going to move. The whole time it was moving it was climbing higher and higher. While it was darting left and right it was not so fast that you could not see it, and the light did not blur or trail so I assumed it was a long ways off. But this I can not be sure of. We was not able to see the shape of the object. It just looked like a big diamond in the sky, and every once in a while a light would shine into it and make like a prism of light. I guess it looked as if someone wearing this diamond on their hand and would move the hand every now and again.  	The location of this light was directly east of our home. It was just above the tree line behind my house. The tree’s there are about 40 foot tall. And they are located about 100 yards behind my house. The ground slopes up at about 5 degrees from the back of my house to the tree line. Hopefully this will give you enough information to figure out a close estimate of where it was in the sky. It was also right below the belt of Orion.  	If there is anything explainable about this the please contact me and let me know.

The object seemed to be traveling along the street, toward us, but moving very slowly and only flying about 200-300 ft off the ground above the street.  Originally 2 lights were in view, but as we got closer, I noticed that there were 3 lights on the bottom of the craft, in a triangle formation.  At this point I was literally yelling at my sister to confirm the object herself, and she seemed very concerned about it as well.  The object then passed directly over our vehicle while we were stopped at a light.  I stuck my head out the window to get a better look at the object, and to see if there were any sounds coming from the craft... there were none, which seemed very disturbing to me.  I asked my sister if she heard anything, such as helicopter rotors or an aircraft engine, and she said she did not.  As I looked straight up at the craft, I very clearly saw that it was triangular in shape, with a circular light at each tip, and an illuminated white line connecting each light.  There was also a square panel at the bottom of the craft that was glowing red, and a smaller yellow light next to that that was pulsing.  I have never seen anything like this before.  The craft moved so slowly that it is impossible to have stayed airborne if it were a plane, and absolutely no sound was heard coming from the craft at close proximity to indicate that it was some sort of helicopter. The object then continued east down the Blvd. until it was out of sight. This object must surely have been seen by many observers, and after seeing it, cars around us were driving erratically, passing each other on city streets illegally and driving very fast.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,38.91147669172933,-92.30242962406015

This light was in the South East sky and we noticed it around 7:45 PM.  The light was very bright and seemed at first to be a plane or helicopter of some kind but we noticed it wasn’t moving. If it was moving it was at such an altitude we could not tell. Like I said the light was very bright. The light was blinking red, blue, and white. From the blinking you could see what appeared to be a triangle of light creating itself every time it blinked. The light seemed to get brighter and blink in a pattern – we watched it for awhile (approx. 30 min) and then went inside. While watching the light moved back and forth in sudden motions approxiamtely 1/2 inch the sky.  Approx at 9:30 we went to see if the light were still visible in the sky it had moved more south and wasn’t blinking as much.  We at first thought this might be a plane or helicopter. We ruled that out as we could see other planes in the sky at what appeared to be the same altitude and they were moving much faster. We also thought it might be a tower of some sort since at first it was stationary. We ruled that out when we watched several planes fly across the path of the light and it moved. Our next thought was maybe it was some astronomical event so we researched the news, Google Earth’s sky charts, and other astronomy databases. We didn’t find anything remotely close to the area except for Sirius and the description did not match what we witnessed. We also checked the alignments of the planets and noticed the planets were in a straight line on Google Earth - but the only visible one was Mars. We had been watching Mars for a week or so now so we have been watching the sky. We lined up Mars with Orion's belt to see if we could locate this flashing light  - but we could not.  As the time passed the light did not follow the path of the other stars and did seem dimmer.  We didn’t want to report it to the local news out of fear of being laughed at but we wanted to know if you people had any other reports of a similar affect. Also if you had not what this light might have been. Thank you  ((name and e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius??  PD))",2008-01-21T00:00:00,38.2075,-83.3989

It was still light out, and i was looking at the sky as i often do, and saw what appeared to be a sphere-shaped silver metal object flying to the north, at an altitude of what couldnt have been more than 200 ft., maybe a quarter mile if that from where i was sitting.  It was traveling fairly slow, at a steady speed, and then I tried to take a picture of it with my camera phone but the lighting and distance made it impossible to get a good shot.  It then passed behind a tree branch, and i waited to see it in between the trees, but it just disappeared.  Now i know that it is not a plane.  It was too close and the shape was clearly not of any human flying machines.  I believe it cut a quick 90 degree turn east when it disappeared because i went downstairs to get a better look, and was looking at where it should have been at that point if it was still traveling the same speed and there was nothing.  I told my roommate about it when he came down, i expected him to laugh at me and not take me seriously, but this is something that i would never joke about (no matter how much i wish they would come and take me away.) I later told my boyfriend about it and my uncle, who is a retired scientist.  Everyone i told took me seriously, and i am constantly looking out for my little friend everyday, hoping to get a picture to prove i wasnt just seeing what i wanted to see.  when i first saw it i had to stare for a bit to make sure i wasnt seeing things, but i was staring for at least 30 seconds before i got my camera phone out of my pocket, so im positive of what i saw.  I am and always have been a firm believer in life from other planets visiting us, i just hope next time i see it they come a little closer!  By the way, i am a 24 year old female, i deliver pizzas for a living, and i have a hobby of taking pictures of cloud formations, so i often spend ! alot of time looking up at the sky, as do i spend alot of time researching the UFO sightings.  I am not trying to impress anybody with a made up story-i have nothing to gain for lying. I just hope someone else saw it or knows what that might have been- it looked like a ufo i saw in a picture once.  Well its a silver ball-like object. It was flying. thats all i can tell u for sure.

I was just looking around, not paying much attention to anything, when what I thought was a low-flying aircraft caught my eye through the open sunroof.  I looked up, and saw what looked like a low-flying equilateral black triangle with bright white lights on each point traveling along at a moderately fast pace directly above me.  It wasn't going too fast for me to be able to follow it, but at the same time, it was gliding very smoothly and much too quickly for the altitude it looked like it was at.   As soon as I saw it, I got chills.  I knew it was not normal.   I followed its path, which was an estimated northeast to southwest direction until it seemed to either fade away or just go too far away for me to see it (although that did not seem possible because of the clearness of the night).  It made absolutely no noise that was audible to me.   I almost told my friend when they came back, because I was pretty shaken up, but I thought better of it.  I came home, did some internet research, and was amazed to find out about the ""Black Triangle"" phenomenon.  I had no prior knowledge of this. I must add that I was completely sober and relaxed, and UFOs were the last thing on my mind at that time.  I believe what I saw was 100% real.  It's definately made a believer out of me.

After a couple of minutes I noticed from the passenger seat out of the corner of my eye this gray ""flat"" object zooming along with us. I thought it was a bird it was relatively close and then when the object didn't swoop down or up like a normal bird would - I began paying attention.  As I watched this thing in broad daylight against a blue sky and white puffy clouds fly as fast as we were driving (I don't know the distance ratio in relation to us or how fast it was flying - only that it was keeping up with our vehicle). I naturally assumed it was a plane (we have a small airport relatively close nearby) then noticed it had no wings and was round.  I immediately drew my grandmother's and father's attention towards it and they both saw it and acknowledged it but thought it was a plane in the distance. My dad, however, kept watching it out of the corner of his eye while he was driving watching it along with me. The road we were on has big trees periodically as you're traveling along. For the duration of about 2-3 minutes this thing was driving along what seemed to be next to us (we were driving about 60mph) and then it flew behind this big group of trees and disappeared. So strange!!  I just figured that the ""plane"" turned a different direction that we were unable to see??  We came to a stop sign in that particular road and headed north on an intersecting road and this object all of a sudden appeared on my father's side (who was driving) and I noticed it. If this was a regular plane, we would have seen it continue to fly with us and end up crossing our path (since it was originally flying parallel to us) but it had disappeared behind the trees and then re-appeared on the opposite side of the road. It then continued to drive (seemingly) along with us again!! We were of course paying attention to the road driving and we took our attention away and it disappeared yet again! We all decided this was very odd but dismissed it anyway. THEN ... we made it to our exit onto I-57 headed north (within about 5-6 minutes from last seeing it) and it re-appeared again only this time bigger than it was before. It was flying on the west side of the interstate and was flying much higher this time and faster. It began to speed ahead of us like a shot out of a cannon. Then it suddenly stopped. It was hovering!! Any doubt that I had that this truly was an airplane that I had simply  misunderstood ... vanished when WE ALL saw that thing hovering. There was a semitruck and a couple of cars that were pulled over on the side of the road pointing up at this thing!  We continued to our destination and it was still in the air hovering. I looked back one last time and could not see it.  The weirdest thing I ever saw!!! I would never tell anyone for fear of being called a lunatic. I consider myself a reliable source and was not alone in my sighting of this thing. Seeing it on a Sunday morning in broad daylight was also very odd. I always hear of people seeing these things at night with lights but this was in the morning!  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I faced East, toward SF Bay, just north of the San Rafael/Richmond bridge.  I scrambled off the recliner to the patio door and saw the circular beam of light slowly, steadily climb (like an airplane) in the sky; it was not on the ground.  There is a small airfield near here and I just thought it was an airplane with a really, really big beam.  There was no way it could be reflected light of any kind.  I watched it rise for about 2 minutes; it was really slow.  Then, of a sudden, it converted from a large circular beam of light and became what looked like the lights of a regular aircraft.  It moved slowly, then disappeared for a second or two and reappeared lower and three feet away for 2 seconds, then appeared where it had been.  It did this three times, then broke into another set of plane lights which, slowly, steadily flew to the northeast.  The original light slowly gained in altitude and disappeared to the south, toward the SR/Richmond Bridge.

I am too freaked out to tell anyone else, especially since no one would believe me.  I was out smoking a cigarette on my patio when I saw it.  I probably wouldn’t have noticed, but a group of people in the grocery store parking lot across the street from my apartment started honking their horns at one another.  I saw them get out of their cars and point up at the sky.  DIA airport faces in the same direction, so always see when planes when they are coming and landing… but this was most definitely no plane.  I saw a light that would have looked like a twinkling star, except for a triangular shaped bright-aura surrounding it.  It was hovering above ground a couple hundred feet for a few seconds, and then shot up higher into the sky faster than any aircraft I’ve ever seen. Then it slowed down, did a zigzag up higher while going north, then disappeared.  I went inside immediately and sat down, a little disturbed by what I saw to make sense of anything.

During a power outage I heard unusually loud roaring from a nearby naval base and saw a triangular shaped orange craft.,Milton,FL,2008-06-29T20:15:00,triangle,2 hours,"Occurred : 6/29/2008 20:15  (Entered as : 06/29/08 20:15) Reported: 6/30/2008 8:48:41 AM 08:48 Posted: 7/5/2008 Location: Milton, FL Shape: Triangle Duration:2 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64210.html,"During a power outage I heard unusually loud roaring from a nearby naval base and saw a triangular shaped orange craft. On June 29, 2008 my hometown of Milton, Florida experienced extremely volatile thunderstorms for most of the early morning hours continuing for most of the day.  As a result our electricity went out numerous times for a few minutes each until approximately 7:45 pm when it went out for what turned out to be over two hours.  My family home is located right next to Whiting Field NAS helicopter training school (check my address on Google Earth - we have the y-shaped driveway) and during the ten years we have lived here we  have grown accustomed to seeing and hearing a variety of aircraft on a regular basis.  On one occasion a few years ago we had the unexpected pleasure of watching the famous Blue Angels practicing at Whiting for a show on Pensacola Beach.  During their practice we only had to stand on our front porch or in the yard to see the spectacular show firsthand, and the planes were flying so low we could even make out the yellow lettering on each plane.  We also were privy to the enormous noise of the six jets flying in formation which was VERY loud.  On this particular Sunday evening in June, however, we learned that the noise of the Blue Angels paled in comparison to what we heard that night.  At approximately 8:15 that evening my husband and father decided to take a ride toward town to see how extensive the power outage was.  As they were leaving I stepped onto the front porch to smoke a cigarette and as they drove down our driveway an extremely loud roaring began emanating from the direction of Whiting Field.  At first I simply thought that there was some sort of large jet taking off from there (even though they cannot ordinarily accommodate the largest jets), but the noise continued to increase in volume until our windows began vibrating violently and dishes and glassware began to topple over.  This jet-like noise was at least ten times louder than the six Blue Angel jets had been and continued for at least five minutes until it began fading out, but when it ended it did not sound like a regular takeoff.  Immediately after the loud noise subsided we began hearing a large number of varying types of aircraft.  My son is a Navy veteran who worked on jets and can easily differentiate between different types of engines and he identified several helicopters, small jets, and even prop planes.  Although some of these aircraft sounded familiar to us we all agreed that they were not all the usual training helicopters and planes, plus there was still enough daylight to view them with binoculars and many did not have the distinctive orange and white coloring or the customary lighting.  My son said that it sounded like every aircraft on the base had been scrambled, and those in the air did not fly in the same direction they usually do, but maintained a large circular formation.  During this flurry of activity I was looking northeast (Whiting field is west of us) and was stunned to see a bright yellow-orange glow in a vaguely triangular shape.  We have a water tower adjoining our property and this gave me some perspective regarding the size of the craft and it was larger than the tower.  Due to the power outage it was pitch black outside and we are certain that there could have been no other source of the light, which began to pulse (NOT blink or flicker).  This craft flew in a westerly direction for a short distance and then flew straight up very briefly and simply vanished as if the light had switched off, but it never made any noise at all.  The other aircraft continued to fly over many times until the power came back on around 10:00 pm and shortly thereafter ceased completely.  In addition to my son and me, other witnesses included my other son and my mother, and when they returned my husband and father informed us that they had also heard the noise and thought they saw something in the sky that was not typical of the aircraft we usually see.  My older son and I were the only ones outside who witnessed the actual orange colored craft. Due to the extreme volume of the roar that preceded the extraordinary flurry of aircraft taking off from Whiting Field we were all terrified of what was happening.  It is so unusual to see aircraft that late at night, and we simply could not imagine what was causing all the commotion. The timing in relation to the storm and power outage also was very unsettling – it started right after the power went out and ended right after the power came back on.  Of course the base has its own sources of power, so we were perplexed about why this event would coincide with a neighborhood outage.  The next morning I was unable to find any reference to this event when I checked the regular internet news websites for our area, both newspaper and television.  I even called the local paper and the administration offices of Whiting field.  The Pensacola News Journal had no reports of anything unusual other than storm damage and the gentleman I spoke with on the base said he had no reports of anything out of the ordinary either. This was a little hard to swallow.  Due to the fact that some members of our family, especially my husband, had seen unexplained events before in and around Pensacola, my family insisted that I report what happened although we had never felt compelled to do so before.  If your organization is able to find out what may or may not have happened we would greatly appreciate it.  Perhaps I haven’t waited long enough to give others time to report it locally, but I suspect there may be no other reports because no one here will take me seriously.  Any help you can give us in this matter will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,30.697336723163843,-87.05111638418079

When I went to upload them into my computer, I noticed that the first picture had these strange cigar shaped objects around the plane. I immediatley checked the other pics, They were clear and there were no objects on any of the photos.  I checked my camera and even checked to see if there was debris on the lens, there was none. All my other pictures of planes were all clear and did nit have anything on them.  That is why I decided to submit the report and the picture to you.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,,

The lights formed what I consider an isosceles triangle.  They disappeared in opposite order in which they appeared, within about 3 seconds.  This was neat, odd, but conclusive for me.  We traveled another 4 or 5 miles and again, 8-10 more orange lights appeared randomly spaced to the right side of the highway, this time appearing closer to the tree line.  After about 4 seconds they disappear.  By this time, we are consumed with speculation as to what could be making these lights.  We traveled less than 2 miles further, and again 8-10 orange lights appeared randomly spaced, and within less than a second they literally moved into a formation of two parallel, perpendicular rows.  I was driving, and could not witness as much as my son, who said it/they, moved into a triangular formation and disappeared again in about 4 seconds.  This is when it became apparent to me, this was real.  We are nervous and anxious to get home, since we are alone in the middle of nowhere.  We traveled another 3-4 miles, when the lights appeared again, but this time below the tree line, literally hovering about 20-30 feet above an open field.  This thing is less than 50 yards away from my car, and we can now see it. The very bright orange lights encompass the perimeter of the vessel that is hovering at an angle and slowly rotating counter-clockwise, illuminating the undercarriage which was a dark gray metallic.  My son witnessed a second vessel hovering above the one described, but said that one did not have lights.

When viewed with the naked eye, it appears to be one light that moves. When viewed through binoculars, it is actually two close together in proximity. These objects ""hover"" with no noise audible. They move in strange patterns. If one looks at the sky briefly, they appear to be star-like. Looking at them for a few seconds and longer you see that they are definitely NOT stars.  These objects appear around the same time each night and stay for several hours. We watch them appear each night between 10:30 - 11:00 PM CST. They leave around 2:00 - 3:00 AM CST.  Also an interesting detail: we live in a rural area and the television viewing we have is via satellite. Our satellite signal is blocked on almost all channels while the objects are near.

Dear Sir or Ms,   Last Friday, which was June 6th, 2008, I saw an UFO.  This is surprising to me as I usually consider myself a reasonable person.  I am scientifically literate and was completely sober.  I also have 20/20 vision and don’t wear glasses or contact lenses.  It was broad daylight and I was driving in commuter traffic westbound on I43 around 5:24 pm.  I didn’t feel any “creepy feelings” or strange compulsions to make mountains out of mashed potatoes.  This is how it happened:  I saw a helicopter hovering in the air over the town of Mukwonago, Wisconsin.  It looked strange because the helicopter was similar to a traffic helicopter, but had no logos or markings on it.  As this area is quasi-rural, this was out of place and I was curious.  I looked farther into the sky in the direction the helicopter was pointed and saw what looked like the round end of a marshmallow in the sky.  It was white and seemed to have a dimple in the middle of it.  After about two seconds it left, shooting directly out into the atmosphere.  I saw no fire, lights, trails or colors and heard no sounds.  The strange flying marshmallow was just gone.  After it left, the helicopter stopped hovering and flew away in a southwesterly direction.  If you have any questions, feel free to call me at 262-((number deleted)) after 3pm CST.  I don’t know how you could investigate this or what good it would do, which is one reason why I didn’t report it earlier.  Good luck!

The red lights didn't seem to flash like the center chartreuse green light.

The following is an account of a real UFO sighting from the balcony of a cruise ship in the Caribbean in 2002.  I’m not sure why I have waited this long to file this report, but once an ardent skeptic of most UFO tales, everything changed on a late summer night in the Atlantic Ocean.  So although late in arriving, here is my story:  On August 27, 2002, while cruising aboard the ship Carnival Pride, I woke up from a deep sleep, only to find myself oddly sitting on the edge of the bed, facing our cabin’s patio door.  The drapes were drawn.  I do not know what alerted me to arise from my sleep, nor can I explain what prompted me to go out onto the cabins private balcony that early morning.  It was approximately 2:30 am.  As I stepped out onto the balcony, I moved forward to the balcony railing.   Our ship was roughly 200 miles out from land, with the first destination stop, being Half Moon Cay, Carnival’s private island.  Our cabin was positioned on the port side of the ship, facing west, traveling in a southerly direction.  At first glance I was drawn to the front of ship, as the moon was out and nearly visible through a small bank of clouds.  The illumination of the moon cascaded over the dark blue pristine waters below.  Then I proceeded to glance upwards, staring straight port side.  To my amazement I spotted a very large cluster of multicolored lights. One light appeared to be very bright and white at its center, while a series of smaller individual lights of blue, green and red surrounded it.  I can’t be sure, but it appeared very much as if its shape were triangular.  My best guess is that it was approximately 70 degrees off horizon and its scale, although difficult to determine would have covered a bald fist at arms length.  By this determination, I gather that this object was very large and probably close.  It did not move or make a sound.  It merely hovered.  A very slight misty cloud obscured about 25% of the visible object. It took a few minutes for my brain to register what it was seeing. I watched it for about 10 seconds.  I was stunned! It definitely was not a plane. It was also unlikely a helicopter, especially given the distance from any land mass.  I must admit, despite the initial state of shock, I was quite proud of myself, in that I immediately recognized the rare nature of this observance and quickly took action.  It registered with me, that only a photo or a video of this object, would exonerate me of any embellishment, should I choose to share this unbelievable sight with another.  So the following actions occurred within the frame work of 7-9 seconds:  I quickly remembered I had left our camera bag, just inside the patio door, on the floor, out of the way of the normal traffic aisle. The small quarters of our cabin made this a logical storage place.  Coincidentally, it would also offer me the shortest distance in retrieving the cameras and film this object.  As I turned to open the door, I placed one foot inside our cabin, keeping my other foot outside, thereby propping the door open.  I reached in for our video camera and as I backpedaled to the open balcony railing again, I opened the lens case, activated the camera, all at the same time.  This is why I reference the time frame of 7-9 seconds.  Why is this important? It will become perfectly clear with my next testimonial.  As I swung the camera upwards and toward the direction of the object, to my utter dismay, it was gone.  It had simply vanished. I couldn’t believe it. Only a few seconds had passed.  I was however, not deterred.  I noticed off in the distance, a very small but bright light.  At first I thought it might be a planet, such as Mars, which as I recall, was highly visible in the Western sky at that time of the year.  I still decided to zoom in and film it, in the event it might have been what I watched in total astonishment a few seconds earlier, and twenty-times larger!  I took nearly two minutes of video.  I used the railing cap to steady my camera.  While I realize, that a digital camera, zoomed to a near infinite range, can cause square pixilation’s and that some subjects, illuminating brightly as a source, can create false images, such as a rainbow effect with twinkles of various colored lights; what I saw, was something far different. It seemed to have a single image of light, countered by the surprise emergence of a second (different) colored light from behind.  Then a third colored light.  I don’t think Mars would react that way.  At that point, I felt I had recorded a sufficient amount of tape to make a convincing case for something obviously unidentified as nothing short of an unexplained, unidentified flying object (UFO).  It was now time to wake up my wife. While keeping our two children sleeping, I would soon add a second set of eyes, in a sanity check, to see if I was imagining the whole thing.  I went inside our cabin and awoke her.  Despite her groggy state, like a good trooper, she trudged out on the balcony with me, to add an equal witness to this sighting.  While she manned (woman) a set of binoculars, I continued to film the subject.  Once again and much more clearly, a red object immerged from behind the larger brighter object, as if hovering or orbiting around it.  The mystery only became more bizarre, as within minutes of the sighting, a group of three ships floating on the water, off in the distance, suddenly appeared.  I know for certain that they were not there before.  After discovering them, my film shows at least one of them floating on the surface.  To conclude, I can only surmise the following:  Did (what ever it was) possess some artificial intelligence that flagged it of my observing presence on deck?  If so, did it react by speeding away at an incredible rate (as I’ve heard of, in other cases) to avoid a video camera image that clearly would have rivaled the one I eventually captured?  To film it at maybe 1-2 miles away vs. perhaps 20 miles?  I’ll never know.  And what significance did the surprise appearance of three smaller vessels on the ocean have to do with this experience.  I have enclosed snapshot pictures or frames of the video I shot.  I have kept the video to myself.  As of this writing, after 4 ½ years, only 6-7 other people know of our UFO encounter.

My wife and I were coming out of a church meeting, when she looked into the sky and said ""What's that?"". There were 3 perfectly shaped triangles flying in formation, in an irregular way (not like normal aircraft). They were flying low, below the upper level clouds. In fact, that was the only way to see them in that they blotted out the stars and the clouds above then. There were no lights at all. There was no sound at all. I have seen stealth aircraft several times (even at night) and they do not look perfectly triangular. These were, equal sides with no ""Flaps"" or appendages. They flew quickly accross the sky, zig-zagging and speeding up/slowing down in an unusual way. Then they sped off at a great rate of speed and were gone from sight. This was right over the intersection of I-4 and International Drive, in the toutist district. We thought that it was pretty bold of ""whosever"" they were to fly over the city. But, in truth, unless you were looking right at them you would not see them. Later, it appeared to us that some jets flew accross the sky in the same direction, perhaps in pursuit?

And yes I know the difference between what all types of air craft look like, I hope it's your's, one did come from the lake one time to with no lights or makings(skipped across the water and stoppped then went up) Lake Winnipeg) You will see them this year they do come a few times a year.

It was like a star appeared, then grew very bright..brighter then any other star in the sky and then dimmed to roughly the same luminousity as the rest...THEN it began to move in an arc very similiar to other sattelites that we have seen. Constant speed and direct slow path across the sky at a very high altitude. The thing that stumped me was to see it clearly appear and grow brighter while remaining absolutely stationary relative to the other stars visible and then a grow dimmer and THEN start to move in the drifting like unchanging arc across the sky like you see with Sattelites. It was clearly stationary first. Almost as if something entering orbit? Very similiar to many Sattelites I have seen while star gazing with the exception of how it appeared and went from appearing stationary to moving and how it changed brightness.

I looked up in the sky because I saw some clouds and I hoped they wouldn’t block the sun while I was tanning. I first thought I was seeing eye fluid bubbles, “I don’t know their correct name”, and so I rubbed my eyes and lay starring up at the clouds again not expecting to see anything. Watching the clouds move, I let my eyes relax in a gaze. What I saw were two very little or just really high in the sky, ball shaped, silver objects moving and stopping in and around the clouds. I watched as they moved and stopped and fallowed each other in the sky. After a while one vanished and the other vanished soon after.  I told my sister when she got home but she just said, “Oh”, but that to be expected I guess. So nothing super really happen that day but I got to see two UFO’s and that was really cool.

I was doing this for maybe 3 nights prior to seeing this, and was actually thinking how id like to see a ufo, and so i sat peacefully staring and pondering about et and life.  This is when it almost scared me because three stars(lights just dimmer than stars) started to move in unison, in a triangular shape(a triangle that was flat with the earth that distorted with distance) it was heading nw slowly. i tried not to blink because the glair from city lights there made it harder to see the farther it moved.  I was hoping to see it pass a star through the center of the object to determine if it was solid of not but never noticed it happen, just floated silently to disappear in the orange glow of the horizon.

I was eight years old.  It was a sunny day and sometime in late afternoon, or early evening, our phone rang.  It was a friend of my father’s and he told us to go up to the roof of our building because there were UFO’s flying around. My father and I rushed upstairs to the roof of the building and facing downtown New Brunswick, we could see very clearly, about four flying saucers.  They were roughly about 500-700 ft. up and were clearly ""PLAYING!""   (In aviation circles, it is what is called dogfighting). They were chasing each other and darting in hard right angles and various other tight angles that our planes were incapable of doing.  However, they stayed within an imaginary box, so to speak. My father’s friend showed up within 5 minutes carrying a telescope.  He quickly set it up and we all had a turn viewing them through the scope.  I was amazed just to see them, in the first place, but seeing them through a telescope, really up close and personal, was truly something else. The ships were silver but not shiny like the bright side of aluminum foil, more like the reverse side, like a brushed metal texture but lighter in color.  The metal, in the bright sunlight, had a bluish tinge to it reflecting the sun’s light off of it.  They were what I would call the traditional cup and saucer shapes.  Two plates with the top one inverted over the bottom and an inverted cup on top of the two plates.  All four ships were of the same shape. As I watched one of them through the telescope (I could only watch one because the ships weren’t far away to begin with.  Looking at it through the telescope brought it so close that I really couldn’t capture an entire ship in my view, just a section of a ship), I noticed it was radiating colors.  Starting at the top inverted saucer of the ship, first a transparent red color, quite faint, would slowly move towards the bottom of the ship.  As the red reached the bottom, then the color green would start at the top and work its way down to the bottom, also transparent in texture, with the red color starting back up at the top again. Suddenly, as if on cue, they streaked out of sight. Within 2-3 seconds, they were gone. I can’t say how long they were up there because I don’t know how long they were there before we got that phone call, but from memory, I would guess we were able to watch them for about 10 minutes. The following day, in the local New Brunswick newspaper (The Home News), there was a picture of those UFO’s right on the front page.

While camping approximately six miles east of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on December 25, 1978 I witnessed a phenomenon at 9:30 PM Pacific Standard Time.  Looking north, I saw a very large glow perhaps 2,000 feet above the mountains.  These mountains were less than two miles away and my very first instinctive thought was that a 747 had exploded.  In a few seconds I realized I was viewing something very extraordinary and tried to absorb details while yelling to other campers to wake up and see what I was watching. A friend's sister and mother emerged and immediately pushed the children back in the VW bus they were camping in.  One of them exclaimed it was a flying saucer--a thought I hadn't permitted myself to have.  The large orange glow must have been between 100-300 feet in length.  Within the elliptical glow were two smaller ellipses, perhaps one third of the way in from each side, which were brighter glows within the large orange glow and close to the color of a white florescent light.  One of the two women with me said there were two saucers, but I felt and still feel there was only one huge structure because the two brighter glows within the large glow stayed perfectly parallel to each other as the large glow descended to my left at about a 35 degree angel. I viewed this descent for about 45 seconds to a minute and a half.  The glow disappeared behind a huge rock called Cabo Falso, about three quarters of a mile away.  As the glow came closer to the top of Cabo Falso the brightness began to fade--alsmost as if it were burning out.  There were no sparks, but the extremely bright glow grew much dimmer as it got close to the sea. The next day I went to Cabo to find out if anyone else saw this light.  I talked with five or six others who had seen it from an outdoor beach bar and they said the glow went into the ocean.  Like myself, they were teachers enjoying a Christmas vacation.  The next year I spoke with a lady named Elsa who was married to Harvey--a couple we camped with for about ten years.  She told me that Harvey would not permit her to talk about it, but she had seen a large saucer hovering over brush not too far from where she was camped.  The saucer then flew above the mountains where I first saw it.  The next morning, Elsa told me, she examined the nearby brush and it had been burned a brown color by the saucer.  Elsa and Harvey have both passed away--they were in their 70's in 1978. I recall trying to listen if I could hear this glow, but the only identifiable sound was hundreds of coyotes howling from a mile or more away and beneath the glow.  There was nothing surreal about the experience--it seemed natural.  I thought at the time that all you had to do to see things like this is to spend a lot of time outdoors at night.  I have seen strange lights on occasion since, but these have always been 20 or 30 miles away and not identifiable.  The experience was the most memorable one of my life.",2008-04-17T00:00:00,,

The premises are outdoors and are guarded by guard and dogs in strategic positioning.While outside and on top of the small roof overlooking the night and starry sky. I distinctly recall the perfect night and how the stars were out. Then as i positioned to my left and towards lower manhattan side i noticed what seemed to be a shooting star. It was bright and streaking with a blue red into the atmosphere. I was amazed first as i thought it a rare chance to see a shooting star. But as i expected it to fizzle out. It only went distant and stopped seemingly pulsating. I was thinking this is odd. Then the pulsing had in a flash moved east as if by a enormous speed and in a  seeming instant. I was now really getting a bit curious and also uncertain what i was expecting. Then i noticed another pulsing closer and i was now sure this was more than odd. Within a flash i looked up and there directly by some amazing unexplained way i was seeing this enormous craft that was very sophisticated and truly unimaginable. The outer side was running a thousand patterns of seemingly colored lights in some sort of sequence. Yet somehow i looked towards the center directly above me and saw movement as if something was being done within the opening as it seemed to turn. But i didn't know what it was doing.Yet i also knew that if i could see this craft here in a borough of ny city then this may have a cloaking ability or some type of force to disguise or hide itself if necessary for its own advantages.I knew that in a instant just by its presence. That i was just nervous and almost wishing for what happened when it just ascended into the upper heights directly above then did the zipping movement into the distance where i saw a pulsation again and then it zipped out. This i almost never share due to its circumstance and the nature of our being on earth. But i feel this event had shown me there are real di! mensions to other realms of being and a extreme degree of sophistication and who knows what else around .

About halfway home, there was a bright flash all around me.  Almost like a flash of a huge camera going off.   Right after the flash, everything in my car started to die slowly.  The lights went out, the radio stopped working and eventually the car died completely.  My first thought was a battery problem.   The next thing I remember was the car starting up again on it's own and everything working as before.  I drove on home, (there were no cell phones back then), thinking it had only been a few seconds.  I was completely shocked when I arrived at our house in military housing to find out that I had lost an hour and 20 minutes.  I have absolutely no memory of what happened during that time. Ever since that incident, I have had many medical issues and severe back problems.  Doctors always ask me if I've had an injury. My husband and I have been married 32 years and have seen many UFO's in our travels across the US.  The largest one was in Wasilla, Alaska, somewhere around 1993/1994.  It was about the length of 3 football fields.  Several cars were stopped along the road watching it and it was reported in the paper the next day.  Even state troopers reported seeing it. After that sighting, my husband began having vivid dreams.  We found out about 5 years ago that my husbands blood type changed.  He'd been typed in High School and throughout his Military Career as type O+.  He had a physical 5 years ago and was typed A+.  The doctors thought there was a mistake and sent him to the hospital to be re-typed.  Although all his previous records showed O+, he is now A+ as confirmed by three seperate doctors. We have a firm belief in UFO's and watch every show on television about them.  The dreams, for mly husband still continue.  Mine have stopped for now, but we still see many UFO's, some just lights and some we can see the entire body of the ship.

I have 3 incidents that I believe have made me more open minded than ever.  Here are may sightings............    1.  I was around 10 give or take 2 years when my friends and I were walking down the B and O railroad tracks behind my house.  We entered the town of West Wyoming and as we past our favorite and Only outside movie screen.  We got near some field by the tracks and saw a burnt area.  So my 3 friends and I went and checked it out.  When we approached the area it looked like a perfect circle with a circumference around 25 feet !!  As we searched the circle the grass and weed structures were bent in perfect harmony.  I did not remember if there was a smell.  We were intrigued when a police cruiser came to the spot and told us we would have to leave so as we were just fooling around in the field we left.   But I never forgot that spot and never went back..  As I drive on a road near that spot I think of the spot every now and then.    2.  I was with a friend named ((name deleted)) down Wyoming avenue  in Kingston at twilight near Cook's Pharmacy when we noticed 3 bright lights in a triangle about 500 yards in the sky.  The lights took a slight left turn and headed toward the river,  So we followed.  We could see the lights and when we reached the river near the cross valley extension they turned north up the river descended and went toward the river itself and whoosh ....the 3 bright lights disappeared near the  river.  ((name deleted)) never talked about this and never denied or said a word when I discussed this.    3.  It was a beautiful early morning ( 6 am.) ((name deleted)) and I went fishing at Harvey 's Lake a 25 minute drive from home.  We were out the night before got little sleep because we planned this a few days ago.  So we went to a a big rock across from Hanson's Park ( you can see the old ricketty rollercoaster ) around a quarter mile across.  There is a patch of hill than a stone patio next to dock we have permission to fish from.  we decided to setup on the patio.  As we fished you could see the street light across the way by the park.  So we fished and some time later around a hour or two I noticed that the light didn't go out and seemed a little closer.  I thought nothing of it and fished some more.  Then I noticed it closer than BAM.......... I looked up in the sky and saw a Black object hoovering oh so slow above us moving toward our back.  It looked like no UFOs I saw in books and other source before.  The shape was like a small triangle in front with another bigger triangle behind it. I have a attachment drawing it was all black.  AS I ran to the road that circumferences the lake the craft went slowly out of sight.  When I ran back to Steve he looked bewildered ,  I said;  hey man did you see that and he just keep fishing with a sort of nod. O asked him what time it was he said 10:30 am.. A hour or two disappeared !!  It sort of freaked me out and excited me at the same time.  Again Steve would not talked about the incident and that was that.

I deduced that an airport must be nearby and began scanning the sky for other aircraft. Not noticing anything, my scan gradually rose in altitude until I noticed a V-formation of white dots flying from west to north-east. I counted seven individual dots, one on point and three on each leg. They were moving rapidly, left no contrails, and appeared to be at extremely high-altitude. They had no discernible form, appearing as small white dots-not shiny but soft white. I watched them move at a constant speed for approximately 15 to 20 seconds as they traversed 45 degrees of azimuth. At that point they appeared to slow almost imperceptibly and then vanished. Analysis:  Although this event occurred almost 13 years earlier, it is quite accurate. I had written down the particulars shortly after it happened, and my present memory of the event corresponds exactly to that written record. I have also confirmed the exact date, although the time of day is approximate. It is impossible to tell at what altitude these objects were flying. However, I expect that they were at extremely high altitude because they had no discernible form. Commercial aircraft flying at FL330 have a clearly visible aircraft shape, but these objects were merely dots. They were clearly not birds, which display a typical individual motion as they flap their wings. These objects never varied in size, color, intensity or motion. It is quite apparent that just before they vanished from view they began a turn, giving the perception of slowing. As the turn progressed, they no longer reflected sunlight toward me and became invisible. The angle of azimuth covered by the flight of the objects is known because they came into my view just beyond the left corner of the windshield and they disappeared almost directly ahead. Furthermore, this section of the Interstate was as straight as an arrow, for you could see the road stretch out for miles ahead with no curves whatsoever. The duration of observation is approximate; I did not record the exact times. Estimating duration of time for short-lived events is notoriously inaccurate, unless there is some reference. Because I am cognizant of this fact, I have tried to mentally relive the event and time its duration. While observing the objects I kept pointing them out to my passenger, who never did see them. I have taken that dialog into account and added additional precious seconds to arrive at what I believe is a fairly close and extremely conservative approximation. Given these variables, it can be estimated that at 30,000 feet the speed of the formation would be between approximately 780 and 1045 MPH, and at 50,000 feet the speed would range from approximately 1295 to 1725 MPH.",2008-04-17T00:00:00,43.05037092436975,-76.157063697479

On Sunday February 17 at 8:12 pm (pst) I observed something in the sky that exhibited flight properties that were unique.  I was walking southbound on 78th Ave Se in the 2200 block of Mercer Island, the sky was exceptionally clear and I paused to observe the night sky.  While looking South-Southeast I saw a point of light that was moving.  The object was about the height of the moon at the time, in the area between the moon and my judgment of due south.  I my judgment of direction was based off the street (I assume the street is pointing due south, the street grid is pretty uniform)  The object’s size, intensity, and color were similar to that of the adjacent stars. Initially I thought it was a shooting star or satellite however the object separated into three distinct points of light. The 3 individual points had equivalent luminosity and size, in addition it should be noted that these “subunits” were equivalent to the single point I saw initially.  These three points seemed to stop in their trajectory, and organized themselves into a trigonal conformation.  The three objects then moved briefly south and then in formation westward, the three points changed their conformation as they moved; I noticed a few different distinct patterns in their movement.  1)	Initially the three point’s seemed to change their speed relative to each-other so that each point cycled through being the leading vertex of the triangle. I would describe their formation as a triangle rolling across the sky. (This conformation was observed as the object(s) moved south to a lower position relative to the horizon, and again as they went west) 2)	The three points then re-arranged themselves into a line; the line was almost perpendicular to their direction of travel [westward]. 3)	Two times the three points seemed to collapse into 1 point, and then disperse into 3 points. 4)	The linear conformation was the largest, I would judge it as being between 1.2 to 1.5 times the size of the moon at the time.   The trigonal conformation was slightly smaller than the size of the moon.  The objects velocity and more importantly their acceleration was outside of anything I have seen.  The objects moved across the night sky approximately 35-45 degrees westward from the initial point of sighting in about a minute.    As the objects moved west I lost sight of them in the glow cast off by Seattle.  My house is on the flight path for a few different airports in the area and object did not seem to be moving in a manner similar to normal air traffic over my home.  I have lived here for 20 years and feel that I have a sense of where the normal air traffic going into or leaving Seatac, Boeing field or Renton Municipal airport should be.  I completed pilot ground school and have logged a few hours in a Cessna, although I am not an expert I am familiar with aircraft.  In addition the US Navy Blue Angles perform over my house ever summer.    The objects I saw did not behave in a manner consistent with my experiences of aircraft.  I recently completed a year of college physics and would say that the objects’ acceleration was amazing.  They seemed to keep a constant speed relative to the horizon while they made their maneuvers.  I did not notice any sound associated with the objects, the points’ small size and lack of audible sound leads me to believe that this object was far away.  This is just an assumption I am making though; in my opinion it is very hard to accurately judge the size  or distances of airborne objects with the unaided eye.  I have no opinion as to what it was exactly I saw, but it was defiantly something unique that I will not soon forget.

Could be distant radio towers, but some things don't fit. On the night of February 18, 2008, my spouse and I were driving south on Highway 285 from IH-40.  About half-way between Vaughn and Roswell, I saw a group of red lights on the horizon towards the east/southeast (driver’s side of the car).  The lights were very low on the horizon--from my perspective they were at or near the ground.  There were at least a dozen red lights spread out over several hundred yards (from my perspective) and pulsing/blinking on and off at the same rate and at the same time.  They looked just like pulsing radio tower lights, except they were so low to the ground.  The lights were not moving.  The lights were somewhat dim (my husband couldn’t see them at all), and were not always visible since the terrain was slightly hilly.  Eventually, as we continued south, the lights moved fully toward the east, then east/northeast, then out of sight.  My first reaction was that it was a nearby airfield, but blinking red lights would not typically be used on a runway.  Looking at area maps, there is very little in the area.  We were already well south of Clovis/Cannon AFB, headed south, and the lights I saw were towards the east/southeast.  Also, since the lights were generally towards the east, I don’t believe it was the Roswell airport either.  Those lights didn’t come into view until much later, and were directly in front of us (due south).  The most logical explanation is that this was a large group of radio or cellphone tower lights far in the distance -- perhaps as far as the NM/TX border -- that appeared from my perspective to be near the horizon. (We were using XM at the time, so I don’t know if there was an actual radio signal transmitting.)  The only thing that doesn't fit this explanation is that most radio tower groups I've seen have lights pulsing at different times, and these lights all pulsed simultaneously.  Primarily, I’m curious if anyone in the area has seen something similar, and/or if someone knows of a feature in the area that fits with what I saw.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,34.6065,-105.1023

Around 6pm I went out on the balcony to get some fresh air.  I noticed the normal air traffic coming and going near LAX.  I then saw these red lights flashing unlike the other planes.  I called my roommate to take a look and he also agreed that it was not an airplane.  We saw a group of lights moving about the speed of an airplane moving in a NW direction.  It seemed like it was flying along the coastline.  The lights would flash in random intervals. There where no other lights but about 4 red lights.  It could have been one craft, the lights moved as if it where one.  The size would have been huge, maybe miles wide! It was about as wide a 4 finger width, if you put your hand in front of you. We saw this thing continue north and finally disappeared in the horizon.  I went inside for a few minutes.  When I cam back out it had come back a bit like it turned around but was heading in he same direction again.  The lights would flash in random order.  It seems there where two on the outside and two closer to the middle.  The light flash was very bright and precise. These were not normal lights.  I would also guess the craft was in a v shape bcuase of the way the lights moved. I kept looking in the sky after it had gone.  I noticed some flashing lights again but this time it seems like an airplane.  I thought it could have been a military jet because the way the lights flashed where different than the other airplanes.  Later I saw a bright light approaching outside of the normal flight path.  Then the light turned off and I saw the same type of airplane lights that I saw after the red lights passed by.  I really think this was a military jet escorting ! or looki ng fir the craft.

I was on my way to Phoenix, traveling eastbound on I-10. My exact location was about the 32 mile marker southwest of Salome at the I-10/US 60 interchange. I had been visually scanning the sky since I left my fuel stop in Quartzite because the night was clear and I like to spot meteorites. The section of the sky I saw the UFO in, I had scanned 6 to 7 seconds prior and there was nothing there. I was looking straight ahead, at the sky and road in front of me, when a bright light caught my eye to my left. I had the window rolled down, and was able to immediately dismiss it as a reflection from lights I sometimes see on my right that are reflected off the driver side window. The object was traveling at tremendous speed in a north east direction at a 40 degree declination off the horizon. At first I dismissed the object as falling space debris because of the blue color of the corona around a bright white center. But when the object disappeared, I thought different. Let me explain why. Normally space debris, or meteorites, after entering or burning up in the atmosphere fade out quickly as they cool or loose enough material to no longer burn. In comparison with a Aries V rocket launch I witnessed being launched from Vandenburg Air force Base last Thursday morning, It is my belief that what I saw was not a vehicle entering the atmosphere but leaving. I went to a hilltop, about 3 miles from the rocket launch, to recorded it High Definition Video. From 3 miles away I could see the rocket very clearly. The UFO was traveling twice as fast as the Aries rocket did, and was 3 to 4 times larger in it’s brightness, at a distance of to 20 to 25 miles or more. The distance was figured by the moon lit silhouette of the mountain range to the north and under the UFO. It’s path was in a north east direction headed away from me, and just before it disappeared the brightness intensified for about one second. I feel confidant, with my experience in the military, and my knowledge of aircraft, that this was a vehicle that was traveling at a high altitude and only showed itself when it needed to reach escape velocity. The total view time was only 3 ½ to 4 seconds, and was a beautiful white round burst of energy surrounded by a blue corona of light. It left no contrail, but did leave a short trail of light that followed it closely. It made no discernible noise, my big rig was too noisy to hear it if it did. In comparing it’s size with the half full moon this night, it was large enough to cover half of that. It was an awesome display of power and technology.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,,

It was obviously traveling at speeds faster than an airplane, which I admit, I am in an area where planes fly by frequently, but this is how I know it was not an airplane. One of the most odd things I noticed about the object was it’s motion. I seemed to be making very close swerves, like a back and forth motion. They were not large movements, but noticeable in spite of it’s speed and duration of appearance. I also noticed that the object was below the cloud coverage, or seemed to be. I was very sure of this detail at the time, but looking back I question whether it was only my eyes telling me that, due to the thinness of cloud coverage.

The lights banked slightly(West light a little up, East light a little down) and now headed apparently due North.

The two objects were out in front, had no wings, no noticeable rotors spinning, cigar-like shaped structures. They couldn't have been helicopters as there was no multi-rotor ""swash"" in the air that you hear with multiple helicopters in flight. They kept a tight tandem formation. All three aircraft were flying in tandem at the same speed together about the normal speed as any commercial helicopter. As they passed by the house I quickly ran to the front of the house and watched as they turned and went westbound over Hwy 50 over the mountains, the two objects out in front of the black hawk becoming harder to see the further away they went. With just a hint of setting sun in the west I could still see the black hawk rotor blades but nothing for the other two objects in front. The elevation here is about 4500' and the aircraft were flying probably at around 7500' - 8000' not too low but not real high either. It is extremely unusual for any aircraft not to have it's lights on in the night sky at this time of night. Something very strange was getting a military escort tonight to somewhere. About 25 minutes later I heard and saw the same red strobed military helicopter return from the west heading south, but it was too far west to see if the other objects were still with it.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,39.16921421319797,-119.75176954314722

ON 7/20/2007 between 10:00 Pm and 10:15 PM I went out to the local Jewel store to get a pack of cigarettes. As I was driving home approx 1/4 of a mile to my house, I saw an enormous disc shaped craft in the sky to my left. If you saw seven to ten low flying airplanes side by side I would quess that to be the size of it. It appeared to be a very large dark disc shape with bright yellow lights in the center, the lights were so bright they looked like large flourecent bulbs in the center. I also saw some small blue and grey lights which appeared to be on each end of it.It made no noise as you would expect a large craft would make.  As I was driving, I remember at least one other vehicle coming from the east I began to yell and flash my lights to try and get his attention, because I did not want to be the only one seeing this. As he passed me by I saw the object moving quickly to the south west. I pulled into my home driveway as it was quickly moving to the west, I saw my fathers car who lives next door pulling in front of my garage. I jumped out of the car to try and get my wife to come and see this, as I got out of my car my father said what the hell was that! I said did you see that! as I was running to the door to get my wife. By the time she came out the craft was far to the west and moving south. My wife only caught a glimpse in the distance, and said oh maybe it was a blimp. I said I can still see it, and we grabbed our dogs and jumped in the car and  drove to the south west and it was nowhere in sight. But to recap my visual experience, this craft was hovering to my left in the sky to my west. A extremely large disc shaped craft with bright yellow lights in the center and lights on what appeared to be each end of the craft blue and gray. Making no noise, by eye it was very close to me yet it was still high enough in the sky to not make an accurate judgement of the size. Big enough to cause me to be in awe and writing this letter. Although, it appeared to be hovering moving slow it th! en moved so quickly that within  2 minutes or so it was completely out of site. The disc itself appeared to be a dark grey color, however it was night so it looked black or grey. If you saw a low flying plane in the sky, this would have been at least ten planes as I mentioned it was HUGE! I dont know what these crafts are military or something else but Im now a believer! 30 Miles south of Chicago it was here!",2007-08-07T00:00:00,41.5895,-88.0578

My husband got his camera out of the back seat and tried to take video but by the time he got the camera ready it was too far away to capture the object properly.  It was not completely round nor was it flashing, but orange and did not fade. It was too close to the ground and stationary at first to be a plane, and since it did not fade away or flash, it could not have been something floating away from someones fire.  I have no idea what it was but the fact that it was pretty much hovering over the road was terrifying to me.  It did not start moving until we pulled over.  We tried to take a video of it with our camera but by the time my husband got it out the object was too far away to look like much of anything on film.

I looked at this very bright light to try and discern whether it was moving because I wan't conviced it was the planet Venus, and after 10 0r 15 mins of stationary position the bright light snapped off and immediately began ascending in a steady but wobbly manner with blinking red lights, and once it reached the altitude it wanted it proceeded to move north.  It's lift was not that of a plane nor when it began moving north after leveling off, it moved faster than a plane would or could, and the thing that convinced me that this was unusual was that my dog was very skittish as were the other dogs in the neighborhood with their barking, but my dog didn't bark he just stayed close next to me which is not our normal behavior when I go out to the hot tub, we play ball when I am in the tub.

Last night, while taking my nightly stroll through my apartment complex, I was looking up at the sky observing the stars. The sky was pretty clear considering we had thunderstorms earlier that day. I spotted what I took at first to be a star because It was a bright yellowish white colour, solid throughout and very high in the sky. However, I then noticed it was moving. I stopped walking and watched it. It was flying in a strait pattern but going rather too fast and smooth for an airplane. I took off my headphones to listen for sound, to make sure it wasn't a plane or for some bizaree reason a helicopper (though it seemed too high up for this) I couldn't hear anything but the normal car noises ect. It didnt have any light changes and I didn't see any red lights or pulsating lights like on a plane. I walked forwards to watch it until it disapeared behind a tress near by. I continued on my walk, shortly afterward, maybe three minutes later, a plan flew over head. It looked nothing like what I saw minutes before and was at the normal height in the sky. This is strange to me because its the second sighting I've had in the last week. I can't remember the exact day, I think It was Tuesday or Wednesday. It was about 1:30-2:00pm I was driving to see a friend at work when I noticed a a silvery object really high in the sky, higher then I had ever seen a plane go. It's shape was somewhat circular and I couldn't make out any wings. I observed it until I turned a corner and it was gone from my view.

The sound which woke me from sleep was VERY loud and VERY deep...it was nearly deafening!  Once I had been woken, it lasted for probably 8 to 10 seconds.  I can't say how long it had been there since I had previously been asleep.  But then, it departed FAST!  It was so fast that within a second, all noise was completely gone!  The sound changed and you could tell it became very distant VERY fast (and sounded almost as if it had sucked the atmosphere as it departed, if that makes sense).  Whatever it was, was way faster than any plane I had ever heard!  I was afraid to go outside at first (this thing was seriously loud, it had shaken me up!), but after a few minutes (after having heard it depart at such an astronomical speed) I went out to look in the sky and saw nothing and no trace.  There was a full cover of very white clouds in the sky though (which was weird being it was at night, and that they were so bright) but none of them seemed to be disturbed.  There is supposed to be a military facility that deals in top secret aircraft outside of Rockwall Texas (away from Mesquite).  My guess is, it was probably a very VERY fast military craft (faster than ANYTHING made public).  I guess that the sightings in Stephensville, TX may also be accounted for by whatever inventions are going on outside of Rockwall.  I just thought I'd share this.

Before deciding it was not any celestial body I was familiar with and seemed too deliberate in it's ""twinkle"". The object was obviously high above the earth and did not appear to be  moving from it's general position. Which was not far above the tree line and to the SE of my position when first noticed it. I went and grabbed my astronomical binoculars and returned with it not having appeared to move. I focused on the craft and clearly made out intense bright lights which varied in pattern and color. The colors appeared to be red, green and white. The white light seemed particularly intense. There was a variation in speed of color change and pattern change. As well as varied patterns. Though hard to be certain it did appear to be a circle perhaps a sphere? But due to some of the patterns and the manner they appeared it seemed a circle. Honestly hard to be sure of a dark shape against a dark sky. The lights however were very visible and easy to make out as well as certain patterns. For example a circle of light alone made up of lights appearing to be on the edge of the craft. As well as patterns appearing on what appeared to be the bottom and a mixture of the two. It did seem to move but not in a rotational ""flying"" manner. It seemed to only move across the sky very slow as though stationary. As it was first noticed from the front walk and was followed over the hours to the side and back. There was another witness whom I called out to confirm what I was seeing and followed it off and on for the duration as well. They too used astronomical binoculars and actually were kind of startled. They could make out the lights and the changing of patterns and intensity as well. Though never under the impression that it was the ISS as I have observed it. We confirmed the ISS was not in the area. Further when it is it does not exactly linger. Likewise with satellites which it could not be for several reasons. Nor was it any type of airplane or helicopter. First it was far too high and second I live near an airport. I know what a plane and a chopper in the sky look like.

I was sitting there looking up at the stars, ( the sky was clear and no wind) a typical thing for me to do, and all of the sudden there was this dark thing flying over our heads.  Just as I said what the heck is that, my 10 year old son looked up and saw the same thing.  It was moving at a slow steady pace.  It was dark out so there was just enough light to make out the outline of this object.  I say object but really it looked more like some kind of creature, not an inanimate craft.  As far as size goes, being dark it was hard to judge the distance in height, but it appeared to definitely be above the tree line but lower than an airplane that is usually way up there.  It was probably about 20-30 feet in length and 15 feet wide. Around the time of the sighting, an airplane did go by on the other side of my house, it was flying kind of low as it was coming in to land.  It had all it’s lights on and I would say this thing was probably as high as that plane.  It was dark in color, kind of an ashy blackish brown color.   From my point of view, (directly under it) it didn’t appear to have wings, and was sort of lumpy around the edges, kind of like a blob.  It’s belly looked to be very smooth and flat, sort of like the belly of a stingray.  It had no lights, no sound, it was totally silent and was gliding very smoothly through the sky.  It had what I would describe as a tail although it just looked a little more narrow than the body of it. We were able to watch it for about 3 -5 minutes before it was out of our view.  I know this was not a bird, not a balloon, it was not a hawk or an eagle, or a flock of geese.  It reminded me much of a creature  from the ocean, such as a whale.    I don’t have any photos of it, when I saw it I couldn’t take my eyes off of it.  I was stunned and very curious.

My boyfriend and I were having a picnic in Franconia Notch at the Old Man in the Mountain viewing area. It was between 3 and 4 in the afternoon. I was looking up at the eastern side of the notch at the mountain peaks when I noticed a craft flying horizontally just above the peaks. It seemed to me to be a cylindrical flat craft. Cigar shaped may best describe its appearance. it was slightly smaller than a passenger plane, it was white in color but did not gleam or shine in the bright sunlight. At first it looked like a plane but I noticed that it was flying very slow. It was very far away and very high above the mountains, I could not make a guess at the exact distances. when I realized its peculiar slow movement I pointed it out to my boyfriend. He acknowledged it and assured me it was just a plane. It did not however visibly have wings or a tail and did not make any sound.  just as it was about to ""fly"" behind a right mountain peak it abruptly made a 180 degree turn into the opposite direction and it seemed to speed up and abruptly turned in the opposite direction again heading in the original direction and ""flew"" behind the mountain peaks out of view.

Specially do to the fact that it was still day light out, and she preceded to take three pictures of it. It was an easy shot for the camera do to the exposure light available.  We went on to the party and once we arrived we just kept watching this still light, but this time with her mom and her step dad, brother, brother girl friend, and last to arrive was my friend and his two boys from San Diego CA.

On Sept. 22, 2007 at approx. 7:15pm we noticed a very bright light low in the southern sky while walking to our car after diner in San Pablo, Colorado.  This bright object appeared to be due south at about 12-15 degrees above the horizon.  The bright object was bigger and brighter than any planet I’ve ever scene.  It was 3 to 4 times bigger than Venus and incredibly bright.  I convinced myself it was a plane coming directly toward us, just high enough to be reflecting the bright light of sunset. As this pure white, bright circle of light grew slightly in circumference and brightness, I thought this must be one huge plane and it’s getting really close, I almost wanted to duck down but there never were any plane sounds.  Without binoculars, all I had to help aid in viewing was prescription sunglasses.  I got in the car to get my glasses and when I stood up again the bright object seemed to be back where I first saw it.  I’m guessing that would have been south of Taos, NM. O.K. that was odd, but the real shocker came when I put on my prescription sunglasses – the brightness was dimmed and I could see 3 distinct yellowish/gold lights - the one middle front light being slightly bigger than the 2 side lights.  There seemed to be some energy or filament connecting or flowing between the center light and the side lights.  I thought, “That ain’t right,” and pulled the sunglasses off my face and there I saw the pure white, bright light again.  What?  How can this be?  I kept taking my sunglasses off and putting them back on again trying to reconcile the two different things I was seeing - a round pure white and very bright light without my sunglasses and with them on seeing 3 separate yellow/gold lights with something blurry between them. In the moment, I convinced myself this was Jupiter and a couple of moons and accounted for the blurriness by remembering I was looking through sunglasses not binoculars, and of course the reflecting light of sunset must be causing the brightness. We stood in amazement and watched the big waxing gibbous moon move along the path of the ecliptic in the southeast while our bright object appeared motionless in the south until our view was obstructed by clouds at approx. 7:45pm. Since Sat. Sept. 22nd I’ve researched star charts and found that this bright light could not possibly have been Jupiter, as that planet was in the SSW, on the ecliptic at 26 degrees during the time our object was sighted due south at approx. 12 degrees.

I watched it for the first time in either late September or early October. 2007, but during this time span, I have seen it on almost a nightly frequency. As was the case on Nov. 10, 2007, it did not appear in the 1 AM-2:30 AM time span I did not see it at all, although I did look for it, but it does not ofteh skip more than one night. I have never seen it before 1 A.M., and although I get tired and my somethat arthritic neck gets sore if I stare at this object more thas 15 minutes at a time, I have looked for it when I woke up around 2:00 AM and don't recall ever seeing it there at that time.  It is always in the sky southwest of my house and usually does not move very noticeably until it has been observable for at least 15 minutes. At first glance it appears to be a very tight cluster of very bright white lights, but only a minute or so later, I see a bright red light coming from somewhere in the cluster, which seems to be a triangular formation during more of the time I am observing it. It seems to be more the tight cluster while it is standing still and when it is moving on a steady line to my left or right. But when it suddenly begins to dart about, it is impossible to determine its shape. And last night and at least two or three previous nights, one bright white light about the size of the object when I first observe it, breaks off from the original cluster, and then both the originaly cluster and the more or less satellite which mimics the slower movements of the original. If have not watched all this long eough to observe the first object and the second re-unite, but I have obsered that the first one observed and the sattelite never seem to get closer together or farther apart. I cannot say precisely what the spacing is. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD))",2007-11-28T00:00:00,37.275004150943396,-79.97072547169812

Witnessed by lab personel as well as 3 physicians and nurses. About 15 witnesses in all. The flying object entered from southeast at rapid rate and came to immediate stop over the city of Boise. It appeared to be at the same altitude that we were watching from, which was probably 2 0r 3 hundred feet higher that downtown area. From our position it appeared to be directly over the State Capitol. From our position, one could not determine its exact shape, because we had mostly a side view. It would be like looking at a disc from its side view. Its height to widith ratio would be like 1 to 300. It appeared to be either metallic or glasslike in nature. I was much longer than any commercial aircraft. It refracted colors sequentially along its entire width, and looked like how windows look from a distance when sunlite refracts off their surface. When it departed, it instantly accelerated at a phenonmenal speed and disappered over Bogus Basin to the north of Boise, about 20 miles from the city. It had no gas trail, and of course we were too far from the object to determine if there was any noise. The peculiar fact was there was nothing in the local news after the event. I was asked to call airport and see if they had it on radar.  I walked over to the lunchroom checkout counter and used the public phone and called the Boise tower. I was given a UFO report number at Mountain Home air force base and made the call. I cannot recall to whom I spoke, but it was an officer, and he was anxious to receive all the information. After speaking with him for about 5-10 minutes, and answering all his questions, I asked him he he could confirm this sighting. He replied, that they had picked up the object somewhere south of Salt Lake City and had lost it as it moved toward the North Pole. He also willing told me that the object's speed was in excess of 6500 miles per hour. He said that the airforce had nothing in its arsenal near that speed. he thanked me and I have never told this story to the public before.
