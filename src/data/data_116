I looked North towards the Santa Monica pier from where we were and I thought to myself what a beautiful sunset.

I stepped up with my phone and tried to focus on placing the beach, sun, and mountains as the primary objects in the shot.  I took a the first picture and quickly glanced at the result on my phones screen, immediately realizing that there was a shiny aqua colored spot in my photo, I quickly assumed it was a reflection spot of some sort.  In my mind I wasn't too satisfied with my picture so between the glance at picture 1st, and tapping the phone to zoom in a l! ittle closer, it took me approximately 8-10 seconds to take the 2nd picture later from the original shot.   As we drove home I told Annette to check out the picture I had posted on social media and I handed her my cell phone.  Immediately she pointed out the aqua sphere in the first picture to me as I drove, and without looking at it or skipping a beat I said to her, ""I know it must be a glare or something,"" while I said that she had shuffled to the second picture and quickly replied. ""the shiny spot's, on the two different pictures, and in two different locations?""

A rain storm was just hitting my area so it would have been normal for a low flying plane.   I recognized it as a plane because I noticed the red steady light and the green flashing light.   Suddenly, the red light dropped straight down and was out of view behind an enormous tree, about 4 house lengths from where I was standing,  I interrupted my friend who was speaking at the time and started explaining to him what I was seeing because I couldn't believe it.  The plane instantly became a red glowing orb and was doing a figure 8 pattern behind the tree in front of me, it would drop down heading west then pull up and around and head east over the top of the tree where I could see it.  It did this a couple of times - then as it was heading west again above the tree it stopped dead! in front of me.  I couldn't move, a part of me thought to run inside but my body wouldn't move.  It stayed still in front of me for a count of about 7 seconds I would say, then it instantly became an ""airplane"" again with the blinking green light and continued west in the same straight ""flight"" pattern it had been on initially.  The orb was a constant red light - not flashing and it's edges were fuzzy.   Also, when it stopped in front of me there was what appeared to be a dark line through the center of the orb.  It's hard to say how close the object was to me, but after seeing the area in the daylight today, I'm thinking that it was probably a 1/4 to a 1/2 mile away from me, over the main intersection in our town.

When it changed direction, it did so immediately.  When it first caught my eye around 1am, it was moving to the left, then headed down.  Headed back up, then moved left again.  Stopped for a brief minute, and when it did, it became a semi-solid/pulsating randomly white light.   When it began moving again to the right, it became the blue/purple orb it had been when it first caught my eye.  After moving for a brief moment it stopped, changed to a white light again, and this is where it sat for a solid 20mins.

Hi Peter, I have finally decided to post this sighting my wife and I experienced.  It was the 4th of July, 2013 or 14, and as you can imagine, there were lots of pyrotechnics going off around the neighborhood.  We weren't shooting any but were sitting in our back yard watching and listening to everyone else play.  It sounds like a war zone in our neighborhood every 4th and this night was no exception.  We don't see most of the rockets because of the trees surrounding our property but get an occasional glimpse of the bigger ones. I was sitting, facing SW with my wife on my right facing S.  I glanced up and noticed a large glowing/shimmering/burning object coming over the trees drifting due west (L to R) around 20 mph (?).  It was probably a half inch square-ish at arms length and was almost directly overhead, somewhat south of the zenith.  I immediately assumed it was fireworks debris from a large rocket drifting overhead.  Within 5 seconds it was clear it was not.  I shouted to my wife, ""Check it out!""  I haven't read many reports with this description, it was virtually square, the lower 80% glowing/shimmering cherry red identical to a campfire coal, the top 20% a horizontal band of pink, same characteristics.  The object and the edges all around were as indistinct as, like I said, a glowing coal in the heart of a fire. We jumped up and she asked, ""What is it?!!"".  Obviously, I had no idea, but we trotted uphill in our yard to get a better look, it is still drifting fast L to R, and suddenly veers due south and flies out of sight over the horizon.  The wind was 5 mph at the most and variable. We were really excited because it was her first real ""unknown"" sighting of any ufo stuff, and because it was obviously unique and unidentifiable.  It was DEFINITELY not debris.  How do I know?, because her brother and his girlfriend came to visit over the next 3 days, and 2 nights after the first sighting, (we had shared our story and gotten the ""yeah, right..."" reaction) my wife was at work so it was myself and the couple visiting. There were no fireworks.  We were sitting outside in a different location on the patio, gazing north and I was expounding on our sighting and was saying, ""Man, I just wish ya'll could have seen what we saw...""  Well, after I had said this about 3-4 times,  (I kept getting up and down, looking at the night sky.) I had just looked around and had my back to the north when he says, ""Look!""  I turned around and it was the exact same thing, and I said, ""That's it!!!"".   It was drifting R to L this time (We were facing north.) at the same speed as before, in a straight line.  He and I jumped up and ran to the end of our street because it went behind a large tree.  It had dimmed a lot and faded out completely within a few seconds.  Both times I would guess the object was at about 500-1000 feet.  These were very clear observations. For what it's worth, I am an aviation mechanic with nearly 40 yrs working on aircraft and a navy vet.  I have considered a drone, but it was a fiery, glowing object and I do not believe that to be the case.  Damn near square, but with distorted edges like a coal.  My best night sighting by far.  I have had a few other interesting sightings through the years, maybe I will share those some other time.  There was no noise the first night except random explosions from fireworks and no noise whatsoever on the second occasion.   Thanks for ""listening"".

UFO Sighting 2014 Summer I was sitting outside on my deck at approximately 10:00 pm I saw what I thought was a helicopter out of the corner of my eye in between two tall cedar trees close to the house.  Then it registered in my brain that there was no noise.  I looked again and it was a humungous object (about the size of at least 2 houses) with  light and it was moving very slowly and there with no noise!  I realized that I was looking up into the bottom of the UFO.  I ran into the house to get my husband to look and he just looked at me as if I was crazy.  I went outside again and it was still there.  Within a minute, it just swooped up and away in seconds and very quietly. Since that night, every so often I see a thin, totally white, stream of light coming in my kitchen window and it hits my fridge. I get an eerie feeling from it and feel fearful of it.  Its happened about 5 times now and always between the hours of 4:15 a.m. to 4:45 a.m.  The first couple of times it happened there was a loud bang on the side of the house and heavy footsteps.  The outside security light does not come on either like it should.  Have you ever heard of this before?  I am a normal person and certainly not crazy.  I would not have written but for my sister trying and trying to get me to report it since then. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

I sit down on the couch in my living room after getting something to eat like I normally do around this time of night, and turn the T.V on.  The house I was in was on the water, and there were big sliding glass doors on either side of the T.V.  After about 15 minutes of watching T.V,, I saw something strange happen, outside the right sliding glass door, about a mile away. This bright green V-shaped light appeared in the top right corner of the window, and shot at an angle down toward the water at an incredible pace!  I had never seen anything move that fast in the air.  When it got close to the water, meaning close enough to reflect well off the water, the light disappeared and in the inside center of where the ""V"" of light was there was this black and white cigar shaped craft, that looked pretty large.   I can't accurately say how large it might have been because I saw it for maybe two seconds, but it was definitely bigger than a small float plane.  It seemed as though this object was mainly black with bars of white horizontally on it.   A second or two after this object appeared, it was gone.  I have no idea where where it went, because I saw no splash or heard or wake.  I'm certain I would've heard something that big crashing into the water.  I hear whale songs all the time in the house.   To this day, the experience has left a lasting impact impact! on me.

It was sitting at approximately 400-500 feet from the roadway and was at at an altitude for from between 300-500 feet.  The craft resembled an airplane or a drone.   The color was silver/brushed gray.  It was the size of a small, early jet airliner perhaps 75-100 feet long.  The shape was that of a cylinder, rounded at both ends with the front portion being somewhat bulbous and slightly larger than the rear.  Two long wings came out from the sides, under the aircraft, and did not appear to be affixed, but gave the impression that they were part of the fuselage as if the whole thing were built as one.  The wings were chopped off at the ends, similar to what was on the old X-15 experimental aircraft, except that they were longer.  The craft had no markings and no markings.  What struck us odd was that it had no tail or landing gear of any sort.  It just remained motionless and hung there.  It did not sway or move in anyway and gave off no noise or light.   It was a sunny and perfect day weather-wise.  We watched the craft through the front and side windows of the car for about 30 or more seconds.  Just as we took our eyes off of it to make a right into Southern Maryland Hospital so that we could get out to get a better look, it simply vanished without a trace.  Traffic was heavy and we have no idea of anyone else saw what we saw.  We could not agree on what it was.  It was in what would have been the flight path for Andrews AFB, and felt that the thing was probably heading there.  However, the fact that it did not move or ""fly"" in anyway, had no tail or landing gear was highly strange.

My husband and I went out to our back deck at approx 9:30pm (21:30) on April 22, 2017, to sit for a few moments.  Upon exiting the east door to the deck we noticed the stars and Jupiter were quite bright and the moon was absent.  We shut off our deck lights so we could observe the sky since we know there was a meteor shower last night but we're not fortunate enough to see any. I thought perhaps we would see some left-over meteors tonight, so we stood facing east on the back/side deck area with the porch lights out.  To the south/south east is the city and it is brighter in that direction, there was also slight mist/clouds in that direction only (at that time). So, we both stood for a few minutes, and we both happened to be looking at the same thing, (which we did.  It realize until we were shocked at what we saw) two identical stars of exact same brightness, from our distance they appeared very small and high up, white in color, and approx 2-3 inches apart (of course we were on the deck looking at the sky), seems like normal stars, I thought the clouds were moving in fast but as it was it was NOT the clouds moving it was the ""stars.""   These objects moved exactly the same speed, were exactly the same size, exactly the same brightness, color exactly the same white, they appeared to never move erratically, they stayed exactly the same distance apart while moving, they both moved in the line of 2 at the same speed across the sky in an east/south east direction.  When they were directly in front of us in the sky, over our east neighbors rooftop, looking east, they grew VERY BRIGHT, the light was not quite white at this point it was more pale yellow, they both brightened at the exact same speed, the exact same time, the exact same size, they glowed for approx 3 seconds and then faded back to ""normal star"" brightness or ""average"" star brightness, and they continued to move in the line of 2 across the sky at the same speed, never changing direction that we could tell, and staying the exact same distance apart.  They never stopped, either.   We watched these two things move out of view and fade until! we could no longer see them.  They did not flash, blink, move strangely, or change movement, they glowed once simultaneously together very brightly.  No trail.  There were no sounds. I tried to get video but t was too late, and too dark. My husband is a technician, and I am an artist.  We have 2 kids who were both in bed at this time.  We were not drinking and we do not do drugs.  We often spend a lot of time on our deck with our garden and chickens. We have never seen anything like this before.  Not long after (about 10-15 minutes), I did see what appeared to be a satellite in the sky, similar to the above mentioned objects, but only 1, moving in the same direction, but directly above my head, it never grew bright or glowed, it remained exactly the same until it was out of site, and it also appeared to be moving faster than the other two objects so because it seemed different and much like other satellites we have seen, I assumed this third object was indeed a satellite but I thought I should mention it.

I noticed my neighbors gathering together watching something in the sky, around 9:30 pm. I went outside and looked up to see a very large circular “spaceship” hovering in one place.  Someone had a car radio on listening to a station reporting the strange sight we were looking at. As I watched in awe, I noticed there were red, white & either blue or green lights blinking and rotating all around this craft (I can’t be certain on the blue or green colors after all these years).  It seemed as if “they” were trying to communicate with us.  Then I noticed three other circular objects off in the distance, they were “darting” back & forth at a high rate of speed, as in the blink of an eye.  Everyone around me remarked about what we were watching, no one had seen anything like this before. This show went on for almost an hour before the three smaller spacecraft disappeared. The larger spacecraft left shortly after that. All of them left at a high rate of speed, much faster than anything we had ever seen. Since there were about a dozen or more people watching this show, and many more listening to the radio, seeing the same thing we did, it had to be newsworthy!  I have never seen a report on this UFO sighting.  Hopefully someone else will admit to seeing this awesome sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My best recollection is that it was late June to early July.  I was sitting on my back patio getting some sun on my legs.  It was early afternoon—about 2:00.  Perfectly blue sky.  No clouds.  There was a nice breeze.  The position I was sitting in would put me facing WNW. Something caught my eye, and when I looked up, I saw a VERY shiny object in the sky.  I would estmate that it was two or three miles from me.  I don’t know what the altitude would be, but I would estimate that it was at about the height I have seen skydiving airplanes. At first, I thought it was two or three mylar balloons because that’s the only thing I thought of at the moment that would be that shiny.  However, a bunch of balloons change shape, flash, move along at a good speed in winds that high, and increase in altitude.  This object did none of those things.  The shape stayed exactly the same.  It did not flash, but it was the shiniest thing I have ever seen—much more shiny than mylar balloons.  It virtually hovered in the same spot and never changed in altitude. Ever so slowly, it moved from left to right.  I wanted to go in the house and get binoculars, but was afraid it would be gone when I got back.  After about 15 minutes, I finally took a chance and ran in to get binoculars.  It was still there.  When I looked through the binoculars (they’re not great ones—7 X 35), the best I can describe the shape is the tip of a harpoon or arrow.  It wasn’t triangle shaped.  It was pointed in the front (my right side) and had pointed tips in the back (my left).  It wasn’t flat like an arrow.  It had some roundness to it. I continued to watch it for another 5 minutes or so until it eventually went behind the tall trees in my neighbor’s yard.  I would estimate the degrees it traveled across the sky in that 20+ minutes at between 35 and 40 degrees never changing in size, shape, altitude, distance or color.  Just very, very shiny—especially the side that was facing me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2017-05-11T00:00:00,45.3422,-122.6639

The suit never seemed to wrinkle, maintaining a perfect appearance. After looking at the alien, saying hi and it's safe.  It slipped away into the woods.  It looked like I scared the crap out of it.  I ran into the house to get a camera, but left the batteries in the house,and came outside to try to get pics.

September ?? 2012, I was riding my bike at about sunset with two friends in our 55 and up neighborhood.  I stopped at my driveway thinking that was the end of our trip when they both rode past me. Facing south I noticed something in the sky.  There were 10 bright golden orange orbs as big as the sun that was by now below the horizon; perfectly spaced (East to West) in a horizontal manner.  I did not see a ship, but they were so evenly spaced, they looked like they had to be attached to something.  Though the lights were very bright it did not hurt my eyes which I remember thinking was very strange.  When my friends got to the end of the street, they realized I wasn’t following and stopped and looked back at me.  I pointed skyward and tried to tell them to look up so that they could see what I was looking at.  No matter what I did I couldn’t make them understand what I was trying to say.  This was very frustrating for me.   Suddenly the lights all shifted in the blink of an eye from an East-West position, to a North-South position, and disappeared.  They were still perfectly evenly spaced so much so that you would know that they must be attached to something.  And whatever that something may be, it would have to be huge; bigger than anything that we have created, even bigger than 5 aircraft carriers.  Maybe even as big as a small town.  I was so shaken by this incident and my friends actually laughed at me because I couldn’t make them understand that I wasn’t joking.   For the next couple of days, I scoured the internet hoping to find that someone else in my area may have reported a similar incident.  There was a report in a town about 10 miles from here of glowing objects in the sky which made me feel a little better; even though they were the wrong color (for they had seen red lights).  I decided to report the sighting to Mufon, but was unable to finish the form as they were asking for information I could not give, such as distance or the approximate size of the craft which I could not determine. The closest thing that I have found on the internet as of yet, to this sighting would be the Phoenix Lights.   Within a couple of days of attempting to report this incident on Mufon, I was startled by the deafening sound of a large black unmarked helicopter with a large gun attached.  It contained two men wearing black.  At first I thought it was a police helicopter looking for someone going through the neighborhood, but there was no insignia on the helicopter or the clothing the occupants.  I had never seen a helicopter like this before.  I could see the faces of the men as it hovered about 30 feet off of the ground, but never landed.  It stayed in that position for about 15 minutes, and then suddenly left.  I didn’t connect the two incidents initially, but now I wonder.

But what shut me up about disclosing such information is not so much the activity of black helicopters, but a woman.  I saw her in 2015.  She had a cowgirl atire, yet she was in black.  She was completely menacing me and yelling ""smoko, smoko, smoko"".  It was wierd because for one split nano second, she was on one side of the road, then she was in my face.   A number of vehicles were approaching, so I told her to get up on the isle where I was standing; she ignored me and continued her tirade.

This put it over Sarasota Bay or the Gulf of Mexico, depending on the distance it was from me.  Much too large to be a star, my first impression was it was a low flying aircraft like when you see the landing lights of a commercial jet on approach coming towards you, it will give the appearance of it hovering.  The light in color was a bright silvery white not a yellowish white.  I figured it was a large military jet out of MacDill AFB, since commercial traffic to Sarasota/ Bradenton Airport do not come from this direction. I continued to watch it as best I could while I was driving as it really had my attention.  The sky was dark over the western horizon but not black, more of a violet hue as the sun had not been down too long.  I bring this up because as I continued to watch it I could actually make out a black shape behind the light,  I have to say I wasn’t sure what I was looking at. I rolled my window down and turned off my radio to see if I could hear an aircraft or helicopter, since I felt the object was close enough that I would be able to hear it.  There was no noise.  Another thing that entered my mind was it might be a blimp or balloon, maybe some kind of promotional thing positioned over the water. All these thoughts ran through my head very quickly, maybe 15-30 seconds. As I continued to drive I would lose sight of it for a few seconds from time to time because of its low angle in the sky where buildings and trees started to obstruct my view. I thought about pulling over but there was really no place that would give me a better view. Anyone on the bay or waterfront would have had a perfect, unobstructed view.  After losing sight of the object/ light for a short time, it appeared still to my left ahead of me but much closer and now at a higher angle so much so I had to peer out my driver’s window to get a good view. I was still driving North and it was clear the object/ light was indeed moving and traveling due East. It crossed over the highway slightly in front of me, almost directly over me, where I lost sight of it temporally before I could again see it from my passenger window to my right.  It continued to travel East at the same low attitude over what is a residential area. I want to point out from the time it passed over me and flew off to the East, I was only seeing the light and not the black object attached to it because that part of the sky was too dark.  Suddenly another identical light appeared to the right of it very close and level. They were close enough for me to consider both lights were attached to the same object but it had to be huge. I don’t think a KC-135 a! t 500 feet would appear that large. At the low altitude it appeared to be traveling, it was just going too slow for any jet to stay airborne. Again, I heard no sound and saw no red and green navigation lights during the whole sighting.  The two white lights became very low on the horizon as they seemed to continue to travel off to the East and I eventually lost sight of them as I continued to drive North. I’m at a loss of what I could have seen. There is another sighting with a similar description that was submitted to this website that took place on the same night and time but in a town 80 miles northeast of Sarasota, Florida. My time of 8:30 is only an approximation and could have been a little before or after.

I left my home to retrieve some chewing tobacco from my truck parked in the street in front of my house.  I looked west towards Fort Carson and noticed a very bright light in the sky that I have never seen before.  At first I though it was a helicopter due to its location over an Army installation.  I ruled that notion out due to the lack of blinking lights and the lack of noise.  The craft was perfectly still (didn't weave or bob like a hovering helicopter).   My second thought was that it might be a commercial airplane due to an airport being nearby my location.  But again the lack of lights, noise, and movement ruled that out for me.  In a stroke of luck an airplane happened to be flying at lower altitude in the same direction and provided an outstanding visual reference.  I went back into my house to retrieve my roommate to ensure I wasn't seeing things.  He confirmed that he too saw something strange.  The object to appeared to be in the shape of a cross.  The cro! ss appeared to have been in the shape of two intersecting ovals instead of two linear components.  The horizontal part appeared to have been red in color.  The vertical part was two colors.  The middle was yellow and each end was green in color.  It didn't move for a very long time and our bare feet were getting cold from the concrete path.  We went back in the house for approximately an hour.  When I went back outside for another look, it was gone, like it was never there.

November 2016 - March 9th, 2017.  I had moved in with my mother last year, around November, and each night I'd stargaze, it was a family thing. Many nights passed and I always noticed a strange star in the sky that was a triangle shape with what looked like a faded upside triangle, but almost see through at the bottom. Sometimes it would glow a bright yellow-ish white, other times it would be dimmed or would quickly dim and look like an aircraft blinking green and red at the ends. At first, I ignored it. The only one that saw it was my boyfriend (at the time.)  It would stay perfectly in place for up to 20 minutes or even an hour before it would begin to move, very slowly. You wouldn't be able to tell unless you had a tree or electric line to measure and keep up with it's movements. Then, it'd either drop down, close to the ground above from where it was or it'd go black and disappear, just to reappear in a different location. We moved, but there it was. I was relieved when my parents told me that they saw it right above them. They said they tried to record it but their phones would mess up or it'd start blinking like a normal airplane, then disappear. They described it as blinking green on one end and the other red. Every night, we go outside to enjoy the night and every night we see it move. Lately, we've seen more and even yesterday (March 9th, 2017), my younger sister and I were picking up my mother from work and we saw it above us a few up in the air before, once again, disappearing. The most frustrating part is how all our phones (a house of five, with multiple phones and tablets), act up when it's around. We've also managed to see it change shapes. Sometimes we can see a darker object inside the bright light (three witnesses). ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I was driving south on 405 with my friend, where I noticed lights in the sky, flashing at the right side of my front windshield at about 7:15 pm.  First, I thought it was reflection of the headlights of the cars that was following me.  But suddenly this object moved to the left side of my car and started flying at the same speed with me.  Now I and my friend saw it clearly. There were four lights of blue colour, egg form (colour could have changed because of the clouds) that moved quickly towards center where they met and then separated evenly in opposite directions.  My friend said it was projector but I said it couldn't have crossed freeway.   After I dropped off my friend I got to my home.  I spent there about 20 minutes and  drove to meet with friends in Bellevue.  Google layed route through interstate 5 where I've met these lights again.  I don't believe in coincidence and I also do not want to think it was helicopter chasing me with some kind of unusual projectors.  The lights did not even touch the ground and did not have beams.  I understood that this object was possibly changing it's altitude because the lights changed it's size.   Second time I saw it, it was about 8:00 pm.  It all happened on 03/10/2017.  Finally after I got home at about 11 pm and parked the car.  I've seen the reflection of the lights on the house I live in. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite serious and sober-minded.  He added that he now believes that the reflection of lights on the house were due to headlights of vehicles on a nearby roadway, and that they did not have anything to do with his sighting, earlier in the evening.

While driving east on S22 in San Diego county, passing by the Borrego Valley Airport, myself and another party in our vehicle witness a series of perhaps 6-8 lights appear in the sky ahead of us.  As there was no proper perspective, the lights could have been far away or maybe as close as five miles.  This is an unknown.   The lights were as bright as headlights and white in color.  (The other witness thought they were ""yellowish"".)  They appeared to be moving slowly from south to north together as a unit so I assumed they were one object.  The lights faded, blinked out, or shut off in a few seconds.  I have witnessed many flare drops but they last much longer than five seconds. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) No, Peter, I have seen many, many military flare drops.  At first, I thought this was possible but the sighting was too short of duration for flares.  Flares last many minutes.  The lights appeared before us on the higway and disappeared in 3-5 seconds.  Also, the location (in or about the north Salton Sea area) is not a usual military training ground.  However as you suggested, they could have been farther away, perhaps over the Chocolate Mts., which IS a restricted govt ""bombing range.""  Still, the short duration and the appearance that they were traveling south to north makes me dismiss that. The other witness says that I posted the wrong time.  She said it was more like 8:15 pm, not 9:15, as I reported.  That could be correct.  She also assumed that they were over Font's Point, a spot about 5-7 miles from our observation site, but I informed her of the perspective issue.  We just could no tell.  Five miles, or 25 miles? I also have some experience with viewing sky divers, as our airport (Borrego Valley) hosts the Canadian Army paratroopers twice per year.  They specialiize in night jumping, BUT they do it to practice in the dark.  THEY do not use flares.  They are all about surprising the ""enemy.""  As I said there were 6-8 lights in a straight row.  Unlikley that jumpers could execute this so perfectly I researched the local news, MUFON, and the web in general, and have yet to see another report coinciding with mine.  I also have a small ad hoc group of local buffs.  We call ourselves the Dessert UFO Group, DUG.  No members reported anything.  I assume that you did not get a second report of this?  As I have told you in the past, I observe the  sky nightly and have become accustomed to what aircraft, with their landing lights and position lights look like.  This was not that.  The desert sky was clear so I think I can dismiss any atmosperic interference with my vision. Another mystery along with so many others. ((END ADDENDUM))",2017-06-09T00:00:00,33.1799,-116.2731

It was about four times larger than the other stars and bright like a stadium light. I had all the windows and blinds open that night to allow the breeze to keep me cool.  I watched the “star” thinking that I had never seen one so brilliant before, and suddenly four lights came out of the “star.”  I watched, stunned, as these four lights began blinking or pulsing and flew around the early morning sky.  The large light, which I had thought a star, stayed higher in the sky, but the four pulsating lights flew lower, closer to the ground.  The where perhaps 100 feet or so above the earth.  They were whitish in color, not as bright as the original but they were blinking or pulsating, not sure how to describe it, and flying not randomly but back and forth like they were searching. I was paralyzed with fear, not wanting them to know that I was there.  Suddenly, in a fraction of a second, everything around me flashed very bright then dark again.  I quietly get up and close all the windows and blinds, hoping to go unnoticed to the four flying “orbs.”  They were not really round, rectangle box shaped with rounded corners.  I laid back down, so I could peak under the curtains and that is when I noticed the blinking round light inside of my RV. I was really doubting my own eyes at this point. It was above me in the corner of the RV.  I was hoping that there was a hole in the roof.  I looked around me and everything inside was very dark except the glowing round light in the corner of the ceiling in the RV. This whole thing had been going on for about twenty minutes.  I was more frightened than I could ever remember.  I felt helpless against these lights.  That is when the RV moved, I was hoping a bear had pushed against it.  Then I heard the clawing and scratching coming from the left rear (across from the round light).  I was again hoping that it was a bear, armadillo or very large mice trying to get in. I finally just snapped out of my motionless state and grabbed one of the headlamps that I had close by and turned it on.  The round pulsing light was gone, the noise stopped and everything appeared normal.  I at 2:00 AM telling them what I was seeing.  My mind fought to find rational reasons for what was going on.  I turned the light back out around 2:30 and laid back down. I peeked under the curtain and saw the large “star” still in the sky.  The round light that was inside my RV did not return neither did the scratching noises. I had my two cats with me, one of them hid and the other stayed with me and was very nervous.

Leading up to my current “issue” with these objects, my father had always talked about this light in the sky following him wherever he went.  He didn’t know why, or what it's intentions were.  He called it his “guiding light”.  He thought it was a surveillance drone and if it is, why him?  Well 3 years of this guiding light had him pretty nervous.  I had only heard the stories, until one night we were heading to my mother's house to visit (parents are separated), and before we got out of the driveway, he asked me, “What do you think that is?” and pointed at a very bright light in the sky.  My first thought was:  It’s a planet.  It was bright like Jupiter or Venus.  Until I noticed how low it was and that it seemed to be swaying or hovering.  Then I said it's a drone.  Dad then tells me to keep my eye on it and see what it does. Our trip was going to be from Lawrence, KS, to Kansas City, MO.  He puts the truck in gear and we go.  As did this bright light.  It would stay in the passenger window down I-70 then positioning itself directly behind us and it was like it locked on to our vehicle.  It would sometimes ascend higher and then come back down.  It was tracking us! I was mesmerized. I had never seen a UFO and here is a full on bright, unidentifiable flying object following us down the highway.  The object followed us all the way to 152 hwy in Kansas City, MO. We get into the city and this thing decides to completely blow my mind by joining up with 2 more lights to form a triangle formation.  I am saying all kinds of, “what ((deleted)) is that,” at this point.  And as we turn down the street to my moms house they all 3 got as faint as dim stars, one after the other, and disappeared.  This was the beginning of my fascination that has now become my reality. Fast forward almost one year later, I researched the hell out of these things.  I know now it's not a FBI drone.  Not a police surveillance craft.  This goes way beyond that.  I start living with my dad  about 5 months ago.  This thing would literally hover outside of his house every night along with 4 or 5 other objects mimicking stars and constellations.  I decided to start filming them because if it is government then they are violating our rights on all possible levels.   Also, because they fascinate me.  I have videos of triangle craft, hovering commercial jets, cigar UFOs in the day time.  Aircraft that I can't explain  doing things we have no context for.  Well they now follow me everywhere I go.  Any clear night I have 1-3 star UFOs hovering over the house. Possibly more.  As well as very strange airplane and triangle craft that circle the house really low.  Some will eject smaller drones I shit you not. I've been watching and studying these like it is my job.  The strange thin! g is I can't get any media outlets or MUFON to investigate this. I know I'm not the only one.  We need to call attention to it and get answers.  I didn’t ask to be tracked and surveilled by these things.  I'm not a criminal.  I'm not doing anything wrong.

Within 5-10 minutes after, at the most, either a commercial or military plane flew over Redwater, flying from the southeast of the sky heading northwest.

Stopped to assist several entities.

I'm not sure how this fits in but the experience has stayed with me; and I had to post something. I am a long haul driver and was travelling east on Interstate 8, just east of Fortuna, Arizona. Having checked the clock, it was 3:45 AM when I alerted my partner to the presence of three or four individuals standing in the middle of the traffic lane.  After sounding the truck horn, I began to slow our rig.  Given the fact that the area is well known for human smuggling and is dangerous to travel, I wondered if, perhaps, we should keep going. But, when it became apparent that at least three of the individuals were wearing some kind of uniform, I decided to stop along the right shoulder.  Nevertheless, my second driver emerged from the sleeper with the shotgun that we carry.  Both of us agreed that neither of us was going to step from the cab, and we kept the engine idling. Three individuals walked slowly toward me, toward the driver's side of the cab.  At about fifteen feet, I could tell that all three of them were suited, if you will, in some sort of gear. I wondered if the Marines, from the nearby Marine Corps air station, had crashed and were going to ask us for help. As I lowered the driver's window, the shortest of the three, bundled in heavy white gear, with what looked like white armor around the chest, and a partial faceplate that emerged from below the chin, said to me, in perfect English, ""Not to worry, we have a minor situation.""   He (it) motioned with his left arm toward the distance, off the highway.  It was strange because neither my partner nor I saw anything as we approached the group but, sure enough, something was putting out intense red flames, maybe fifty feet off the right shoulder from where we were parked. Before I could say anything, a triangle-shaped wedge of the landscape to our right, with the flames at the base of the triangle, rose up and sliced through the truck cab.  For lack of a better description, I felt like I was looking at some kind of image--as it came through the cab. I mean, the individual who spoke to me appeared first on the left side near me, and then appeared on the right side, the raised side, then on both sides, which appeared raised. My throat was so dry, my stomach in knots; honestly, I felt like I was going to heave. I figured we had it.  Three individuals, two in white, wearing helmets, and one who appeared burned or blackened and without a helmet, appeared in the image to our right, as they made their way around chunks of rock, walking towards our cab.  There was a lot of communication, like radio, between them, or between somebody. The one who had spoken to me, after I had lowered the window, now sounded metallic. So I turned once again towards the voice, to my left again, toward the open window and he (or it) wasn't there.  I turned toward my partner, in the right front seat, who was still cradling the shotgun, nothing. I mean, it was black. It was perfectly silent.  There were no flames off to the right in the distance. Our clock showed 5:15 AM, only the entire encounter felt like it had lasted fifteen minutes or so.  I don't know what to claim.  I stopped to assist several entities that appeared to be projected from somewhere; and I still feel nauseous.

It disappeared for a few seconds and then reappeared about few seconds later further to the right of where I first saw it and it was moving very slowly and going in the opposite direction from which I first observed it.

It appeared to turn West, and as doing so, the “orbs” turned into a long thin bright white light.  Like a long fluorescent light bulb, but so much brighter.  It then headed West and no lights were visible.  I opened my eyes wide to let as much light in as possible (the moon was not above the horizon at the time).  That is when I noticed the shape, very much like a box kite, but with triangles on top and bottom; essentially an elongated diamond.  We stood there for about a minute after and headed back down the wooded trail talking about what we had seen.  After about 40 yards, I said let’s go back.  I was shining my flashlight on the tree line and my daughter said that if ! we see anything she will record it with her IPhone.  Once again, three orbs in the shape of a triangle appeared in the same spot slowly rising above the tree line. This time my daughter took out her phone to record and her phone died.

It would twirl and become quite large, but get smaller as it rotated - only to be large again within seconds.

Having only been aware of the extraterrestrial presence for the past two weeks or so, I have been watching the night sky every chance I get.  On 4/09/2017 at approximately 23:00, I was sitting at the park and saw a bright white light hovering just above the trees on the eastern horizon.  The light was roughly the size of a street light, but the apparent distance indicates that the light originated from a larger source.  It was blinking but I'm not sure if was in a pattern.  Upon seeing this light, I was filled with a great sense of fear and felt an intense need to go home. After making it back home, I lied down outside to watch the sky some more. At approximately 01:00 on 04/10/2017 (later that same night) the craft reappeared, hovering above the trees on the southern horizon this time.  It was blinking at me the same way, as if testing to see if I was aware of their presence.  I froze, gazed fixed on the bright, blinking light, and suddenly it was gone.  I did not see it leave. Then on 04/14/2017 at approximately 22:00 the blinking light was back.  As soon as I noticed it, it flew away in a direction that was hard to see.  Shortly after, a craft with two solid white lights on the sides, a blinking white light at the front, and a blinking red light at the back made several passes over my house.  I concentrated on these crafts, as they could have been normal airplanes, but the positioning of the lights was unlike any plane that I have seen before.  The next pass (always from south to north) I held my arm up and thought the words ""Is that you?""  A few minutes later three crafts passed overhead simultaneously. Two from a greater distance, with the two lights on the side and the blinking lights in the front and back, and another much closer.  The one that passed closer to me was diamond shaped, but didn't appear flat, almost like a prism with a glowing orange light in the middle and around the sides. At this point I decided to walk to the park to get a better view of the night sky.  In the distance I could see something hovering that would blink a white light on the left side and a red light on the right side.  I felt like it wanted me to follow it.  I went in the direction that I thought it wanted me to go, and waited for further instruction. I don't think that I followed their directions correctly at first, so I started walking in another direction when one of the larger crafts with the two white lights on the sides made a low pass above me.  I was able to see it more clearly. From below, it was diamond shaped with four smaller diamond shaped quadrants.  The sides where they has the two solid white lights could light up with green or red all across, so I think they were trying to imitate regular airplanes for camouflage purposes while remaining distinct so I could follow them. There would always be one hovering in the distance while the other would make passes above me.  After awhile, I noticed that both of the crafts would alter which direction was blinking white or red, as if to tell me to go in the direction of the white light. They led me a few blocks over, to a side street with a culdesac.  At this point it was around 23:30 and most houses were quiet, except for one.  The house at the end of the culdesac had the garage door open, light on, with a man sitting, seemingly waiting.  I hesitated, for I did not want to appear insane, walking up to a strangers house in the middle of the night with no logical explanation.  The blinking continued in the direction of the mans house, along with another pass from above.  I finally mustered the courage to approach the house, but the man was gone. I started walking home, still watching the sky. Getting closer to home, the crafts appeared to be trying to lead me once again. They brought me through the park, to a dark corner where there were few houses around.  I heard what sounded like two birds chirping at me from the trees, and walked around the area for a moment, looking for signs. The chirping sounded almost like the words, 'Over here,' and when I started to walk away, it changed to a panicked, 'Come back.'  I wasn't sure if my mind was playing tricks on me, but I went back.  Looked around, saw nothing, started walking away again.  This time the chirps were more like high pitched beeps, like an electronic signal.  I turned a flashlight to the tree and saw nothing, but the sound went back to being chirps.  The chirps were telling me 'right here, below you' so I looked around the base of the tree and found a small light that is manufactured by a company here in Phoenix. I've read that an electrical company has had communications with ET life but I have not followed up on the lead as of yet. I saw the diamond crafts again last night (04/15/2017) at approximately 21:30, making several passes over my home, but I was unable to follow them this time.  I feel like they can hear my thoughts when they are in close range, like they know I'd like to meet them.  I do not feel as if these being have malicious intent, but they may be part of the collective.  I can feel a sort of pressure in the middle of my forehead when they are around, but I can't be certain if that is a placebo effect or not as I have read about the pineal gland and how many consider it to be the 'third eye'  I plan on investigating further.",2017-04-20T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I live in a rural area of Texas, and have very little light pollution, so I can normally see a night sky filled with stars.  The dogs had been barking quite a bit that night, so I went outside to check to see if something was amiss. I was outside for a few minutes to make certain that everything was alright with the animals and to quieten the dogs, then turned to go back inside the house.  Before I went completely into the garage, for some reason I turned and looked back at the sky.  The sky was very clear that night and I do not recall seeing any clouds – only stars. I was facing the northeast, at the time, and saw a very bright, single light moving slowly across the sky, parallel to the horizon (i.e. sideways, tilted slightly upwards).  This was approximately the speed of a single engine prop plan – based on what I could tell.  This was a single light and it did not have a tail, so it absolutely was not a meteor, meteorite, or falling star.  We see a lot of those in the sky, but this light was 2-4 times larger than most of the ones that I normally see. The light was moving east to north, again, very slowly and I observed it for several seconds - possibly even a minute.  Suddenly, the light disappeared completely.  It didn’t fade, as a meteor or meteorite does, it was like someone turned-off a switch and everything went dark. There was nothing in the sky to block my view and this light was well above the trees.  Also, there was absolutely no sound at all, so it obviously was not a plane, drone, or helicopter. I continued to watch after the light disappeared, but it never returned and there was never any sound.  Everything was still extremely quiet, except for some cows about 1 mile away and my previously rowdy dogs were now completely silent.",2017-04-28T00:00:00,30.1327,-96.2438

Its wingspan fully covered the two-car driveway I was walking on, and then some.  I was walking directly north towards my house after checking on my kids who were attending a birthday party at another home in my complex. I noticed something just above my line of vision.  At first I thought it was a cloud forming, as it had the consistency of a fine, mist type cloud.  As it continued to move forward, I realized that the object had a solid outline with a consistent shape.  At that point, I thought perhaps it was a hang glider, but considering that this was in Texas, where there are no large hills, that made no sense at all.  Then, I thought it might have been a flock of birds, but the object had a solid form and a consistency of shape as it flew by.  It continued to fly or glide at a consistent rate and a direct line path, until I could no longer see it. The object was completely silent.  There were no lights.  The object almost blended into the starry background of the sky.  It had a somewhat mottled color of white and possibly dark, navy blue, grey or black.

It was a cold clear winter night in March 1966 when my friend and I decided to go ice skating in a creek that was approximately a quarter mile from his his home.  We were both 9 years old at the time.  He lived on the edge of town.  As we were about half way to the creek, we witnessed a white light weaving slowly toward us across the sky heading west.  It was about 100 yards above us and made no sound.  We panicked and ran back toward his home and as we did the object shot straight up in the sky at a high rate of speed stopping abruptly to look like another star in the sky.  Our sighting coincided with the mass UFO sightings in Michigan in March of 1966.  After this we did witness the object a few times again.  The most remarkable one was seeing it again from his home at about the same location. His house faced south with a large pane window in front and he had a small telescope that we set up to see if we could see it closer.  We did catch the object briefly and it h! ad red, green and other colored lights that I cannot remember. It reminded us of a Christmas tree when lit up and appeared oval shaped.  It seemed to know we were watching it and once again shot straight up in the sky at a rapid speed.  I did see it a few more times as I was riding with my parents in our car.  It seemed to tail us for a short distance and then depart again.  It was almost like it wanted to make me aware that it was there.  My friend and I never spoke about this with our parents as we were afraid they would never believe us.  To this day, my friend will still not speak of the sightings and changes the subject when I bring it up.  On a side note, the farmer Frank Manor who had the sightings and landing on his property around the same time worked for my Father on weekends.  I remember Frank as a very credible and believable guy as he detailed his sightings. He was hard working and a little rough around the edges but I believe he saw what he reported.  I felt bad at the! time because he took so much ribbing from my Father's employe! es and o thers in the community at the time.  It was laughable that Allen Hynek labeled the object as swamp gas.

Huachuca in SE Arizona. My brother came out for the grad ceremony and drove home with me to Los Angeles. My car at the time was a 1967 Ford Mustang. We began the drive in the late afternoon, choosing to take Interstate 8 and drive up through San Diego.  It was dark by the time we got through Tucson and onto the 8. Looking at a map, we were around the Sentinel Rest Area, driving westbound.  We noticed to our left, farther off into the mountains, a bright glow.  It was behind one of the mountain’s ridges and we thought it was a factory behind a ridge, a softer glow but large.  As we kept driving, we noticed we were never able to look into the ridges or fingers of the mountains to see the glow.  It was always over the next mountain ridge. By the Mohawk I-8 Rest Area, we were pretty confused.  We couldn’t figure out why we couldn’t see the source of the light.  Estimated time since first seeing the light, 20-30 minutes.  We pulled the car over and my brother jumped up onto the side of the door, looking over the roof of the car at the southern mountains.  We could still see the glow, but no noise, no details, just a glow that was always over another ridge.  The car is still running, I remember him saying to turn it off. Just as my brother said to turn the car off, we heard a sound from behind him, in the brush. It is hard to describe, over the years we’ve joked that it sounded like Megatron.  It was a growl, but had a metallic recording to it.  As soon as we heard the growl, my brother dropped back into the seat and started screaming GO GO GO!  I have never felt fear like that, it made our stomachs sick, a static-like tingling in the hair and neck. We are now back on the highway, looking all around, windows rolled up, maybe ready to laugh it off.  But then the cassette player starting warping the tape.  Just as we ejected the tape the radio turned off.  Then the dashboard shut off, headlights shut off, everything shut off. Except the motor.  We are now westbound on Interstate 8, speed 60-80mph and no lights. We decided to keep going, could see the road well enough and knew if we turned off the car, it probably wouldn’t start back up.  We weren’t sure how long after we lost power that we noticed the mountain lights we were chasing were now gone. We got to Wellton, AZ a little time later.  We pulled into a motel parking lot, turned off the car. We were right, it didn’t turn back on.  We stayed the night at the motel, pushed the car over to the auto shop the next morning.  I really couldn’t see anything in the engine bay but there was a strong burnt smell throughout the car.  The mechanic took 2 minutes and brought us out to the car.  All over the car, wires were melted together.  He spent most of that day replacing parts and wires. He said that should get us to LA and we can take the car to an electrical shop. We barely made it into Yuma before we had to stop and do more repairs. The mechanics in Yuma echoed the same question: What did we run into? Nothing they knew of would affect the entire car. They mentioned it was an older car, as long as the distributor was turning it would continue to run. We drove home the next day without any further issues.

I had just enough time to be able to point and say, ""What is that?"" and my other two coworkers were able to catch a glimpse of it before it disappeared behind a building.  I ran to the other side of the building, which only took me about 10 seconds to get there, to see if I could see it, and it had disappeared.  It was heading northeast just west of Langley Air Force Base. It was a clear night.  We didn’t hear any sounds before or after spotting the aircraft.  It was a solid black triangle (all sides were the same size, a perfect acute angle) the size of a football field with a light in each corner of the craft.  The lights were pulsating very fast almost like an energy surge.  The best way to describe the lights would be comparable to halo lights, but soft white in color.  The lights seemed to be what powered the craft. None of us could identify it to anything we've seen before like a drone, or military plane.

Later two military jets came in from the south and the strange lights just bounced all around the two jets.  Eventually, they disengaged and headed back south towards Phoenix.

I looked around and saw few faint blue lights and wondered if they were connected as one large craft, because they were separated by quite a distance.  The distance of separation would have been at arm's length, if you held your hand out, arm stretched, in front of your face.   At first I thought they were in trying other patterns, because there was three of them I saw period, but then I realized they were separate.  I looked around and there were a whole bunch all around the entire sky all headed due north over Lone Peak mountain.  Each one was a faint small blue looking light moving at high speed coming much faster than an airplane moves. They could have been military drones but they were moving so fast, and it was clear their agenda was to travel due north at a very high speed. There was a whole swarm of them that travel from as far as the eye could see from the south end of American Fork City, over Highland City, and then over Alpine City and over the Lone Peak mountain. I walked outside as the last of them we're traveling from the south end of American Fork Andover Lone Peak mountain.  I probably conservatively counted 20 to 25 of them.  But I think there was a lot more!   I've never seen so many objects in the sky at once traveling so quickly and One Direction.  They were a very faint dim blue color, they weren't too difficult to see but the color of the sky, clouds and sunset made it more difficult to see them and they seem to blend in more. There were low-lying clouds and they were below the clouds and traveling up and through the clouds, and disappeared out of sight as they flew over Lone Peak Mountain headed north. Their blue light was constant and was not blinking. The color of blue was a very faint navy blue. They appeared like small craft, and seem to all be moving in a swarm, separated by the aforementioned distance when your hand was outstretched towards the sky. The strange thing was is that it was very windy outside, they did not seem to be affected by the weather or wind at all, especially given how small they appeared to be?  I had my cell phone camera with me, but realized that it would be pointless to try to take a photo because they were so faint against the sky and would likely not show up.  So I didn't bother.",2017-04-13T00:00:00,,

There is a parking lot with a large rock painted to look like a lady bug.  I saw what looked like a low flying plane, with a flight path headed west over the parking lot from the mountains.  I pulled into the parking lot to look up and get a closer look of this “plane”. As I pulled to a stop, the object slowed to a stop in front of me and vertically descended to about 100 ft. Its shape was rectangular with four red blinking lights at the corners of its shape.  I remember saying out loud, “Oh my God, this isn’t a plane!”   After that, a white light in the middle of the object started to light up, and I started to get freaked out. I put my transmission into gear and spun around and left the parking lot quickly. It changed direction and starting following me north.   I started screaming because I was scared.  Whatever it was, was going to try and take me.  It was keeping pace with me and flying directly above me so I increased my speed.  It followed me from the parking lot by the highway exit to my street which is about almost one mile to my street.  I turned north from the side road from the parking lot to head towards my street and it was still following me.  I turned east down another street and then north again to head down my street.  As I approached my house I pressed the garage door opener, I slowed to a stop and started to back into my driveway.  As I was backing into my garage, I lost visual of the object.

They have a video. Standing facing south in front of their home, approximately 200 ft from highway at 12:13--shortly after midnight, a strange steady orange light was observed south south west approximately a mile from home.  It was a clear night, no clouds were observed and very quiet.  No traffic passing on road and no wildlife sound.   The witness observed the light for about 5 minutes.  The light appeared to hover over buildings located in that area.  It appeared to be un-moving.  In the video, the light appeared to be a large object.  How large was difficult to ascertain.  The light can be seen above the tree line and was a steady non-blinking light.   At one point, the witness pointed a high powered blinking flashlight in the direction of the object due being unsure what the light was.  The witness was able to see some reflection of a dark shape around the light.   Right after shining the flashlight at the object, all electricity went out in the neighborhood.  This scared the witness who ran inside the home to check on the people inside.  All were ok.  The electricity came back on, so the witness went back outside and noted that the strange light was gone and an alarm was sounding from the building the light had been hovering over.   At this point, the sounds of wildlife returned...frogs, circadas, and coyotes.  Approximately an hour later, the witness noted the same orange light North of him and much further away.  The light appeared to be moving slowly away from the witness's location and then disappeared.   The witness spoke to the people who worked in the building the next morning to see if maybe there was a break-in the night before.  They agreed that the alarm had gone off, but there was no sign of a break-in.   Also spoke to a neighbor who also noted the electricity had gone off for a few seconds the night before.",2017-05-06T00:00:00,29.597885185185184,-90.73580952380952

It first started with two friends calling for us to come outside to see if what they were seeing was actually happening.   There were four orbs first 3 green, one was blue and the other red flying with a movement that did not resemble a shooting star, jet, airplane or satellite in a square like formation.  They created a diamond shape formation as pictured below with the two of the greens being capture in the photo and the blue directly in the middle of the two simultaneously flashing.   A few minutes later, a set of eight lights cane from the east creating multiple formations that can't be described, but again the all had the same colors as the others green, blue, red and some white.   Then continued to the same location where the others traveled and stopped in the same area the diamond formation stated earlier was created, still simultaneously flashing in a distinct! pattern.  theb moments later two more sets of the exact same color maybe a total of 16 8 in each group came from the east again flying in the strangest pattern and formation ever witnessed.   I tried my best explains in the both videos what they were doing as far as movement, I know that this seems unreal but what we saw last night again was REAL there were no airplanes, shooting stars, jets, or helicopters in sight.   The formations that these lights created in the sky and the maneuvering of them is beyond hard to explain in writing.

My daughter saw 3 hovering lights, white with red and blue and thought it was an airplane but wondered why they were silent and hovering so low, plus too small to be full sized airplanes, but very bright lights.   The group of 3 were in a tighter formation at first.  There were more bright white lights hovering lower on the horizon by the water,  Commencement Bay Puget Sound.  We notice 9 lights and actually noticed 11 in one photo, almost as though they were meeting at the spot we saw the first 3, making a formation of some kind.  I got my phone to get pictures.   They stayed bright white and spread out, then disappeared, most moved upward into the clouds, a few sideways, probably hovering for close to ten minutes.    This was about 7:45 PM, Sunday, March 12th in Tacoma, WA..  We have no idea what these were.  I'm glad we got photos. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Thank you for your reply and information.  I looked at photos online of Chinese lanterns and don't believe that is what we saw as the objects seemed too mechanical and the movement seemed too deliberate but hovering rather than floaty, if that makes sense.  Plus they seemed larger than the photos of Chinese lanterns.  They were coming from the horizon.  I looked at the map for this area and noticed a Tacoma city park on the water called the Fuzhou Ting at Chinese Reconciliation Park.  I called to ask if they allow Chinese lanterns and if any were lit last night.  It seems Chinese lanterns are illegal in Seattle so I would assume most likely in Tacoma, too.  I am waiting to hear back from someone at the Parks Department to verify.  Being it is so chilly and rained earlier in the day, I doubt there were any weddings at the Fuzhou Ting Park. I am wondering if there is some kind of military goings on with the nearby JBLM.  I looked up pictures of drones but these seemed too large to be a drone, at least what photos you can find online.  I also tried to reach the Tacoma Tribune but no one has replied as well as the local Fox KCPQ affiliate.  I couldn't find anything online reporting lights in the sky.  It was all very strange, we could not stop watching it.   I can't believe my Galaxy 5.6 phone was able to capture what it did since the photos are no where near the brightness and clarity of what we actually saw.  We were thinking how could you not notice this but this road is quiet and with the trees and terrain, we were in the perfect spot to see what we did.  I was hoping the Fox KCPQ might show the pictures and others might come forward if they saw it but they must not be interested.   I will submit to the online report form as soon as I get an answer from the Tacoma Parks Department about the Chinese lanterns.  The person who handles that venue is out until the 22nd so hopefully the other person I left a message with will call me back tomorrow.  I will also see if there is some way to get information from the City of Tacoma about people calling in about those lights. I looked up some videos on youtube and these lights look like what others have seen, too.     Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter, I did not hear back from anyone I left messages with.  However, I found an information bulletin from the Tacoma Fire Department that says there are no permits allowed for any kind of incendiary releases or sky lanterns.  I would assume a Tacoma City Park nearby would not be allowed to release lanterns. These lights that we saw look like some I found on you tube such as the ones in Missouri in 2012 and in Arlington, Texas, June 2015, in the International Business Times.  It's very strange and I also find it odd the media I tried to contact have zero interest.  You would think they would at least show the pictures to say what it is or isn't and talk about the safety of Chinese lanterns, etc... or at least verify if JBLM ((Joint Base Ft. Lewis/McChord AFB)) was doing testing of some kind or whatever they want to say it is.  I don't think it's either lanterns or drones based on what I could compare it with on the internet.     I just submitted the form on the website. The photos are in the email I sent.    Thank you, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM #2))",2017-03-17T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

It’s now mid-March 2017, and since mid-February I’ve seen an extremely bright light (reminds me of a huge LED tactical light) early every evening in the eastern ((sic.  western)) sky over Southern California.  It’s large enough to make a person assume that it’s close to the observer’s neighborhood, but its size and brightness make it likely to be seen by many residents living in Southern California. The light always appears around 8 p.m., sitting low in a dark sky, without any other visible stars. The light is bright in one position for approximately 30 minutes, then the light goes out, and it pops up again nearby, again parked for another 30 minutes in a new position. I first noticed it in February and, like my husband, instantly thought of Saturn.  But the light was so “artificial” and too low that I couldn’t bring myself to believe it was Saturn.  My thought was that it’s more likely a satellite or a surveillance device (drone? balloon?) possibly launched by the police, or by USGS, or by CALTRANS.  I’ve found no evidence on the Internet, but if any of these surveyors want anonymity, there wouldn’t be an announcement or explanation posted to the Internet. I believe I’ve noticed lights-out once a week (does the object need a break to re-adjust?), and then re-activated the following night for the rest of the week. I’m not certain why the foregoing surveyors would survey at night, except to avoid small aircraft from local municipal airports that would not be flying at night in the object’s altitude thereby not interfering with the object’s mission.  Large airlines flying to Ontario or to Los Angeles can be seen and are distinguishable because they move higher in the sky than does the bright light that parks low in the sky and does not move at all while lit. Thoughts rush through my mind of foreign surveillance by China, Russia, North Korea.  Could that be true?  Don’t know.  “It’s a puzzlement!”",2017-03-17T00:00:00,34.03061421800948,-117.14975355450235

Parker/Aurora (perhaps Smokey Hill area) area over E-470 from person in Parker/Franktown – video and video screen captures available.   Every so often, objects would rotate and project beam of light.  Perhaps 10-15 miles away from viewer.  Objects spotted and perhaps 10 mins total observation.   Speculation the objects were there before viewer spotted them initially.  Objects initially appear to be somehow connected as they undulated together in the sky as if they were connected, but later one of the objects broke pattern with the other two and did its own maneuver and then returned to the other two, and then the three of them continued maneuvers together.    Due to the undulating pattern, it is not thought they were just one object such as a dark plane with three lights (since one did separate from the two and then later rejoin) since the viewer has witnessed planes heading to or from DEN as the viewer knows the flight path over e! ast of Parker Road and basically down E-470 to DEN.  Objects went higher in elevation, lower in elevation, east, west, north, and south – moving further away and then closer in several different patterns, some looping, some more block-style in nature.  Ball lightening ruled out since ball lightening doesn’t last this long.  Total movement from time noticed until they disappear into the passing storm that was hitting Aurora area at this time was maybe 10-30 miles.   This seems too far for a controlled drone or drones and drones don’t seem to be able to fly in unison like objects.  Drones also don’t seem to have such bright lights as object were maybe 10-15 miles away.  Objects did not appear to be metallic, but some kind of darker material, so doesn’t resemble photos seen of weather balloons, and weather balloons don’t seem to have lights or ones that were so bright as the objects did.   Objects were making various loops, appearing to stop in mid-air, rapidly going from left/right (West/East) but were generally following either an Easterly or North-Easterly direction.  During this same time, a large storm with hail, rain and lightning was passing from West to East north of the viewers position with the objects between the viewer and the storm.  If this was under human control, why were these maneuvers being carried out extremely close to a monster of a storm?  The viewer cannot think of any plane, drone, etc that can make such maneuvers.   iPhone 6 video was captured (2 min 45 sec) in zoomed in mode.  No rain at time.  Video shows birds flying around and trees for perspective.  Video is a bit shaky.  There was no water on the camera since it was not raining yet when the video was taken.

At the stoplights there, I saw what looked like a typical jet airplane heading over the Hwy. 10 bridge in a northeast direction.   Today was a perfectly clear day with no clouds in the vicinity.  The craft appeared for maybe 5 seconds and then vanished out of sight.   This is the third time that I have seen a cloaking aircraft in the past two years.  Because of past sightings, if I see a flash in the sky I pay attention and do not assume it is a 'regular' airplane.   Frankly, I think there would be more reports on these sightings, if people only would pay attention.  I believe most people are desensitized to air traffic and a prime example of this was about a year ago while at a stoplight on Co. Rd. C and 35 E around 3pm, a black hawk helicopter was so low to the ground that you could feel its breeze.  Everyone around me in thier cars just sat there as if it was a normal day in the neighborhood.  I am perfectly sane, I might add.

This object appears frequently over my property in the Bonhamton section of Edison, NJ.  It is a bright star-like light or even like an airplane, but it definitely is neither.  A friend was here earlier & she witnessed it.  It hung low in the sky, stationary & it has a subtle random pulsing of its light. It was there in the sky for about 2hrs.  The Big Dipper was in the sky almost directly above my house.  The UFO was in its usual location--looking at the backyard, in the sky to the back right side of the yard.   As we sat outdoors chatting, my friend kept checking on its presence.  After a couple hrs she commented that maybe it was a planet.  I have a SkyView app on my phone & it doesn't identify it as a planet or star.  Then shortly before she left, she looked and noticed it was gone.  Yet the Big Dipper was still visable in the general area which dispelled the idea of it being a planet.  She left soon after. I have a screen house on the patio with a hammock on a stand, chair, sidetable, etc., like an outdoor room.  I sleep out here on these mild evenings.   At about 4 am I witnessed a bright light low in the sky coming straight in.  I can't explain it but the way it was moving you could tell it wasn't a plane.  Initially, it was lower than I'd ever observed in the past & more centered in the sky looking over the back of the backyard (line off in the distance but not far distance) and it just hung there.   Since I started typing this it has moved slightly higher in the horizon to almost the position it had been when my friend was here.  I have a fair amount of video footage taken with my iPhone each night it comes.

Upon turning around to walk back to the house, I noticed the moon just up over the trees across the road, so took a photo of that as well.  This has become a routine for me to do after I let the dogs out and give their meds, each night at 9.  It is also part of my exercise strategy to lose weight by doing something fun.   As I continued to walk home, I noticed immediately- a very bright light straight south in the sky, under 45 degrees or so (I am not the best at calculating that). and guessing it to be under 5 miles away.  At first I figured it was a plane going to the small airport a bit more to the West.  However, the lights did not change direction, there were no red or green ones visible to me like they typically have, it was too big to be a plane, and there was no noise.   Then I noticed it was bobbing around a little, l! ike a pulsation type movement.  My next thought was that it was Venus rising, but thought I surely would have noticed it while letting the dogs out before, and it seemed a lot bigger than a planet or a star.  A sudden excitement came over me as I realized this was most likely some sort of UFO!  For about 3 minutes I stood in wonder watching it, until I remembered I had my camera in my hand, so I took a quick photo.  Unfortunately, I was in such a hurry to run back to the house to have my housemate come out and see it, I only took that one shot.  Movement often blurs and I am not the best at night photography, so figured a photo would not turn out well.  By the time we got back out to the road, it was gone.

As I drove closer to the lights and closer to my home I saw that there was actually 3 white lights and the lights formed the shape of a triangle. It is hard to estimate the size of the craft and the height of it but this craft was lower than any other plane that I've seen in my life.  I stopped in the middle of the road to try and take a picture, at this point I realize the craft is moving and is moving pretty quickly southeast.  I quickly take one picture that didn't turn out well and drove quickly to my home about 200 yards away,  I race inside to gather the attention of my family and by the time I got my family and I out on the deck the craft had just passed over the tree line.

The orb/sphere sized light was traveling North towards my mom's house, so I rolled down my window to listen and there was no noise.  It didn't resemble a plane, helicopter, Chinese lantern, drone or a balloon and was flying level about 300 to 400 feet over the treeline.   I reversed my car back to mom's house and as I pulled up into her driveway the orb/sphere disappeared over her house/neighbor's house (I probably witnessed the orb for a total of 10 seconds).   I got mom back outside (as she has seen this orange orb several years ago and reported it on this site then) and we watched the skies for about 10 minutes and did not see a thing other than planes passing high above.  I went home and did not witness anything else on the ride home. However, nearly one hour later, mom would have a second sighting.  Mom forgot to bring and snailmail a couple of bills so she left to drop them off at the post office at around 10:25 pm.

She stated that the bright orange light was about the size of large ball and was going from her east to the north and disappeared in the same way.  She stated that it didn't come as close as her home but was further away.  She also rolled her window down and never heard a sound.

Plus other strange lights around our area there one minute gone the next.  About a week or so ago we spotted 5 orange/yellow lights fallowing each other some closer to each other than others but they all seemed to be together followed by 2 more of the same lights a lil further back we have these sightings sometimes every night sometimes 4 or 5 days without seeing a thing.  Some nights they are out there but they don't move they just set there like there watching something or waiting for something.  They sometimes stay between the hours of 10pm till 3 am and sometimes just 30 minutes. You cannot hear them.  I honestly am afraid of the dark and whatever this is has only added to my fear.  This has been going on since the first sighting I mentioned a year ago of 3 red/orange lights that made up a triangular shape.  We do have video of a light very close to us trying to land during a bad storm but when the light noticed us it was frightened and flew off.   I can send this video if interested.

Shortly thereafter, a third object appeared.   They appeared to be ‘globes’ and moved in a somewhat fast rate of speed.  There was no noise.  Their movement was very ‘smooth’ (no quick movements). Object 1 traveled towards us and, at one point, began ascending straight up (it disappeared).  Objects 2 and 3 passed the house (to our left look at the objects).  As they passed, I noticed what appeared to be a single light (underneath) the object.  I could make out a black shape (outline from the light) but could not distinguish what it was.  That is, they flew low enough for me to see that it did not have a bank of lights. I am confident in saying that it was not a plane as I did not see wings.  The light was bright and did not flicker or pulse.  I have seen and heard drones when deployed to Afghanistan.  This was not, in my opinion, a drone. I am forwarding a picture captured of object 2 and 3 from our deck.  I have other pictures but the size of the file would be too big to email.  These were taken from my android phone (Samsung).

(I was 12 ).  It was 1967. Going out our road, my mom judged where our lane was by the neighbor's yard lite.  I wasn't paying attention when she said, ""Oh, I thought that was Smiths' lite.""  When I looked up, we were past Smiths, and the ""lite"" was down in our woods. We turned in our lane and our house was 200 yards or so back this lane.   As we drove down the lane, this fire ball began to move.  Not toward us but parallel to us in the opposite direction.  My mom was so scared she said what are we gonna do.  Well, I figured I didn't want to be in the car if this thing starts coming toward us, so I opened my car door and when the dome lite came on, it started moving faster, and zig zagging. I reached the house, mom on my heel, and we told my brother and dad.  They immediately grabbed their guns and we killed the lites.  By the time we got focused looking out the windows, the fireball, which had been the size of a house, was a trail of embers. We had a few horses and poneys, and at that time one pony was out of the pasture.  As we looked out, this pony came running full blast, scared into the barn.  Another striking aspect was that one our horses had passed.  My dad was borrowing a backhoe the next day to bury him.  The fireball had been at the location of the deceased horse. As we processed this, we came to the conclusion that some hunters or something had set our horse on fire!  As the evening progressed, 2 sets of lights about 100 yards from each other, began signaling each other.  They reminded me of traffic signals. The lights were horizontal about 4 to 6 feet in height.  They seemed to be signaling a code to each other. The night wore on, it got late.  My dad chalked it up to crazy hunters.  The next morning, my brother and I got on our horses and headed straight to Lightning, the deceased horse.  Like I said, it was late, dry August.  There was absolutely NO sign of a fire.  However, Lightning's stomach was flat and his rectum was cored.  I never read about cattle mutilations till 68 or 69 in I think it was Mechanics Illustrated.  And I was shocked.  It all came to me then. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",,41.156,-80.4838

The wife and I were sitting on our deck, looking at the stars and the waxing moon.  It was around 9:00 P.M. on a cool Spring Sunday night.  The sky was clear and cloud free. The moon was @ 95% full.  I was looking over the roof line of my house towards the south and east.  My wife was looking south and west.   Suddenly there was a flash of light over the roof line in my sight of vision.  It was an intense, luminous emerald green color.  It looked like electrical sparks with arcing shards of current.  It appeared to be 3 or 4 times larger than the moon.  From the center of this matrix emerged what appeared to be a round or slightly oval orb with what looked like a lightning bolt trailing it.  The short trajectory of the object curved @ 180 degrees (like the letter C) and it stopped at that point.  The trailing energy field that followed the orb was visually sizzling (no sound) like the fuse of a firecracker and eventually subsided.   The orb was standing completely motionless at that point. If the moon was a basketball this orb would have been a softball.  I yelled at my wife to look at the object and she stood up in time to see it begin to pulse and speed away.  It shot into the tree line and disappeared.  I have never seen anything move so fast from a dead stop.  It seemed to me the pulsing of the object correlated with it's rate of acceleration,.as if the pulsing was a proponent of it's propulsion.  The angle of the sighting was at a 45/50 degree angle.  It appeared to be moving laterally due south.   My personal opinion is that the object made a dimensional shift, like a car running off the road.  The initial light show appeared to be a force field that had been breached.  As the object stood motionless, after its introduction into our world, it appeared to get its bearings and re-enter it original flight plan.  That's just my take, or maybe it was here to stay.  I hope to make a computer model in real time of the experience.  This is something the wife and I will never forget.",2017-05-11T00:00:00,33.96188745901639,-84.51021319672131

As per usual, I was on my balcony having a late dinner, still keeping an eye out for these lights I had seen some 10 days prior. As i looked up, dozens flew overhead, flying much lower than last time, they came from behind my line of sight in a west to east direction, three or four at a time, this seemed to be their standard formation, I noted about a dozen or so, while they did not make a sound, it was almost as if they were humming.  Perhaps some similarity can be drawn to how lightning ""makes"" thunder.  Regardless, I was excited, anxious, thinking of all the not too mentally well people claiming to have seen similar things. In my own paranoia I thought, ""hey maybe it's a government op, like some sort of fake alien contact type of thing to control the masses with red herrings and distract the populace from something bigger?"" while this may and well may have been plausible at the time, this concept would be doubtful in later days. The 24th of july 2013 it happened again, this time, it was dozens, flying in formation, sort of like a line, or a flock of geese, but closer to a weak semi-circle with one aircraft in front and two behind the formation. I went from counting the lights to counting the dozens, and as i did, the sky would be covered with another type, more of a gaggle, in which they were maybe upper 30s to lower 60s, flying much faster, and these formations were stratified, some flying at much higher altitudes, and this went on for several minutes, maybe 20 or so, where I estimated well over 2000 lights, and the adrenaline had worn off, i went inside, had a beverage, walked downstairs and out of my apartment, towards the park where this was still ongoing, and then i noticed that even MORE were flying at an even higher altitude, possibly in the upper atmosphere but keeping pace. Now i thought to myself, if this was some secret government project, then they were doing a horrible job at secrecy. m! y theory of foreign governments testing NORAD response times was gone, so gone. and after a while I decided to go home, I worked about an hour away and had to be there at 7 in the morning. and went to sleep while stragglers were still passing overhead. my initial count of 2000+ was way off, my estimate put it probably above 10,000 but, honestly, its a moot point to try and estimate. I was an air cadet in my youth, that type of flying, if it can be called that, takes logistics and co-ordination. That summer, I had witnessed them fly over maybe 10-30 times, honestly I don't remember, Once or twice I was waiting for a bus and staring up at a busy station feeling like an imbecile and someone also looked up and seemed somewhat puzzled, but it didn't get quite the reaction. At least on two occasions, possibly a few more, my father or sister had stopped by and I had shown them the lights, typically passing around 10pm eastern time. always in a west to east fashion. they were unsure what to make of it, a bit awed, words like ""I don't want to know."" and ""freaky!"" were used. but a piece of my sanity returned to me. Sometimes they flew really close to aircraft, I was quite concerned, Sometimes they would appear only a few moments after an aircraft took off. At one point I was no longer phased by seeing a group of three or four fly overhead, or over my head maybe only (if not under) 150 feet high as i was gathering groceries nearby. I saw them again the following year, mostly in the summer time when having a cigarette isn't an out-and-in affair. And, for a time, I concluded, even if it weren't the case, that it was best to pay it little or no consideration, that, it could me electro-magnetic phenomena from seismic activity. But then it all changed, how i allowed myself to perceive them as non-sentient, birds, sun spot anomalies, etc. that concept shattered for me on the 21st of october 2015, when they flew again overhead, this time flying in the formation of a question mark, it took me a few seconds to grasp, since, typically they only flew in lines or loose gaggles, and then some more passed, and, then they flew in the shape of a stick figure holding his arm up, waving as I casually did earlier, and with a humanoid face, an elongated, grey-alien type face in dot-matrix. maybe because it's an archetype, but, that would indicate they know of it, communicated with us, read our message boards.  Humans perhaps? tens of thousands of drones don't come cheap for a thrill of disrupting international airports and waving at people on a balcony for several dozen evenings, there would be some sort of hearing, someone would get sacked.  I have not yet seen any ""men in black"" or any of that. One time, I was responding to an email from my mother about these lights, and felt the urge to go outside, and there they were, conveniently. Never had i felt threatened, many thoughts coursed over their possible intentions, capacities, perhaps we are an open-air safari and they're simply visiting the great apes. At times I recorded them on my iphone, I did not have a filter so they are not visible, I may have kept the files, attempted to amplify the contrast, etc. to no avail.  The last ones i saw, were this summer, 2016 possibly late august.

Flagler Beach. I was on South Flagler Avenue by the Flagler beach police station in my vehicle, it was night time and it was approx. 18:40 hours.  An extremely large black triangular object approached from the South West at approx 5-10mph and was approx 1.5 miles away from my location.  I slowed the vehicle to idle to witness the object.  The object appeared approx 2,500- 4,000 feet in the atmosphere at that time.  At first sight, it appeared that the object was not on a horizontal plane.  It appeared to be on more of a vertical plane.  Upon first sight of this object i noticed 3 lights; they appeared similar to butterscotch in color.  The object remained moving towards my location at 5-10mph.  I noticed a vehicle in front of me heading north on Flagler avenue that had stopped to take pictures of the object.  I brought my vehicle to a complete stop and got out of the vehicle and I continued taking photos with my Galaxy Note smart phone. The vehicle behind me heading south, pulled! over on to the right hand side of the road.  The driver got out of the vehicle and appeared to be using a video camera (not a smart phone) and was capturing the object on video.  The left side of the object passed directly above my head at what appeared to be 500-1000ft directly overhead.  At that time, the object appeared to be approx. 500 feet in width and length and on a horizontal plane.  Upon looking up I saw 3 lights that were visible, the lights were on each of the 3 points.  The lights were recessed and cylindrical and did not have an aura.  The light on the north east side, front forward moving, and the North West side, front forward moving were bright white.  The light on the back side of the object or the Southside was blue.  Directly underneath the object, in between the North West side white light and the South side blue light were approx. 15-20 spherical shape impressions on the underside of the object.  The object was dark and the only reason I could tell it was tri! angular was because of the 3 lights, the 15-20 spherical shape! impress ions running in between the two lights.  The object made no sound, no vibration and no other auditory sensory. The object appeared to keep moving at the same 5-10 mph and towards the north east. It did not change speed, vanish, dematerialize or change in any immediate direction; velocity remained the same with no immediate changes.  Because I had stopped in the middle of the road and got out of my vehicle, due to oncoming traffic, I needed to get back into my vehicle as to not stop up traffic.  I dropped my phone, picked up the pieces, got in my car and continued heading south on S. Flagler Avenue.  I could see the object during my drive down S Flagler Avenue.  I came to the 7th street stop sign and went east at which that point I lost sight of the object.  I have spent many years at Whiteman Airforce base and have witnessed many B2 Stealth Bombers up close, directly overhead, on take off and on landing.  They have a distinct sound and have a distinct design.  This object was double or triple the size of a B2 Stealth and was definitely NOT a B2 and was NOT any aircraft I have ever seen.

Its open farm fields so the view is good.   after we were done we began walking back to the house when i noticed a strange orange glow in the distant western sky just above the horizon but very far away.  Thought it might of been an distant airliner at first, but there were no blinking lights and the color was odd.  It reminded me of the nasa launch last year from va which i could clearly see from my location as well.  It climbed in altitude very quickly and covered that large distance away and was soon over the southern sky looking up at it at about a 45 degree angle and then was soon way out over the ocean heading in an east south east direction.  You could see the engine flicker and flame out just like the nasa launch when it the stage burned out.  This occurred near the coast.  I thought it was interesting since i hadnt heard of any launches.   But what concerned me was about 5 minutes later we saw another one, came from the same direction and headed the same way,  only it flamed out somewhat sooner over land but was still very high up by that point.   Then about 5 minutes later we saw 3 orange lights glowing way off in the distance same area again and they flew across the sky in the same direction, followed by 2 more not far behind it, then one more then one more that appeared to go up and then looked as if it was slowly coming back down but may have been going west giving that appearance as if it was coming down, by that point we all were like whats going on and went in the house to check the news, i was concerned with all the stuff on the news some war had started or something.

Helicopter chasing orange light at low altitude.,Lawrence,KS,2017-05-04T23:00:00,light,~1 minute,"Occurred : 5/4/2017 23:00  (Entered as : 05/04/17 23:00) Reported: 5/5/2017 11:42:29 AM 11:42 Posted: 5/6/2017 Location: Lawrence, KS Shape: Light Duration:~1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/133/S133973.html,"helicopter chasing orange light at low altitude I was in my room in my apartment watching Dave Chappelle on Netflix, when I heard a helicopter overhead.  It sounded very low and powerful, so I figured it had to be military, and I-being a total nerd-had to run out to the parking lot to get a look. By the time I was out my door and in the parking lot, I had just enough time to watch a small orange ball of light being chased by what I assume to be a Blackhawk helicopter (because of size and sound) disappear behind the rooftops of the buildings east of me.    This struck me as bizarre because I saw something similar some months ago in the same general area (skies south of Lawrence, I live on the south side of town, not far from Baker Wetlands).   The light was small and orange in color and was about 50-100 yards ahead of the helicopter.  It made no erratic movements but was travelling at a fair clip as the helicopter was tracking it at almost the exact speed and it was moving pretty quickly.  As such, I have my doubts that this could've been a paper lantern (though the color and intensity of the light were similar to one) and the distance ahead of the helicopter rules out a refueling boom.  I'd give the altitude of the two objects to be between 500-1000 ft agl and the speed! of both to be about 100 kts at the time I saw them. Also of note, I saw another object in the sky in the general area at the same time, though it may not have been connected.  This object seemed to be an aircraft judging by the red and white lights it had on it, but it hovered in place for a moment until the lights slowly faded out with no apparent change in location.  The direction I was looking toward would be about a straight line to KCI, so I wasn't immediately suspicious, but--having seen plenty of air traffic heading to and from KCI on that flight path--this didn't look like anything I'd seen before (no landing lights).  I mention this because it was odd and because the previous sighting of a few months earlier of the same kind of event had 2 helicopters chasing the light instead of just one.  Maybe this was the second.",2017-05-06T00:00:00,39.0001002739726,-95.25458794520547

I was on the peak of a one story house roofing, when I heard what seemed like a sonic boom—something, living in Alaska, I have only experienced maybe 2 times…  But I remember  distinctly experiencing the first as a child and how it lead me to ask/learn about the speed of sound, etc., after hearing a massive jet fly over, yet looking up to see the only aircraft in the sky was already far far past me.. So on this super chilly yet beautiful BLUEBIRD, (literally not a single cloud visible in the sky) sunny day, I was sitting on the peak of the roof and as with a sonic boom, this out of nowhere, thunder-like BOOMING began so I started to scour the sky for the plane. There is a very small municipal airport nearby, so watching the various and at times quite suspicious types of helicopters/planes that come and go, is something I actively do as we work. As the INTENSE sounds continued it was immediately obvious that the sound was not “flying by” but instead was isolated almost directly above me, a little more towards the north east though. It was if a rocket was taking off above my head but that it was either sooooooooo far up that my (extremely excellent) eyes were unable to see it or that whatever it was, was COMPLETELY invisible.  I have read the unaided human eye can see a candle flame from 30 miles soooo, whatever was producing the noise was not reflecting light, was behind a barrier or was projecting its sound ""angularly"" by bouncing it off of a barrier. It was SO LOUD that it literally rattled my bones with cracking and booming, freaking me ((deleted)) out. Another way to describe how the whole thing felt is like the blue of the sky was the surface of water, and I couldn’t see up into it, but right on the other side of the surface was an enormous turbine propeller that literally tore its vessel away with power resulting in what sounded like a sheet of tin, as big as the sky around me, being shaken over and over and over  --like you do with sheet to make a bed.. I searched the sky for any movement- for minutes even after the sound ended. Looking in every direction over and over, closing my eyes a time or two because of the intensity of the sunlight and trying to make sure my eyes combined with the immense field of BLUE NOTHINGNESS, didn’t start playing tricks on me.. Picture me like some freaking crazy-ass, paranoid tweaker, sitting on top of a roof,  in -15F, doing a methodical but semi frantic 360 scan of an empty sky, over and over.... Ohhh how I HOPE someone saw it hahaha There were no planes, birds , clouds, wind--- NOTHING. The noise was of seemed an invisible craft ascending straight up, directly away from the earth until it could not be heard from the ground any longer. I have seen the videos of crafts with chameleon abilities but with those, there were objects and clouds around/behind them so it seemed their movement and outlines were visible. There was nothing but the stop-you-in-your-tracks noise and the nearly impossible-to-describe blue of an Alaskan sky on a below zero, sunny day. I have had two unidentified sightings before this.  The first in late Dec 2013 shared with another witness that was reported—which shared someone else’s similar report on the same day/area on NUFO, and the second not reported from winter of 2015. I wish i had thought to record the sky to see if something was caught... oh well  ........ To me it is insanely humorous how people are told not to believe & neglect their own eyes/hears/senses in general, and how most are willing to ‘accept’ some second hand information or “knowledge” from a complete strangers mouth-- from some device or screen of which they have not even the most basic understanding of its workings, nonetheless!

I didn't see an object but there a low flying helicopter with a spotlight was seen along with other aircraft,Monson,ME,2017-03-04T18:30:00,,5 minutes,"Occurred : 3/4/2017 18:30  (Entered as : 03/04/17 18:30) Reported: 3/4/2017 4:45:01 PM 16:45 Posted: 3/10/2017 Location: Monson, ME Shape:  Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/132/S132979.html,"I didn't see an object but there a low flying helicopter with a spotlight was seen along with other aircraft I was playing a video game tonight and heard a low-flying helicopter go over my house. It was enough to shake my house, and also several of my neighbors went outside to see what was going on. I didn't actually see the helicopter, but my neighbor said that it ""had a big spotlight on it"" and looked like it was looking at the power lines on our street and then it flew off.  Several seconds later, I yelled up the street to my closest neighbor and said ""what the _____ was that?""  And he replied he didn't know what was going on. I went back inside for a few moments and figured it was a search helicopter or Lifelight (we have snowmobile trails here and several people become injured or lost) and I figured maybe that's what was going on.  We have had helicopters flying low before looking for marijuana but it's the dead of winter and I'd highly doubt that was the cause. Anyway I went outside to see if the helicopter was going to make a circle back. I heard the sound of a plane off in the distance, went to my backyard and saw 3-4 aircraft off toward Borestone Mountain which is about 10 miles away.  They appeared to be either jets or helicopters.  As it was night time I could only make out the lights and that they were moving ""left to right"".   At that moment I was pretty sure something had happened and decided to call the sheriff's department and notified them of what was happening.  They said that they had ""no reports"" of Lifelight or any other aircraft (from an emergency standpoint) in the area.  The dispatcher on the phone said ""you are the only person to call in about it TONIGHT.""  I asked, ""has this happened before?"".  She said that she had had reports in the past of aircraft in the Monson area and low-flying helicopters as recently as a week ago.  I didn't give them my name but told them in general where I live as I didn't want to sound crazy.   I then went to the store and talked to a clerk who had said she saw the helicopter. Another friend across town also mentioned on Facebook she thought the ""helicopter was going to land on her house.""  I know I didn't see an object - but what is making me report this is that after I had returned home, I looked above my house and noticed more aircraft and a suspicious low-cloud at the end of my street. It is pretty windy here tonight, and the cloud DID NOT move.  It seemed to be like a trail and it was going in the direction of the mountain I had previously mentioned.  I showed my neighbor who remarked the cloud looked weird - the moon lit it up in the dark. It is a clear night and very cold with wind. I am just wondering if it was perhaps a military exercise or there was some kind of incident like a UFO, maybe something crashed?   I live in rural Maine and although we get military planes occasionally it is below zero and I doubt any training would be going on - especially so close to the ground.  I didn't see an object but am curious as to what it could be.  I've heard of reports like this in the past that have happened around the world and I have an avid interest in UFOs.",2017-03-10T00:00:00,45.3006,-69.5092

No sound was noticed as it passed by nor several minutes after it passed.   There were five sober adult witnesses to the object!  Including three Law Enforcement Officers! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, who works in law enforcement, and we found him to be sincere and sober-minded.

Myself, as well as the other witnesses with me, enjoy spotting satellites while camping!  This is often done with the aid of the iPod app SkyView, as well as the Sky View Satellite guide!   When this object was noticed, we all commented on how different it was, compared to a normal sighting of a satellite.  The object was faster, brighter, and maintained the same intensity in illumination during the entire observation, from approximately 10 degrees above the northeast horizon, over our location, to about 10 degrees above the southwest horizon.  Most satellites will get brighter or dimmer, depending on its relationship to the earth and sun!  The moon that night was about half full but the object was still very visible!  My wife was able to orient her IPad in the direction of the object, but no satellite was noted on her app!  I know that not all satellites may be allowed to appear on this app, as well as all space junk (rocket bodies)!",2017-03-10T00:00:00,,

I look out the passenger window to the East and notice a large, bright circular object with a bright corona in the sky over Downtown Denver.  There are no colored lights on the object to signify a conventional aircraft.  When observed through a phone seems to be either changing shapes or is emitting orbs that seemingly change the object's shape.   We take a left turn at an intersection to head West and during this time that we are turning the bright object vanishes from the sky. Approx 30 minutes later we had returned home from errands and, as we approached the door to the house, I notice the same bright, circular UFO hanging in the sky to the East.  A seemingly conventional aircraft (read: helicopter) in the same area of the sky seems to be approaching the circular object, at which point the object promptly vanishes from the night sky. I run inside to tell my friend who had already gone inside to put away items.

I did not hear any engine sounds.  They may have been about three miles away and 1000 feet or higher. I ran back inside my house and told my wife about the craft, and we ran into the backyard in time to see the two crafts pass further to the north in about twenty seconds, when they passed out of sight into the light cloud covering.  My wife only witnessed the two craft  from the back just before they disappeared.  She could only discern the red lights.  She did not hear any engine sounds either, but she said if they were normal, identifiable craft, she might not have heard any sounds anyway from that distance.. I spoke to my neighbor again and that is when he confirmed that he and his wife had estimated about a dozen ships flying to the east of his house.  His house is about one block from our house.  The craft never flew directly over our houses but may have moved near our area as if they came from the airport to the east of us.  The direction they were headed after we last saw them, if they stayed on that path, would have taken them directly over the city. We did not get to take any video or images. Just as the crafts dissapeared from sight, some type of passenger sized plane flew directly over our house from east to west.

I was driving west on US-60 on trip to Sky Harbor Airport and noticed a bright silvery cylinder shaped object over, I believe, South Chandler.  I was in the distance... Based on a thin cloud bank I would place the altitude at about 8000' so it must have been large.  I first saw it at the 10 o'clock position.  I first thought that it was sunlight on a jet contrail, but as it became larger I thought that it may be a plane on approach to the Mesa Gateway Airport... then it began to recede to the southwest... I almost wrecked the car trying to watch it.   There have got to be hundreds of witnesses, because it was very prominent... It then drifted back into the thin cloud layer and I thought it was gone, but it was bright enough to shine through...  Then from a cylinder it then appeared as two equally sized globes just touching each other...  I had to watch my driving so looked away briefly and thought it had moved away, but you could still see it behind the thin cloud... at one point it appeared to emit a curving smoke trail... then that stopped and the two globes began to sparkle...  I again resumed driving.... the next time I had a chance to look up it was gone... There absolutely have to be other witnesses to this.  It was still daylight and this thing was prominently in view.  This thing was bizarre.  I checked today's local news.... nothing... but then saw a video on you-tube that showed it... Only at the point where it was two globes. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Addendum to 3/20/17 submittal regarding the 3/19/17 incident...  The cylinder was situated at a 30% tilt, higher side to the left.  Object's length was approximately 7 times its width.  US 60 runs exactly east/west... this object was at the 10 o'clock position. It was nearly sunset.  There are always contrails in the very busy skies...they were all orange and this object was silvery white.  The spheres that It turned into were pretty much the same width as the cylinder appearance, but occupied 1/4 the length of the original cylinder.  It is possible that it was two cylinders side by side that turned so as to make it appear as two spheres... just a guess.  The object stayed double-sphere in appearance until it receded to the southwest... emitted a sinuous smoke emission from the left side of the left sphere which dispersed almost immediately... the object was receding slowly... then it began to sparkle with lights brighter than the initial silvery white appear! ance…  I looked away for not more than 10 seconds...when I looked back it was no longer visible.  It is impossible than no one else saw this... as it was fairly large with an apparent width of your index finger at arms length at its narrowest and was slightly larger upon my initial observation.

They were white, glowing circles who moved across the sky.  At first I assumed it was just airplanes flying- but together to make a triangular shape?  I've seen way too many pictures of UFOs, and have witnessed some in the past to know what they look like.  I do have a few pictures of the lights my sister took as well. 1:00 A.M. (a few hours later) - I was at my house with my boyfriend, while my family of three and two dogs slept upstairs.  We were laying in bed talking, when suddenly we heard a noise outside.  We stopped and listened. We then heard a strange noise that I cannot explain..all I could say, is that it sounded like some sort of ""alien"" noise.  I have no idea what they sound like, or if they can even make noise, but I am 110% sure it was something...extraterrestrial.  While we were (low-key) panicking, we then heard three quick footsteps upstairs, going outside.  We didn't hear any door shut after those footsteps.  As we laid there in slice, and fear- we heard another noise outside.  It sounded as if some sort of machinery was running, and made a humming noise.  It lasted for a few seconds, but then the sound faded away. Coincidentally, I feel like these two experiences have something to do with each other. I spoke to my folks about it- both are passionate about UFOs and the phenomenon, and they too, believe they could have followed me home.. Whatever it was, it was definitely another life form different from mankind, and I hope it doesn't come back to visit.",2017-04-20T00:00:00,40.6677,-111.9388

We came out of McDonald's when I was drawn toward a bright light, high in the northern sky.  I had seen this kind of light before ... I guess that was why I was looking up there.  Venus was visible already [it was pre-dusk] high in the south-west - and that light in the northern sky had about the same magnitude than Venus did that evening.  As we drove home -about a 10 minute drive] we still saw that light, but it soon faded dramatically, only to split into two fainter lights, hovering above each other, then starting to 'dance' around each other [my daughter said 'they are playing tag'].  When I ran inside to get the binoculars, the lights were gone ... as there never was anything up there. Last evening [Februray 21] we saw the same thing again.  Same time, same location, same brightness at first.  This time I had binoculars at hand, and two neighbours witnessed it too [though, they dismissed it as balloons or something like that].  After waiting about 20 minutes, the light faded again and it split into many tinier lights.  The binoculars revealed that the original light was donut shaped, and after fading, the smaller were just light dots, moving erratically, before shooting away in all directions with such speed I could not follow them with the binoculars.  I also saw two, what looked like cloud-shapes among the seven tinier lights before they shot away. I'd like to know what we all saw ...

We live in a small town near the Hanford nuclear facility, one of the places used by the Manhattan Project to create the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki at the end of the second war.  It is not uncommon to see helicopters in the sky and an occasional jet flying over the city, usually headed from or going to the ""Area"" as we call it, but that night it was extremely windy with very little visibility and a blanket of clouds covering the sky.  The helicopters were not visible but very audible and drew us out into the yard to look at the sky.  At first we saw nothing but clouds and fog but then we noticed the red light and it app! eared to be similar to the light of a plane and another in front and another in back and we saw the sky above us moving.  The craft was at least a few thousand feet long and the largest craft I have ever seen in the night sky.  We were shocked.  Called another neighbor and they saw it too.  It was amazing and it was heading north east towards the base at the Hanford area and the craft blocked out the sky above us.  We went inside and didn't speak again about what we saw until two weeks later when we saw it again a second time and this time it was about 20 miles from our home viewed from the front porch and it blocked out the mountain, Rattlesnake Mountain, the tallest and largest treeless hill in north America.  It almost looked like a battleship that was meant to be on the water but it was in the sky. Think star wars battleship cruiser.  Blocked the mountain out.  Incredible!  We saw it twice! Strangest thing i have ever seen and the biggest ship I have ever seen since.  But every night, there is a bright ""star"" that shines brighter than all the others and moves in irregular orbit across our sky.  I have pictures and there is a second star, half the size of the first and it moves irregularly as well.  I believe that we have low orbit satellites in our skies every night.  There is no other explanation I can stipulate, I call the large one the ""death star"".  Everyone agrees in my community that star is irregular.  I always say ""that's not a star.""

From the yellow light was this funnel of light (sort of a cone) that was a sort of orange brown extending at a 5 o clock direction from the light.  Inside the cone were three blinking white lights that alternated randomly.  The blinking lights were spaced out evenly long ways inside the cone.  My friend and I were perplexed, staring at this light, because we'd never seen something airborne act in that sort of fashion.   After staring at the light for what seemed like 2 minutes (it could have been longer) the blinking dots stopped.  Then the cone started to slightly disappear.  Once it was gone, the light began to also fade away. Also forgot to mention that I was a sort of thin smoke pillar extend from the bottom of the cone to about halfway to the ground.  Never touching the ground.  Or even reaching the trees.  The smoke went away first, then the cone, then the light. After that about 1 minute later, I heard and felt a low low rumble.  Like very distant boulders falling from a cliff.  And then over the course of the next 30 seconds the rumble grew louder and more intense.  Parallel to the sound was a light eminating from past the tree line.  I could see the atmosphere grow with light.  I felt as though a nuclear bomb had dropped and the blast wave was imminent.  The low hum/rumble was extremely frightening. I honestly thought I was going to die.  After 30 seconds the sound stopped instantly.  And the light faded. Something else to mention,  I don't know if this is relevant, but there's a retention pond in the neighborhood.  Inside the pond were frogs.

Woke up at about 3 am to a loud melodic hum during the catastrophic wind storm that hit Colorado this month that sounded like it was above my house.  It was like nothing I’ve ever heard before.  It moved north away from the house and sounded like it was moving back and forth between the northern and western part of Golden.  I woke up my girlfriend and she was able to hear it to, but couldn’t make sense of it either. 	Checked around while it was going on and the sound didn’t appear to be created by the borderline record setting winds blowing through or against anything as the noise remained consistent in volume between wind gusts.  Also, being from Wyoming (arguably the windiest state in the country) and having heard a lot of wind against a lot of different things, this hum was still like nothing I’ve heard before.  I checked the skies around the house, but it was overcast and all I could see was the glow of the Denver lights bouncing off of the cloud deck.  But considering the fight or flight response that sound was eliciting from me, I’m glad I didn’t see anything if I’m honest.  My every instinct was telling me to get as far away as fast as possible.  It’s worth noting that the hum was higher pitched and seemed to alternate between 2 tones.  It scared the hell out of me but oddly the sound was kind of pretty in a way.  I’ve found a lot of reports online of a “hum” that detailed a really low pitch that almost chimes, but this was nothing like that and was both several octaves higher and constant. 	Also conferred with my next door neighbors.  They woke up from the wind at about the same time that I did and also heard the noise, but they’re pretty heavy sleepers and fell back asleep pretty quickly without giving it much attention.  To be more specific, it didn’t occur to them that they heard a sound until I brought it up a few days later.  I stayed up and listened to the hum until about 5:30am before falling back asleep myself.  As far as I can tell, no one has reported this to anyone. 	I’m prior military and a fairly level headed person.  So far, nothing has ever made the hair stand up on the back of my neck like that hum.

We were marveling at Orion, as he was pretty high in the Eastern sky.  We turned and walked with our back to Orion, and I looked up (towards the West) and saw a triangular object moving EXTREMELY slowly towards the N/NW in the direction of Charlotte, NC (I'm 2.5 hours from there, but just trying to give some perspective of its movement).  We were able to observe it for 15 minutes before the dogs and the 11 year old got restless.  I came back outside, but the object was beyond the far tree lines.  I live with open fields around me in a rural area close to an Air Force base (Shaw AFB). The object was definitely an equilateral triangle with a slow-blinking red light in the middle.  It was low enough that I would be confident in saying the light was at the bottom of a convex/downward dome.  The points of the triangle had white lights that were not blinking.  I would estimate the width of the craft to be on par that of the wingspan of a Boeing 747.   Ahead of the object and to its left was a much smaller craft that was simply a red light as though it were ""towing"" the larger craft--definitely guiding the path for sure.  The light on that smaller craft was not blinking.  I could not make out the shape of this object, but the red light appeared as a dot from my vantage point. I heard zero engine noise.  Since Shaw AFB is home to an F-16 fighter wing, so I know what F-16 engines sound like, even at idle.  This object wasn't making any noises that any aircraft would make, much less an F-16.  I was stunned at how slowly the craft was moving and amazed it was able to stay in the air without me hearing any engine noise.",2017-01-26T00:00:00,33.888483783783784,-80.38087297297298

Hello,  I wanted to share something that happened to me on February 10th, 2017, at around 7:15PM EST.   On Friday around 6:30PM I left my house to go pickup a pizza we had ordered for dinner.  I made the trip there with nothing abnormal, began the trip home and seem to have lost some time.   After making a left turn onto NC RT49 in Roxboro, NC, heading back to my home about 9 miles away, I remember seeing a section of the road where after the left turn, the road has 4 lanes.  About a mile or two after that the road narrows to 2 lanes and its around another 8 miles to my house.  I moved here about 3 years ago, so I am usually looking around at landmarks, way points, or familiar sights to keep me aware of where I am.   During this trip home I remember the part where the road changes to two lanes, but have no memory of what I saw during the trip home until I looked up, saw lights in the sky above me, and realized I had driven passed the road my house in on, and driven another 8 miles or so.  I onl! y remember seeing the lights above the road, and had to sort of hunch down in the seat to see them above the road.   At that point, I realized where I was, looked at the clock and it was 7:28PM.  I thought maybe I had fallen asleep, but the road has some curves-twists that could not be navigated without some sort of intelligent control.  I have no idea what happened, but thought I needed to tell someone about it.  Thanks, Scott Horner",2017-02-17T00:00:00,36.2599,-79.068

Suddenly, in the northeast sky, two large, very bright, white lights just appeared above tree top level.   The light on the right was much brighter than the left.  The brighter light was brighter and larger than Venus was in the sky that night.  The lights were of the same intensity and moved in tandem, remaining the same distance from each other and at a 45 degree angle to each other at all times.  They seemed like they were connected together. The lights remained stationary as they slowly adjusted their angle until the light on the right became higher in the sky than the left light.  The lights paused a moment, then began to steadily move to the northeast until they disappeared into the night sky. There was no sound, no color to the lights, and no flashing.

From around 34,000 feet, I noticed in a completely clear sky a chevron shaped object.  It was dark grey.  There were no clouds anywhere, and no other objects in the sky. We began our descent into Denver.  I estimate when I noticed it it was around 30,000 feet.  I believe it was moving the same direction we were only slightly slower. It appeared as a V.  As we descended, it flatted out in my perception and was completely flat and extremely thin. I witnessed a fast moving plane come in to my sight.  It seemed to have a wider jet trail that was angled more like a ""V,"" instead of a ""="" stream. The plane came in fast.  I couldn't make out what type of jet it was but it flew towards the object and made a quick turn around.  I could tell because of it's jet stream it was going towards the craft and then parallel with the craft.  It was above and to the side of the V shaped object.  It remained over the object until it was out of my vision. On Southwest flight.  This was probably somewhere in that New Mexico/North Texas/Southest Colorado area. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Seemed more of a darker gray, more black.  That's why it stuck out.  On the smaller her I couldn't tell.  It was fast and made what looked like a a power slide maneuver when it got over top.  Once over top it seemed to do more of a hover/drift rather than fly.  So I don't think it was a commercial type jet.   I don't think those hover planes can do that maneuver that high in the air, but that's what it looked like. Yes, it looked like it ""wing manned"" it or was guiding it away. I'm not on crew.  I asked one pilot, ""What the hell was that, and he just looked at me and said, ""I didn't see anything.""

I stepped out of the house for a few minutes to view the sky and full moon.  A few wispy clouds in a moon lit sky were observed, with some stars visible.  As I looked to the north, above my house, I saw what at first I thought was a star.   As I continued to look at it I noticed it was moving slowly in a linear trajectory, NNW to ESE. While keeping my eye on the object it appeared to pick up speed.  While doing so the bright round light changed to a more defined 'fuselage' with no wings.  It continued on until it slowly extinguished its light and faded out.  A possibility is that it went above a lower cloud bank, but I feel that was not the case.   This sighting is very similar to one I had over my house two months ago which I also reported herein.  That object, however, was lower in altitude and much brighter. Both object changed from a round light to an cylindrical light before fading out. No sound was heard from either object, no other lights visible on the craft, and the speed was about that of an aircraft.   Height estimate for this sighting I would have to guess at being 10 to 15 thousand feet, but it was impossible to know for sure.  Since I live a few miles from the Atlantic Ocean, the trajectory would take it out over the ocean as it continued.   This area is a 'hot spot' for UFOs for some reason.  Other local residents have hesitantly told me of their sightings, when I casually brought up the subject.  Some of their stories were quite extraordinary.",2017-04-13T00:00:00,,

When I first came outside I began to watch the stars and relax as the last day of school for me is the 5th of May 2017. I see the usual things such as a few shooting stars, twinkling of the stars, and just normal stuff one would see in the night sky. Minutes pass by as my friend and I were talking about the what Earth would look like from space. 11:34 p.m CST.(The Sighting itself) Now at this time I was just glancing around in the sky when I first saw it and pointed it out to my friend. It looked like a meteor at first from a very far distance. This was in the East/South sky, about 75-80 degrees. It was such a bright flash of light compared to other stars and it didn't just go away. For a minute I thought it was just another planet. Then thoughts crossed my mind if it was a man made satellite. It couldn’t have been however. It was moving different directions. First traveling towards the South sky. Then it began crossing in a back and forth motion. It would occasionally stop for a minute or two. Then it would go back up and move in this back and forth motion. At this point I stood up knowing it was not man made, as my friend tracked it, I ran quickly grabbed my high powered laser pointer (10 Mile radius Class 4 green colored) my friend pointed it out and we shone it to see if there would be reaction from it. It did seem to react which was very interesting meaning it must have spotted this light, at least a very low power of it. As soon as i shone at this light, it stopped and stood still. It didn't move for at least 5 minutes. It moved again and I shone at it again. The craft stopped again. By this point my friend and I ran inside and changed and began looking up who records these sightings. 11:48 p.m CST.  (The call in)  After seeing this I began looking for somebody who would take in this sighting.  I googled exactly where to report and immediately called the hotline. 11:50 p.m CST. I told the man at first how i swear it was not a prank call.  I forgot his name (I asked at the end and completely forgot) I explained it as “A fireball"" looking thing that switched directions in the sky”  It was in more words but if I were not so panicky of giving a 15 second detail it would've sounded better.  He told me to make a report on what me and my friend saw and in a way he could describe it.  Therefore, I made this report in order to show that a sighting is just a matter of paying attention. 12:09 a.m CST. I began writing the report and finally finished at 12:30 a.m .

I scanned the skies to check for signs of geoengineering.  I noticed two commercial airplanes flying west, laying down contrails that dissipated pretty quickly at what appeared to be cruising altitude.   At this point I noticed what appeared to be three white birds flying (drifting) around in circles, almost like they were drifting around in the air currents.  These three white “birds” appeared to be at a similar altitude to the two planes I had been observing.  I quickly realized that birds don´t fly at that altitude, and if they did I wouldn´t be able to see them with the naked eye.   I pointed it out to my wife to see what her opinion was.  She had a hard time seeing what I was asking her to look at, but when she could finally see them she said they were round, white balls—difficult to see.  I, too, saw that they were round, white balls flying around erra! tically, like the way a bird of prey might drift around in the air.   One of the three objects disappeared, while the other two continued flying west.  They twirled around each other in a spiral pattern while zipping west at a very fast pace.  No emissions or noise was observed from these two circular ball objects.   We both realized that these objects were strange, nothing that we have seen before in the skies.  UFO’s?

Talking with friend on outside kitchen steps and was discussing how many planes fly over at this time of day, from roughly East to West. (I have an App on my IPad showing their departure and arrival times and speed and altitude, called ""Plane Finder"".)  I was telling him most of these were flying anywhere from 30 to 40 thousand feet and often times they were starting their decent over us, depending on their destination. Anyways; I looked up at one of these planes that was just beyond overhead and flying West and saw a very bright light that was in back of it, yet at a much lower altitude, so I could perceive.  This light was not moving.  The sun was overhead also, although positioned slightly southwest and more westerly than the plane. The light looked like a light from a very bright flashlight. I asked  my friend. ""what's that light?"" He had to turn, He was facing North.  He looked and as we both saw it, it split into 2 lights (splitting from East to West) not too far apart and then gradually faded away. We could not determine the distance to this light, although I would guesstimate from 1/2 to a mile, although I am guessing more than I actually know. When it started to split, I rubbed my eyes, not knowing what I was seeing, thinking that I was seeing something that was not there.  It was there. The time I saw this light until it started to split was about 8 to 10 seconds, how long it was there, I have no idea. The time it took from when it started splitting was about 10 seconds, before it faded away. The distance between the 2 lights, after they split was about 5 to 7 times the width of the original one bright light. For example if the original light was say five feet wide (it appeared round), the split lights were roughly 25 to 40 feet apart.  This measurement seems to be an interpretation of possibly the height of this light, in my mind, not sure??  It was very bright, so much so, that even with the sun shining on us from a more southeasterly direction, it was as bright, if not brighter but much smaller.

It appeared to be moving in a floating drifting manner, its movements were slow and smooth, it was over the mountains to the north of Lava Hot Springs, ID, about 45 degrees above them the lights looked to me to be in a set of three, one red, one yellow, and the other sort of white.  I have seen a lot of jets, airplanes and helicopters, this was not one of them.   When I first spotted the lights, I called my mother out to come see, while I grabbed my binoculars for a better look.  The lights continued to drift to the left, and then to the right, then it seemed to move away.  As it did, I saw a high flying jet plane with flashing red and green lights blinking and heading east.   After the jet plane flew out of sight, the lights I was watching through my binoculars suddenly got bright, and then I saw it explode.  I saw a large ball of fire and two large sparks fall beneath it then it was gone, all through this there was no sound, not from the object or the high flying jet plane, nor were there any noise from the explosion, which  would tell me that it was a good distance from my location.

I see that hill across the Valley every night and thought rhat the lights looked way too big, and that I never saw them before and thats when out of nowhere 3 more just descend from above out the black of night looked like fireballs coming down to the earth when they suddenly stopped directly above the original 3.   There was a group of about 4 or 5 kids at a park bench about 40 yarda away from me that couldn't stop watching this either the lights just floated there for a minute and then started spreading out towards the ocean.   I lost track of 4 of them, but 2 stayed in the first location for about 30 minutes",2017-03-17T00:00:00,33.5717,-117.7289

At this point the object began to move from a northern direction towards the west rather slowly and horizontal.  I begin filming but could tell the image was hazy on my phone and did not resemble what I was actually seeing.   I heard people talking outside, so I just stopped filming and just looked at this object.  I'll try my best to describe.  It was an orange sphere and had an orange glow.  There seemed to be like darker orange lines In the center that made either a diamond or triangle shape.  It seemed as though something was in the center.  So, as the object moved, I'm questioning what it is, etc., and it begins to fade away.  It completely fades and then becomes visible again.  It was really odd.

Abrupt angle changing motions, morphing. Want to start off by saying I have never seen this much activity in the sky over San Tan Valley.  I've seen a few things I couldn't explain in the past over this horizon.   Went in my backyard to feed dogs and I looked up in the sky like I always do.  Saw a bright red ""star"" in distance, which I thought was a plane heading straight at me.  It got bigger as it approached then stopped in the sky.  It hovered over the San Tan Mountains for a while, then directly under it to the right another white light appeared.  Slowly drifted north.   Then another similar light appeared and did the same.   For a while the three lights formed an Isosceles triangle.  The two white lights drifted toward Chandler/Gilbert area and when they got over the populated area started to flicker like that of an airplane.  But not constant like a planes lights flashing.  The white lights started to flicker a lot and dipped under the horizon out of sight.  The red ""star"" stayed still drifting upward slightly.  What I thought was a plane headed towards the red light, then stopped and completely changed directions and drifted upward.  Couldn't believe what I saw.  The red light then started to fade away but not until a bright white orb appeared under it, pulsated, shifted direction and disappeared.  Before the circus ended a smaller red orb drifted up to the red star and almost ""kissed"" it before changing directions and fading away.  Also when all this activity was happening I saw three aircraft in the sky fly by.  One flew almost directly over my house.  Had a big green light under it and I couldn't tell if it was a plane or a helicopter.  Made almost no sound at all.  The other two flew directly under an orb but must not have seen it.  This sighting left me with an uncontrollable gut wrenching feeling in my stomach.  Too much activity for no one else to witness.",2017-04-07T00:00:00,,

Hovered roughly 15 feet over our heads. It was August 26th at around 11:45 PM and my two friends and I were stargazing on the beach in Sandwich Massachusetts.  It was a very quiet night with little wind and quiet waves. As I was staring up at the sky, the stars were suddenly blocked out by a slow moving black rectangle that appeared to be only about 15-20 feet above our heads.  The rectangle was only about 3-feet in length, was completely black and had a small red light in the front of it. The most terrifying aspect of it was that it was completely silent.  ABSOLUTELY NO noise came from it and the only reason we saw it was because we happened to be looking at the stars when it crossed right over our heads. Immediately after yelling at my friends to look up at it,  we chased it for about a hundred yards and as it picked up significant speed.  The way that it moved was incredible.  It didn't seem aerodynamic in anyway but moved very quickly and silently and it had no fans or wings.  It was simply a small, black, rectangular prism. We chased it until it suddenly turned and it crashed into the ocean about 40 yards out.  The way it crashed into the water seemed almost intentional.  The object moved too well and seemed too in control for it to accidentally land it in the water. The lights we had with us were too weak to see it, but we presume that it sank when we could no longer see it floating on the surface.  Shortly after this incident, roughly 15 Coast Guard boats began to move back and forth very close to the shore as if they were looking for it. The next day we searched the water but with no luck, and we think the object was either found by the Coast Guard or was pulled out with the tide.  I’m not a believer in aliens, but this was nothing like anything I had ever seen before.  My best guess is that it was a spy/surveillance drone, but with some sort of cutting edge technology that allows it to fly without wings or motors. Whether its aliens or some government test, I don't feel safe knowing that things this stealthy and advanced exist among us. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

There was also a small Cessna type aircraft buzzing up and down the coast. These five aircraft at first seemed small, but then it appeared they were all very large, seen at a distance of a quarter mile.  They were somehow very dark, too dark to identify any markings despite the bright sun overhead.  They looked like large bombers in shape, but then again, not.  Very hard to describe their shape.  Kind-of like military planes but kind-of not.  They looked more like some sort of squashed plane, with a short nose and squat wings, but very large.  It was very hard to tell. The reason I am posting this is because they were traveling at a speed SLOWER than the birds around me.  Even at the distance from me, I could see the small prop plane moving faster than the five large aircraft. They didn’t make sense.  They should not of have been airborne, moving so incredibly slowly.  It doesn’t make any sense.  Only balloons can travel that slowly, or maybe a hand-glider.  They should have fallen out of the sky. They moved in formation all the way out to the ocean and I lost sight of them.  I don’t understand. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Saw a number of red lights in the sky.  Appeared to be distant.  Originated below the horizon (obscured behind buildings) and rose in the sky while moving steadily from left to right from my perspective.  Lights were North and East of my position. Lights moved with constant speed but did not follow a constant path.  Vertical component of velocity changed - lights changed rate of rise and at some points descended.  Horizontal component seemed steady. Saw about 10 total lights. Initially saw them when coming around the corner of a building that obscured the sky and immediately say about 7 in the same part of the sky.  No obvious formation to them but they were all in the same few minutes of arc in the sky.  One by one the lights faded and disappeared.  As the last of the original lights disappeared a new one rose into view, then another, then another at wide intervals.  They all rose and then disappeared as the original 7 did. Did not appear to be flares as they steadily rose and covered a very large distance (assuming hey were far away, as was my impression.)  Again, they appeared to change vertical component of velocity several times.  My sense was they were maneuvering. I have seen this phenomena before in the same part of the sky from a nearby (2 miles away) location about five years ago.  I am an avid airplane enthusiast, an atheist, and a general skeptic - I am not prone to false beliefs and delusion.  These were not aircraft lights or flares.

I was sitting on my front porch listening to music, and since I like to listen to aircraft passing, I decided to pull my headphones off.  The strange thing was that there was no sound.  This light was hovering over that house for about a minute or so.  The light was very bright, but oddly enough, not so bright that I couldn't look directly at it.  I'm located in the Columbia area, and I could tell that I was facing north when looking at this object. That bright white light shut off.  What replaced that bright white light was a green and red light pattern.  It's difficult to explain, but the lights appeared to be one and the same, and yet separate at the same time.  This craft still didn't move and I could tell because it didn't appear to be getting bigger or smaller.  I couldn't make out the exact shape of the craft, but I could tell it was big.  It was like looking into the dark to see a blurry figure and you can't tell the exact shape but you can tell how big or small it was.  This thing was huge. I'd say it was the size of a C-130. About 20 seconds after the bright white light changed to the green and red light combination it shot off to the East at a speed that was ridiculous.  This was weird because it went from a stand still, to shooting off at such a fast speed.  There was no build up to the speed.  That kind of maneuver seems ridiculous because that has to be technology I've never seen before that allows an aircraft to go from a stand still hovering position to speeds I haven't seen fighter jets match.  It didn't make sense how fast this thing was, and yet there was still no sound. I couldn't believe what I saw so I stood up and looked around for neighbors.  I spotted one such neighbor who happened to be an Air Force veteran and we talked a lot because I'm an Army veteran.  I asked him if he saw anything weird.  He told me that for several nights he saw the same thing.  He too said there was no sound to this aircraft he was witnessing.  He said it didn't seem like a drone because drones don't move like what he saw and he thought it was weird he never heard any sounds coming from this object. I decided to call Shaw Air Force base.  I got in contact with the command post.  They said they didn't fly anything over my area.  They got me in contact with McIntyre Air National Guard base.  They said it could have been an Apache helicopter with ""whistle mode"" engaged.  Now I'm no expert on Apache helicopters, but I have ridden in one before, and I've seen the so called ""whistle mode"" in action.  That doesn't eliminate all sound nor does it explain the speed I saw.  Even the person I was speaking with couldn't explain why this thing was so unbelievably fast. I'm not sure what I saw.  I don't know what I saw.  I just know that I'm a combat veteran who was deployed to Kandahar Air Field (KAF) and I've seen all sorts of aircraft. I've never seen anything like this before.  That speed, the way the lights were so weird, the fact I heard nothing and the fact that the outline of this thing looked a heck of a lot bigger than an Apache is something I cannot explain.

These were definitely not birds or any natural animal but some sort of craft flying silently and without any navigational lighting or other illumination.

It floated West, across Amsterdam Avenue and about 65th Street in NYC.  It floated in the West/North West direction, out towards the Hudson River. At around 18:31 pm I was walking South on Riverside Drive, at around 71st Street, when I noticed a group of these same “balloons” floating West towards the Hudson River.  They looked like balloons, but they also looked like UFOs.  They were coming from a completely different direction and time than the one I had previously seen. There were approximately four UFOs in this small group.  As they ascended, they all moved at the same speed towards the sun, making it hard to see them.  One of the objects didn’t float in formation.  It proceeded to move swiftly, heading North, before banking and heading South, now above the Hudson River.  It did this a few times, changing direction smoothly.  At the same time, it seemed to move in the general direction of the other objects. If they were a lot closer, I imagine they would have been relatively large balloons. The objects were silver, and, if they WERE aircraft, I imagine they were small…smaller than a car.  If they were balloons, they were large balloons. The part that REALLY drew my attention was the time difference between the two sightings.  There is no way that the one balloon I saw, descended to the earth, found three more balloons like it, then proceeded to ascend back on its course, four hours after the first sighting. Maybe there was an event in NYC, where a lot of silver balloons were let off…it was strange.  I have some video of the two events.

I was sitting on one of the chairs facing East looking out the living room window that also faces East, and while my nephew was commenting on a topic we were discussing, I saw what I can only describe as this:  “Two oval-shaped lights, BRIGHT, sparkling,” appeared over the treetop of a neighbor’s home. The only lighting from outdoors came from two homes, which I could see from my position.  These two porch lights and one dull, street light were the only noticeable light sources. I stared in puzzlement with what I was seeing, and the flurry of possibilities came flooding into my mind of what I was seeing:  “Maybe it’s the traffic lights from the neighborhoods in the hills…but that can’t be because there’s no lights or traffic lights coming from that direction. It’s a big rig…wait, that’s too close and too big to be that low and that big.  Street lights?  No.  That’s not a street light.”  These are the thoughts that were racing in my mind as I watched these “lights” float and lower to the level of the neighbor’s rooftop and then disappear. I stared, after it disappeared, trying to figure out what I had just seen.  The first words out of my mouth after the “lights” disappeared, was, “Oh. My. Gosh.”  Not wanting to create fear with my nephew, I waited until he was finished with his conversation and slowly introduced him into what I had just witnessed.  His response was doing the “Sign of the Cross,” and uttering a quick prayer.  I laughed reassuring  him that there was no need to be concerned because I wasn’t afraid.  I said to my nephew, “I KNOW what I saw.  I saw it. I just don’t know WHAT I saw. What the HELL did I just see?”  This incident lasted about 2-3 seconds, but DAMN, I can’t get it out of my head and I am not about to go broadcasting it publicly because who’s going to believe a random sighting of unexplainable lights amidst skeptics? Well, there you have it.  I would NEVER put myself into a position of being persecuted for perjury.  I KNOW what I saw, I can’t explain WHAT it was, but I KNOW what I saw.  Please help me to explain this because it’s constantly replaying in my mind. THANK YOU for your time to look into this and hopefully explain it.

This was completely by accident.  I was getting up to get some honey for my sore throat.  I noticed that the moon was very bright, however very few stars actually visible in the night sky.  We are accustomed to seeing planes come in from the direction I was looking.  What caught my eye was that it did not appear to be moving and rather than the traditional, well timed flash of lights on the wing of a plane, these were multi coloured and extremely bright lights. And rather than the lights appearing to be on the object, the lights seemed to be the object and around the object all at the same time.  The other anomaly was that it was not moving.  I lined it up with a street light on the other side of the city and stood stationary and it never moved.  The tree line was also visible in the dark and it was not going up or down either.  We keep binoculars in the kitchen window for bird watching so I steadied my arms by resting them on the counter and looked through.  Plane shapes are easily seen this way.  This was not holding a specific shape and seemed to change randomly in a fluid manner. I woke up my house mate and the first suggestion was that it may be Sirius which most certainly can have bright flashing colours.  Although we have never seen Sirius that low in the sky. The other thing that was strange was that it looked considerably bigger than a star in the sky.  Taking into consideration there were only two other stars visible in the clear view of the sky from the kitchen window, it was strange enough to keep watching. After approximately another five minutes of watching it, the object slowly moved away in the direction of South West fairly fast until it appeared to be lowering in the sky to the tree line.  It was definitely moving away rather than dropping because it was getting smaller and harder to see. Taking the distance from the object, night time hours, treeline and buildings into consideration, I would estimate the overall size (although fluidly changing) to be that of five to six city buses, end to end, wide.  And perhaps four city buses, end to end, high. We both had the sensation of feeling unnerved.  I can only describe it as feeling like we were seeing something that was not right.  Even when we trying to rationalize that it was a star or something else.  It was a little upsetting and exciting at the same time.  Just a knowing that something was, off?  Hard to put my finger on it. I do not need to be contacted by anyone, however if anyone has questions I am happy to  answer them.",2017-02-17T00:00:00,45.85845371702638,-66.63156282973621

Today it is crystal clear with no clouds.  We often see airplanes fly overhead but this these were obviously not planes. I watched them for about a minute before pulling out my Galaxy Note 5 set to 1920x1080 30p with Image stabilization on. When I first noticed them I thought they were balloons but quickly realized they were not because of their size and speed. They moved like fighter jets changing formation darting around then getting back into various formations. because of how high they are and large about the size of airplanes I knew they were not normal, I knew I needed to record them. At the beginning of the video, they look very far away and tiny. It's unfortunate that smartphone cameras make things that are about the distance of an airplane look much tinier than they are because to the human eye these UFO's were much closer like looking up at an airplane flying over at about 2,000-3,000 feet. It was also clear these things were metallic as they were very reflective and would get easier to see as they maneuvered and changed direction in the sky. I zoomed in but because of how bright the sun was it was hard to see my screen which is why I loose them in conjunction with how fast they were moving across the sky. Lastly, I know it may lose some credibility because I put my product logos on the video but I have a family to support so I had to capitalize on this unique and puzzling experience with my kids.

At 8:30 this morning at my house, something caught my eye in the sky to the East.  It is difficult to estimate the height and location of the object, but I estimate it was centered over Winter Springs, Florida at a height that was a little higher than you would typically see a helicopter.  The object was likely Frisbee shaped, but I believe I was just seeing it from the side which I would describe as Cigar shaped.  My first thought was that it was a drone, but it was moving too quickly and effortlessly.  It went from the original location to the left and hovered, then to the right and hovered, and then up higher to hover.  The changes in location were split second, not gradual changes.  The object seemed to be lit up with a white light that covered its entire shape.  Based on how white the light was and that it didn’t seem like a glare, my guess is that it was a light coming from the object and not the sun’s reflection.  I was able to track the minor movemen! ts for about a minute before the object proceeded East at a speed that disappeared from view within a moment.

At 15:45 my son called us and said he could see a UFO back at my house 4.9 miles away, north of our location. I immediately went outside to look and asked him where to look in the sky, and he said north.  I couldn't see anything but looked for some point of reference and noticed an airliner taking off from LAX (it was climbing) some 10.7 miles away north west from our location at mother's in Torrance Ca. I asked him if he could see the jet and he said no but would go to the front yard to get an unobstructed view.  While he was moving from the back yard to the front I could see a flash that lasted about one second. The flash was about 60% the size of a full moon.  This object flashed three times and at three second intervals, and on the third flash I could see what appeared to be a star but in full daylight as it was a very bright white light. I then noticed a pinkish orange flash coming from the star object at three second intervals. My son came back on the phone and said it was on a collision course with the airliner which he could now see. The star object would flash for a second coast for three seconds and then flash again for a second.  At this point my eyes were adjusted and I could see a second identical object trailing the first.  It was also flashing pinkish orange but at two second intervals until it caught up with the first object. The scene left me with the impression it was dropping down from a higher altitude to a lower one.  The second star craft was as it was dropping down reminded me of a shooting flare much like a descending flare from a flare gun except it was bright white. When the two objects were even they both were flashing in complete unison as if they were mirror images of each other.  They were perfectly side by side and were headed from the northwest towards the southeast.  They gave me the impression like, they were skipping across the sky.  Like an ice skater, rhythmic and smooth. I told my son I could see two objects and they were headed towards me.  I looked at my watch and it was 15:50 and told my son to go to work because the incident distracted him from going to work.  He was suppose to be at work at 16:00 and he hung up the phone and went to work. The airliner was headed perfectly due east and I could see the airliner and star objects converge.  I almost expected a collision but the star objects were well above the airliner because one of the star objects was blotted out by the mass of the jet but for only a split second. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better a third object appeared as if it just dropped in on the other two objects.  The third object dropped in on the other two exactly like the second star object. I expected the third Starcraft to line up with the other two but it did not, it went into what I think was a kind of missing man formation.  It hung slightly back of the other two and at a distance double the distance of the first two objects. Had there been a fourth object lined up with the other three they would have been perfectly spaced.  Like this.  *   *   *   *  except the far right third object was slightly behind like this.          •  •         *  Size and Distance if a circle is 360 degrees and from horizon is 180 degrees then the the two objects were about 5 degrees apart and the third object at 10 degree and slightly back. My son sighted the first object at 15:40 I caught site of the first one at roughly 15:48 by 15:50 my son left for work he said he seen two and missed the third possibly because by 15:48 they were closer to me than him. The third object went back up and disappeared while the two continued southeast until I lost sight of them at about 15:55 due to the distance. They were almost directly over head and my neck is sore form looking up so long. They seemed too slow as by my estimation if you could have seen them from horizon to horizon it would have taken them 30 minutes to make that distance. Between my son and I we watched them for 15 minutes. Thank you for your work.",2017-02-17T00:00:00,33.83267537437604,-118.33263344425957

My wife and I were just happen to be looking up in the sky as we were taking our dog for his final ""potty break"" for the night.  While I was looking up, I saw a light of an object traveling at a much faster speed of a typical airplane or any other object that I could identify. The time was 8:40 pm.  It was dark and the sky was clear.  I was facing east and looking at the moonrise just beneath Jupiter.  Out to the southeast, I noticed this object that had a white solid light traveling in a straight path to the northeast direction.  The first thing I noticed was that the light was solid and did not flash or flicker like the traditional airplane lights we see in the sky.  I quickly brought got the attention of my wife and showed her this moving object and compared it to the much slower-moving airplane lights in the sky to contrast the difference between the object I am describing in this text. Once we identified this particular object as being so different, we continued to follow its path. It was a straight path.  At first, and as it was moving overhead, the light seemed to get brighter and larger. My wife described the light to become elongated.  The light quickly dimmed as the object continued to travel into the northern direction.  As it approached the Northern horizon, there seemed to be a flash of light (kind of light a shooting star), then the object disappeared. The total arc of its pathway that we witnessed was approximately 90 degrees arc and this took about 30 seconds.  The light was a constant white light. The speed of this object was much faster than any other planes in the sky. There was no sound with this object. Because it was nighttime, we could not see any vehicle. I could not identify what that object was. I looked up the ISS location and found it to be over South America at the time. As I continued to observe the sky, we saw lots of airplanes, helicopters that night.

It was dark but the porch light was on. I looked up at the sky to see the stars and when I looked to my left (East) I saw a ""V"" shaped light pattern moving in a due West direction, directly over head.  It looked to be very low and very large (I could see it between the roof line of the house and the tree branches which normally, if I see a plane, it's 100 times smaller).  I could hear an engine but it wasn't near as loud as when planes go over head at a lower altitude (Richmond airport is about 15 miles from us).  It proceeded to my right (West) and then went out of sight over the tree tops. There were five white lights...one in the center at the point of the V and two to each side; and there was one green, small light behind the V shape but further back than the tips of the V. I called my husband out and he got there in time to see it flyin! g away and fading out of sight but he did see it. Since we heard an engine, we thought it was a B-52 Stealth or some kind of very large military plane. But, we have seen a Stealth and they make hardly any sound at all so I don't think that was it. And this was so low that I truly expected to hear on the news that a military plane had crashed in the mountains near Charlottesville, VA (which was the direction it was heading). There is an airport in C-ville but I wouldn't imagine a huge military plane landing there since it's a very small airport. I don't know what we saw but we really don't think it was a plane. What made me start looking on the internet to see if anyone else had reported anything was because a day or so later, up until last week, we had tons of military chopper activity going back and forth. We are close to DC and a couple of military bases so we get training ops flying overhead every once in a while. But not usually this much activity.",2017-02-10T00:00:00,,

Close to 7:00 pm on March 21st, just before dusk, myself and 4 of the crew members aboard our vessel saw a craft that appeared to be five times our 240 ft vessel in length.  My line of sight was about 1/4 mile from our vessel.  There was a rig behind the craft about a 1/2 mile.  I used this to help gauge size of craft.  Sighting was approximately 80 miles SE of New Orleans, Louisiana. 	The scene lasted about 40 seconds.  The craft rose up out of the water (Gulf of Mexico) about 40 feet, no water was dripping from the craft.  Within a split second the craft disappeared at a 30 degree angle into the sky.  Speed appeared to faster than speed of a light turning on in a room.  Within seconds it had disappeared completely. I can say for sure that the craft was dark colored, oval in shape and made no sound whatsoever. With as many rigs (2), there has to be more witnesses than just the four on our vessel. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be unusually sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very capable, and very reliable, witness.  He estimates that upwards of perhaps 50 people, who were aboard nearby vessels, may have witnessed the event, as well.  We would urge those other witnesses to submit reports of what they had witnessed.  PD))",2017-03-23T00:00:00,29.96590338078292,-90.0784456405694

I saw what I thought was the back view of  a jumbo jet heading towards MacDill Air Force base on my right over a field.  It got my attention because it was so large and seemed so close.  There was a large white light in the center, with a small blue light on one side and another white light on the other side---as if on wing ends.  There was a small red light on the belly of it and was blinking.   However, as we got closer, we saw it definitely wasn’t moving.  So then we thought it was a tower of some kind with weird lights, but there are no towers in that area and it definitely wasn’t that, because I saw this thing rotate mid-air rather than turn.  It was definitely triangular/teardrop sort of shape---kind of both of those.  It reminded me of the jets I saw in the sixties and seventies, only a little larger.  I‘ve spent a good portion of my life in and around the military, so I‘ve seen a few.  Its nose definitely pointed downwards briefly for about ten seconds or so, not really straight down, but at an angle and there was a long shaft off the nose of it.  I saw a flash of dark metal as it shifted and the definite shape.  We heard no noise whatsoever.  It appeared to sit quietly in mid-air at about eight stories up, it didn‘t seem to be much above the tree line from our point of sight from the road.  My daughter (29 years old) kept saying, “It’s so close.  What IS that?!”   My husband nearly drove off the road into the bushes because we’d gotten so excited, but he didn‘t see it because, well, he was driving.  By the time he’d turned around, it had moved in the opposite direction going North/Northwest towards Tampa International, but it had gotten really far really fast without a sound.  If I had to hazard a guess, I’d say it was some sort of stealth jet with an odd shape.  However, I have never seen a craft quietly rotate mid-air like that or head off so fast ! without a sound.  It just didn’t behave like a plane, blimp (wa! s way too fast for that), drone (was too large for that), or helicopter.

A blinking blue light on its left side and a red blinking red light on its right. It started going faster and had no noise. At this time my son said, ""Look at the plane! Look!""
