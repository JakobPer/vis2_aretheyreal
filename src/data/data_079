They were moving in an imperfect arc from the mountains south-east of the Salt Lake Valley turning west then possibly either toward south or upwards in altitude.  They also caught the attention of at least 5 of my neighbors so I am sure there are many other reports to be heard and seen throughout the southeast valley and hopefully pictures and video.  They were moving about the speed of regular aircraft and even passed at least 2 actual airplanes (as noted by the normal light colors of aircraft).  As they reached about perfectly south of my current location they gradually seemed to fade away from either light direction or distance.  I was able to point out other high flying airplanes at the time.  They seem to be very similar to the orange orbs seen in the June-July series of orange orbs worldwide.  However they are questionable because of the near-airplane speed they seemed to maintain, with the exception of one orb that stopped after raising from behind the mountain as 2 other passed it before it continued on its was.

Nor did they dart or zip away.  No wobbling. Just flew the same as a plane or helicopter would but was not either one.

At about 945pm on 11/24/2012, four of us were driving through Bolton.  While driving over the bridge that crosses over 384 on route 85/Bolton center road, we noticed a white, glowing penny sized orb to our left, which would have probably placed it nearly above the highway.  This object hovered and made no noise that we know of.  We noticed it only because it was in our line of sight, and seemed too big to be a star - though otherwise this is what it looked like.   After crossing the bridge, curiosity made two of us look back, at which point the orb seemed to shrink to nearly a pinpoint, which we realized meant that it had ascended upwards.  No sooner had I (the driver and writer of this report) turned my head forward again to watch the road, a second object was observed by all of us directly ahead/in front of us, no more than a mile away.  This object was also a glowing white orb, but basketball sized. It descended below the treeline pretty much on route 85 itself!  We drove along route 85 to see if we could find it, but to no avail.  I would be VERY interested if anyone knows of any military operations going on in this area on this date.  If not, then I cannot explain what we saw. NOTE: Airplanes do frequently fly to bradley airport in the area we saw these orbs, and we saw such a one at this very time.  The orbs were clearly different than the airplane.

I live on the top floor of a 3 storey block.  As I sit at my computer I have a window directly to my left which gives me a view of a taller block (12 Storey), left of this block I get a good view of the horizon if I lean outside. At approximately 19:55 I glanced out of my window and saw a gun-metal black craft with 3 spike-like protrusions, one on top and a spike either side.  There was no sound whatsoever from this object, I could hear the traffic and faint police sirens in the distance but no aircraft sounds. The craft's overall shape was a flattened Teardrop, with the curved portion at the rear.  At first I thought it was a toy, I could clearly see the shape of the craft and exactly where the spikes meet the body. The craft appeared quite large in the sky, about 2cm if I was to pretend to hold it with my fingers. I used to be heavily into model aircraft and kites when I was growing up, I do have an interest in aviation and I'm not one to mistake everyday flying devices as something else. I quickly opened the window and leaned out. The craft travelled 8 o'clock direction towards the tall block directly ahead and disappeared behind the building. I watched intently for it to emerge from the other side, after about 1 minute I could see it again, but its position had changed. It was MUCH further away, whereas before it appeared fairly close, now it was just about visible above the horizon to the left of the building. The craft appeared to stop in the distance, turn around (from facing right, to facing left), then lower vertically beneath my line of sight. I waited for another few minutes after that to see if I could catch sight of it again, unfortunately that was the last of it. This has put me in a weird spot, I had no idea what to do with this. My mind literally cycled through everything I understood about things that fly the moment I laid eyes on it. It didn't fit, and that realisation actually startled me. I really needed to get this reported somewhere, thank you.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,,

I first noticed 6 bright orange lights when I glanced out of the driver’s side window of my van.  At first I thought it was simply a reflection and mentioned it to my wife.  When she looked she said…”that is no reflection!”  We both saw the phenomena…a series of 6 bright orange lights arranged in a pattern very similar to the Big Dipper constellation.    The pattern was only 10-15 degrees above the horizon and would be in a northwest direction from our observing position.  The pattern did not apppear to be in motion vertically or horizontally.  The lights were definitely not stars.  They were a definite orange in color and much brighter than stars.  Also, they were all of a seemingly identical brightness and size. We decided to continue to travel east on the road to a spot about a mile farther where we knew we could get a clear view of the sky.  During our travel, we continued to glance at the formation and noted that the lghts started to move apart and disappear, one or two at a time.   They did not fade…they simply vanished as if moving away out of sight.  By the time we reached the area we intended to stop, all the lights were gone except for two, which left shortly thereafter.   When we stopped, we also noticed another vehicle perhaps 100 yards ahead of us also stopped.  We suspect that they may have seen the same phenomena and also stopped to observe.  This is simply conjecture on our part since they moved on shortly after we stopped and noticed the lights were gone. Neither my wife nor I have ever observed anything similar to this phenomena before.  We would be anxious to know if others in our area observed anything similar.  When we arrrived home last evening, I immediately wrote a note to a local television news room (WNYT Albany, NY) detailing our observation in hopes that if any others had observed, we might hear of  the matter on that station.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,42.7513388429752,-73.59967396694215

I was distracted by a flashing strobe type light from astern (North) looked back and discounted it as air traffic.  About five minutes later took another look and lights were much closer and well defined.  The strobes were flashing from my right to left (east to west) in the front of the craft.  Continued to monitor the craft as it neared. As the craft passed over head I could determine that the flashes were distinct separate lights moving around the craft.   The lights were bright enough for me completely lose my night vision.  I could not make out any sound (please note that I was running a diesel engine at full throttle in building seas and breeze).  I would approximate the altitude around 2000 to 3000 ft.  Please note that I did not see any navigational lights or spots. The craft continued south, parallel to numerous commercial flights heading north prior to their east bound turn (out of Seatac).  It passed at least three jets heading north and if this was odd they could not have missed the lights.  I tracked the craft as it made an easterly turn over the shipping canal toward Lake Union.  At this point I thought it might have been a strange lighting configuration on a sea plane which would land on lake union.  Or a new lighting configuration on a plane heading for Boeing Field. My curiosity was piqued when the craft did not land in lake union or turn south to Boeing Field but instead turned north (probably over lake Washington) and continued that course until I lost it behind the rise (this is how I approximated the altitude)  I was about two miles off shore and to lose it behind the hill the angle would not allow for much height. Strange occurrence and thought if you got other reports this might help to substantiate them.  Times and heights are all approximated so use with a grain of salt.  But I hit the Shilshole dock at 2200 so speed and time are pretty close.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

It was the color of a flame - the illumination remained consistent - except that, looking through binoculars, it appeared as if the ""light"" was moving from left to right - as if scanning the sky, in a consistent pattern.

After the initial craft disappeared in the south sky, a second craft appeared moving in the same north - south track, at the same rate of speed.  Both crafts were identical in appearance.  Neither craft had any blinking lights, nor were they moving at a speed that would be required by an airplane to remain aloft.  I took a few pictures of the crafts, only one of which turned out decent.  I also filmed some HD video, however, because it was dark, it did not turn out well.

I was standing in our driveway stargazing as I often do. The sky was mostly clear. We're 4 miles south of Long Beach Airport, and the sky was busy as usual with air traffic. One plane caught my attention as it flew south toward the general area of downtown Long Beach about 3 or 4 miles to my west. The only light I could make out was a bright white headlight that flashed every second-and-a-half to 2 seconds. When it reached my latitude, it banked east toward me. Now I could make out 2 white headlights which continued flashing in unison at the same interval. No green lights. No red lights. No other lights. Just 2 flashing white headlights.  It was much higher than the altitude police helicopters fly. The 2 lights were about a pinky width at arm's length apart. At this point I was figuring that it was a plane, and that there was a logical explanation for the missing identification lights. So I took a look at it through my binoculars, and I could make out 2 lights, but before I could bring it in focus it vanished. So then I looked without my binoculars, and after about 4 seconds it flashed once or twice more and then it vanished altogether.  The sky was clear. I watched for about 10 seconds.  By this time there was a tree blocking my view of where it would be if the plane reappeared, but I was satisfied at that point that it was gone, and that it was a plane with malfunctioning lights or maybe something else.  As for its sound, there were several planes in the area at the time and to tell you the truth I wasn’t even focusing on its sound, but I don’t remember any sound coming from it. So I’m not 100% sure. If it made a sound, it didn’t stand out.  So I spent the next 15 seconds watching planes, just kind of looking around, and then ! I surveyed the area right above me. Okay, now here’s where it gets weird. The plane reappears flying the opposite direction. At least I assume it was the same plane. Same size, same 2 flashing white headlights.  I had never seen a plane with that light configuration (I’m 56), so logic told me it was the same aircraft. Then about 2 flash sequences later, when it was directly overhead, poof! Gone. In all my years of stargazing, I’ve never seen a plane make a 180 degree turn in 15 seconds and then disappear.  So I thought that was a little strange. In the next hour, I saw 2 unusual aircraft, or maybe it was the same aircraft, in the north sky from around Cassiopeia westward.  The first of these 2 sightings began as a flash of white light, like a star, in the constellation Cassiopeia. I could make out a dark object either losing altitude or flying NE which flashed again about 3 seconds after the first flash. Then about 3 seconds later it flashed again, and then I lost it behind trees.  It travelled about a width of my fist at arm length between flashes. Then about 15 minutes later, an aircraft with the same description appeared in the NW flying south about 2 miles to my west.  It flashed twice, about a 3 second interval, and sometime before the third flash it turned east and flashed about 2 or 3 more times at 3 second intervals and then it vanished. As for sounds, again there were planes in the area but I can’t remember any sound coming from them. So if they made a noise, it didn’t stand out.  When it was flying east to west, it looked to be about a mile to my north.  Neither of the aircraft appeared to be much more than a thousand feet high. These sightings happened 5 nights ago. I’ve been watching the skies almost every night since and I haven’t seen anything out of the ordinary, just the usual planes and helicopters.  And I had never seen anything like that in my life prior to that night.

If it was 500 meters away then it would be much bigger of course. The sighting duration was about 3-5 seconds after which it was behind trees and out of sight.

The shape became evident that it was in the shape of a saucer as it flew closer to the castle.  Hundreds of eye witnesses and myself became very quiet as it flew over us.  My best guess is it was maybe 500 ft above us as we could all see it was silver, metallic and it had a series of lights on the underside of the craft that spiraled in a counter-clockwise direction.  The craft never made a sound as it flew over us.  The flight pattern was smooth and linear.  The craft never stopped.  It continued to fly through the fireworks, over the castle and onto the horizon. I tried to video tape! it with my little digital camera; however, all you could see was the lights swirling in the counter-clockwise direction and could not quite make out the shape of the craft because it was too dark.

The sphere was very close to my door, less than 3 ft from where I was standing inside. It was larger than a basketball, solid, and perfectly symmetrical. There were dime sized holes covering the sphere, perfectly spaced, approximately 1.5 inches from each other. Bright lights were emitting from these holes, changing colors, from red to orange to yellow. The sphere was spinning slowly and horizontally, from left to right. I was so stunned that I stopped in my tracks. I watched the object, while I called out in wonder to the individuals in an adjacent room, who could see me looking outside.

I was driving home from work, it was about a year ago, the exact date was unknown, but I tried to post around the known time frame, at first I thought I was seeing things, and I was beyond terrified at first, I have seen one other unidentified flying object one time before this, but since after, I have been seeing an increasing amount, around once a month.  But the object that I saw that night was the most outstanding of them all.  It was around 11:30 to midnight, and I was on my way home from work, I was only 16 then, I was washing dishes, but I driving down a road called saltsburg road, when to my right side, high above the trees, I saw a green triangle of what seemed to be very BRIGHT LED lights, they were not flashing, they were a solid steady color.  I pulled off the road into a little gardening center called schrams landscaping. I pulled over, and the object proceeded to slowly fly over the church on the hilltop and slowly coast towards me.  The objecy did not directly fly over my head, but about 150ft out in thr front of me.   As scared as I was, I proceeded to stand and watch the object. I continued to slowly float across the road infront of me and fly into the woods across the street. I stood and watched the object about scared beyond my self control.  The object stopped in mid-air, and floated there for around 5-10 seconds, it then slowly decended maybe about 50 feet, the object was probaly only 300-400 feet in the air, while the object decended, I quickly proceeded to run to my vehicle, and turned around to exam the object one more time.  While doing so the triangle of brightly colored green LED lights, began to spin, it started off spinning slowly but quickly proceeded to accelerate.  As it started to spin, the trianlge of green lights grew into a large circle of green lights, and began to spin at a high rate of speed, the faster the object to seemed to spin, the closer and closer that cirle of lights came to each other, t! he cirle grew smaller and smaller into one giant green light,  I then h eard a woosh noise as if the wind were blowing, and the green light was completly gone, I then proceeded to drive home at a very fast unsafe rate of speed, constantly checking in the sky for this object to make sure it was not following me, when I got to my road I pulled over and checked one more time, and saw nothing, I quickly flew down my road and pulled into the driveay and checked one more time, saw nothing so I ran inside explaining to my mother and brother what I saw that night. It was absoloutly amazing, because this was not the first time I have seen unidentified flying craft, but after this, my sightings have increased alot. If I can explain here, I would like to explain some other odd sightings I have seen. The first UFO I have ever seen was in Murrysville PA, at a park called Townsend park, probaly around 7-8 p.m. It was my brothers boy scout meeting, and I wondered off to walk around, I saw these three white lights in the sky. They were extremly bright white lig! hts much like the ones I saw in july last year, but there were only three of them, in a perfect row, seperated equaly in the night sky. They were moving not at an excessive rate of speed, but quicker than most man powered aircraft. And the way these lights moved through the sky, is absoloutly undescribale, the only way I could ever show somone how they moved through the sky would be drawing it out step by step on paper. When I saw this, I didnt think too much on it, but after seeing the one last july, it really occured to me what I saw that night at the park. My second sighting was the green triangle of lights that flew above me that night in july. My third sighting, which didnt occur until early this spring was in april, exact date unknown, I know it was evening time, and I was taking the garbage down to the bottom of my driveway, and I saw a bright white star looking object in the sky, at first again I did not think much of it, but I still continued to watch it, because t! his time, this weird feeling overcame my whole body, a feeling! that af ter feeling it, i remeber I felt the both nights I saw the other two UFO's. I watched this object for about a minute, it sat steady in the evening sky, then it slowly flew very genly to the left, so slow it almost looked motionless, but I focused on the object and noticed it was slowly moving, then it flashed a very bright white, almost a blinding bright, I turned my face away from the light, I flinched because it was so sudden and bright, but when I looked for the object, I could no longer find it in the sky. My fourth sighting was back in May, It was evenging time again, and I was driving down Route 366 in murrysville pa. Out in the distance, I saw two lights hovering around, they gave off a bright whiteish bluish glow, the two objects were hovering in the sky together, slowly flying around each other, hovering for around a minute, the lights got a little bit brighter, but nothing too exsesive, they slowly flew close to each other, almost as if they joined into one object,! and it slowly hovered upwards into the sky for about 15 seconds, and then took off at an abnormal un-human rate of speed. It was almost an instant aceleration, into the sky, then about 30 or so seconds later, 3 military planes, couldnt ID. what kind of model planes, but they were larger looked like cargo planes, two engines on each wing, all flying in a cordinated group, flew over the highway, and proceeded towards where the objects were in the sky. Now what makes this sighting even more abnormal than it already is, is that my mother and brother were outside walking the dog, and they called me shortly after to tell me they saw a UFO and they now believe everything I have told them about what I saw. When I got home that night I had my mom explain fully what she saw, and what she described was exactly what I saw, I had her come outside and point to me where she saw them in the sky, and it matched perfectly with where I saw them, and both my mother and brother saw the lights,! and the planes. Now my 5th sighting wasa the night after this! , I saw the same EXACT two lights in the sky, the birght white/blue glowing balls. They were doing the same thing, but they were in the opposite side of the sky, the first night I saw them they were hovering in the westward are the sky, the second night they were eastward. I stopped and examined them, and showed my girlfriend them, she too saw them and was amazed. This time they were there for only a matter of maybe 15 seconds, and flew away. The night before they conjoined each other and flew away together, but the night after, they did not rejoin, but flew off with the same instant aceleration as the night before, but in total opposite directions. Since that night I have seen a few odd lights but nothing I can confirm like that, until tonight July 1st, I was on my way to work, I work outside of down town pittsburgh from 10-6 A.M. It was 9:23 P.M exactly, and in the very gently illuminated sky, I saw a bright oragne, firery object, slowly floating along the woods, I was a massive b! all of fire, but seemed to die down as flew downwards, and the fire proceeded to get brighter as it hovered upwards, I know that it was not a hotair baloon for the fact that it was close enough to see the shape of the obeject, it seemed to be a perfect golden colored cube, with fire surrounding it, and it slowly flew into the woods, then disapereared into the night time sky. This sighting tonight is the reason why I am reporting everything I have seen, and when I see more UFO's, I will be reporting them here. I hope my information is helping, and I hope it will do some justice. Thank you very much for taking your time to review this.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,,

It seemed to be over our yard eventually and shining the light right on us.  All of a sudden it was gone.  It was an amazing experience. On another evening we had company over and were outside on the deck again when the lights appeared.  This time, there were 2 lights.  Our guests were going insane and my husband and I had to explain that this happens all the time over this mountain range.  The lights seemed to be dancing when all of a sudden, once again, they were gone. It is not only during the summer months we see them.  One of our bedroom windows also looks out onto the mountain range and I see the lights often, dancing in the sky over the mountain, as I lay there at night trying to sleep. On one afternoon while standing at the top of our long driveway for our daughters school bus, I also witnessed 4 objects in the sky in the opposite direction of the mountain range.  They were silvery looking and almost shaped like a sombrero. they appeared in the sky one at a time and moved around a bit then disappeared as they appeared, one at a time.  There has been a lot of activity in this area for as long as I've lived here (23 years).  Not just over the mountain range, but all around the community here.  I've never reported anything for fear of being ostracized and thought of as crazy.

She had done this a few nights before, and I had taken her out.  When I went outside I remember hearing a loud sound, of what seemed like horns, or trumpets from all around.  I remember it being very early in the morning, maybe two am, and thinking, why isn't anyone else waking to this sound. I thought about it later, and thought maybe my dog had heard the sound, and that is why she wanted to go out. So On October 2nd, when my dog did this again I was much quicker to go outside. Again I heard the horn/trumpet sound, though this time it seemed a bit muted, almost like I was hearing it in a vacuum, similar to hearing the ocean in a seashell.  I looked over the horizon and saw nothing, then from overhead noticed what appeared to be a triangle of lights, with what appeared to be randomly moving lights running between each of the triangle points.  It was very large, and all I could really see were the lights, and definitive darker, more shadowed area within the confines of the lights on the corners.  It continued to move away from me in a Southern direction, and reached a point on the horizon where is seemed to remain still, or in a relatively central location for a few minutes.  I was able to get 31 seconds of video with my cell phone, and then the battery died.  The video was shot prior to it reaching the location on the horizon where it hovered,and I opted to stay and watch it, as opposed to trying to go in and get a quick charge on my phone to record more video (Which is what I did after watching it hover for a few minutes on the horizon, when I returned to try to record more, it was gone.)

The display ended around 10:30 pm.  I noticed a bright, solitary red light in the sky to the north.  It was traveling north to south, directly towards us, and I believed it to be an airplane; except the light was not flashing, and was much larger than lights on a plane.  I watched the light for about a minute, waiting to see flashing or other colors with it.  But there were no other lights or colors. I pointed it out to one of my friends who had remained after the fireworks display.  He and I watched this bright red light coming in our direction for about two minutes, trying to determine what it might be.  We considered it was probably a light from a Coast Guard helicopter.  That wasn’t the case. Within about four minutes of first noticing the light, it was finally directly overhead, at an altitude of about 1,000 feet.  We then knew it was not an airplane, or a helicopter.  It made no sound whatsoever. It appeared to be traveling faster than any plane that would have been flying overhead.  Almost immediately after it passed us, the light became smaller and dimmer, appearing to be less than half the original size. It seemed to be traveling more than twice as fast once it was south of us, than when it was coming towards us. Within about 20 seconds after passing over us, the light seemed to shrink until it was completely gone.

The bottom of the ‘triangle’ was one red/orange light; the other two lights were higher.  If I held my arm straight out in front of me and made a fist, the lights were about the same size as my fist. I noticed them because they were stationary at first, just hovering in place, and I wondered what kind of aircraft they were.  When they didn’t move for a while (a minute?), I started to pay closer attention to them.  They didn’t make any sound. Soon they started slowly shifting their position vis-à-vis one another, so they created a kind of diagonal line, with respect to the horizon.  At that point I noticed a fourth sphere much closer to the ground, hovering just above the beach, much closer to me, at a distance of probably half a mile. I didn’t feel particularly afraid, or threatened, but I didn’t want to stick around there all alone, so I started walking fast, back to my house.  As I walked, I kept my eye on the lights, and noticed that they seemed to be moving away from me, too, at a very fast pace.  By the time I reached my house (about half a block from the dunes), the lights looked like four tiny red dots of light flying away, into space.

I was driving home ( no alcohol) and saw a bright orange oval shaped light travelling very low, approx. 500-600 feet  and only going about  25 mph or so . First thing I thought was this is a plane , it`s got to be a plane , but after I approached  a stop sign , I got out of my vehicle and got a good look at it &  it was  oval shaped and with a bright orange glow  lit from within . It was also WAY too low and going really slow about 25 mph. Now , i`m not delusional by any means , I know what I saw, as a matter 0of fact I ended up following it THROUGH st.norbert until it slowed right down and STOPPED . I got out of my vehicle and shut the engine off,  & this thing was absolutely silent !  I watched it for about 15 seconds and it started flying away at a faster pace. I followed it up to near pembina hwy & the intersection of hwy # 75 and lost it from sight .  I have to tell you , i`m an amatuer  astronomer , and an aviation buff and  i`ve never seen anything like this at all. I noted the time when this happened, it was 10:54pm on the clock in my vehicle. The whole event lasted approx.  3 1/2 -4 minutes total from the time I acquired it  till it flew out of sight . The hair on the back of my neck was/ is  standing on end , this just wasn`t right.  The way it was moving  around  sort of skipping really got to me. It wasn`t flying in a straight path  ( almost like it was wandering around, quite bizzare)  This was not an R/C  aircraft  or anything else I can think of . ( no noise at all & too big)  I just had to tell someone , it was a really nice night out, so someone else had to see it , it`s just  not the kind of thing you miss. I know it was friday the 13th and everything , but this is not a joke in any way, shape or form . I wish I had a camera with me , I can tell you that I will be keeping one in my vehicle for good after what happened tonight. It`s important that someone else know what  happened out here. I`m not sure if the Airport in WPG  would have picked anything up on radar or not  , as it was flying really low , again  estimate about 5-600 feet. This   was just stunning , I could barely keep my vehicle on the road as I drove following it  through the area . I don`t think i`ll ever witness something like that again ...",2012-08-05T00:00:00,49.891260040733194,-97.15285022403258

I stepped outside at 8:04 p.m. to view the night sky, which is very clear and filled with stars.

After about a minute, one started to move and go North as if it were going to the ocean, soon after the other two moved in same direction following the first.  We stood and watched till we could not see them anymore. We were quite amazed with this sighting.  Definitely not stars, shooting stars, falling stars or any type of normal aircraft.

They appeared to be playing, moving in random directions.  The one in the lead would stop and go back toward the second light which would move sideways.  It reminded me of a slow game of tag.  The first would stop then move ahead of the second light again.  They also moved in a slight crescent pattern at times.

I was headed south on Cleveland Ave. (US 41).  I had just turned left onto Cleveland Ave. off of South Road when I saw a bright ball of orange light flying towards me.    It appeared to be at about 500 feet and moving at about the speed of a small aircraft in the approach pattern, that is about 120 MPH.   The threshold of Runway 05 at Page Field is just a hundred yards or so northeast of the intersection of South Road and Cleveland Ave.  My first thought was that this object was a small plane on fire trying to make the runway, although its current position and direction of travel would have made Runway 31 a better choice for an emergency landing, especially since there was no wind.      As I watched this orange light, I realized that it was not an aircraft.  There were no navigation lights, no landing light, and no anti-collision strobe.  It made absolutely no sound.  It was certainly close enough that I should have been able to discern wings, fuselage, and tai! l, had there been any, but it seemed to have no physical structure to it.   It was simply a ball of orange fire.   I could see variations in intensity on its surface and small flames shooting out from it in all directions, and at times I thought I could see some white smoke trailing from it, but very little.  It did not leave a trail.  The fireball was moving in a straight line, from southeast to northwest, and holding altitude.  I turned right off of Cleveland Ave and into a darkened parking lot on Maple Drive and got out of my car for a better look.    This part of town is well lit by orange street lights and single story buildings, but this is a commercial area and almost every store was closed.   There are no high structures in this part of town because of the airport.  There were no pedestrians around, but there was still considerable vehicle traffic on Cleveland Ave.  The weather was clear and warm, and there were no clouds.   I still had a good view of the fireball as it! passed overhead just a little to the south of my position and! continu ed flying to the northwest, making no changes in altitude, speed or direction of travel.  When I first saw it over Cleveland Ave., it appeared to be about the size of the full moon in the sky, but the moon had not yet come up.   There were no aircraft nearby, and so I had nothing to compare it to for an accurate estimate of its size.   It continued on its course, getting steadily smaller as it became more distant from me.  I watched it until it became nothing more than a pinpoint of bright orange light in the distance.  I estimate that it did not fade from my view until it was well past the Caloosahatchee River and over North Fort Myers, or perhaps even out over the Gulf of Mexico.   I do not know if anyone else saw it or not.   Page Field is a very active general aviation airport, lighted all night, with a control tower.  I don’t know if the Page Field control tower is manned all night, but if it is the air traffic controller must have also seen this fireball.    Also, the control tower at Southwest Florida International Airport should have seen it as it passed a short distance south of their Runway 06, but given the FAA attitude towards reporting any unidentified airborne anomalies, I doubt that anyone in either tower would have said anything.   Given the heavy use of fireworks by the local population in this area to celebrate holidays, it could have been mistaken for an aerial fireworks display, if someone were to take only a quick glance and not watch it for a while.   I am a pilot, and can with certainty state that it was definitely not a firework, nor was it a flare, balloon, meteor, comet or any type of known manmade aircraft with which I am familiar.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,26.58139708890637,-81.84065302911094

At 10pm California time I was listening to “Coast to Coast Am” and I was surprised to hear that there were as many as 200 UFO sightings around the United States with-in the same time of my Romania sighting describing the same type of Glowing Ball Sphere .. I think this is a very significant sighting especially because all were at near the same time and of same description of what I saw on this Web Cam  in Constanta Romania . I am very familiar with this particular area in Constanta Romania and there are several large lakes where this Sphere could have landed and submerged itself.  I have friends in Constanta looking for news reports about this large object.  I spent 2 months in this area living on the beach and I know many people were walking their dogs or jogging at this time and someone must have seen what I had seen . Last Summer I had dinner near the sea in Constanta and observed a glowing sphere about the size of a small car with multi colors in phasing mode  slowly moving up and away from the shore. I alerted others sitting around me and they all saw the same thing as it seemed to disappear into thin air as it got some altitude.  The manager of the restaurant told me that for hundreds of years in this particular area Spheres of lights have always been seen off shore from the Black Sea and the Sailors consider them friends.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,,

Primary observer is a former US Army Aviator with over 2500 hours of day, night and night aided flight time as pilot in command; trained in distance estimation, target recognition and target identification.  Primary observer is currently a senior executive in an aerospace corporation with over 25 years of aviation experience and exposure to aviation technologies.   Following dinner on New Year's Eve primary observer and wife (secondary observer) departed their home to walk their dog.  Neither had alcoholic drinks with dinner and neither are drug users.  There were children in the streets firing fire-crackers; as such a neighborhood security guard was parked near their house (third observer).   After greeting the security guard the primary observer noted two bright objects in the sky generally south of his location (round, orange lights, approximately 120 degrees from his location at approximately 300 feet above ground level).  The primary observer initially assumed these were fire crackers that were about to explode; they did not explode.   The primary and secondary observers moved off the paved road down a lake bank to obtain a better view.  The objects proceeded from their southerly location along a route of flight that was generally north at approximately 500 feet above ground level; approximately 1/4 mile from the primary observer.   All observers witnessed these round, orange objects in maneuvering flight and specifically noted that while fairly close in formation (50-100 feet separation) they were not connected by any visible structure. The orange objects were approximate size of a helicopter fuselage, bathed in orange light that is best characterized as appearing similar to molten glass or metal; with shifting degrees of brightness.  There were no anti-collision lights and absolutely no sound.  A third object trailed the first two by approximately 1/2 mile and then a fourth object traversed the same route; approximately 1/2 behind the! third.   The objects were moving at approximately 70-90 knots and took approximately 2 minutes to traverse from initial sighting (south horizon) to extent of viewing over a tree line to the north (probably four miles total).  All observers watched the objects proceed north until they were no longer visible.  They remained on the same courseline and altitude.   During the sighting the primary observer noted a twin engine plan on left base to final for landing at Sanford Airport ... approximately four miles to the northeast.  The reported lights and the airplane were well separated and it is likely that the airplane would not have seen the lights (blending with ground lights).  After the sighting the primary and secondary observers walked back up the lake bank and discussed with the 3rd observer the inexplicable nature of what they had all witnessed.  The secondary observer captured the event and video with her iPhone and that video is available upon request.  It is a good quality video.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,,

I was driving home, heading south on my street, just about to reach my residence.  Off in the distance, to the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon, I saw an *extremely* brilliant seemingly stationary object in the sky.  Distance unknown.  It was white, incredibly bright, and pulsed or twinkled...not unlike a bright light through a lens, or a distant twinkling star...except this thing was huge compared to what a star or planet looks like, and many magnitudes brighter...and it was still mostly daylight out.  I cannot emphasize enough the brightness of this object.  It was akin to Venus at its brightest on a clear night in the country, only it appeared so much larger than Venus ever does.  Without being able to gauge the distance, I have no idea as to its actual size.  It could have been anywhere from a mile away to several dozen miles away, but from my point of view it was about half the size of a dime held at arm’s length. As I approached the spot I always use to turn around, so I can park facing north, I stopped and watched the object for maybe 2 more minutes.  At no time, did it move or change intensity.  Even though it seemed way too bright, I kind of expected it to just be an airplane coming up over the horizon, directly at me, and that after a few moments the perspective would change and the light would look different.  I then realized I was sitting parked in the middle of the road, so I proceeded to turn around as usual, all the while keeping an eye on the object either directly or through a mirror.  When parked, now facing north, I continued to watch the still stationary object in my driver’s side mirror for up to another 30 seconds or so.  I then got out to take a better look, and in the time it takes me to open my door, the object apparently had vanished.  I did not directly witness it vanish, but I had only taken my eye off of it for a split second.  If it had been an airplane, comin! g up over the horizon, making it appear stationary, then I still would have been able to see the plane itself after the perspective of the light changed.  But there was nothing in the sky there.  Nothing coming or going...left or right, away or towards.  I also did not hear any airplanes or helicopters.  I continued to watch that spot and surrounding areas for several more minutes and did not see anything at all in the sky, anomalous objects or otherwise. There was a gentleman waiting at a bus stop about 50+ feet away.  We noticed each other looking southward, but being shy I did not go over and speak with him.  I wish I had now.

It is a clear night out. U can see the whole of the night sky.  Stars from horizon to horizon.  There was no visible jet, or any aircraft that i could see.  I began searching for FAA running light, hoping to use them to locate the source of the sound.  There where no lights anywhere.  I then began trying to use the complete star banket as a means of location.  When an aircraft moves through the night sky, it has to pass under the stars, thereby blocking some out as it moves.  There where no disturbances in the area that the sound was coming from.  As i was about to just go back inside, thinking it was just a high wind off up in the area above the tree line, the sound began to move at a slow but accelerating rate due north.  I again began to use the star light to try and locate the source as it moved.   It was then i saw a weird distortion.  Not a true blocking of starlight.  But more of a moving of the starlight, like it was being forced around something.

Hello.  I live in Bozeman, Montana.  On the night of March 27th, 2012, I witnessed what I am positive to have been a UFO.  I went outside on my deck at 10:45 p.m. to smoke a cigarette before going to bed and I looked up into the clear night sky as I usually do.  What I saw dumbfounded me!  As I was looking southward, toward the Hyalite foothills from my house off of College Street, I saw three lights, they appeared red and white in color, and they were in a long line apart from one another.  The lights were blinking simultaneously, the first one, then the second one, then the third one, in that order over and over. I opened my front door and told my fiancé, to please come outside to see what I was witnessing.  He came out and witnessed the phenomenon too and he said, “What is that?”   Then he exclaimed, “It’s a UFO!” We both watched as this UFO very slowly moved east, towards the MSU campus until it disappeared from our sight, approximately two or three minutes, it was all over by 10:50 pm. This UFO appeared to be at least a football field long in length, from where we were standing.  I know that the Hyalite foothills are only 8 miles from our place, so it was definitely in front of the mountains and it looked very close, like it could be right above College Street, which is only 200 or 300 yards from our house.  We watched the lights blinking and the UFO was completely silent.  We knew it wasn’t an airplane, the lights were spaced too far apart, and airplanes are not that big, also, helicopters make alot of noise!  Plus, I know the flight pattern for the airplanes that fly overhead to the Gallatin Field Airport in Belgrade, and this object definitely wasn’t going that direction!  He also ran back into our house and grabbed his phone and tried to take a video of this event but when he turned on the video camera it kept shutting down! If only we could have captured this on video, nevertheless, having lived in beautiful Big Sky Country Montana my entire life and being the avid “sky-watcher” woman I am, I have never experienced anything like this before.  I did call our local radio station, The Eagle 105.7 & 104.7 FM and the guy I talked to said that he also saw the UFO!  He said that it was triangular in shape and black in color.  I couldn’t make that out when I witnessed it, but it appeared BIG!  Anyhow, they did announce it on the radio.  I have yet to hear how many folks called in to say they saw it too.  I am a little freaked out by the whole experience, and I haven’t felt good since.  Maybe it’s the flu, but my headache won’t go away.  I have seen what I thought to be UFO’s in the past, especially up at our family cabin in West Yellowstone, but they were always pretty far away.  This one however, was too close for comfort!!  Thanks for sharing on this website and thanks to Peter Davenport for be! lieving in my story.  My fiancé is also going to post his view of the story soon.  I will be watching the Montana sky alot more!",2012-05-13T00:00:00,45.70981012145749,-111.05357489878543

I was driving home heading East on University Avenue on the West side of Madison.  I had my sunroof open.  I am a birder so I always have a pair of binoculars on my dash.   As a was coming down the road on a slight hill just before the state office building (Hill Farms) on the right, and the golf course (Blackhawk CC)  that begins on the left I saw a large object very low in the sky just ahead and to my left about where the Pyre Square Building and McDonalds are located.   At first I thought some helicopters were probably moving some large item but as I got closer it was not.  It was totally silent.  I quickly cross over three lanes of traffic to turn right onto Segoe Road to pull over and watch the object.  I grabbed my binoculars to look at it through my open sunroof.  As I was looking at one of the red lights the entire object just plain disappeared, no light , no anything.   I then spent the next 45 minutes driving around the west side of Madison trying to find it again and ! to find a good unobstructed viewing area.  It was so obvious that I saw something that when I got home I turned the news on since I assumed everyone would have seen it.  There was nothing on the news, nothing in the newspapers - I kept checking for a week or so. What the object looked like was a very large L-shaped thing with red lights on each of the corners.  I assume the reason most people did not see it is that just down the road a mile are many, many red lights on top of the building cranes at the construction sight by University Hospital, in addition to the red lights on top of University Hospital for the helicopter pad (Med-Flight).  So there are twenty plus red lights ahead in the sky as you drive down this road.  But all the red lights there on the hospital and on the cranes blink!   I am always looking up in the sky since I often see owls in flight at night..  I also spend many hours star gazing with either my binoculars or my spotting scope.  I always can see satellites crossing in the sky.  Recently I have been seeing movement in the sky that I do not think are satellites.  These star like objects are much brighter and move way more quickly and straighter that the satellites.  They have been moving from north-east to south, south-west.  I regularly spend many hours at night watch the stars.  About 13 years ago I was up in the Apostle Islands when star gazing one night I found three very small bright star like objects that were arranged in a triangular shape and kept moving around in perfect sequence in the triangular shape.

Moments later at the end of my driveway a red glowing orb popped out from the tree line it appeared to be around 100 feet above the tree line.  I quickly told my son to go up to the porch as this orb travels over the driveway towards us.  We watched from the porch as it slowly paraded over the driveway.

We were about 5 minutes from their home when I noticed a diamond shape of 4 red orbs in the night sky.  They were much farther away than planes or clouds, but much closer than stars.  I pointed the orbs out to my husband and both of us were confused about what we were seeing.  We arrived at my parents’ home, watching the red orbs during the entire drive.  When we reached their driveway, my husband ran inside to get my parents to come outside and look at what we were seeing.  I pulled out my phone to take pictures and got out of the car for a better look.  As I pointed my phone toward the sky I realized I couldn’t see the red orbs on the camera of my phone.  When I looked away from my phone and back at the sky, one of the 4 orbs was gone…there were only 3 left.  I decided to stare at the orbs and watch what they! did, rather than try to take pictures.  As I was staring at the orbs, each one faded out to black – they didn’t move around the sky, they just “turned off,” so to speak.  My husband and parents did not make it outside in time to see them…they had disappeared by that time, in a matter of maybe 2 minutes. I’ve been searching the internet for answers since this happened, but didn’t think to report the occurrence until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory on 06/20/12, when he discussed this happening more frequently across the country since June of 2011 – and he was describing something very similar to what we saw.

MUFON # 35024 (#1 below) MUFON # 34937 (#2 below)  Additionally, a Delaware sighting later that same evening bears similarity to the three observations in PA that night. NUFORC # S86669 (#3 below)  and, the previous evening, SW of the three PA sightings on 18 January,  a very similar craft was observed. NUFORC # S86663 (#4 below)  interestingly, reporter #1 saw a single craft the previous evening. I arrived home in the time-frame of the two below reports (~6:45 PM). As I backed into my parking space, I observed two sets of lights toward a mostly East direction. Initial observation indicated to me that they were a pair of military helicopters in the distance. I assumed this due to the fact that the 'choppers' were in a somewhat typical flight pattern. That being one offset and a bit higher/lower than the second. As I walked to my mailbox, I watched and assumed that they would be coming nearly directly toward/over me as this is the typical flight path for aircraft traveling East toward McGuire AFB / Lakehurst NAS. I have many low-level flyovers of military aircraft to these military locations.  I am approximately 40 miles from these facilities. As I watched, I realized that the craft were flying in, from my perspective, a more Southerly direction. This is a bit of an unusual flight path for low altitude aircraft. My view was obscured periodically by leafless trees and a couple of homes. As the craft traveled it became obvious that the direction had changed as indicated in #2 below. This direction change put the path coming nearer to me. I am NW of Philadelphia. As the two craft came into full-view in my South direction, and at the apparent nearest, I had an unobscured view for about 30 seconds. What I observed was different than those below. It was not until this point that I became really interested in the craft. This was my nearest observation of them. As indicated below, there was absolutely NO sound coming the craft. I observed what appeared to be two individual aircraft. The leading craft was lower than the following one. What I saw were four lights. Three white and one red, on each of the objects. There was NO symmetry in the lighting pattern. I saw no variation in intensity of the lights. Additionally, I am / was unable to put a shape to the objects in question. The position of the lights on the craft made no sense. The lighting configuration on both craft were identical. I first saw the craft at a 7 degree elevation (this elevation number is quite accurate) and 81 degrees toward the East. Utilizing the location information from #1 below and a distance of 19 miles from my location, would yield an altitude of 2.3 miles above witness #1.  I believe that I first saw the objects very close to the time as seen by #1 below. When the craft were nearest to me, the elevation was approximately 11 degrees. Utilizing the information from #2 below, that being turning West, distance from me to the objects would be approximately 2 miles. This yields an altitude of about 1/2 mile. Obviously, there is a problem here. I had the objects in view for some period of time. It was not beyond 10 minutes. Utilizing a 10 minute time-line and the distance traveled by the objects as seen by me, approximately 25 miles, yields a speed of 150MPH. Again, different than the speed indicated in #2 below. Although there variations in the observations, there is no doubt that all three observations were of the same objects during the same time period. What they were is certainly unknown to us. The flight looked 'military' in formation. Possibly some 'stealth' type plane / chopper. But who knows ?   #1 January 18th at 6:40PM Levittown, PA MUFON # 35024 . .(17th sighting information) . . .  On January 18th at 6:40PM I was driving in Levittown, PA southbound on Woodbourne Rd shortly past the roads intersection with Business Route 1, heading towards Trenton Rd. Above the residential section to my left, I saw two sets of three horizontal lights that appeared to be stationary to my left. One set of lights was slightly above and to the right of the other from my vantage point. The lights were the same as I witnessed the night before, but now there were two sets of them. I drove into the section to get as close to the lights as I could. At 6:41PM, I called a relative who resides in the section to look at the objects. As I got closer and towards the end of the residential section as it met Bristol Oxford Valley Rd, the lights started to move and again as had happened the night prior, the large sets of three horizontal white lights were no longer visible. The lights flew over the edge of the residential section and Woodbourne Rd ! in the Southwest direction. At one point I was only a few hundred feet from being directly under the objects. I could hear no sound being emitted from them. I followed the direction of the two aircraft as I headed towards my relatives house. I was now behind the aircraft. The structure of the lights resembled a cross or plus symbol with two white lights on the sides with two vertical red lights on top of each other in the middle. The lights were blinking. I arrived at my relatives house and we watched the objects fly Southwest towards Northeast Philly in formation from a window in the upstairs of the house. Approximately 5 minutes had gone by between first sighting them and their lights fading as they flew too far to see. #2 January 18th at 6:45PM Northeast Philadelphia, PA MUFON # 34937  Four family members, including myself, were walking returning home after grocery shopping in Northeast Philadelphia, PA at around 6:45PM on Wednesday, January 18, 2012. We first noticed the lights flying very low and close to each other back to back, almost as in a flight formation, with absolutely no sound. We could not make out a solid object around the lights that we witnessed. At first, both sets of lights appeared to be in a single horizontal line, with white lights on the sides and a large red light in the center. My son ran inside and grabbed his HD camera, and after zooming in, we realized that the large red light in the center was actually two red lights stacked one above the other. Because of this, the lights looked like the following • : •  Again, in the video footage (to be uploaded at a later date), the lights on the sides were white and the two in the center were red; there were two of these sets of lights, making for 8 lights in total. In formation, they appeared to be diagonally flying next to each other, with one on the bottom left and one on the top right. The pair appeared to fly almost directly over us and then drifted off towards the west, over neighboring Montgomery County, PA. The lights speed was slow, possibly traveling at 10 to 20 MPH. My son claims to have seen one of the sets of lights shoot up into the sky, while we saw the other one disappear beyond the tree line. I personally did not witness the first set of lights shoot up. What we witnessed was definitely not anything ordinary, especially since I am usually skeptical of UFO sightings. #3 January 18th (reported at 7:17 PM,  19:17) Lincoln, DE NUFORC # S86669  i saw blinking lights in the sky, & think it was hovercrafts.

As I sat in my studio, I was beginning to get ready for bed.  I emptied my pockets onto my desk and thought that I should go out side before my shower.  As this was the second time in a few minutes that I had thought about going outside, I stopped what I was doing, lit a smoke,  and walked to the back door, opened it, and walked onto the patio.  I noticed that there was a distant rumbling sound that seemed loud, loud  enough that I wondered why I had not heard it inside my house.  The sound was much like the sound of a jet engine, without the usual high pitched whine.  Just the low frequency component of the sound like an Atlas rocket at a distance, or maybe a Harrier jet.  I am a professional audio engineer, and have very good hearing. I'll also point out that I grew up in the Land Surveying business, working many years in that field before my mid 20's.  Since the security lighting had activated when I went onto the patio, I reached my hand back inside the door and turned off the light to get a better look at the sky.  Still hearing the rumble, I looked up to see what it could be. Above me about 60 degrees above the horizon, and due west, I saw an odd haze that would sparkle light, mostly white, with red and blue green. My first thought was that it was too low to be an airplane, and that it did not appear to be moving fast enough for flight.  The sound was incorrect for it to be a helicopter.  The lights seemed to twist and turn, with no discernible shape.  As the sky was otherwise clear, this confused me.  I noticed that there was an occasional brighter flash in red and then blue green.  The object continued to morph, and as I watched, it solidified into a shape.  It became an equilateral triangle with one end pointed directly south.  The object seemed dangerously close to the ground and just hanging there. With my right hand outstretched to 30 inches, the object was about 9 -12 inches on each side, and about ½ to ¾ inches thick. The lights appeared along the perimeter of the two leading edges, with the brightest areas at the middle of each of those two edges.  I noticed that the southern most tip of the triangle had a soft white glow, and that the remainder of the bottom was a dull dark matt finish. The light area did not appear to be illuminated, only contrasted to the rest of the surface.   Much to my surprise, the bottom was not flat.  There appeared to be two large rectangular areas, one on each side of the center line, and while one was along the axis of (very slow) travel, the other was at 90 degrees to it.  The rectangular boxes had rounded edges.  I remember thinking, that this was not a good aerodynamic shape. Another incongruity. Once the position of the object stabilized, the lighted edges were barely visible from my perspective, but the occasional brightening of the nearest mid-side light was red.  I thought, maybe they were FAA lights, so I waited for the next flash.  The flashing did not have consistent timing.  The next time it was green, and still hazy in a digital sort of way.  Checking the far side lights, I realized that they were also inconsistently colored also..  It was more like the lights were displayed as camouflage, something that would appear correct to the casual observer. Wanting to take a photo, I realized that I did not have a camera on me, and that in order to get a photo I would have to get back into the studio, grab my phone off the desk and turn it on.  By this time, the object was already 45 degrees south of my position and I realized that I did not have time to get to the camera, and I decided to just continue watching.  The object continued south and within a few seconds had moved to the horizon, the sparkle growing ever smaller and less distinct. I have some surveillance cameras located around my house, and I later checked to footage.  I left the studio at 11:15 pm CDT to go outside, and the event lasted barely 2 minutes.  I saved the recordings from the system and looked at it later, hoping that some more information could come from it.  The studio camera has an audio channel, but the camera over the patio does not.

At first I though it was a low flying aircraft. The constant orange glow and absence flashing wing lights triggered my curiosity.  The time it took for the object to track accross the sky was approximately 10 seconds.  What was particularly noticeable was the total lack of noise, it's dead straight line of flight and identical brightness viewed from front and rear (certainly not aircraft landing lights).  Having witnessed two separate similar events approximately two years ago my hairs on the back of my neck started to tingle.  Within a minute of this sighting I notice an identical orangey light ball approaching from exactly the same point in the sky.  It seemed to be flying exactly on the same track at the same speed.  This time l reached for a pair of binoculars.(8x30 Carl Zeiss).  The binoculars gave me a very clear view of t! he orangey ball.  The ball looked like it was a perfect sphere emitting a constant bright orange glow, there also appeared to be a very slight ultra violet iridescence glow similar to burning meths.  Having witnessed similar events three times now, I am still unsure if these balls are solid or gassious?   The local weather conditions at the time of the above sightings were a crisp cold night with extremely good visability.  Both stars and high flying aircraft were crystal clear to naked eye.  Each time I have seen these strange events they have been traveling at similar altitudes, my guess would be between 500/1000 feet.  My guess as to size would be about 1 to 2 metres or 3 to 6 ft in diameter (I could be completely wrong with these estimates, however it is what my eyes and brain were telling me each time)  The first time I witnessed these red balls (approximately 2yrs ago) I saw 2 balls traveling together in a straight line at a much higher speed in a southerly direction.  Two weeks later l saw a singular ball travelling - in a westerly direction!  I did speak about what I had seen to my wife and friends and decided drop the subject of conversation after feeling like everybody was giving me strange looks and suggesting I drop the subject. Since seeing the red balls in the sky last Thursday night I have done a little internet researching.  It appears these sightings have been going on since WW2. (check Foo Fighters see wikipedia). There also seems to be a significant increase in sightings just recently according to other UFO websites. I am 53 years old with a degree in physics and have good eye sight and questioning mind. It has certainly got me thinking!  If someone had told me the above story before I had seen it for myself, I would have thought they were barking mad. Maybe I should give up smoking in the garden and stay in doors!",2012-11-19T00:00:00,,

As I watched, I realized there was no break in the clouds – it was solid overcast and still raining lightly.  As I ran through what the object might be, I thought jet plane at first. It was much too fast for a small prop plane or a helicopter, but the speed could have looked like how a low jet might appear.  I don’t think it could have been a plane though, since it was only a solid bright white light – no flashing lights light an aircraft would have.  I thought it must be a satellite, but thought a satellite would be much higher, and above the high cloud cover.  Then, the thing that puzzles me happened. The object had been clearly visible the entire time, and was moving steadily, with no variation in the intensity of the light, or the direction or speed.

I am white, 55 years old, and retired from the Navy a little over a year ago after 22 years of service. My Top Security Clearance is still active, though I am currently fully retired and not working. I recently went on an Elk hunting trip with my brother who is 53, in the Boise National Forest.  On the night of November 2nd, we were camped a couple of miles outside of Centerville, Idaho in heavy timber country.  We were sitting around the campfire marveling at how clear a beautiful the stars in the sky were when you are out in the middle of nowhere with no city lights near you to hamper the view of the sky. I had gotten up to go and get something in the camper on the back of the pickup and was looking at the sky as I walked to the camper.  When I got to the rear of the pickup, on particularly bright star suddenly caught my eye. I can remember being confused when I first saw it and thinking, “what the heck is that”?   The light coming off the thing looked just about the same color as the light coming off all the stars, except that it was substantially brighter than any other star in the sky, including the North Star, and about every 2 seconds it would pulsate to a very bright dark red color.  At first that made me think it must be an airplane, but there was no green light at all and the movements this thing made were impossible for any normal aircraft.  Also, the brightness of the lights seemed to shimmer because of its movements. I stood there watching this thing for a couple of minutes and then yelled for my brother (who is a small plane pilot) to come look at this thing.  He came walking over, watched it for a few seconds and said, “What the hell”?  We watched this thing for a good 15 minutes make movements no normal plane of any kind could possibly make and at speeds that are equally impossible. I have no idea how far away the thing was from us. If I had to guess, I would say it could be anywhere from 60 to as much as 120 miles maybe.  There was no sound associated with it and it had 3 very definite patterns to its movements which I would describe in the following way.  Picture the little + in the very center of a rifle scope.  This thing seemed to have the very center of that + as the center point around which all of its movements took place.  The first was straight up and down and straight side to side movements along the axis of that cross.  The second was a circular movement all around the outside edge of the +.  The third was the most incredible of all. It would make diagonal movements in both diagonal directions through the center of the +, but when it made this movement is was 3-5 times longer than its straight up and down or side to side movements.  At the distance that thing was from us, those diagonal movements in particular had to represent a distance of mile! s and it would do it in a couple of seconds. Sure wish I would have had a camcorder with me, but at least I got to see it for myself and for several minutes.  It was pretty extraordinary and exciting!  Feel free to contact me if you would like, but I think I have pretty much covered what we saw!",2012-11-19T00:00:00,,

We were sitting around a campfire facing south when I looked up and noticed a group of 4 or 5 bright orange/red balls of light traveling north along the coastline.   At first glance I  thought they were fireworks as they are commonly shot off on the beach, the group was then followed by another group of approximately 6-8 lights traveling in a row at slightly uneven looking altitudes, the groups all veered  west directly toward the Gulf of Mexico.  There was no sound from them and they did not appear to be at very high altitudes, maybe 1500-2000ft, but quickly climbed higher.   Once they were roughly what appeared to be about a hundred yards south of the house over the coastline, they veered west into the Gulf of Mexico and within a few seconds would disappear.  I then thought this may be some maneuvers from! nearby Macdill Air force base.  Then, another group, this one more spread out than the 1st two appeared and followed the same flightpath as the others and disappeared with 5-10 seconds of veering west into the gulf from the coastline.  Then another group appeared and then  another, so I grabbed my camera and began recording them.   The whole episode lasted about I’d say 10 minutes tops with approximately 20-40 orange/red balls of light passing overhead.  Then several minutes after the last group disappeared a single ball came up (like a stragler) and followed the same route as the others. I was able to capture about 4 mintues on my video camera.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

As mentioned earlier, while my son and I were sitting in our backyard at 9:45pm facing south on the barrier island of St Pete Beach, FL, we observed several groups of orange/red amber balls of  light traveling north along the beach, then going west into the gulf and vanishing. I was able to video a few of the objects as they approached then veered off. Visibility was reported as 10 miles at the time of the occurrence with S/SSW winds of 5-10mph by NOAA during the time frame.  The camera I used to capture the objects was filming at 30 frames per second with approximately 12,000 frames of stills. Upon frame by frame analysis of the objects, they displayed unusual characteristics. The first set of lights were traveling in close pairs, one in front of the other or next to the other. The frames revealed the lights changing colors in fractions of a second randomly from red to blue, green, yellow or white. Also, a ball would randomly disappear in one frame while the ball next to it would not, then reappear in the next frame. The changing of colors  and disappearing then reappearing of the lights occurred throughout the filming and all the objects observed displayed these same characteristics. This was not visible while observing t! hem in the sky or while viewing the footage at a normal rate of speed. Additionally, later frames revealed other balls sporadically appearing and disappearing from frame to frame that were in the background of other light balls. Another set of frames shows 2 light balls. One remains stationary while the other one directly next to it  streaks west at an extreme rate of speed disappearing within fractions of a second.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

We turned left onto Emile Ave. and could not see the lights.  We turned right onto Osborne Ave. but the lights were hidden by trees.  I told my wife about them and we drove down Osborne and could see them to the north when we passed by houses without trees.  We turned right (due north) on Gelpi Ave. and could see five red lights in the sky in a roughly triangular formation.  They did not appear to be moving.  They seemed to be suspended and motionless in the sky. They were relatively high in the sky.  From our vantage point, I would estimate that they were between 30° to 45° up into the sky. We assumed that they were over Lake Pontchartrain.  As we continued driving north trying to find an unobscured viewing area, the lights suddenly faded and di! sappeared.  Disappointed, we turned around and headed home.  At this point, I looked at the clock on my dashboard and mentally noted that it was at exactly 10:00 PM CDT.  What was unusual about these lights is that they were above the normal flight path of planes landing or taking off from New Orleans International Airport.  We see jet lights all the time.

She ran out onto our back deck and yelled for me to come outside. We saw a bright, glowing object, mostly orange with some red as well, and the lights were pulsating. The lights would get slightly larger, then smaller as it slowly moved (slower than plane) across a small portion of the sky.  It's tough to say what its exact shape was, because the object's glowing lights were so bright...but it seemed to be oblong, with the lights glowing more strongly towards the middle and back of the object.  It didn't make any sound. It was heading in a southwest direction, but after a minute or so, it started gaining elevation at a quick rate, getting smaller, into a pinpoint light into the sky, and then disappeared.  At first, it was lower in the sky than most planes, but by the time it left, it looked as far away as a star.  I was amazed how fast it moved. I called for my husband to see it and he also said that he hadn't ever seen anything like it and it certainly wasn't a plane. I then asked my daughter how she first noticed it and she said it was first at the tree line level (near the top of some tall pine trees) and very large.  I asked her how large and she said it was huge.  It it looked like, in her words ""a huge, glowing lantern that was floating up over the trees.""",2012-08-05T00:00:00,45.4312,-122.7715

I disagreed and told them to look at it, I told them that it was orange and I have never seen a plane that looks like that. I then stated it did not seem to be moving,  they then wondered what it was as well. My roommate then noticed about a minute after the initial sighting that it just completely disappeared; we looked all over and could not see it at all in the sky.

These seemed to be slightly moving then all but one disappeared, about ten seconds later the last one disappeared as well.  I thought maybe the buildings could have been blocking my view but after we passed them there was nothing there.  The sky was clear with no clouds at all in that area.

This is a report of the craft I have seen flying over the area where I live.  I started to see things more and more as I started to look up more and more.  There are planes that fly above the house but I notice that there are a lot more things around than just a few planes flying over. Planes come from one area and keep on going in the same direction.  I have not seen but a few planes during the day and night but whatever the other things are, they are not planes.  Several times you will see a jet chase the other objects around the area and in circles until the object takes off and leaves the jet behind like its nothing at all.  A lot of times the other objects look like bright orbs that float in air. They set in a spot for a few hours then slowly move to another area.  They pass one another like playing chick but they stop side by side and then take back off again.  They come together in a circle then break off in different directions and fly out of s! ight then return a little later to do it again. Any time a plane passes by they follow it for awhile then drop back to where they were setting at to begin with.  Some look like a flying star but brighter, much brighter. There is a area back in the woods that are large sand pits where they lower down below the tree line and come back up several hours later. I have been back their but get a sick feeling when I do and hair stands up on my arms. I will not go back there anymore. They seem to be more and more over time and on clear nights. I have a lot of other objects with red and white flashing light that fly around the area a lot but they are much slower and normal just fly out of sight then return to the other direction hours later. I caught one on my camera during the evening and it looks like a flying star but with a jet chaseing it. I mean the jets are so close to the tree tops when chaseing these things that you see leaves fly up and the tree tops lay over. The bright orbs like to stay over the several sand pits we have in the area. They fly in circles over them a few minutes before either lowering down or moveing to the next one. One other the other red and white lighted crafts did the same and we know it lowered all the way to the ground because it left a stream of smoke like a jet from the ground up when it landed and took off. But this was different from the bright orbs. Several times the bright orbs seem to come from every direction and that’s when they all come together in a circle and s! et for a few minutes. Some times for a hour or so before backing up to form a triangle. Once they form a triangle they look to be connected to one another as they start to spin in a circle as a triangle. They spin around in a circle and slowly move in another direction. When this happens it is like a stopping point for all of the other crafts. Each one comes from another direction to meet up with the brighter one that formed the triangle and after meeting them it returns to another area to do it again. I can see anywhere from 10 to 30 in one night some times. I saw several in just a hour. I burn large piles of tree limbs and they seem to come out from everywhere when that happens. My mother is scared to the point where she will not go outside at night. When you see 8 or 9 flying lights over your head just setting there not moveing to much it is weard. I just need to find out what they are. Some look to be a sphere with lots of light from red to a white strop to even a green! lazer light. But I have called several airports and they said! that th ey have no where near that many planes in the air at night. I have seen about 4 land in the fields and sand pits in the area.

I've spent more than enough time investigating everything from homicides, to conducting relatively rare under cover investigations.  I'll elaborate more if further documentation is required.   I first want to explain why I have never reported or discussed this situation.  I'm currently a police office and served over 13 years; of those 13 years I have heard numerous encounters of ""suspicious circumstances"" among the local population.  None of these, however, have anything to do with what I have seen.   I currently live in the southwest area of Arkansas.  This area is home to the Fouke Monster, AKA big foot....  A recent television show included numerous people investigating areas that sightings have been made.  I'll be honest, I've hunted these areas on foot for over 8 years.  I've never seen nor heard anything that I can't explain.  Needless to say I'm not a man afraid of the! woods, strange noises or ... well ok I'll admit I am afraid of spiders....   So on to the topic of discussion.   I cannot give you the exact date.  I honestly have only spoken twice as of last night as to the event ever even happening.  I do not want to compromise anything by asking questions of the other person involved because we have never spoken of it.  I say we have never spoken of this situation, but we have spoken of it twice.   Neither time have either one of us spoken as to what we saw, when it happened. I can not recall the year, but I know it was late summer.  It was hot outside and the windows in my car were up.  I was driving an early model Chevy Nova 4dr car, maroon in color.  My friend, ((male name deleted)), and I were at a party.  We, for some reason, although it was alcohol related, decided to go 'big foot' hunting.  Well I loaded up a bunch of guns into the trunk of the car, took some more beer, and we left... en route to the hunting grounds.   This is an area that I don't exactly know where we were at.  ((male name deleted)) said we were in the Tiawishi River bottoms.  I've never heard that name or term before and still havn't.  So we went to where he said to go.  We were both drinking and having a good time as we headed to this area. Once we arived to the area, I knew, just by being on the roads, that this was an oilfield back road type of area.  I was driving and continued driving down these back oil field roads.  I do not have a time frame or amount of time that we were driving but I know that we were on an oil field road.  We did have guns, but they were still in the trunk of the car.  We continued driving and if memory serves me, and we came to a bridge.  Once on the bridge, I stopped the car.  I/we decided to stop the car to listen to the sounds from the woods.  We didnt't hear anything..... and that is when it happened. I lack words to describe the scenario.... We were listening to the sounds of the woods, it was quiet, not unusually quiet....  While sitting in the car a bright light appeared from the right side.  A light that was brilliant in color, and I can only describe as being bright as the sun and the same color.  There was no sound, wind, or anything else to make you believe anything was ever there.  This sphere passed from my right to the left in a steady motion while maintaining static elevation. Afterwards ((male name deleted)) and I left...tried to describe what happened to us... and I remember that nobody believed us.... To date I have spoken to ((male name deleted)) two different times.  Once in November 2012 ((sic.  2011??)) , the conversation was brief and non discriptive in nature.... The second was on 08/04/12.....  The conversation was joking in nature and I realised after he said that he has had nightmares about that night since. I don't know what we saw together that night.  I've told myslef so many times that it was swamp gas of sorts..... I'm open for personal interviews and willing to take poligraphs, or what ever else we need to do.... Honestly, I want to have an answer that it was just swamp gas and methane gas combusted with decomposition products. From what I remember it was just above the tree line, running in a directional path.  It never changed direction, speed or made any kind of sound,   If you would like to speak with me directly I can be contacted at ((deleted telephone number)).  I'm employeed for the past ((deleted--approximately two decades)) at ((deleted--law enforcement))..  I would like my information kept confidential. I've not spoken of the details of what I saw the night that I believe what I saw.  I have spoken to ((name deleted)) and neither were times that we wanted to talk about it... after a laughing incident the previous date I decided that since we havn't spoken about what we have seen and my understanding of interviews... this might be a situation that can be explained or debunked....  I believe it's probably just swamp gas, at least that's what i've always told myself! ((ADDENDUM FROM AUTHOR OF REPORT)) Dear Sir,  In reference to the sighting in east texas.  I spoke with with my friend y ((name deleted))  (XXX) xxx-xxxx).  I adivsed him why I was calling and that I wanted him to tell his version of events that happened.    I also told him that I did not know exactly where we were when the incident happened.  ((name deleted)) said we were on county RD 322 and turned right (or East) onto FM 1249.

While outside my workplace for lunch on a nice clear day with some clouds. I looked west in the sky noticing a long white saucer shaped object at about a mile or two away. This thing was directly west of our position Maybe at about 10,000 - 20,000 feet in altitude. I called a nearby Landscaper over to come see what I had been witnessing! He also confirm seeing it. As we watch it together in the sky It appeared not to be moving much, as we watched it passed 10 minutes. Also note : One side did slightly lift up . Like a boat on waves  I then ran into my workplace to get two more witnesses and binoculars. The two other witnesses could also see this unknown white craft AS IT DID HAVE SIZE. After using the binoculars to see closer. It appeared brillant white in color- long in length No other colors or markings could be seen. Still staying there near stationary. Now a truck driver pulled in and got out of his truck And was pointed out this white UFO still sitting in the sky. This now brought the count to four witnesses watching as well myself As we all continued to watch it wondering guessing to explain it ! This now being about 25 minutes when first seen. Was now starting to move quite slowly towards the north. I 'm guessing somewhere near over the Don Valley Pkwy.north. After another five minutes we all lost sight of it in the clouds. Needless to say : two witnesses thought it was a white plastic bag for an explaination The other two could not explain the object at all. Do plastic bags stay stationary in the same area of the sky over 25 minutes ? Even have such size at such a distance. This was a incredible sighting to witness  I can only conclude again a presence unknown again witnessed  I also noticed one hour later There were so many jets -every direction causing crosses in the sky. Thus the clear sky was now not so good in clarity as it had been earlier at 12:00pm",2012-08-19T00:00:00,43.77102833099579,-79.24512173913044

It was about 2:30-3:00am when we were going down 248 when my one friend sitting up front passenger side is staring up in the sky and ask me and my friend who is driving, ""what the hell is that?"" I did not thing much of it because he is known to joke a lot.  But after repeating it again with alertness in his voice i finally lean forward in between the front seats and see this massive disk flying low probably about 100-200ft from the tree line on the mountain right near the radio tower on top of the mountain. I would say this craft was about 50-100 yards in diameter. These were not only strange lights i saw, but i saw the whole undercarriage in detail due to the light that reflected from the treeline onto the bottom of the ship.  this ufo honestly was not of this world and seemed as if it was crashing due to a flame behind it a! nd its angle which seemed as if it would crash over this mountain next to 248. the craft seemed to be malfunctioning due to the fact that it would be flying along at an angle towards the ground, Completely vanish, then reappear in its normal path.  I could see the treeline on top of the mountain glow green from the underside of this craft which was emitting this light. On the underside there was inner rotating multiple lights with a big round light in the middle. picture a wide hulla hoop going clockwise and another hulla hoop going counter clockwise but with different colored lights.  I never had a feeling like that before and i will never forget what i saw. we were so convinced the craft crashed over the mountain we went searching for it but came up empty handed because we could not find the radio station where the craft was near. After this experience i could not keep my eyes out of the sky. for weeks after this sighting i noticed a large increase in helicopters around t! hat area which is uncommon because it is not a heavily populat! ed area. i would say about 10 helicopters patrolling this small area which struck me as very odd considering what i saw. i did not contact police because i knew they would just shrug off my call as a hoax, nor did i even know that i should contact anyone.

The air was clear, the sky was cloudless and a light wind could be felted. I was alone but it is probable that other people saw it. I live near a corridor often taken by commercial planes to land at Montreal Trudeau international airport; in the axis of the landing runway if you prefer. The object was taking the same corridor as if preparing to land on the runway to… But it was obvious than it was NOT an air craft – nether commercial, military, or a hot air balloon (or a children helium inflated balloon) – it was not affected by the wind like it would had normally done. The objet was perfectly spherical and divided in two vertically. The left – or front part- looked like well shined stainless steel.  The “rear part was light brown – or dark beige – a bit remembering leather. It size could be compared as a dime held at arm length. It flew a about the same speed and altitude than commercial plane, in total silence and was not affected by the wind – as a balloon would have probably done as I did said. Its direction was about east to west. I observed it for around 10 to 15 seconds. Ps.

I first noticed the craft as I walked past my son’s bedroom window on my way to the restroom, and it immediately caught my attention.  The object in the sky was triangular in shape and appeared to be a yellowish orange color. Almost the color of fire burning in the distance.  However this was not a fire. I know what I saw and I know without a doubt that it was a UFO.  To say that I am slightly unsettled at the moment would be the biggest understatement of my life.  The object itself was quite large and melted into the atmosphere faster than any mode of transportation we currently have here on earth.  The glow from it was very bright and even as it escaped behind several mountains I could still see the light glistening above as if it were right in front of me.   When I first looked out the window it was very large and fairly high in the sky.  It was high enough over the mountains that I knew there was no way this could be a fire, or vehicle of any sort.  However it didn’t stay hovering very long.  It seemed to descend slightly and then move North West a few hundred feet before moving upward and eventually dissipating into the night sky.

I have lived in rural areas my whole life and have never seen anything like this. I am familiar with airplanes and jets, and there is an airport north of my apartment, but I've observed several planes flying to this airport tonight and they were much different from this object, not to mention flying in a completely different direction. Tonight at about 8:29pm, I heard what sounded like an aircraft flying very low and approaching my apartment. The noise was higher in pitch than any aircraft noise I'd ever heard, but a constant whooshing hum. I went outside to see it, because it definitely sounded like it would be in my line of sight, and it was indeed.  The sun had set but the sky was still a light royal blue color, so I could easily make out the solid kite shape of the object: like a diamond, but with a flatter front and elongated back rather than equal sides and angles.  It was gray and had a number of white and yellowish lights. Several lined the front (maybe around 5 to 7), and one was at each corner, and a few of them (if not all) blinked. I believe the lights were shaped differently: some were rectangular while others more round.  The object wasn't extremely low, but low for an aircraft.  It was flying pretty directly east, and I couldn't tell whether or not it was ascending or descending, though it seeme! d to hold a steady altitude.  The object looked familiar to me (probably because of photos on TV of similar-looking UFOs), so I wasn't alarmed upon seeing it, but I was extremely curious and watched it intently.  As it passed behind trees and then the hills that blocked it from my sight, it seemed to turn slightly north.  Even after I could no longer see it, I could still hear it, though the sound decreased out of hearing at a constant rate (meaning it didn't abruptly cut off as though it had landed).",2012-05-13T00:00:00,40.3548,-80.23639999999999

The red light was at an angle and that is when I noticed it was not helicopter but a huge cigar shaped craft flying about 800 feet high.   I was so blown away by the size that I ran into house and grabbed binoculars to see up close and fell on the way out the back down because I was so anxious of what I had just seen.  I got out side just a s it crossed my house and it was huge maybe 800-1000 feet in length and 100 feet across. It was shiny metallic with what looked like faint row of windows at top running front to back. The most amazing thing was the rear end that had a square like structure that had the red lights reflecting through some sort of engine.   The square engine was huge as tall a my house which is 2 story and double the width. I ! looked a engine with binoculars and I was amazed again as this square structure appeared to be a structure that had a grilled surface or you could see through this open vertical lines going up and down as this was a vented power source.  The red light I had seen was lots of red protruding through these open grills.  The reason I had thought it was something hanging down earlier is because this light was reflecting out and I was seeing object from a horizontal view coming toward me and it was turning toward me. I am still blown away by what I saw . I researched online but did not seen any other reports except Nashville a couple days earlier. Maybe local newspapers Morristown or Granger county had something.   Also I forgot that I heard a low humming sound as maybe a powerful electrical power source.

I just wanted to share with you what I witnessed today February 1, 2012 . I work construction and I am currently on a job in the small town of Smackover  Arkansas. We have built a tower for a large vessel which is about 125' tall. I am the safety manager for the site and we had a computer radar showing a fast approaching thunder storm, as part of my job I had to make sure that crane booms where secure and workers on the tower were aware of the severe weather that was coming.  I also had to climb to the top of the tower to make sure all materials were secured from the wind.  Knowing I would have to go to the top of the tower and that the terrain in south Arkansas is very flat I took my binoculars (12 x 25) so I could watch the storm moving in. As I was looking to the west at the storm I noticed what appeared to be a reddish but almost pink in color, round object about 1-1/2 to 2 miles away but only about 500' above the ground.  My first thought was, what would ! a plane be doing flying in a severe thunder storm, but the orb was not blinking it was steady and unchanging and I new it could not be a plane.  It was moving at the same speed and direction with the storm.  After watching it for just a matter of seconds I saw another one of the same size shape and color about 500'  directly above the first one.  I tried to looking for them without my binoculars and could not see them, I did this several times. I was able to track them for about two minutes but only with the aid of the binoculars. I had a good steady rest so I could focus in pretty good.  The light was not a shining type but just a bright glow with what looked like a dark spot in the center of the round orb.  I eventually lost track of them when I had to come down due to the rain and lightning.  The size I can only guess to be no more the 3 to 5 feet in diameter at that distance since I could not see them with just eye sight alone. They stayed exactly one above the other the whol! e time as if they were under control, because I could see wind! sheer i n the storm clouds. I guess what puzzles me the most is the color and glow, I have never seen anything like it. I listen to Coast to Coast all the time and I figure if anyone has knowledge or might have heard of these types of orbs you would. Thanks in advance.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,33.333,-92.7545

This report concerns two  -  [2] sightings – within the confines of my bedroom.  •	The first incident occurred in December 2008. 	   While asleep at approximately 0230 – 0300 I awoke to the sight of about 4-6 white balls (the size of a Ping-Pong ball, swirling in a clock-wise motion and exiting my bedroom, through the venetian blinds which were closed.  	As one can imagine, I was mystified at the sight of those luminous balls of light, vanishing through the closed blinds.  	There was no sound associated with the incident.  I perceived no “communication” of any kind.   •	A second similar incident occurred at about the same time of the morning in February 2012. 	 I was awakened by the sense that something was happening.  I cannot describe the feeling, other than ‘something’ was happening.  	I raised my head from the pillow to observe one [1] single, white illuminant white ball, the approximate size of a Ping-Pong ball, ‘dancing’ up and down the entire length of my dog, which was sleeping on the floor approximately six feet from me.  The light reminded me of the sing-along ‘bouncing ball’ at the bottom of the television screen when a song is being sung with subtitles provided for the lyrics.  	I was astonished at the sight!  The light started at the dog’s nose and ended at the tail.  The light then vanished, and presumably exited the room.  The lights in the bedroom were - off.  I then drifted off to sleep.  	Within what seemed to be a matter of minutes, I felt as though I was now being observed!  I opened my eyes without raising my head from the pillow to observe the same white luminous ball now directly in front of my face, at a distance of perhaps 2 feet!  	When I opened my eyes the ball began to ‘dance’ from my head to my toes – the full length of 	my body.  There was no communication, there was no sound, and the light/ball seemed ‘programmed’ to do so, without any concern at being observed by me.  	The ball of light in both cases remained constant, without any increase or decrease in brightness.  All motion was constant and consistent in both cases.  	I had never before personally seen or heard of such a thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-07-04T00:00:00,35.2445,-80.5164

I live near the Mexican border in San Diego and I was facing south towards the horizon listening to my iPod when I notice a big green jolt of light shoot out of the horizon. It reminded me of something you see in Star Wars, the light changed from green to blue to purple, spreading across the night sky in a window shield wipe effect. I was so taken back from what I’ve saw, I stopped and looked around in the parking lot I was in and no one was there.  I saw a woman in a parked car and ask if she seen anything strange, but her back was facing from what I seen. She laughed and I laughed too (out of nervousness). I was still stunned from what I seen and trying to understand what I saw that lasted 5 seconds. As I was walking out of the parking lot and I saw two women who I passed by earlier while I was walking to the store. I asked if they so that light in the sky. They said they saw it also, I can tell they were scared and confused. We spoke for about 5 minutes trying to understand what we saw.  I went home still in disbelief. I know this wasn’t just some earthly phenomenon, something in my heart tells me it was something I will never understand. I tweeted what I saw asked if anyone in my city seen it. I got a response from some who lives about maybe 5 miles from where I saw it and she seen it too. I checked for the local news that night and no mentions and nothing from the Mexican news. The next few days I checked online and couldn’t find any reports. I tried to do some research of what I saw, but also couldn’t find anything close to what I saw that night.

This light however was different in that as it approached was a brilliant burnt orange and moved gracefully and silent towards my home.  As it came into view, it did not resemble aircraft of anything I am used to seeing, ie..Life flight, charter planes, 737's etc.  This light slowed and then hovered above my street, and was absolutely silent, it glowed a beautiful orange, appearing at first triangular in shape becoming  super bright then shrunk to the size of a small star in the sky turning bright white.  After a moment it resumed its original size.  It remained in a stationary position until I ran up to my front window to alert my husband who was in the house.  I was probably gone 3 seconds from where I was originally standing when I looked up and noted it had disappeared.  I quickly went for a walk thru the neighborhood and could not locate it.  I live on a bluff over looking the water and had it been a normal aircraft I could have easily caught up with it.  This one, however I could not.  In all honesty, I felt like it was merely observing, and for whatever reason I was able to see it.

I noticed orange/yellow pulsating lights ascending from the north/east part of the sky.  First I thought they were the street lights but there were too many of them and they were forming patterns, there were about 12 orange/yellow orbs. They were orange in the middle and yellow around them. They looked like pulsating balls of energy.  I watched them for for five minutes across the street before calling my wife. I told her to go outside and look east but her view from our home was obstructed and too far away.  They formed into two circle patterns and then broke away from each other and then reformed into two circles again.  I watched them for another 5 minutes and came home.  I grabbed the video camera and went back to the store, all but two had left.  I tried to record them but they wouldn't show up on the camera.  And then a few minutes later they both extinguished.   Also when I arrived back for the second time there was an ambulance and firetruck in the parking lot where I had seen them and the paramedics had loaded someone into the ambulance.  The orbs had been right over where the ambulance and firetruck were and I'm not sure if that was just a coincidence.  My feeling of the objects was just amazement and awe. After this happened I posted my sighting on the Mufon website. Well on November 7 I had another experience.  I was at the store the same store where I had first saw these orbs and went to swipe my rewards card and all 4 of the self checkouts simultaneously froze.  I didn't think anything of it but then about ten minutes later I was at a drive through restaurant and saw one singular orb, the same color and distinction as the previous ones.  I went to ask a group of people if they saw it too, turned around and it was gone.  Now this was bizarre.  When I told my wife she became concerned and told me that the only way to get rid of them is through prayer and she prayed that they will leave me alone.  Haven't seen anymore, but I am still curious.  I don't know what the hell they were.

Airport, and all four of us were quite certain it wasn't a plane, or a flare, due to its strange movement, seeming close proximity, the lack of landing lights, and no noise.  Airplanes do often track over our neighbourhood, so we are very familiar as to what they look/sound like, and they tend to follow the same track. After we studied it for a few minutes, it started to move again left to right, and then stopped again for a short time.  After stopping for a bit, it slowly diminished in intensity and winked out, but not before very briefly (1-2 sec) getting a bit brighter.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,43.46031845574388,-79.71625894538606

At first glance I thought why is this plane so red, then I notice that it began slowing down in way that seemed odd for a normal plane in flight across the sky and as the  blazing red plane became closer to view I saw a second plane coming clearer into view and then first plane began ascending higher into the sky.  I said to myself that it must be a helicopter until it became going further up into the sky than I had ever seen a helicopter ascend. I saw a neighborhood acquaintance that is in a wheel chair approaching and I called out to him to look up at what was happening. While we were watching the first plane ascend so high that it look like a red dot the second plane was moving up higher while moving in the direction of San Francisco it was at that time we could see a third plane approaching as if was on fire then all three were gone from view I was back into my apartment and the time was 11:50. I am so glad that I did not have that experience alone the two young men that so were also amazed at what we had just experienced. I had planed to visit with my friend and bring in the New Year with friends but I felt to hot inside and decide that I would return home after visiting only 10 minutes.

I hurried out, looking to the East/ slightly South with two grandchildren, aged 10 and 9.  We all saw three red lights in a line at first.  I would guess that the object was quarter of a mile at most away and very low to the treeline far past our neighbor's rooftop.  We have standard, rambler style homes, and this 'craft', at that distance, was at least half the length of their house.  It appeared to be moving about 45 degrees off the horizon (Can't see the horizon due to trees in the area, so this is a guess) and coasted smooth and silent, no jerky movements. Also, there were shimmerings of red lights that would appear along the 'edge' that faced me, though these were hard to see. The lights pulsed repeatedly, but they looked nothing like anti-collison lights on the aircaft we have seen thousands of times in our area. Within a minute or two, the lights took on a triangular shape that was huge. It seemed to pivot, and turn while slowly lifting the front edge as if it was a single large craft, or if it were several flying in unison, the back ones lifted up.  At any rate, the entire group of lights slipped to the South East and apparently down into the Auburn Valley area. I attempted to record the sighting, but since it was dark, the video from my cellphone doesn't show much. In between the very excited yelling of myself and the elder grandchild, there is a noticable silence.  Any aircraft that we have seen would have shaken the house at such a low altitude and proximity. There is also a report on the MUFON site that almost exactly mirrors ours, case # 44199 from Kent that happened two hous after ours and to the North and East of us.  My son submitted his report last night after we saw it, and the MUFON site had not yet been contacted by the people in Kent that also saw it.

Light traffic.  Well lit – businesses and street lamps.  Weather was cold and cloudy but there was a clearing in the night sky – by the time I arrived home (appx. 7 mins. After sighting, it had clouded up again).  I saw two objects very high in the sky.  What caught my eye was the brightness and the color.  I pulled over to get a better look through my moon roof.  What I saw was inexplicable in terms of anything else I’ve ever seen in the sky.   Both objects appeared identical although one was either much smaller of much higher up – appearing less than half the size of the other.  They were pretty much dead overhead and I had to crane my neck to watch them. The closer (larger) was the one I got a pretty good look at.  It appeared to be triangular in shape with softened – almost blurry, slightly rounded edges.  The objects stayed lit the entire time I watched and there was no blinking at all.  There seemed to be a little bit of variation, however, much like a candle flame if it could be encapsulated into a triangle shape.  It appeared to be lit from within with no individual light sources that I could see.  Actually very pretty – glowing red with a lighter orangey-red/yellow on the edges.  The objects seemed to be about 70% red with the lighter color at 30% divided between the three sides.  In addition, there seemed to be an oblong shape that bisected the triangle lengthwise.  It appeared to be lighter in color – similar to, but a little lighter than the orangey-red yellow of the edges.  This gave me the impression of being somehow more substantial than the rest of the object.  This was not visible on the smaller (further away! ?) object likely because of the lack of detail at that distance. In terms of size, I had the impression that these were large objects seen at a great distance rather than small objects seen closer.  If I were to hold a dime up at arms length, the larger object would have approximated the size of the dime.  If anything, somewhat smaller. When I first saw the objects, they were perfectly still.  Just “hanging” there.  At some point, the larger object began a trajectory in the South/Southwest direction at a very slow speed.  This prompted me to move my car because it had moved to a point behind a tree.  While driving to the corner, I frantically looked around to see if there were any other witnesses but I didn’t see any pedestrians and traffic was moving normally.  It was at this point, I looked again and they were gone. There was no sound that I could discern – just normal traffic noises.   At first, I thought this might be an airplane on fire but the entire plane would have had to be engulfed and it would have had to remain stationary in the air while it burned.  This while an identical airplane also burned at a higher altitude.  So, I don’t think it was that!  Also, flames would have motion associated to them and this just glowed.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,41.3729,-74.6407

On the night of April 22nd, 2012, around 9:00pm, I was looking at the moon with binoculars, and noticed a bright red/orange flashing/flickering/pulsing light. It was much brighter and larger than other stars, so I figured it was a plane or something like that. But I can recognize a plane's green and red blinkers, and it's steady movement; this was not a plane. The color was distinctively bright dark red, and bright orange (it would seem to alternate between the two, but definitely red and orange could be discerned clearly). I looked at it for a few minutes, then realized it was actually moving slightly, and would temporarily completely vanish for a moment, only to reappear at a slightly different location. This process of 'pulsing' red/orange and 'vanishing' to re-appear close by continued for a few minutes. The very last time it vanished, I could've sworn i saw it 'release' some sort of a trail, similar to a meteor tail, but it was a red-streak, and bent slightly. I was simply amazed at what I had just seen, so I kept looking at the sky, but eventually clouds moved in, and the object never re-appeared. I went online to do some research the next day, and sure enough, one lady in the area has caught it on film and uploaded to youtube. (unfortunately, the video is of poor quality and hardly shows a faint but bright red light flickering slightly before disappearing)  I've contacted this person, and I found out that she was looking in the same direction, at the same time I was. My brother claims to have seen the light return the next day, although I wasn't in the area at the time, so I can't confirm this. Interestingly enough, both Texas and Georgia also reported bright orange/red lights around 9:00pm on that same night. I am under the impression that this object may have been the very same, headed for the Gulf, giving each state a different point of view.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,26.70504529494382,-80.13514009831461

On May 19, 2012 at approximately 9:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, I walked outside on my back deck.  I had gone outside to let a pet out. We live in a heavily wooded area that is separated from other houses and not close to any city lights. Our property is on an elevated part of the land and our deck is elevated.  I looked up, just above the pines and only a couple hundred feet in front of me, I saw a very bright red/orange pulsating light that was obviously not the norm.  As I was backing back toward our back door, never letting the light go out of my sight, I was yelling to my family “come here quick and tell me what the hell I’m seeing”. Four other family members ran out beside me, and everyone stood totally quiet... and watching. The pulsating light changed from a deep red/orange to light orange in color with each pulse. It pulsed at a very regular rate (like a heart beat). When it was the deep red/orange color, the shape was a three-tiered hour glass shape and as the light would change to bright orange it would illuminate the whole object to appear like a bright orb. No sound could be heard, no emissions came from it.  It sat totally still in the sky (as if it was allowing us to observe it… or was it observing us?). I tried several times to get a picture from my cell phone, but it wouldn’t process it. Then we could see three other lighted objects approaching from the southeast about 4 miles away. The first object then shot up at a 45 degree angle to completely disappear in a clear night sky in 2-3 seconds. Our view of the first object was never obscured as it left. The second object stopped at the exact! same spot as the first, paused briefly, and then shot off at light speed like the first one. This continued for a total of eight pulsating globes. We each stood there talking so quickly to each other because we were so astonished at what we had just experienced. Each one was giving their account of what they saw just to validate it. About 5 minutes passed when a family member said “look, here comes another one”. Indeed...another approached from the exact same direction. We could see it through the trees at about 4 miles away. It took about 3 seconds to get to where we were. It paused in front of us right where the others did, moved up slightly (as if it were making a correction) then took off at a 45 degree angle and disappeared as the other did. I contacted our local airport and spoke to the director of air traffic control for Gwinnett County. He stated that they did not get any unusual reports that night. When I shared what we all saw, he said that he could not think of anything in our airspace that would fit that description. Two days later, we had unmarked military helicopters that circled so low you could read the name badges of the pilots (if the windows weren't blacked out). This activity continued at different times of the day with as many as three helicopters at at time, for about a week. I was able to catch a couple on video as they stayed below the tree line. I have lived many years near Hartsfield Airport and now Gwinnett County Airport. I have attended many air shows, flown in personal and commercial planes, been around military aircraft, hot air balloons, weather balloons, and an assortment of other flying or floating manmade crafts. The pulsating objects were about ½ to ¾ the size of a football field, could sit perfectly still in the air without making any sound, had no emissions that could be seen, traveled from 4 miles in 3 seconds to light speed, and did not have any conventional shape that I have ever seen. I can say without hesitation or doubt that the objects we watched that night for about 20 minutes were not from our world. Where they came from or why they were here may never be known, but I do feel that this is just the beginning of these types of sightings. I have seen unusual things around our area for four years now, but this is the first time that I have had witnesses to back my experience. It is strange to me how people don't want to believe or even hear about this. I come from a scientific background and would love to know what these are and how to deal with future visitations. This has nothing to do with faith or religion. You may keep both, but should realize that on our tiny planet we have such diverse forms of life with many not yet discovered. Surely you could see that in the vastness of our universe, life also exists...no matter if we haven't discovered it. However, I am certain that they HAVE discovered us.

Also, it had a different glow to it, almost like it was oscillating differently or something. Something stood out about it, and I almost crashed as I pulled into the grocery store parking lot. I got out of my car and my eyes were glued to it. I didn't care that people were walking around me, probably thinking I was a mad man. I just watched it. I found a star near it as a point of reference and in about 2 minutes it traveled around an inch in the northern direction, after which I noticed it fading. The oscillation was also changing and it's vibration was reducing as well, so it wasn't like it was just turning a light off, it was getting farther away.  At first I was just amazed, like how could this be happening? It got smaller, then exponentially like it was traveling away from earth until it was too far away to see. I'm just amazed. Is there any logical explanation for this?  Something explainable?  There were no clouds in the sky, and if it had have been atmospheric, the dim star I used as a point of reference would have also faded, and eventually the bright light would have come back, but that was not the case. In the past I've gotten really excited, my heart has started pounding when I saw something I thought was a space ship of some type, and then I see that it's a plane or a helicopter or a wedding party has released lanterns or something, and I feel embarrassed.  This time I just kept my composure and it blew my mind. I've never been so sure that what I saw was the real deal. Is there any way to check if others saw the same thing as me?

I thought to myself, how unusual is that? Having watched satellites transverse the sky on countless occasions I had never seen two travelling together.   From my vantage point to the point in the sky they were about 1” apart but clearly moving together.  They seemed to travel slower than most other satellites I had observed but I surmised this was because of their unusually  high altitude. (which I suspected was higher than all the others I have seen).  As they moved toward the NW and  the sun was still below the horizon I could see the reflection of what looked like a silver thread appear between the two satellites, lites, ufo’s or whatever you want to call them.  At first not believing my eyes I carefully studied what I was seeing  with great interest for about 1 1/2 minutes until I could no longer see the objects or the! thread connecting them as they moved out of view. I was left with the impression/conclusion that what I had seen were two satellites connected by  some kind of tether, cable etc. It was clearly glistening in the sunlight from over the horizon.   After some further thought I surmised that perhaps it was some kind of space experiment reminding me of the unsuccessful shuttle experiment with the tether to create/capture inductive power in orbit. At the obvious high altitude of the objects, the distance of the tether connecting them had to be immense since I could perceive it as approximately 1 inch in distance from my vantage point. It was an interesting observation and I am pleased I could share it with you, Best Regards.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,43.6273,-70.9075

We looked up and saw a few lights fairly close.  They looked to be on two edges of a triangular object.  They looked to be in conical shapes hooked to the edges of the object.  One light turned off and back on a few times while we saw it.  There was not a regular pattern or timing to the flash of this light and only one of them ever went out. It didn’t seem to be very large or very far away and it was completely silent.  Airplanes did pass by and were further away though we could still hear them and their lights blinked regularly and were red and bluish.  The lights on this object were a bright bluish white.  It seemed to move almost like it was drifting (like a balloon), but then it would stop, and hover before continuing on in another direction.  I took a video on my iphone and a few pictures before we got in my car and followed the lights to another spot, trying to get closer where we took more video and photos.   We went to even a third location where it seemed the closest, descending and stopping, hovering almost right over us before taking off and rising again, heading back toward the original spot we saw it. We tried following it back but lost it as it was so low against the skyline and other lights were so bright.  We are not sure what it is but we just want to know what it was.  We are upset we lost it and were hoping to see it again.  At times it seemed aware of us and coming towards us, but I never felt any threat from it.

I was driving on Interstate 91 in Massachusetts, just before the Vermont border.  I was in Bernardston. It was just before 1 am and I was driving in my car I had just gotten last month.  As I was driving, my light behind my radio display caught my eye because it went really dark and kept flickering between off and barely on.  The lights on my dash were acting funny too, as were my headlights. This snapped me out of my highway daze, as I had been driving for an hour and “in the zone.”  Mind you, this is a new car—this obviously isn’t normal behavior. When I began paying attention again from this I caught sight of a green light to my right in a sort of valley. I was in the traveling lane towards the guardrail, and the land appeared to dip there.  What I saw shocked me—it was what I can best describe as a floating piece of abstract art. Next to my car, it was massive, but in terms of Hollywood UFO sightings, it was very small. Nothing large to make those sorts of cropcircles you see in the news, either—very small next to those, but big next to my car. It was about five to ten feet higher in the air than my car’s roof was and was extremely close to me and low to the ground, again, in the valley. There was a guy driving in front of me and he was the only other driver around, and he braked and flashed his hazards so I know he saw it, too. Up close, it looked like it had a sea foam green sort of paint job on the belly, with precise lines and evenly marked. It was probably a three-foot-high green under border wrapping up the pieces jutting out from it. The rest was a dark chrome/silver. It had between four and six green lights that were darker on the outside of the circular shine, and a lighter shade in the middle. It had weird rectangles sort of prodding out, and odd tentacle shaped pieces. Think of the Grinch’s mountain, and flip it sideways curling up, and more of a gradual slimming of shape. This too had the border and there was a green light on top of it. this was the section I focused most on. The rest of the craft blurs in my mind; I focused on this and remember thinking it looked like a mish-mosh of shapes that somehow flowed smoothly together. I stared at it in absolute shock for a few seconds—and then the lights pulsed. The lights were not in a perfect line—some were up, some were down, some in the middle of the craft. The lights pulsed brighter, dimmer, brighter, dimmer, and then suddenly the craft was far away. It went north. It paused in the distance, and then vanished in a second. At this point, I’m honestly freaking out, wondering what I just saw. Again, I am in the travelling lane, and the thing I just saw was on my right over the valley. The valley ends and I’m driving, not a full 30 seconds have even passed, and a coyote comes flying out of the grass on my right side. I’ve never seen a coyote, or any animal ever run that fast before—it was white, with a yellow tint to it. Think of a white lab—that color.  I had absolutely no warning and it appeared just a few feet in front of my car, racing, not being chased and not chasing anything, no other coyotes around (and don’t they run in packs generally?) and I had absolutely no time or room to react. I was forced into hitting it, going 65 as I was on the highway. Again, I have a new car—it’s a sturdy car. It hit so hard that my front quarter panel went flying off. I called the cops right away fearing for the poor coyote maybe still in the road and to report the incident. The cops showed up and couldn’t find this coyote I hit going 65 anywhere. Whatever scared it scared it so bad it couldn’t stop running. I hit hard. My quarter panel was way across the other side of the highway.  In order to tell the cops my location,  this all took place around the 48th and 49th mile marker on Interstate 91. The valley is within the 48th, going northbound, and I hit the coyote just before a merging area on the 49th. I can’t help but feel these two cases are related. I told the cops about what I had seen and they totally dismissed me and even started talking to each other over me, acting like I was a crazy person. I had just hit an animal, it was 1 am just about, and I was shaking harder than I ever shook on my life—they probably assumed I was on drugs. Whatever the case, they totally dismissed me and I’m not too excited about that—people tend to not take you very seriously about paranormal happenings. Now, I’m extremely anxious being outside at night, especially when it’s clear out. This event scared me terribly—I’m far more upset over the UFO than the coyote, though I feel really bad for the coyote. Looking back, I also wish I had the radio on. I had a CD playing and turned it down when I noticed something amiss. I wonder if that would have been affected.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,42.6906,-72.5832

I'm almost afraid to ask.... do I want to know?  I feel it in my body but my mind wont let me think it's true.  Here is what I felt.  Just before I fell asleep, I heard a ringing in my left ear, it startled me into full awareness. I totally woke up, I don't know why.  It took me a while to fall back to sleep.  I think this is because I read that this happens sometimes when people are taken.... so, could it of been a dream?  My mind thinking about it?   After falling asleep, I felt like I woke up but couldn't move..  I forced my eyes open and standing in my bathroom, in my line of vision was---- a grey I think.  short, thin, large head, black almond eyes, large eyes and I could see another in my peripheral vision.  The one in the door of my bathroom, it almost seemed like he was in charge... he was still and silent, very small movements... a light sway here and there.  He was intense, but I had the feeling he was friendly.  He didn't scare me, but I felt he was the one that was controlling my not being able to move.  I have the feeling he was the one that made me feel calm and after I panicked and became afr! aid, I think he is the one that gave me the feeling of euphoria.  He was in the shadows but I remember him clearly.  I was surprised that he was so short, maybe slightly taller than my door-nob I think. As I was laying down, I didn't have to look up to see him clearly.  I quickly closed my eyes and told myself I was dreaming.  I don't know how long I stayed like that, it felt like only a minute.  It was like I could hear them thinking.  The second one, he moved quickly.  He is the one that frightened me, he is the one that has the sing-song voice. I thought he was singing in my mind,  I don't know what he was looking for but I do know he was going through my stuff... I only remember one thing of what he said, but I don't know what he ment by it, I remember hearing the words or impression of ""bad baby"". and that disturbed me.  Last september, I went through a 4 or 5 day period of time... I knew I was pregnant.... I knew it.  When I was laying down and I rolled over, I felt the sharp painful pull of the muscle holding my uterus.... sounds funny, but I only had that when I was pregnant and the weight of the baby made the muscle pull, it started in my pregnancies at about the 5th or 6th week and always got worse the bigger the baby grew.  I al! so had a heaviness or a fullness in my uterus. I kept talking myself out of it, I finally got around to taking a test and it came up negative, but I could of sworn I was pregnant.  After talking with a friend and putting a few time lines together, I think they impregnated me. My friend said it usually only last 3 - 5 days.  I was happy I wasn't crazy and sad because I don't know if I will ever meet my child, is it my child?  I carried him, so I feel like it's my child, even if it was only for a couple of days.  Anyways back to last night. when he said ""bad baby"" it upset me because I thought that maybe something was wrong with my baby. At this point,  I still feel like I cant move.  I didn't want to see them so I closed my eyes.  That's when I got the weirdest sensation, I was floating, rotating around above my bed.  I was scared this whole time and yet not scared or maybe just this feeling of calm, this deep, deep sense of calm. As I was floating--- how do I explain this--- you know what the pressure you feel when your lying down, that softness of your bed when your really, really tired and it feels so soft and comforting and solid? That's how I felt all around my body.  This soft wonderful pressure surrounding me and it was nice.  I felt no breeze as I floated but I could feel the sensation of turning.  Then I was back in my bed, I was more aware again and thinking of ""bad baby"" and then I heard a moan and thought it was one of my girls. I felt an intense protectiveness and became upset. I wanted to protect her but I couldn't move. I felt an intense fear came over me.  I told them no--- or thought the words, it was like I could hear them with no noise.  I felt panicked, then suddenly I got this rush of euphoria.  I was covered in it. I could feel it everywhere in my body, I tingled with it, I could feel myself smiling, even laughing in my head.  It was wonderful. Then it was like the ""heaviness"" that surrounded me left, but I felt so good I didn't want to move or it would go away.  My body felt heavy but my mind told me to move, so I started with my hands and as I wiggled my fingers I felt the euphoria leaving my body, going up towards my face, which still tingled.  When I stood up I felt unsteady and a heaviness in my limbs, but I still went to check the girls.  They were all sleeping.  I tried to go back to bed, but I felt surreal and when I just lay there I started to cry.  I don't know what to feel, I don't know what to think, I don't know if it was a dream or if it was real.  So I decided to write it all down on my computer, but when I turned on my computer, it made a series of low tone, loud buzzing noises, twice in a row.  I've never heard it before.  I'm really tired now so I think I'm going to go back to bed. I don't know if I like this. I feel a little fear to go back to sleep and that's stupid, if it wasn't a dream... they wouldn't come back again... and yet at the same time I don't feel fear... I think because I believe that no matter what, I am God's child and He is watching over me and because He is God, they were created by Him too....  Weird.  I do know that I have that image etched into my mind...  of him standing in my bathroom doorway just looking at me... dream or real... I wont forget that.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,31.200200000000002,-97.9921

I woke up at about 4:10am on 10/12/2012 because Venus and the Moon were supposed to be the closest together on this date. When I woke up, I noticed a third ""planet."" I thought it could’ve been Jupiter, but then realized it wasn’t located at that point at that time I rested for a few minutes then checked on the third lighted object again (still in the same place). This was in the eastern sky. I got out the binoculars and looked at the third ""planet,"" which turned out to be an aircraft. Just in the sky, motionless. Then it flew south maybe around 4:18-4:20am. There were two-three circular lights on the bottom of the aircraft (white lights) and a sky-blue blinking light toward the back of it. I started to, now, observe the sky with the binoculars and noticed multiple flying objects (which appeared very small) with red and white blinking lights). They might have been commercial flights but seemed to be moving slowly and not so steadily like a commercial flight would. They seemed to also slow down and ""sit"" behind some of the cloud coverage on an otherwise clear night. All in all, there were probably about 10-12 flying objects (but 5 or so could’ve been commercial/international flights). I looked out at the lake now, and in Chicago there are water sanitization stations in the middle of the lake. I noticed two-three objects around one of the stations (through binoculars). The lights did not look like boats (they were not red/green) they were white flashing lights and one had three lights that would light up and down (not as a boat would), and were small. They were out there “surrounding” the water filtration station for 2 hours (until 6am). After that, I don’t know, because I went to bed. At one point, the large brightly lit object (that I had first thought to be a planet) came back, this time from the north. It stayed in the sky and hovered for a couple minutes, then came over my head (I was located in a tall building). It was brightly lit, lights were under the object – so hard to make out the shape (it seemed to have maybe 5-6 circular white lights on the bottom and a sky-blue flashing light too). However, there was no sound whatsoever. My background includes growing up in Chicago, where I attended good schools. I work about every day, so my sleep schedule is sometimes off. I’ve always loved looking at planets through binoculars and have a natural curiosity toward the solar system (even though that is not my career focus).

The objects at no point in time made any sound whatsoever.  The objects were located above the ocean approximately 2 o’clock with respect to the horizon. The visibility that night was clear with a backdrop of clouds and stars.  The objects appeared to emit/disappear into the clouds themselves as though they were integrating themselves into the clouds when they turned on or off. Timeline:  1)  First minute of viewing: I observed one fireball stationary in the sky hovering for about 15 seconds appearing as one fireball.  During this time the fireball appeared to morph into a brighter red color giving birth to another fireball directly to the left of the first one creating two fireballs.  The second fireball morphed/gave birth to the third fireball.  The term gave birth to can best be described as originating from the first, then the second, and the second making the third.  For a total of three fireballs lined up horizontally. 2)  Second minute of viewing:  The three horizontal fireballs drifted into the 12 o’clock position in the sky, the other off to 3 o’clock, and the third moved up to 9 o’clock position.  The three fireballs repositioned themselves again and appeared in higher or lower positioning moving at a med-slow speed several more times staying in approximately the same area of the clouds but with different formations.  Then, the fireballs were observed to become integrated/dispersed into the clouds themselves as they disappeared into the backdrop of the clouds. 3)  Third minute of viewing:  The three fireballs came back on in completely different positions in the sky one at 10 o clock, the other at 5 o’ clock, and the other 11 o’clock.  The objects appeared to move up/down/side-to-side repositioning themselves in the clouds and looking as though they became absorbed by the clouds themselves. 4)  Forth minute of viewing:  After the lights went off they came back on within the span of about 2 seconds.  The three fireballs were located in completely different locations (with respect to before).  The objects appeared to move up/down/side-to-side repositioning themselves in the clouds before going off for the final time.

This sighting occurred on May 10, 2012 an hour or so after sunset in Cambridge, MA.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of an acquaintance's car on my way home from dinner when I first noticed a peculiar bright light descending from the sky. Aside from its gradual vertical descent there was no horizontal movement; the object did not appear to be heading in any direction except for straight down. This was particularly notable because there were airplanes in other areas of the sky during that time by which to compare this object, and while the other airplanes were headed in more obvious directions (toward or away from Boston Logan Airport just a few miles away), this object was altogether different. It was a bright white, spherical object that did not blink as most airplane lights do.  At a certain point the object stopped its descent and merely hovered there for several minutes. By this point I was in shock, and I watched this object for the entire duration of my car ride home which was just under five minutes. When I got out of the car near the Cambridge/Somerville line I noticed the object split into three smaller bodies of light.  The three objects began flying away together in a triangle flight pattern, only to break it a few minutes later to fly around freely. They made sharp turns and seemed to be flying around a certain area near my neighborhood. By this point I was running down the road at top speed trying to record what I was seeing on my phone's video camera, but unfortunately the quality was terrible because cell phones simply can't film these kinds of events when it's pitch black outside.  I ran into my apartment to retrieve my partner so we could go out together, but by the time we got outside 10 minutes or so later I couldn't find the objects again. I have been checking over and over for reports of this online with no luck which I find to be very shocking because prior to breaking up into three separate aircraft, the single body of light was so bright and moved so strangely in the sky I couldn't believe no one else had said anything about it.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,42.36679527248851,-71.09546408404465

Also the white cloudy fields that made the triangle line configuration would slightly dissolve themselves but immediately return their shape and consistency while craft was in motion turning over a flipping over.

I noticed something moving in the night sky a crescent shaped object moving north, no lights, or sound. I did notice the dim lighting of the lights from the location below reflecting, illuminating the object.  The area is suburban, to give you an idea of the lighting I’m speaking of. My observation was 30 to 45 seconds, and then the object Turned West seemed to maneuver into a horizontal flight position, so I assume what the crescent object was doing was the banking maneuver. At this time I lost visual contact. I was not thinking of what to use as a guide to accurately measure the size of the object. I do live close to an airport, where daily military F15s have runs.  I can say that what I saw was flying lower than the usual fly by of the jets I see during the day and what I saw was definitely bigger by 10 to 15 feet. Did I see a drone?

I was looking east when I noticed a bright orange/red light in the sky.  Upon a second look I noticed two more identical lights.  The lights were aligned like the 3 points of a triangle.  I could not see a solid object between the lights but the way they moved together made me believe they were part of a solid object. The lights were above the tree line and appeared to be very close to me.  I was worried that while I was sitting there the object/lights were going to fly over my house.  They appeared to be much lower than an airplane would fly.  I would estimate that they were approximately 100-200 feet in the air, maybe higher but definitely below the light cloud cover.   I remember thinking that when the object flew over, it was so low that I would be able to see all the detail and that frightened me. The lights were gliding very slowly, not wavering from their position in the triangle and moving in a westerly direction.  The lights were circular in shape and were about 5 times brighter and larger than the brightest/largest star in the sky. I watched the lights for about 10 minutes as they moved west, toward me, then they began to slowly fade until they appeared no brighter or larger than the average star. I wish, in retrospect, that I had grabbed my camera but I was too scared/in awe to go get it while the event was happening.  After the lights faded I immediately went inside and woke my husband but it was too late, they were gone. I am a 30 year old mother of two with a 4 year degree from a reputable university.

It was a strobe flashing light of white, green, red, and, blue lights all in random order. You could see the light shimmering in the sky, so to be sure it was not a star I went and got my rifle scope.  After staring at it through the rifle scope I noticed orange lights gaining altitude on the horizon.  These lights then connected into the stationary light.  It then got very bright for a split second as the lights intersected.  The orange lights then began to rise vertically. The lights then began to start moving towards my direction.  As it was moving I noticed it was in a linnear pattern of four orange lights with a strobing white light flashing beneath it.  As it continued to move I then looked at it through my rifle scope and saw the lights then transform into a triangle of 3 orange lights with a white light on the bottom. It continued on its course and as it passed, it made a strange ""voooooooooooom"" noise in a deep low octave. About 3-5 minutes pass.. I returned outside to smoke another cigarette while I called my friend in Georgia, who has seen alot of UFO activity in his area.  While I called him I saw another light similar to the initial strobing light of multiple colors -- begin to rise from the horizon and then after a minute or two  It disapeered. Side Note - When I first sited the initial light I ran inside to tell my dad and brother I saw a UFO, and my brother watched as the lights intersected and the orange lights began to fly and change formation.

Our home sits at a higher elevation where one has a view over the neighboring homes from the second story.  As the objects passed over our home, the girls ran downstairs and yelled for me to get out on the back deck. I ran out onto our deck, looked up, and immediately noticed 2 bright red-white glowing objects at about 80 degrees overhead moving silently in a E-SE direction.  They appeared to be at about the same altitude but the object on the right was slightly ahead of the other.  They held the same spacing as they continued to travel over the treetops away from the house (maintaining the same course). As they moved farther away, the one on the right seemed to get smaller faster and then disappeared.  The one on the left continued to be visible for about another 15 seconds and then also disappeared.  Just prior to disappearing, the glow seemed to move slightly in an upward trajectory before vanishing. The objects were not airplanes as there were several planes visible at the same time in the clear night sky (higher altitudes and different locations).  There were no blinking lights, just a constant colored glow.  The objects were also extremely large compared to the planes flying beyond them overhead in the night sky. The objects had a brilliant red/white glow (bright like a flare - but not a flare as there was no trajectory... just a straight steady movement from west of our home, overhead, and then eastward until gone).  The light was not from a jet engine as the brilliant red-white glow was the same when the objects moved towards us from the west, over, and away from us towards the east.  Both wife and daughter said everything was the same in appearance from the window looking out the front of the house as from the deck on the back of the house... other than at some point over our house the third glowing object vanished. The size of the objects when I first saw them from the back deck were about that of a quarter held at arms length.  As they traversed away from the house towards the horizon, they got smaller to about the size of an an aspirin held at arms length before vanishing. Shortly after vanishing, beyond where the glowing objects were last seen, I noticed a lighted object streaking across the sky (right to left) at about a 45 degree angle upwards (horizon towards the atmosphere).  It was just visible to the eye and I lost track of it behind some trees. There was no noise associated with the objects.  They were definitely closer than any planes but there was complete silence in the air. Shortly after vanishing, beyond where the glowing objects were last seen, I noticed a lighted object streaking across the sky (right to left or SE towards the N) at about a 45 degree angle upwards (horizon towards the atmosphere).

When I went back out, I glanced to the northwest and saw two orange-red colored lights.  They were moving inline, with one light following behind the other, and heading almost directly over our small town. The weather was cold and foggy, but the fog had lifted to a low cloud ceiling.  The lights were traveling in a west to east direction, and were beneath the clouds.  They were moving steadily and I noticed were completely silent, no sound at all.  These were clearly not aircraft lights, and were larger than aircraft lights would appear at that distance. When the lights were almost directly overhead, the lead light appeared to turn and go straight up until it disappeared into the clouds.  The second light followed just past where the first light went upward into the clouds.  It seemed to stop, and backtrack slightly, before it too went straight up into the clouds. I checked the weather recorded at the Pullman/Moscow Airport  15 miles to the south, and they were recording an 1800 ft cloud ceiling.  Given similar conditions, I would estimate these lights when I first saw them were traveling around 1500 to 1800 ft above my location. I do not know what these were, but I am almost certain these were not airplanes, helicopters, fireworks or meteors. Due to them flying almost directly over our small town and their low altitude, I had the feeling of possible observation?",2013-02-04T00:00:00,46.8885,-117.155

30-35 Orange bright lights fly silently in line across Sacramento sky and disappear in same place - New Years Eve,West Sacramento,CA,2012-12-31T23:59:00,fireball,25-30 minutes,"Occurred : 12/31/2012 23:59  (Entered as : 12/31/2012 0:00) Reported: 1/2/2013 9:03:39 PM 21:03 Posted: 2/4/2013 Location: West Sacramento, CA Shape: Fireball Duration:25-30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95762.html,"30-35 Orange bright lights fly silently in line across Sacramento sky and disappear in same place - New Years Eve On New Year’s Eve my husband and I, and our friend were traveling home to West Sacramento from Old Sacramento (a touristy area in downtown Sacramento). We were planning on watching the midnight fireworks but there was a shooting and they were cancelled. It was perfectly midnight when we had just crossed over a metal bridge into Southport where we live. I spotted a group of bright orangish lights (my husband says a warm orange-yellow). They were traveling from the southeast to the northwest. It became clear right away that they were not moving like any airplane or helicopter we had seen before. I asked my husband to pull off onto a side road. We got out of the car and watched as about 4-5 crossed above us.  When they got just past us overhead they would disappear. Then another three came from the south.  They disappeared in the same place. Unlike the ones we saw later, these first ones appeared to be in a vertical line (not straight though) Almost like the  bot! tom ones were connected to the top ones and hanging there. Picture an old fashioned mobile. As the others joined them the line became horizontal.  The lights were luminous. As they all disappeared we got back into the car.  We were discussing what we saw and agreed they emitted no sound. There were no blinking lights, just a continuous glow.  We turned back onto the main road and went up a couple streets to the entrance to our neighborhood.  We got about 3 blocks into our neighborhood and saw a new group of them coming.  They were in a straight line, moving relatively slowly but not maintaining any static speed.  Some appeared to stop momentarily as another would pass it up.  They would all reach a point in the sky just south of Downtown Sacramento and just disappear.  When they were all gone we got back in the car and drove another 3 blocks to our home.  As soon as we got in I ran upstairs to the master bedroom which looks south. I opened the curtains and found a whole new bunch.  There were a lot of them.  We watched for 10-15 minutes. They w! ere in a long line. They all disappeared in the same spot.  To me it looked like they veered to the east and disappeared (maybe their light then focused in an easterly direction making it look invisible us) but my husband and friend disagreed and said they went up. Hmmm.  My friend got on the phone with 911 as we were watching but they thought we were nuts (thought we were seeing fireworks). I was so frightened by this that I could not sleep for hours. Let me add that the light from these things did not seem to come from one point; it seemed to emanate from the whole object. We are on the flight path of Sacramento Intl. Airport for Southwest Airlines from L.A. We also can see flights take-off from Sacramento’s Executive Airport. We are well aware of what planes look like and how they travel. We can safely say that the point south from where they became visible to us is at least 10 miles away, probably closer to 15. I have just learned there are such things as Chinese Sky Lanterns. I ! have never seen these but I would have to say that these lights were very large. Very much larger than any light from an airplane!! They also traveled a great distance for a floating candle light and also they all disappeared at exactly the same place. We all agreed that they were about 1000-2000 feet up. So, tell me, what do you think? We three are convinced we watched UFO’s that were being intelligently and purposefully controlled. We are all very educated. My husband is a college professor, I am an environmental scientist at Cal/EPA, our friend has a BA and is an educator. Before New Year’s Eve we had never heard of these orange-red-yellow things. We have since learned they are being seen by many.  Thank you for listening.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,38.65568145161291,-121.6169435483871

Whilst watching the New Years Fireworks from my 2nd story which affords me a good southerly view I noticed two orange lights flying in sync along the southern horizon. I know what aircraft look like as my home is in a flight path for PDX airport. My interest was piqued as the lights differed from the planes that I see as they were not red or white but orange.  First the two objects were flying east to west in a formation which seemed quite strange i.e one of the lights was low on the horizon and behind the other light that was higher up from the horizon, plus they seemed to be flying at a fast speed, not zipping across the sky at an unfeasible speed but faster than planes tend to go . Another brighter, whiter light that I took to be a plane flying along the normal South to North air route for Portland International airport was flying to the West of the orange lights and didn't garner my attention until it started to fade out,  I don't know how but it was there then started to diminish and was gone.  At this time the lower light was no longer there (I don't know how it went it just wasn't there anymore) whilst the other kept along the east west path it was on and too faded out of my view. Then I saw another light that seemed similar to the two previous orange lights much lower on the horizon, for about 20 seconds which then dropped away from my view beyond the horizon. Shortly after this a plane one with the white and flashing lights came into view and flew an arc westward over towards Portland City Center.  This gave me the impression that the other lights I saw were quite a ways off and going much faster than this plane. I viewed the orange lights through my binoculars and did not see the red and white flashing lights that planes normally have.  It may be that they were aircraft that did not exhibit the normal night time lights, but these had no flashing lights on them, were in a formation and seemed to be moving fast. I wanted to put this up as I am intrigued to see if any other folks saw this or have an opinion on what I saw.

We were facing east when we saw a large, bright, orange light.  The light was stationary and did not change size, shape, or color.  There was no sound associated with its presence.  The coloration was similar to that of a street lamp but more intense.  The light was bright enough that it emitted rays.   It was overcast so we were able to tell that the object was under the clouds. There was a full moon so the sky was illuminated, but we were not able to see an object that could be emitting the light.  In relation to the moon the object was far down and to the left.  If the moon were the center of a clock face the object would have been located at the ""7:30"" position.   The object was located approximately halfway between the moon and the tree line. The object was stationary for a long enough period of time for us to notice it, stare it at it, discuss its oddity, and photograph it.  After about one minute the light vanished leaving no trace of its presence. I am a nineteen year-old female with one year of college completed at the University of West Georgia.

My girlfriend and I were on the way to purchase a few tickets. We pulled into the local gas station parking lot and through the sun roof a brilliant light was shining, almost floating in our direction. We both saw it and I commented to how it was flying very low.  It was not a plane as we saw planes, indicated by blinking lights, flying in the back ground. After parking, instead of rushing to buy lotto tickets, I was curious and wanted to see if I could hear the motor flying the mysteriously bright light.  I  could hear nothing, and I've been known to have keen ears.   My girlfriend and I were just looking at it when I noticed Venus next to the moon.  I know it was Venus because i used a star map app to find out.  As I focused on Venus, with the app, my girlfriend looked away from the shining object. An instant later the brilliant shining light was gone.  I wanted to put the object in the app but no suck luck. We were also out of luck when it came to winning the lottery.

After what we saw last night, I have to tell someone.   We were sitting outside in our yard.  My husband was facing me, so his back was to the outside and I was sitting so that all I could see was him and our yard.   All of the sudden a large glowing ball rose up from the trees.   I must have had a shocked look on my face because my husband asked me what was wrong, and I told him to turn around. It was big, it looked close (but not too close to be scary), and it was an organish - yellow color.  It looked as if it was glowing. It also looked like it was being propelled by a flame.  The oddest thing is that it made NO NOISE - that's what actually got my husband spooked, he kept saying over and over that something that big and close would have to make some type of noise.  It continued to rise, slowly, from the south and as it rose in the sky, it did get smaller.  It was a cloudy night and both my husband and I were shocked we could see it as clearly as we could.  It started to head north, and it disappeared into the sky the higher it got.  It moved pretty slowly the whole time.   We did video it on our iPhone, but it's not good footage, nothing that could be used.  All you see is a small dot and you hear my husband and I discussing how strange it looks and that it makes no noise. I'm so curious to know if anyone else saw it.

Never seeing a UFO before this is a first for me.  I went outside last night at 11:30pm.  The moon was very bright and as I looked up to see it I noticed something very large off to the N.W. of the moon.  Approximately about 1 oclock.  It was circuliar in shape with a yellowish glow around it.  Their were lights on the outside of the glow all around the object.  Blueish in color to me.  Wondering what in the world was I looking at I thought perhaps my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I watched and it appeared to be slowly drifting away from the moon but hovering.  The outside lights seemed to be flickering.  I was wondering if it was a space shuttle or satelite.  As I watched it I noticed the outside lights seemed to be moving and changing the shape of the object and it appeared to be getting trianglular in shape when I noticed something shot away from the body of the object.  Then the lights slowly went back into a circu! lar shape around the object.  I went inside woke up my significent other to show her to make sure I wasn't seeing things. She thought perhaps it may have been a planet with the sun shinning on the backside of it giving it a glowing appearance.  I was so convinced I was looking at an object in the sky that I called 911 and reported it.  911 transfered me to the Sherriffs department here in Lane County and I reported to them what I was witnessing as we spoke!  I was still watching the object.  By this time it had drifted a bit further away from the moon and down around 5 oclock.  The Sherriffs office said they would document the report.  After hanging up and still watching the object I went in and grabbed my Kodak with a 12 power zoom lens. I was careful to keep the moon out of the picture because of the brightness and began to shoot a few pictures.  The object was so high in the sky that on the photos it just appears as a very bright light.  I watched the object change shape! very slowly but always returning back to the circuliar object! .  After 30 minutes of watching the object I returned to my house.  I could'nt help but believe that maybe it was a planet with the sun shinning on the back side of it making it appear to glow BUT that didn't explain the lights around the outside of the glowing and moving on the left side with what appeared to be another object leaving from within the body of the object then the lights going back around the circuliar object.  As I stated I've never seen a UFO in the past however this was something significent and I didn't imigine what I saw.  I hope I explained what I witnessed in enough detail for you to understand, and I did report it to the Sherriffs office who claims they would document the incident.  I am curious if anyone else has reported this sighting.  If so please contact me.  I also would like to know if anyone has seen an object that has done such a movement as I witnessed.  At times it did seem to get larger in size and I remember thinking to myself is this thing moving! lower causing it to get larger in size?  I wish I could describe more detail for you but honestly don't know what I saw.  I am convinced that it was some sort of a craft though and not a star.

Sitting on my patio with an unobstructed view of the north, south and western sky, I noticed an extremely bright flash of white light that appeared to be 6 to 10 miles away at an estimated altitude of 6,000 to 8,000 feet.  The pulses of (only) white light occurred about 10 to 12 seconds apart and lasted for about a second.  There was nothing visible at the site of the flash after each burst of light. The bright blue daylight sky was mostly clear with a only a few small clouds scattered out of my direct field of view.  The flashes caught my attention because they were so much brighter than the landing, strobe, and navigation lights of any other air traffic that was visible nearby at the time, or that I normally see during daylight.   I live near an airport, and the Long Island Sound and am familiar with most of the air traffic that traverses the area. I assumed that the first flash might have been caused by a momentary reflection of the sun off an aircraft that wa! s changing direction. I dismissed that assumption after I observed the second flash continuing on the same heading. I expected that this aircraft was approaching me with an ultra bright strobe, and that it would become visible as the distance closed. It was not until the fourth flash, that I realized that the flashes were moving away and gaining altitude. After about 8 flashes, I lost sight of it.

At about 10:45 pm I opened the curtains of the living room in order to use the remote lock on our automobile’s ignition key to lock the vehicle as it sat in the driveway of the home. Momentarily after closing the curtains my 9 year old daughter asked me “Dad, what were those blue lights?”  Thinking that she had simply seen one or more of the yard lights near the storage barn(s) on the property I told her such.  She then replied “No, that’s not what I’m talking about.”  At this point we went back to the window, pulled back the curtains and, sure enough, there were two blue lights that appeared to be located above the barn / equipment shed located northeast of the home.  These lights were distinctly not the above-mentioned yard lights and, I would estimate, were located approximately one-quarter to one-third of a mile from the home and probably around 800 – 1000 feet in the air.  The location of the barn / equipment shed would be approximately 200 feet northeast of the home.  The lights appeared to be moving in a southerly direction that would cause them to pass to the east of the home. The color of the lights is best described simply as blue … no off colors such as sky blue, baby blue, etc. … just blue.  Wanting to get a better look at the lights, my daughter and I immediately stepped out onto the porch of the home and watched two blue lights transit from north to south at a distance of about one quarter of a mile to the east of the home.  It was at this point that we noticed what was likely a helicopter accompanying / following the two blue lights.  The helicopter was distinct from the two blue lights that it was trailing in that we could observe at least two navigation lights (red and green), a flashing / strobe light (white) that would illuminate a portion of the aircraft / helicopter body, and we could easily recognize the characteristic engine and rotor noise of a helicopter.  In contrast to this, the two blue lights did not flicker or flash, were not accompanied by any other lights, did not change colors, did not illuminate any visible structure around them and did issue any noise … or at least any noise that was perceptible above the noise of the helicopter.  As the group passed to the east of the home, it appeared that we could get a better estimate of the relative positions of the helicopter and the two blue lights as well as their speed(s).  Again, the group was still in the range of one-quarter to one-third of a mile in distance and probably 800 – 1000 feet above the ground.  Viewing the formation from an approximate right angle to the direction of flight, we observed the helicopter trailing or following the two blue lights.  All three were at the same altitude.  One of the blue lights led the formation, the second blue light trailed the first by approximately 500 - 750 feet, and the helicopter trailed the second blue light by another 500 - 750 feet.  All three were moving to the south at the same speed, which I would estimate as the normal speed of a helicopter … perhaps 120 to 150 miles per hour.  Once the helicopter and two blue lights transited behind the side of the house so that we could not see them, we went back into / through the home to the deck on the south side of the structure.  We then observed the helicopter and two lights continue their flight to the south with the same speed, height, direction, and formation described above until they passed from view behind the trees located a short distance (several hundred feet) to the south of the house.  The helicopter and lights were probably three-quarters of a mile distant when we last observed them.  As we were observing the formation from this vantage point, I consciously made an effort to try to discern or distinguish any noise emanating from the two lights as distinct from the noise of the helicopter.  The reason I tried to do this is that I realized that, given the radial separation of the helicopter and the two lights from this observation point, I should have been able to distinguish any noise from the lights as opposed to noise from the helicopter.  I could not do so and the only noise that I heard appeared to be coming from the helicopter alone.  Again, I would note that it simply may have been that any noise that might have been emitted from the two blue lights could not have been heard over the noise of the helicopter … but it was at this point that I should have had the best opportunity to hear any noise from the two blue lights.  The entire observation occurred over a period of approximately 45 seconds to one minute.  In terms of atmospheric conditions, it was overcast at the time of observation with a relatively low ceiling that I would estimate at perhaps 4000 – 5000 feet. Although it is difficult to say for sure given that we observed this at night, I don’t believe that the two blue lights were part of the structure of the helicopter nor were they part of a single structure.  My impression is that each blue light was independent of each other and the helicopter.  Also, I wouldn’t characterize the flight formation as a helicopter chasing the two lights but rather it appeared as if the helicopter was escorting the two blue lights.  I also recognize the difficulty of accurately gauging distances / heights / speeds in a night sky but I do feel that the estimates that I cite above are fairly accurate given the close proximity of the observation. My guess is that there is a conventional explanation for what we observed.  Nonetheless, I find the number of unusual characteristics of our observation sufficient enough to make an effort to submit a detailed report to this database. I have no doubt that I observed a helicopter.  But I am a bit puzzled as to the nature of the two blue lights that we observed in front of the helicopter.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,39.2591,-96.3007

I was passing a school located at Rhode Island Ave. & Q St. NW.  Coming from behind the school, I saw a bright light high up in the sky moving south to north.  At first it looked like an airplane because it was moving in a slow, slight line.  But the more I looked at it the less it looked like an airplane.  The light had an orange color to it and was getting brighter and then dimmer over and over again.  As it passed overhead, it started to dim and then finally disappeared altogether. Right before the light disappeared, another light came from behind the same school.  This second light was completely identical to the first in its flight path, speed and quality of the color.  It also dimmed and then disappeared at the same place in the sky as the first one did.  It’s difficult to estimate how far each one traveled as I watched them.  But they were far up in the sky so they easily could have covered 1,000 feet of distance. Neither of these objects made any noise.  For a second I thought they might have been helicopters because I heard a helicopter motor just as the second one was disappearing.  But then I realized that they weren’t because the helicopter noise was coming from behind the school (the south – where the object had just come from).  In fact I briefly saw the lights of the helicopter come from behind the school to confirm what I was thinking.  It didn’t follow the flight path of the lights as far as I could tell. I continued to walk and got to my street within about 10 minutes.  As I was walking down my street, I looked back in the general area in the sky where I had seen the two lights.  To my surprise I saw a third object that was completely different than the first two.  While the first two objects were high up like an airplane, this object was lower, about the height of a low flying helicopter.  It was moving in a straight line from south to north.  It’s difficult to describe its appearance because it had no discernible features.  If you can imagine a large plastic grocery bag (about the size of an SUV) flying through the air and changing shape in the wind, that’s how it looked.  Unlike the first two objects, it didn’t have any kind of light to it.  It was a white object that was visible due to the ambient light of the city.  It made no noise even though it was not too far over the rooftops.  I watched it travel for about 500 feet until the trees of my neighborhood obscured my vi! ew.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,38.907575087012276,-77.02499886426087

About two months ago my husband was awaken in the night/early morning to a VERY bright light.  He jumped out of bed thinking someone was in our driveway and shining their headlights in our windows. He went out into our family room and was shocked to find the entire house was lit up with a whitish, bright light.  There was no noise associated with this light and it was like it was coming from the sky.  This light lasted long enough to wake him up and for him to go into another room and realize that it was not what he initially thought.  The next day when he told me, I was thinking that it had to be a car or something, but we didn't talk about it any further and shrugged it off.  Later that day I was talking to a neighbor friend and casually and half jokingly asked her if she saw a bright light last night. She gave a humorous response so I explained what my husband saw.  She than told me that 3 or 4 years ago she saw the same thing. it woke her up and she tried to look around her house and outside to see what it was and figured it was something in the sky.  When she went to work the next day she was talking to her co-workers about what she saw and a lady that lives 3 towns over, East Burke, saw the same thing. Well, sometime between April 1-April 5 (we honestly have not been keeping track so we cant remember what night it was) my mother, who was visiting from AZ, was lying awake in her bed and all the sudden there was a bright light that lit up the room. She thought something was wrong with the barn light, but then realized that a light would not have lit up the room like that, plus the light was coming from the sky.  She laid there waiting to hear a helicopter fly by, but there was no noise with the light.  That morning she came downstairs and asked my husband if he saw the bright light. He immediately got goosebumps and said no, but I know exactly what you are talking about. He explained what he had seen prior and also what our neighbor friend saw. We didnt go any further into discussing it besides making the obvious jokes. That brings us to the last ""sighting"" that is now making us question what the heck this is. Our neighbor friend came over yesterday and told us that her husband fell asleep on their couch watching tv the other night when he was awoke by a bright light. It lit up their room and he got up and looked outside thinking there was something going on outside. He mentioned it to his wife the next day, but didnt seem to interested in discussing it further.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The light was too bright to have been landing lights!!!!  I also tryed to tell myself it is explainable.  I have no idea as to what it was. And I was thinking. Somebody else had to see this.  I decided not to call police. Now a few days after experience I went on the net to see about weird sights in Maryland sky's. Was shocked to see that other reports and the same sounding object I had witnessed. That is how I found this web site to report this. Did not know one ! could do that.

Three orange fireballs were clearly visible moving in what appeared to be a southern trajectory, although it may have been southeast or southwest. The lights would have been near the eastern city limits of Billings Heights. As we watched the first three crossing the sky, more continued to come into view, as several large trees blocked part of the sky from our sight. I counted at least ten. Most of them seemed to be moving in a line with each other, althrough three of them formed an irregular triangle formation. At one point two of the orbs came close enough to eachother that they appeared to touch, before swirling around eachother for a moment. The lights all made their way across the sky, eventually fading into some cloud cover. The entire incident lasted less than 5 minutes. The lights would best be described as orange fireballs. Their size was quite a bit larger than any star or planet would appear, and they were clearly visible even though night had not quite fallen and the sky was still fairly well lit. There only appeared to be the singular orange source of light for each light. There were no additional or blinking lights that might suggest an airplane or helicopter.

We observed and noted the Big Dipper constellation. I then noticed a bluish light a bit larger in size than the stars making up the Big Dipper. I asked my girlfriend if she saw it and confirmed she did as well. We both observed this light move from East to West over Sacramento. It blinked on and off about every 5 seconds.  There were no visible clouds at all. This ruled out the blinking of the object to be from passing behind clouds. We heard no sounds at all overhead. The object moved from just under the handle of the Big Dipper to above the star Arcturus in about 20 seconds. We were able to figure out that it was Arcturus using the Google Sky Map app on my girlfriends phone. It then continued across the sky another 10 seconds and then changed direction in a right angle turn that appeared to head downwards as if coming to an abrupt stop and then descending. The object appeared to descend for about 5 seconds and then disappeared entirely.  The time durations are based on the blinking interval that seemed to again be every 5 seconds. The object was nearly invisible to the naked eye and would only be seen every 5 seconds when it emitted a bright blink or flash that was bluish in color. It was like tracking a firefly flying across your backyard. I noted the time of the event after first seeing the object by checking my watch.  It was a full 11 minutes before the ISS was supposed to transit the sky at 3:46am for that Lat and Long as confirmed by spaceweather.com. I do not believe it was the space station. There were no meteor showers anticipated for the evening either.  I have seen ""shooting stars"" and this did not match what I have seen during meteor showers.

By the time I got my camera set up the trail had shifted in color from red to green and blue.  I snapped several pictures of the event then left for work.  Things of note: 1 The sun was nearly overhead; 2 The surrounding clouds were doing nothing like the trail in its color transitions.  I finished my work load for the day and copied the photos from my memory card over to the computer and was blown away by what was in the photos.

Suddenly, it came to a dead stop in the sky, while simultaneously turning red, as if it were a brake light. The red light appeared to be rather large and oval in shape.  This happened over a fraction of a second, then the object completely disappeared. I am curious to know what it could have been.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,41.7039,-72.5461

Between 6:20-6:30PM, civil twilight, observed a series of six brilliant orange orbs ascending from the opposite shoreline, due west, and gliding SE.  Each light traveled about 1.5 miles at an altitude of about 250 ft before it disappeared from view and was replaced by another, aloft from the same location. Through 10x25 Nikon binoculars I watched someone on the opposite beach involved in launching the last two of these lights.  Flashing a 5mW green laser in that direction seemed to have an affect: no further lights arose. Immediately driving around the Milford marina to this opposite shore of the Gulf, I met a group of partiers around a bonfire who admitted to launching several kong ming type paraffin sky lanterns.  Two of these which failed to go aloft were still on the beach for me to examine. MYSTERY SOLVED:  Milford obviously has more than its share of hot-air balloon/sky lantern users in various areas.  These are not necessarily hoaxers, mostly folks just out to have some fun.  The “swarm” of dozens of lights which I reported taking place on 10/13 originated from a sports bar/restaurant – some sort of celebration. Therefore, to save others undue waste of time and effort, I offer… ANATOMY OF A FAUX UFO:  IF IT LOOKS LIKE A BRIGHT FLAMING ORB WITH A HAZE AROUND IT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN. IF IT APPEARS CIRCULAR, BUT ALSO APPEARS TO CHANGE INTO A CYLINDER, OR HAVE A CYLINDER ATTACHED TO IT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN. IF IT LOOKS LIKE A CANDLE INSIDE A BUBBLE, IT IS A SKY LANTERN. IT IF RESEMBLES A FLARE ATTACHED TO A PARACHUTE, IT IS A SKY LANTERN. IT THE BRIGHT LIGHT FLOATS OR GLIDES SOUNDLESSLY OVERHEAD ONLY TO FLICKER AND/OR SUDDENLY WINK OUT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN. IF IT SEEMS FLAME-LIKE, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS YELLOW-ORANGE-RED, AND ITS FLAME SEEMS TO BE SWAYING OR WAVERING, IT IS A SKY LANTERN. I realize how unusual these things appear – particularly since I have witnessed some types of them being launched right in front of me, and still could not determine what I was observing after a two month lookout!  However, this is a very popular fad and these things are plentiful, easily available and cheap.  So expect more of them just about everywhere.

Pleasant, IA Shape: Fireball Duration:3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90989.html,"Large orange/red fireball appears and travels in sky above and quickly disappears. It was around 11:40 at night on July 16, 2012, in Mt. Pleasant, IA at the Henry County Fairgrounds.  A friend and I were talking on the corner of where the main road through the grounds and the road to the east of the project building meet.  I was facing north, her to the south. I was listening to her talk and as I was looking at her, all of the sudden, out of nowhere I see a large fireball object in the sky behind her. It was up above the tree line to the north, which if you are looking from the place we were standing, isn’t too terribly far.  It was red/orange in color and started to rise up in the sky slowly. It then stopped moving higher up and appeared to be moving closer to us (or farther south) and east as well and was glowing brighter orange. It continued in a sort of U-shape or a half-loop because it kept getting farther south and east. As it travelled this path, the color appeared to pulsate. It then reached a point where it started to get farther away! from us (or back to the north again). As soon as it hit that point where it started to appear to head back north again, it suddenly began to rapidly glow dimmer and stopped the pulsating effect. It faded to white rather quickly right before our eyes, though still very visible at that point. It wasn’t too much longer that the white object appeared to change course yet again, heading directly north and in less than 5 seconds it just disappeared. This whole event was quite perplexing especially since the object was in the sky for no more than 3 minutes. First of all, there was no noise from this object. All day I work around crop dusters and I can hear them from an even farther distance than this object was to us. If it were a helicopter it definitely could have been heard as well. Second of all, if it were a plane or helicopter, why would it be flying in that sort of pattern? If it was a medical helicopter, it certainly wouldn’t be flying that way considering the locations of the hospitals in that part of the state. Third, the duration of this event was crazy. We should have been able to follow this object in the sky a lot longer. It was a crystal clear night! We could see many satellites and other objects in the sky and we noted how slow moving they were, how far away we could see them from, and also how clear and crisp their lights were.  The object we saw had no definite shape, no consistent color, and no consis! tent pattern or flashing of its light. We cannot come up with an explanation of what it was. One final event that went on about 10 minutes after the sighting: there were a lot of chickens, turkeys, ducks, and other birds in cages in a small open sided building right south in front of the project building (to the west of us). These animals had been quiet all night besides an occasional cluck. But as my friend and I were discussing the event, as I said around 10 minutes afterwards, they just went berserk. All of the livestock were making some sort of noise and it was loud even from where we were! They carried on at the same noise level for close to 4 minutes and all of the sudden just stopped. Absolutely nothing had changed from the time that we had been standing outside other than us seeing that object in the sky, so whatever caused them to get all riled up is a mystery, too. I am just blown away. I have always been skeptical of “UFO’s”, always laughing when shows came on the TV about them or writing people off as crazy that had sighted them or shared stories of them. I know I’m not crazy, so there goes my original theory. I’m starting to pay a little more attention to these occurrences now.  My friend has never had any experiences involving UFO’s before either, so she was shocked at what we saw as well. But questions we will likely never answer are why us, why then, and why there? The odds of it happening are unreal and I’m still in shock as to what went on.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,41.0207,-91.5839

I decided to drive to the far north end of town and observed what I thought were three (3) planes flying unusually close and moving faster than normal in an east bound direction.  The objects were flying single file behind one another with approximately 500 to 1000 yards behind one another.  I would describe the objects as pulsing orange and red (more red) and from my distance would appear circular.  However due to distance, an actual shape could not be conclusively determined. My first impression was that these planes were flying way to close for FAA regulations and were moving faster than normal. It is important to note that these objects were due north of a medium sized airport.  It is also important to note that I have lived right under a major airport highway for a major city airport and my town is in a direct path way (most of the time) to this airport mentioned above.  I state this simply because I have a lot of experience watching planes take of and land.  I am also very aware of normal lights on planes.  I am also aware of covert lighting, dim/ no lighting procedures. I would guess that if a plane normal plane is moving at 500-600 miles per hour at this altitude (10-15,000 ft?), these objects were moving under super sonic speed but pretty close.  It is a cloudy night tonight and these objects could be seen for some distance to the east.  By the time they flew over me and I was able to get my binoculars out of my trunk, they were gone.  That was fast.  It took me approximately two minutes to dig for them. Finally, the only other comments I could state is that they were not blinking lights on the wings of a plane.  The object would have been totally engulfed by what ever this red/orange object was.  It was moving too fast to be commercial aircraft, which would have been in that particular area.  I am not aware of any further witnesses, but people driving home may have seen me point my spot light at the last object for a brief moment.  This seemed to slow it down for a second.

I was watching with my friend, who was driving me home, and we entered a small bend in the road.  Our view was blocked for a few seconds by a tree, due to the curve, and when we had a clear view, the left light was gone, leaving only the one that was on the bottom-right. We went North for two minutes before turning East, and nothing else changed during this time.  I kept watch while my friend watched the road, and I saw the object flare up, like fire does if it comes into contact with a new chemical substance.  It sort of shrunk into a four pointed star shape then brightened and became much larger, white in color, before going back to orange and dropping an orange object that looked to fall to Earth.  The new object was the same size and color as the other one.  The new object disappeared a little bit above the ground, from our vision. Then the first object started fading, like a satellite that is going out of the sun's light, gradually becoming dimmer.  It disappeared for a minute, then appeared again, in the same spot.

I walked out onto my balcony for a cigarette at a minute to midnight. I remember the time perfectly because I was cramming hard to get work done before the clock struck twelve.  I had just finished saving some documents and uploaded them to my work's server at exactly 11:57.  Then I cheered for making the deadline and immediately headed outside to smell the fresh ocean air and relieve some stress. I had just lit my cigarette when I heard a dog suddenly barking very loudly.   I scanned the boardwalk with my eyes until I located the dog, and then saw its owner was struggling hard to control the animal because it was going ballistic!  The dog was facing and barking wildly towards the sky, so naturally I looked in the same direction, and that's when I saw a green swirly motion in the darkness.  Like a ball of green fire, it rotated very fast in circles like a neon snake...then faded into complete blackness.  At first I thought is was a firework, but I've never seen fireworks take on the perfect form of an illuminated green snake.  The spiraling effect was too perfect to be a firework.  So then I thought well maybe it was a projection of a computer graphic of some sort, but where could someone project something so bright in this area?  I don't know of any projectors that could be aimed so high to create such a bold hologram-like picture...unless it was military or NASA.  And though I caught the spectacle at its tail end, I know that fireworks wouldn't be shot off now so close to winter, and so close to Boston airport.  There are tons of planes constantly landing and taking off in this area.  What I saw scared and alarmed animals.  If it was a normal flying aircraft,any dog in the area would be so conditioned to seeing and hearing them.  However, this dog was clearly threatened.   At first I thought the dog sensed a negative stranger and was acting protective over its owner.  So I focused my attention in the beginning to the boardwalk (in front of th! e walker, behind, around)...before looking UP.  It was such a w! eird sig ht.  My partner came outside to see what the barking was all about because apparently all the dogs in the building next us also went ballistic.  I showed him traces of the spiral circles in the sky and told him what I saw, yet the remnants had quickly evaporated like a cheap perfume.  We ruled out all ""sane"" possibilities.  The dogs going crazy also confirmed something was not normal.  I've never seen anything like this in my life. It sort of reminded me of those chinese dragons that spin around and around.  This was similar, yet the green fire moved like a snake and looked exactly like one....almost as if it was chasing its own tail.  This goes down in my memory book forever.  I'm a very educated person with no mental issues whatsoever.  I'm not going to look at a grape and try to convince you it is an orange.  I am only telling you what I saw.

At about 8:20 pm on 9/10/2012, in Niagara Falls, NY, I was showing a bicycle to a young girl and her mother in my backyard. The young girl saw something in the sky visible to her only at first because of the house blocking our view. She pointed up and asked “What the heck is that?” Stepping into her view point, we both saw an extremely bright light moving as fast as a high altitude jet moving north to south. It seemed to have a central bright light similar to a yellow colored welding arc surrounded by a less bright disk or sphere. (more orange in color) The unique aspect of the orange sphere was that, unlike atmospheric glow, it was not hazy but had a distinct sharp edge to it. There was no detectable wind at ground level and upper atmosphere winds had been west to east all day. At this point I called my wife out of the house to see what we were seeing. Now,  it was directly overhead. I admit that my first interpretation of the object was most likely a Chinese Lantern. But the overall brightness of the object and its movement not correlated with the prevailing winds made me think otherwise. The central bright light looked less like a candle burning and more like a welding torch or magnesium burning. Very bright! I still had time to get my binoculars from the house and when focusing on the object it remained the same size as it appeared to the naked eye. Probably very distant. My neighbor and her daughter are average people as my wife is. No special interest in UFO’s or astronomy. I have been an amateur astronomer since my teens and make a habit of observing the night sky every chance I get. I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like this object in my life – I am 65 years old! bright",2012-09-24T00:00:00,43.106133918128656,-78.98603684210525

The store is located less than one mile from my home. Her boyfriend stated, ""Mr. X, I think we just saw a UFO."" I asked them what they saw and they described a large ""orange glowing fireball"" moving across the sky. My daughter said the light ""fizzled out"" after a while, but then it reappeared a second time. About five minutes into our conversation, at approximately 8:30 p.m., her boyfriend looked outside and and spotted the object again in the northwest sky. I told them to turn off all the interior lights and the television to eliminate as much light pollution as possible. We all had our smartphones in hand and I set mine to video mode. We moved outdoors on my balcony which has a west-facing view. My complex is set on a mountain ridge with each building higher in elevation than the next. So as I looked westward, I can clearly see over the top of the next building. The night sky was very clear with low humidity and cool temperatures. I observed a glowing orange ""ball"" of light moving steadily in the sky northwest of my location traveling southward. The light did not blink or pulsate. It was a steady glow. The color did not change, nor did the intensity of the light. The object was moving at a steady rate of speed which I would not characterize as particularly fast or slow. Somewhat like the speed a plane would fly on approach to land. The glowing light appeared to fade and disappear after about a minute or slightly more. It seemed that if the object was turning away from our vantage point, in a westward direction, it might account for the light disappearing. I was unable to see the object on my smartphone but continued to film. Once the object disappeared, I asked my daughter to get her digital camera, which also shoots video, from her upstairs bedroom. She returned quickly with the camera. We discussed the fact that it might be related to heightened security as it was close to 9-11. We took note of several commercial airplanes with their blinking lights in the area and pointed out the obvious difference in appearance to the object we saw. We also spotted two satellites racing across the sky and noted how different they also appeared, merely a speck of white light traveling extremely quickly across the sky at a great distance. Approximately 3 to 4 minutes later, the object reappeared in the same spot of origin as the first sighting, northwest of our vantage point, moving southward at a steady, but not overly fast rate of speed. My daughter and I both captured the object on digital video. I thought I was able to hear something from the object, but it turned out it was the local freeway which was clearly audible given the clear weather conditions. After the object disappeared a second time. We waited for a return which did not come. We went on with our evening discussing what we had just seen and watching the premier of NBC's The VOICE. We both downloaded our videos to my home computer and watched the footage. She was able to zoom with her camera, but I was not with my smartphone. We both captured the same incident at the same time on two separate devices as evidenced by the same recorded audio. The object made no detectable sound. If I were to approximate it's relative distance, I would approximate 3 - 4 miles or less at it's point of origin and at an altitude of around 1,500 feet. I would guess it traveled about 3 miles or so before the light disappeared. My girlfriend came in around 9:40 p.m. and we detailed what had just occurred and showed her the videos. I found this website after searching to see if anyone else reported a similar sighting. I did not notice any other distinguishing features other than the color and intensity of the light. I did not notice any similarr objects at the same time. I am assuming the second object was merely the first object making a return pass, but it could have been a separate second object. No way to know for sure. This is the first time I've ever seen anything remotely odd in the night sky.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,41.078,-74.1764

We then discussed the possibility of f-15 training flights out of PDX who were lighting their afterburners but due to our close Proximity to the lights and their complete silence this seems unlikely.,2012-08-19T00:00:00,44.9435,-123.9487

Universal Studios, CA Back Lot Tour  UFO Photo Hello,  My Family and I( Me, my Wife, and 3 boys ages 17,13, & 10) recently took a Vacation for a week in Southern California. We drove in from Texas and took countless photos of the scenic landscape of New Mexico, Arizona, and California. We visited Magic Mountain, Universal Studios, and many other sights around Southern California. Along the way in New Mexico we were taking several pictures , joking about capturing  UFO’s, of course because of Roswell.  When we were headed back to Texas looking at all our photos from 4 different cameras, my 13 yr old said “Dad look at this”, at first I said how did you do that, that’s a pretty real looking picture.  He took pictures with his Ipod during the trip.  He swore he did nothing to the photo and it is original. I got goosebumps because it was a creepy looking saucer in the upper center of the photo,  I was hoping to get clarity on what it may be.  Could it be an Airplane, bird, or is it an Unidentified Flying object. I won’t let him dele! te the photo until we have some clarity. It was taken during the Back lot tour at Universal Studios Hollywood on 7.31.2012. At approximately  8pm. Thank you for your time.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,34.1374,-118.35280000000002

I live a short distance from the downtown Clio Amphitheater where there is a concert held every Tuesday, typically between 7-9 pm. We sat on my front porch and listened to the concert which ended at around 9 pm. We remained talking on the porch after it was over and I had just happened to glance up into southern horizon where I witnessed an extremely bright fire-orange light traveling on a 25-30 degree angle from NE to SW at a very low speed. I had never seen anything like this before, and briefly sat in astonishment before cutting off my friend in mid-conversation, stating “Dude… What is that!” He looked up as I pointed out the object, we were both speechless… I turned off the front porch light (without losing sight off the object) to get a better view. This bright orange light had no defined borders (but appeared! to be more sphere-shaped than anything else) continued to travel NE-SW very low to the horizon (25-30 degrees) at a very close distance; first appearing to be about the size of a quarter before suddenly shifting to 45 degrees and dimming slightly and becoming smaller in size (about the size of a dime). The object remained orange in color and continued to fade, brighten, and travel very slow. It completely disappeared for about 5 seconds, then faintly reappeared for about 5 seconds, then slowly vanished into the sky. The entire incident lasted about 1 minute. We remained on the porch until 11:30 pm hoping to see the object again but it never reappeared. I have looked on the internet since then hoping that someone else had seen it and it turns out that there have been many similar sightings in July, but nobody has posted anything about this particular incident that occurred on 7/31/12 in Clio, MI at approximately 9:30 pm. This is surprising due to the incident occurring shortly after the concert ended downtown; typically at this time locals walk home from the concert or hang out in the park for a while. Surely, somebody else had to of seen this bright orange UFO in the sky other than us – it was so bright that is would be simply impossible to not see if outdoors at the time, even out of ones’ peripheral vision.

On August 1, 2012 at approximately 9:50 pm ET I walked outside to get something out the car and noticed a very bright red light coming from a west/SW direction (back towards batesville rd) moving in a north/nw direction.  At first I thought it was a helicopter or plane as we see them frequently near the GSP International Airport.  However, after a few seconds I ruled that out because it made no sound and was not flashing/strobing – it was a single red bright light, no green or white secondary lights. I watched the first one go past my location and then suddenly go out.  It was 30 sec to 45 sec from the time I first saw it in the distance until it went out.  It moved in a regular straight line, at a constant speed, appearing to climb in altitude. Almost immediately after the first one disappeared, I noticed a second light in the exact same location (west/sw) and following the same path as the first.  I ran inside and got my wife to come out to see the light.  It hade moved on past our location and then went out at approximately the same point as the first.  This happened 3 more times for a total of 5 over about 5 minutes.  The altitude appeared to be about the same level as I usually see local news helicopters. I was able to grab a set of binoculars in time to look at the last occurrence.  The light appeared as a solid sphere.

It was now to the south of me and seemed to be hovering again, this time over my neighborhood.  I made it to my house and got out of the car and looked at it.  It flew directly overhead of me, probably no more than 1000 ft off the ground. It made very little noise, a slight shhhh sound could be heard right after it passed over me but not as loud as any aircraft I know of.  It seemed to have two white lights close together on the nose or front w two red bl! inking lights toward the center of the craft but on the outside, as on wings.  It also had a blue light somewhere on the body.  I can't be sure where. When it passed I noticed two very faint bluish grey lights on the rear, almost reminding me of thrusters.  I was wondering if anything like this had been reported recently by anyone in the surrounding area. I feel like I couldn't have been the only one to see it. It didn't look big enough to be a plane.  If I had to guess I might say it was the size of a minivan or mid-size SUV.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,38.4309,-85.5239

It can't be mass hallucination.....since it occurred at different times.  At first I thought that it was just my eyes playing tricks on me.... but I went out and looked multiple times..... not staring for a long time (which can distort your vision).  I would just look for 30 seconds or so and it would dart to the right....then the left...then it would make like a loop....then these little sparks.... and it happened multiple times.... As we continue to watch them as it is now almost 4:30 am est they are still there but changing their main position slightly.  For the most part when they dart to the left or right or up and down and do the loop they always seem to come back to the point where they started.  Out of curiosity we looked around in the sky and have found at least 4 at this point, but it is cold out there and we (or at least I) do not want to keep looking...  We are freaked out enough.  The witnesses are as follows : a 13 year old girl, a 46 year old woman, and two younger women ages 28 year old and a 38 year old.  The 13 year old is still in school, the 46 year old graduated high school, the 28 year old has her GED and the 38 year old went to 1 year of college.  The 46 year old is the mother of the 28 year old and she is currently on DSS. 38 year old is a stay at home mom. and the 28 year old is too.   Well, that is all I can think of..... I do have one last thing to say and that is.... I know I saw what I saw....and It really makes me feel uneasy.  Thank you for your time. (I also called and left a msg on the hotline.)",2012-10-30T00:00:00,41.8709,-74.1662

Once sitting in my stand I started to use my flashlight to see where the deer had went as it was still dark out.   At roughly 530am I saw what I thought was a plane or a helicopter go straight up into the sky.  I did not think anything of it however I then watched it come back down to about eye level with the tree line.  Whatever it was it was right through the trees as I could make out pulsating white lights.  All the while the object never made a sound.   As I was watching this happen the lights moved to my left, then to my right.  Once it moved to the right I could clearly see 3 pulsating lights.  Yellow, Red, Yellow.  I was extremely scared at this point as I actually felt as if we were both looking and checking each other out.  It should be noted that I am an avid outdoorsman and leave for my hunting trips when it is dark out.  I have never seen anything like this in my life and I hope I never do so again.   I lowered my equipment out of my tree stand and left the woods heading back for camp.  I get the sense that my wife doesn’t believe me and my friends think I am crazy!

Finally a young Hispanic girl with braces came along but was late to work and I couldn't even get her to look at the object.

My friend and were having coffee,talking when her face looked shocked and she began to point behind me, saying ""what's that?"" I turned around and in the north east horizon were at least, twenty-five to thirty, bright, orange glowing globes. At first they appeared to be floating. There was no sound.

It was as though the orbs were moving, but still floating- suspended- just above the tree lines. I! ran back in the house to get my husband. He grabbed his binoculars. We all went to the front of the house and stood in the drive way. By this time the ""y"" formation had started to disappear, first the ""v"" part then the ""tail"" began to move out of a line and the orbs were moving,individually.

He said ""There were no oustanding features, they looked like bright, orange pumpkins to him"" We started to get in the car and see if we could follow them,as it seemed they did not go away, but just floated out of our sight. We went back to the deck and discussed what we saw. We decided to call the police to see if anyone had reported seeing these.

While recording the object in video mode, my wife yelled out to me from the car that another one was coming over the trees. I moved my camera to record the other similar UFO. There were approximately 3 more bright fire-like orange glowing objects traveling across the highway in succession. A total of 5-6 UFO's seemed to be following each other in a pattern of about 30 seconds apart and were about 500 feet or more into the night sky above. I believe that each UFO was about the size of a very small house. The UFO's did not make any sound but just seem to glide effortlessly across the sky. I was simply amazed and in awe of how big and bright they were. Each one of the UFO's flew almost directly over us toward the west and disappeared over the trees and into the clouds. They seem to have come from over the trees and through clouds on the! other side (east side) of the highway. This is a first time I! 've seen a UFO. I showed my Dad the footage I obtained and he told us that that was the same object he saw last year Memorial Day weekend. Although the bright orange glowing UFO my Dad saw traveled downward toward him and his friends and suddenly, at a very high rate of speed, changed directions at about 45 degrees and disappeared into the night sky.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,41.9761,-85.6475

What caught our attention was the altitude of said lights.  They were low for the planes we normally see flying over that area.  The center light was almost a blue with the two other lights on either side of it being orange and equally distanced from the center one. Four more lights appeared to the left of the three already visible lights.  The way they appeared was one right after the other, almost like the runway marker lights of an airport, one right after the other. As soon as the fourth new light, or seventh total light appeared, all seven went out simultaneously and were not seen again. The initial three lights were seen over trees, and guessing distance, I would have to guess they were between the area of Highway 176 and Cypress Gardens Rd.  The other four lights that appeared were seen over 17-A. All seven lights were in a perfect line and spaced equally apart from each other.  The furthest left light was at the highest altitude with the furthest right light being at the lowest altitude.

Just spent 20 minutes on the phone with Miami ARTCC (Center); would love anyone's insight here.  Bear with me, kind of a long, detailed story:  Flew back from FXE to TPF direct with my student tonight.  All of the Avon Park MOA's and Restricted areas were active/hot, and we could see about 6 F-16's (as per Miami center) dog fighting and practicing intercept procedures at 7000' and above. Upon clearing the MOA and due east of Arcadia, what appeared to be a LED landing light abruptly popped on just above the cloud layer and immediately caught our attention.  It appeared to be about 500ft below us, at our 2 o'clock and figured about 5-7 miles, and looked as if it might be in conflict in a few minutes.  The light then started flashing, presumably because he saw us up ahead crossing and wanted to make his position known.  I turned on our landing and taxi light of the 182 to acknowledge, yet this other aircraft kept turning this light on at odd and random intervals until he went dark for about a minute.  Fed up, I asked the Miami controller for a traffic advisory on the aircraft at our 2 o'clock and about 3-4 miles.  He responded that he didn't observe any traffic in the area.  A little puzzled, I asked him if he had any primary targets in the area and he told me to standby. A long 15 seconds passed by and the light appeared again!  This time it appeared to now be at our 1 o'clock but the light still pointed at us (?) and then quickly went out again.  The controller came back on and said that he had checked and rechecked his backup systems and assured me that there were NO primary(pure radar return) targets in the area.  Just when he said that, an aircraft behind us a few miles asked where we were, the controller told him, and that pilot reported that he was watching all of this happen AS well!  Then a third aircraft also chimed in and said he too was seeing the strange light and it was moving across the sky rapidly.  Three aircraft in all saw this.  The controller was completely bewildered at this point....needless to say, upon landing, I called up Miami Center. I talked on the phone for 20 minutes to the D-Side of the sector I was in, who turned out to be a supervisor and was training the R-Side.  He too was sufficiently freaked out and confused along with the rest of the guys on ""the floor.""   He said that in his 27 years, he had odd occurrences like this every few years and they usually turned out to be flares IN the MOA but never in this location, intermittent, and underneath another aircraft moving laterally.  He thought that it was a UAV (which is of course illegal to operate in the NAS), and that if it was, it could have been much closer to our aircraft than we had thought (that's always comforting to hear) and it would also explain why it was not on their radar if it was small enough.  I chimed in and figured that it started turning its lights on and off in an effort to avoid us. This was not a flare or laser.  It changed position laterally and maintained its altitude.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,27.188313636363638,-81.87071363636363

This occured between 22:15-22:25 PST. I was driving in a northerly direction, about 14 blocks away from my home when i noticed an orange light. At first glance i assumed it was a plane or aircraft of some kind. Then as I got closer, about 10 blocks away i noticed the light was still there, and it was rather large, not small like a plane light. I then as i was driving, I started watching for it to blink or fade away or turn like most planes in the area do. There were no other lights or aircraft lights or anything in the sky during this time. When I first saw the light it was a little to the left of the road i was driving on, during the day there is a large tree at the end of the road where i turn and it was in that area. as I got closer the light had moved to the right side of the road. When I was about 8 blocks from home and still observing this light i decided to pull over to the side of the road because this was simply something i had never seen before. It was a VERY clear ORANGE light. Not flickering or flashing. It was roundish, maybe a little more oval than round, but overall just an VERY orange light. At the time i thought it was a paper lantern for 2 reasons: #1 because it was SOOO low to the ground..maybe 200 feet up. Maybe a little higher, it was night time so judging distance was hard but it was a large light (street lamp size) so I assumed it was rather near to the ground..much closer/lower than i've ever seen a plane or even a helicopter. and #2 reason was because of the way it was moving. It wasnt moving at a fast speed like i would expect an aircraft or helicopter to move. In fact it's movement was more of a floating/gliding. However the longer i watched it the more i knew it was not a lantern, because it was a clear light, there was no lantern for a flame or anything to be encased in. It was a clear, orange light that was not flickering like a flame would. It was also very silent, i could not hear it passing by. there were no engines or blades or cars or music or any other type of noise. So when I pulled over the light floated to the left side of the street again, passing over the road, but i could not see a shape associated with the light, just the light..and it just slowly meandered across the houses and trees to the left of the road, 1-2 blocks over. there are about 2-3 blocks on the left side of the road then there is a cliff going into the Puget Sound.  I watched the light for about 2-3 minutes while i was pulled over.  I would expect a normal aircraft/helicopter would have passed out of my line of sight during 2-3 minutes and would be heading off wherever it was meant to be but after 2-3 minutes i got a little freaked out that I didnt know what this light was so i drove the rest of the way home.  I did not see the light again after i drove off. As for my background/description:  I am not the kind of person looking for UFOs or strange sightings, i have never tried to see things like that.  I am deeply interested in astronomy and when it's not raining/cold outside i usually have my telescope out in my backyard looking at the stars/moon, however i have never seen an object that i could not identify.  Other than a few meteors i havent seen anything unusual in the skies during the past month or two here.  I still dont know what i saw except that it was like NOTHING i've ever seen and i've been looking at the stars all my life.

SIGHTING  it was at this point an object emerged from the eastern horizon, flying east to west at over supersonic speeds. it flew maybe 800+ feet above (although not directly 'above', likely on its flank a bit as it was hard to tell from my angle) the chopper. it made no sound at all and gave no heat or other effects and crossed the entire sky in about 2 and a half seconds. It had one indescribably bright light on the center of the object, that flashed at regular intervals. the 'light' had only a few chances to flash due to the objects' speed. the light was so bright, so intensely white that you could see every color of the rainbow streaming within the light. there were perhaps other, dimmer white lights that stayed on constantly, placed around the craft. The main body of the craft was very hard to distinguish in the darkness, but the lights on its own body gave some ambient illumination to itself. i could barely make out the greyed outline of a bizarre, somewhat triangle shaped craft. when the light would flash, it would be blocked out by the intensity. when it was off briefly, there was still light emerging from the craft, although not as bright. the lights on the object far outshone that of the helicopters', even the moon. the light was distinctly inhuman. Because of the sudden nature of the event, i did not really try to make sure i would remember the details of the craft itself, as i was still what i would describe as 'calmly-lobotomized', staring like an idiot into the sky away from their house as someone opened the door. I believe there is a possibility that the chopper pilots may have also seen the craft, although given its speed and silent nature there is a chance they only saw a white flash in the corner of the eyes. Choppers seemed to remain in the sky for the rest of the night as i saw one driving a few hours later and also heard another when i got home. I give an estimate of 900+ feet for the elevation of the craft, and perhaps about the size of a good boat, quit a bit larger than a fighter jet. I have seen F-16s, F-15s, F-22s, F-18s, MiGs, at night, at day, flying high, low, supersonic, really slow, you name it. I have looked down the barrel an A-10 Warthogs' Gatling gun.  I  have seen b-2 spirits, Stealth fighters, both parked and flying in close detail(although men guarded the F117 nighthawk) i have been in a V-22 Osprey helicopter, hueys, Apaches, UH-60 Blackhawk, freaking chinooks.  I have been on countless commercial aircraft of all make and size my whole life. This was NOT a known aircraft, to be certain. it demonstrated distinctly inhuman traits. if it was human, i conjecture top secret military craft. It should be noted that this was certainly a 'craft', and not a natural phenomenon. It was NOT a meteor or balloon of any type.  It was not ball lightning. it was not an aurora,a moon halo, it was not swamp gas, sun dogs, it was not a lenticular cloud, or any other type of electromagnetic/plasma phenomenon. it was not gary busey eyeing the world dangerously as he travels in his home-made craft powered out of fear and childrens' screams. it was not santa, it was not a satellite, it was not a missile test. as someone who is extensively familiar with both military/civilian aircraft and astronomical phenomenon, all i can say with absolute assurance is this was an unidentified, constructed object exhibiting inhuman traits flying in proximity to aircraft with zero explanation and no other way of seeing it was there (radar?) other than eyesight.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,43.61444520153551,-116.24467802303263

The object's speed was that of a slower airplane and its elevation was below the clouds yet no discernible features were visible.   It was slightly larger than a typical lighted plane.

I had a good look at it with my binoculars and noticed it was triangular shaped and had light of a orange colour emanating from what looked like widows of a rectangular shape.

The sky was clear, moonlit night.   While the aircraft was descending approximately 60 miles east of Tucson, approximately at or below 18,000 ft. I observed several light objects in the sky. (location approximately Mount Graham near Safford AZ).  I first noticed the brightly lit object when it was joined by a second object same size and color light, I first thought it was a plane turning in the sky and was very curious because of the proximity of the second object, then one of the lights turned off and then on again and that is when I knew this was strange.   Almost immediately a third, fourth, fifth and sixth light the light appeared in the sky, not all in a straight line but somewhat aligned horizontally. I would estimate within a mile separation of each other end to end.   I am a pilot and engineer, I have much experience identifying aircraft at night, this was absolutely not an aircraft light or flares dropped by military planes.  In fact, the amber color objects did not appear to move and were higher than our plane, I know this because they were well above the horizon (higher in the sky) I would estimate above 20,000 ft.  The objects were not moving, but turning on and off in short duration like someone flipped a switch.  I only saw all 6 lights on at the same time once, after that it was down to 2 or 3, then only 1 on and off (5 to 15 second duration)over a period of 3 or 4 minutes.

Also, with me was a 45 year old male friend who is a construction worker.  We live on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, next to where the Wright Brothers first flew.   We all basically agree with the following account. All three of us were getting on our bicycles to ride to a cook out a few blocks away in our neighborhood.  It was 6pm November 30th, 2012 Friday night.  It had been dark for about 45 minutes.  We rode down the street a few hundred feet, heading basically north, when some red lights caught my eye through the live oak trees.  Seconds later, an aircraft emerged from behind the tree line.  It was a black or charcoal gray craft.  Estimated 200 feet long tip of the triangle to its base, 100 ft wide at its base and 15ft tall.  Flying virtually silently about 300 ft off of the ground and traveling in a seemingly straight line about 15-25 mph.   It flew very slow and quiet for a craft of this size.  I have seen Stealth Bombers and Stealth fighters, it was at least as big as the bomber, probably bigger, but not shaped the same and much more quiet. There were rows of red lights lining the bottom of the craft on either side from the tip to the base, but not along the base of the traingle shape.  No lights went on and off like FAA planes.  All lights were red, some pulsated seemingly randomly but stayed relatively dim compared to the lights on the points of the triangle and never went out or ""blinked.""  The lights at the points of the triangle seemed to be the brightest lights.  The craft flew almost directly over our heads, just west of us, so we had to crane our necks to look up at it because was so close.  We watched it ""slide"" slowly past us and continue in its northerly direction until we lost sight of the lights behind the trees and houses north of us.  As it passed our position, a low humming rumble noise could be heard, but it was by no means loud like a jet or propeller.  It was not a blimp.  We would have been able to see the blimp above the craft because it was so low.  Also the blimp would have had to been li! ke 1000 feet long to lift the structure we saw. I am not convinced this is not some semi-secret military operation, as we have Oceana Naval Air Station near us to the north.  However, they are obviously not concerned about people seeing the craft flying the way it flew over the fairly densely populated area here on that night last week. This is a true account, it happened.  What we saw is real, whatever it is.  I am not a UFO enthusiast, I am a hard facts guy.   We saw what we saw, and whatever it was is a reality.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,36.02,-75.6699

It was partly cloudy but this part of the sky was completely clear.   At first I thought it may be Mars because of how much red was in the object but then I noticed it was moving very slowly to the west.  Because of the color and slow movement it caught my attention. Next I thought it may be an airplane far off in the distance but I dismissed that quickly.  I did not think it was an airplane because it did not have any flashing warning lights on it and it was more of a solid red object with maybe a lighter whitish outline.  Also, the object seemed to be moving very slow in the sky. I could not take my eye off of it because I could tell it was something I have never seen before.  I saw this object moving very slowly in the sky and it seemed to be far off in the sky (I thought it was a star or planet at first).

As I was waiting for them to pick up my call, a group of three orange lights flying south and some distance away caught my attention.  When my friend picked up my call I told him immediately what I was seeing as I joked by saying it was probably some college kids sending off some dry-cleaner bags with candles lit up inside and then we laughed as I turned away from their appearance. As we chatted for a few minutes, I was surprised to see the orange lights still flying about in the distance since it seemed like five or ten minutes had passed since I first noticed them.  So I focused my eyes more acutely on them again to see what I could detect about their nature. One thing I found very striking about them was the pureness of their orange color, which was stunning to see.  My friend and I also began speculating about what they could be due to their high strangeness as they flew over the south end of the Bay Area at an altitude of maybe 5k feet, though from my vantage point it was difficult to tell this for sure. As odd sightings in the sky go, and I sure have had my share of them in my 60 years, this was particularly curious to me because it was so obvious as the three orange orbs seemed to play whimsically together as they flew further and further into the distance before disappearing into a cloud formation and then they suddenly blinked out. I laughed as I mentioned to my friend on the phone that they must have flown inside their mother ship. Believing others must have also seen what I saw flying over this very large metro area, I naturally assumed there would be a number of reports on the late news to let me know what it was I had observed.  However, as I perused through a number of local news reports later I was surprised that not one thing was mentioned about the orange orbs, which was almost more shocking to me then witnessing them as I had earlier.  I guess the media has been told by SOMEBODY…DO NOT cover such mass sighting events unless you have specific proof of what it was everyone saw in order to prevent mass panic among the public at large. Pffft!    Fortunately, I heard Peter D. on C2C about two weeks later and he mentioned then that there were numerous sightings of orange orbs witnessed across the US and elsewhere in the world, which also made me pause as his descriptions of them grabbed my attention, particularly the one in Castle Rock, WA, seen by an airline pilot.  Oddly, the pilots description was almost the same as what I had seen, though my sighting was at a far greater distance by order of magnitude. Based on what I have become aware of regarding such bizarre phenomena in our strange little world, it is only my opinion today that such widespread and multiple sightings of essentially the same thing being reported (and many others unreported too) suggests that this is a conditioning procedure that will eventually allow people everywhere to become comfortable with them as an everyday, ho-hum, occurrence.  Once their presence is generally accepted as a mystery that isn’t really hurting anyone, my guess is that our first encounter with intelligent life from another world is forthcoming.  Soon.  And, I suspect the reason for this is because our civilization has become to large and complex for us to manage and it may erupt into a full-on global thermo-nuclear war that will kill everyone in its aftermath. However, such a scenario of our untimely and unwelcome demise may not be acceptable to a group of aliens who have invested their time and resources into an effort to cultivate a civilization, ours’, (emulating God?  Perhaps, or acting as an agent of the Divine) that is now on the verge of joining theirs’ to one degree or another and for whatever reason they may have for such an undertaking over a twenty-six thousand year time span. After all, whom among us can say for sure where we all began?  Can you?  Or do you simply believe what others believed thousands of years ago when their interpretations of reality may have been much less precise than ours’ today and also influenced heavily by strange superstitions.  If so, I truly hope that works out for you as your closed minds and hearts implode when the truth comes out later. Nuff said…",2012-12-20T00:00:00,37.5963,-122.0657

Our exact location is less than 1000 feet from the location of a Google Maps search for Sheridan, CO.  Each object was seen by itself in the eastern sky, with no other identifiable or unidentifiable flying objects in our field of vision.   All three sightings occurred between 9:00 to 9:25 PM Mountain Daylight Time.  None of the objects appeared to have any physical structure to them, we saw only light.  The first and third craft seemed to be circular, but it was hard to discern a specific shape, since they were quite small.  The second craft was roughly diamond shaped, but didn’t have a distinct shape, looking more like an extremely bright light shining down from a very high altitude. The first object we saw at approximately 9:00 PM in the eastern sky at somewhere around 40 to 45 degrees from the horizon. It was apparently at a very high altitude, looking like a moving star. Its color was white, maybe slightly blue. It moved at a constant speed on a straight trajectory from south to north. We observed it for several minutes until it slowly faded from view to the north of us. The second object appeared around 9:10 PM, also to the east, but much higher in the sky, roughly 75 degrees. As it moved from west to east, it pulsed a very bright white light at a steady interval. Its brightness was a higher magnitude than any identified flying object, star, or planet I have seen, except maybe the Moon..  The light would appear and build in intensity to peak brightness in about 1.5 seconds, then dim and fade from sight in another 1.5 seconds, disappearing for about 10 seconds before appearing again. After several pulses while moving, it seemed to me to have slowed or stopped its movement, while others said it had changed direction. We did not see it after that. Its speed was slower than the other 2 objects, and it traversed a much smaller section of sky. Total time of observance was no more than a minute. The third object appeared sometime after 9:20 PM and looked extremely similar to the first object. The only difference apparent to me was that it seemed slightly brighter.  We watched it move at a constant speed on a straight trajectory from north to south, at about 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon. We watched this object for several minutes until it slowly faded from view to the south at 9:25 PM. It may be important to note that Buckley Air Force Base is not more than 20 miles to the east-northeast of the location of our sightings.  This fact indicates the possibility that we misidentified military aircraft, although I do not think we did.  The objects could also possibly be classified aircraft. My initial investigation via website sources yields no information on visible satellite or space flight passes matching both the time and location of our sighting.  Although the objects could still be satellites not listed on the websites I looked at, or pieces of space trash, both are rarely seen from the Denver area.  I doubt that any of the objects were satellites or space trash, as I have seen both many times on many occasions in the mountains of Colorado. I apologize for sending in two reports. I accidentally submitted the first one without fully filling out the form.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,,

I thought at first it was a boat with a flashing beacon but as I was explaining to the other two that on tv I noticed that sky watchers like to flash a bright flashlight at them to see if they resond. I flashed a bright Mag flashlight beam at the light expecting nothing but when I flashed it off to the right of it , The light suddenly flew straight to where I flashed the light.  This went on for over five minutes . Where ever I flashed my beam it flew straight to it.  After a while I made a cure with my light beam like a half circle with it ending in the ocean and when it followed the movment it disapered into the ocean.

The light was a very bright red , flashing a red light from its middle.  I held out my hand to guess its size and when I made a fist I could barly see the red light around my fist , IT WAS BIG. I wish I brought my phone to get pictures but because we were close to the water I left it in the house ( that was right behind us ). We went back out the next two nights watching to see if it returned but it did not.  When I first seen this light I thought it was on the ocean's surface but was able to tell it wasnt because I could see the ocean's surface below its glow.  It also moved at great speed to each spot my lights beam flashed at, much faster then anything I know of and the way it stopped , like on a dime.  Were talking a long distance between where each light beam was flashed at.

It was a totally clear evening with no clouds or moon in sight.  We were looking towards the southeastern sky observing a distance jet aircraft that was moving eastbound.  Suddenly I observed coming from east to west a blur or smudge of lights.   For a brief instant I thought a group of meteors were striking the atmosphere simultaneously, at least until my eyes become focused better on the blur of greyish-white lights.  When my eyes were focused completely, I saw an equilateral triangle directly over me moving rapidly to the northwest, but more westerly.   The triangle had 3 dimly-lit lights near the points of the triangle. I did not notice the color of the craft; however, my daughter thought it was black.  She also asserted that the points on the triangle were rounded as opposed to sharp.  The experience was only 3-5 seconds in length before the craft was out of sight, so each of our brains could only process a limited amount of information. The craft made no noise that we could hear.  Because I do not know the size of the craft, it is difficult for me to assess the height and velocity. If it was the length of a mid-sized commercial jet liner, then I would guess that this craft was about 1000 feet about us and moving perfectly straight at 150-200 mph.  I will e-mail a Power Point graphic if requested. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  Age 9 years.

((NUFORC Note:  One of six sightings from same source, submitted over the course of two months.  PD))  (Please refer to previous sightings from Milford since 06/06/12) Again, from Gulf Beach. Saturday evening, cold, overcast, and steady wind 10mph+ from SSW, which after sunset shifted to SW. Maintaining watch over previous NW and N positions for possible reoccurance when, at 8:22 PM, surprised to notice a large cluster of what appeared to be sky lanterns or balloons  slowly rising above the treeline in the NE (15 degrees), at what initially appeared to be 2 + miles distance.  Immediately started video recording with Lumix ZS15 superzoom. Original cluster composed of over 20 objects, all slowly drifting upwards, while changing positions and forming an X shaped plume.  These floating objects, for the most part, did not appear to be moving into the NE, as they ought to have been by the steady wind at my back.  There was a continuous release of other lit objects beneath those that had already risen up into the sky, eventually fading from sight.  (The treeline peaks at about 4 degrees, the maximum elevation any of the lit objects attained was about 25 degrees - that appeared to be their ceiling.)  None of these lit objects appeared to be drifting steadily into the NE, though that could simply have been the result of their angle of movement to my angle of view. As these lights continued to emerge above the treeline, the newest/lowest ones were brighter, more prominent, and definitely appeared to be moving against the wind's direction, sometimes in pairs. Some of the final objects looked very much as if they were moving towards the Gulf.  Likewise, there seemed to be a grouping of some of these objects as they ascended, as if they were maintaining a set space between each other.  Possibly distance illusions?  Close scrutiny of the 3 minute HD video might clarify this. This incrementing cluster of lit objects gradually diminished after 15 minutes, the final object fading away by 8:37 PM.  Total estimate = 40 - 55 sky lanterns/balloons/kites, what-have-you. Very brief follow up:  At 9:15 PM, after waiting for any reoccurance, I drove to  Milford's Westfield Shopping Center, which is near the line of sight these objects had appeared in, in order to find out if there had been some local event that would explain such a release.  None known of.  No one else had seen anything. During that evening, and over most of the next week, after dozens of inquiries throughout the area, including checking every regional and local  newspaper's recent and current issue, as well as talking with police and fire officials, I have finally been able to triangulate the area these lit objects emerged from:  The western portion of Stubby Plain in Milford.  Google maps reveals this particular area to be marshland immediately surrounded by forest.  It is about 6,000 feet to the NE of the Gulf Beach bridge, where I was recording from. Visiting this area confirms that it is almost impossible to enter into the plain itself through the swampy woods that surround it.  There is one large fenced off parking area adjacent.  I should add that not a single remnant of any kite or balloon or lantern has been found, even though their supposed plume of movement was mostly over a heavily populated area.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,41.223742105263156,-73.05265438596491

Then thought of a private balloon (but it was too late, and it moved to fast!), then i saw another one, a 3rd one and a 4th one. ..  Instead of searching for my cellphone to film it, I stood there watching (bummer!),  I called my girl-friend, who watched them too.   By the time they drifted/flew to the other side of the rooftops, she tried to find them in the skies in the front yard...but they had vanished... What are these things?

UFO  Report to NUFORC    I have experienced three UFO sightings, one with my daughter, one alone and most recently with my daughter’s boyfriend.   I had no intention of reporting my experiences until I received the Coast to Coast AM e-mail update on the June 20, 2012 show dealing with red-orange-yellow spherical UFO’s.   This is exactly the type of UFO I experienced all three times and the C2C show inspired me to report my experiences to NUFORC.  I did not have any way or chance to video any of these sightings.  The first sighting was my very first experience and it happened approximately 11:15 pm about 10 miles north of Syracuse , NY on August 30, 2011.  I pulled over to the side of the road, got out of the car and watched the object approximately 10 minutes until it “disappeared” instantly.  It was moving very slowly overhead at maybe 2000 feet from NW to NE moving maybe a quarter of a mile along a straight path at constant altitude. There was no sound at all.  It appeared to be “pulsing” from red-orange and some yellow, kind of like a “glowing” ball almost like “fire”.  It was hard to estimate the size of the object  but it was larger than the lights of a landing aircraft or helicopter and much larger than when Venus was very visible this spring. (2012)   I KNOW it was NOT an aircraft, planet, balloon, flare, parachute or star.  I wonder if it could have been a secret military drone.  The following two sightings were essentially “identical” to the first in the appearance and characteristics of the objects.  The second sighting occurred on June 14, 2012 at approximately 8:45pm in  Oswego, NY.    The object moved in a straight line NW to N. I observed it for about one minute and it moved out of site...it did not disappear. The last sighting was June 16, 2012 about 10:15 pm also in Oswego, NY.  It moved in a straight path S to N over the roof of my house I estimate at 2000 feet.  No sound and VERY slow and we observed it for about 5 minutes when it “disappeared” instantly. I KNOW it was not an aircraft, balloon or satellite . There was one difference in this object over the first two. I wear glasses and the object was so bright that it seemed to cause “ radiant spikes” from the general spherical shape. I took my glasses off and these “spikes” disappeared and I was able to make out a king of pulsing between the spherical shape to a kind of cubical-elongated shape. This made me think of a military drone of some kind.   I have no idea what my 3 UFO’s were other than “unidentified.”",2012-07-04T00:00:00,43.2629,-76.3105

I noticed none of these objects while filming and my gut  tells me there was some external   'influence'  which did so.,Xenia,OH,2012-06-17T20:41:00,rectangle,3 minutes,"Occurred : 6/17/2012 20:41  (Entered as : 06/17/2012 20:41) Reported: 7/4/2012 1:39:23 PM 13:39 Posted: 7/4/2012 Location: Xenia, OH Shape: Rectangle Duration:3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90386.html,"I noticed none of these objects while filming and my gut  tells me there was some external   'influence'  which did so. On June 17th of this year at 20:41hrs I stepped outside work to take some video of some very strange looking clouds. I panned back and forth, accross  the horizon, covering west, north and east. I did this a couple times, focusing on the clouds, roughly pointed at about 45 degrees above the horizon. The most impressive cloud was a towering cloud with a very strange feature on top. I really cannot decribe it, but the three minutes of video capture it well. I actually took two seperate videos; one lasting about two minutes and twenty seconds(20:41hrs) and a second lasting about one minute(21:00hrs). During filming I noticed nothing other then the clouds I was filming, although I think I can recall some strange sun-light rays, beaming accross the sky which seemed to 'smear' the clouds which it covered. Once again, the video can tell it best. As best as I can recall, it was about two days later(6/19/2012) when I decided to use the footage as a medium for my music(guitar).   After creating what really is just an artistic hobby of mine, I titled the video ""Fire Clouds,"" and posted on a popular video viewing site. I really liked the way the music amd video complimented each other and I was watching it repeatedly to get a good 'feel' of it because I thoght I might re-make it with some improvements. After viewing it 7-8 times I noticed what appeared to be a metalic disc at 1min:49 seconds into the video.  t was at about 45degrees and seemed to either create a cloud-like mist(putting it at about 100 yards away) or it was partly behind a cloud (putting it quite far).  It had a dome on the bottom and I could see part of one on top.   I would estimate its size at either 30 feet in diameter or 300 feet, depending on which distance it actually was from me.  Once again, the video shows this clearly. Upon further inspection, I noticed a huge rectangular-shaped object partly sticking out from the clouds. Above was all on the first video and on the second I could see this second object moving away to the east but in second video it had rotated some 90degrees, displaying its book-shape appearance.  Large rectangular windows can barely be made out along the top front and top side edges(see video). As the easternly sky came into view, two more objects can be seen hovering above (but in the distance, not right above) a restaurant. Both were at about 35degrees above the horizon.  Both were right along the roof-line of the restaurant but obviously some distance away. The object on the left side was pizza-box shaped with a dome-like structure on top.  This object appeared to be cloaked but could be seen well enough throgh its firey-cloud-like disguise. The one on the right was triangle shaped and had a different cloaked appearence.  The light seemed to be smeared-out, making it diffivult to see well.(see video) I also noticed a large  tube-shaped cloud in the video, seen while filming due-west, torwards the setting sun. I am sending three videos along with this report:  (1)  A video which focuses on the rectangular object. (2) An un-interrupted look at  entire 2min+ long video  (3) The video ""Fire Clouds""(My created video where objects were spotted)   Thankyou.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,39.678,-83.9027

This object appeared as a bright red light, fairly large and round compared to any other flying craft I have ever seen. It moved in a straight forward motion without flashing any lights. It seemed to be traveling faster than any plane or jet I have ever seen, but did not have any similarity to a shooting star, and it was not going down or up. These unique attributes caught my eye, but the real surprise was when the object suddenly vaporized into thin air. Again, there were no clouds in the sky, so it was quite surprising to see this bright object suddenly disappear with no trailing off or fading into the distance.

At that point, the light flashed once (again white) and I watched the light shoot away at an extremely high rate of speed. The light did not disappear, but appeared like a tracer being shot out of a military weapon till I quickly lost sight of it behind a tree.  I had though initially I was viewing a satellite (which I have seen before and could recognize), but when it flashed and shot off, I was stunned.

We saw these dancing lights in the sky and at first tried to explain it--maybe strobe lights or reflections of some kind but nothing made sense.  The lights would start from one source, then spread out and dance around and then return to the source light. The whole sky had a different quality to it, almost like a magnetic type of storm.  This went on for 5-10 minutes, then the lights returned to their source point. I could still see where they were, it was a slight glow in the clouds, but they stayed there and stopped dancing.

At the intersection of 19th and Norwood, which is located at the top of a steep hill that faces south, we observed 4 bright lights near the southern horizon.  The lights were located on a bearing just east of south, probably about 170 degrees.  They were all the same brightness, evenly spaced, and resembled sodium vapor street lights; they were orange in color.  They were no more than 5 degrees above the horizon from our vantage point. The lights were stationary during the minute or so that we viewed them. My wife is an adamant skeptic regarding UFOs.  Nonetheless, she readily admitted these lights looked ""weird"".  My wife and I both have bachelor's degrees in physics and we have both studied astronomy at the university level, including considerable observational experience.  Neither of us thought these lights looked ""normal"". I have a private pilot's license and I am familiar with the location and traffic patterns of all airports in the vicinity of Boulder.  Our line-of-sight to the unknown lights passed near the traffic pattern for the Rocky Mountain Regional Airport (RMRA) (formerly the Jefferson County Airport or ""Jeffco""). However I do not think these were conventional aircraft landing lights because  1) they were distinctly orange and not white;  2)  because normally we do not see landing lights from aircraft in the pattern at RMRA since the downwind leg for runway 29 R&L points *away* from Boulder;  3) because there were *4* of them, all identical, evenly spaced, and they did not change their appearance at all during the minute or so we were observing them. Normally, conventional aircraft landing lights only take on an unusually bright appearance (such as we observed) when they happen to be pointed directly at the observer, a condition that normally happens for only a few seconds when an aircraft is maneuvering in the pattern.  I was unable to imagine any plausible arrangement of conventional aircraft in the landing pattern that would produce the display of lights we observed. In addition I should mention that the line-of-sight from us to the unknown lights passed more or less directly over the former Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility.  The lights (if taken to be similar in brightness to aircraft landing lights) looked as though they were located right over the former nuclear facility.  Although Rocky Flats has not been used for nuclear weapon production in many years, the author is aware that UFOs are often sighted near sensitive military installations, and thus thought that this detail should be included in this report. I was conflicted about whether to file this report or not, since we do have a large amount of conventional air traffic in our area at nearly all times, and therefore it is conceivable that what we saw was an unusual configuration of conventional aircraft.  However I decided to submit this report because I have thought about this sighting a number of times since it happened and I really am at a loss to explain those lights in a conventional manner.  Also, I reasoned that perhaps others saw these lights and may have already reported them, or, if not, perhaps my report will catalyze others into coming forward with corroborating information.  As far as I know there has been no mention in the local media about such lights, but I did not do a thorough search to confirm this.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,40.024403601895735,-105.26873952606635

As I watched it, two more followed forming a triangle shape.  Then, two more came after that.  They were all the same size, shape and color.  They did not flash like the lights of a plane would.  They did not make any noise and traveled at a steady pace from East to West over the river and out towards beachside and the ocean. A small airplane (4 seater maybe) followed after them in almost the same direction, which confirmed for me that they were not small airplanes flying together. At that moment, someone a few blocks to the west lit off some fireworks.  Not sure why other than maybe they had some leftover from 4th of July, but it made me wonder if they had sent up some Chinese lanterns.  But, the lights I saw stayed in the exact same formation, did not gain altitude that I could tell, did not flicker or change in any way, and none scattered or floated in different directions.  I thought they’d have to be pretty talented or lucky to send up lanterns in a triangle shape and have them stay that way as they floated over the river. Regardless, after these lights had gone out of sight, I proceeded a little further with my bike ride but was a shaken by what I had seen.  I have never seen anything like this.  So, I decided to turn around and head home going north on the same road.

At about 9:20 PM Central Daylight Time July 18, 2012, I was sitting with my dogs in my driveway enjoying a fire I had built in a metal fire pit.  This location is about 300 feet from the north shore of Shawano Lake, WI, of which I have a basically an unrestricted due south view except for a few trees.   Suddenly to my left or east I saw what I initially considered to be a large fireworks rocket being launched from an area east of me.  I immediately noticed that it did not explode and the trajectory was not like a fireworks rocket.   Gaining my interest immediately, I advanced about 100 feet toward the lake to get a better view.  As I was advancing it appeared more to be a fireball with pulsating red, yellow and orange lights.  It was quite close relatively speaking and I quickly dismissed the fireball description and thought maybe it was a small plane on fire trying to make it to the local airport on the opposite side of the lake about 2 miles away.  The lighted object made no sound in a virtually silent area geographically and at this point, I realized that this was nothing I could logically identify and realized that this may in fact be a UFO. Then a second one showed up on the same trajectory about 2 miles behind the first one.  I turned and ran to the front door of my house and yelled to my wife to hurry and come outside and look at these strange lights.  She had the presence of mind to grab a small Canon Power Shot SD 600 camera and began shooting video as we advanced toward the lake shore.  I/we observed these lights travel in a straight line a total distance of about 6 miles before entering some scattered clouds preceding some later light rain.  I could clearly see these clouds against the remaining glow of the sky from the twilight in the West.  The scattered clouds appeared to be about 4000 feet AGL. It appeared as though these craft were traveling 150-200 MPH and clearly climbed into the clouds about 3-4 miles to the west of our position.  The scattered cloud cover was advancing from the Northwest and preceding a light rain which started about an hour later.  These low clouds were above the UFOs and the local surface wind and scattered clouds were blowing lightly from the Northwest.  The low cloud layer moved in the opposite relative direction of the movement of the UFOs.  The size of these craft from our vantage point appeared to be about the size of a quarter held at arm’s length.   Our observation and video ended when they entered the clouds.

I traveled about 3 mis north, then turned west on to 74 St South. Immediately, as soon as I was facing due west I saw a very bright orange light directly in front of me. It was moving very slowly in an erratic pattern appearing to move north, then drift in an easy turn to the east (toward me), then to the south, then straight up, almost straight above. I would say it was about a 1200 feet up and almost a mile or so away when I first saw it. I was so amazed and so entranced with the phenomenon, I called my friend to tell her to go outside, she did not answer. I called her several more times hoping she was would see it, too. I could not continue to drive and watch, so I pulled over to stare with curiosity and a bit of trepidation. When I first saw it, I thought it was a helicopter, but within seconds realized it was too big, too bright and moving to erratic for a helicopter. After I parked I knew immediately it was not a helicopter or plane.  At that same second the intensity of the color got brighter and more yellow-orange.  It was sitting in the sky at about 8:00 to Jupiter, just kind of hanging around, like it was a fiery balloon floating in the wind.  It was not so large that it could have been easily covered in the sky by my thumb.  As it started to climb straight up, the fire of it flickered more intensely, but the flame itself started to die out and soon it was extinguished. However, the “object” was still visible:  it was not round, but I could see it was spherical.  It did not emit much light, but yet, I could see that it was there, lighter gray than the sky and still doing the same lazy floating pattern of drifting.  I decided I needed to get out of the street where I was stopped and go home to watch it from my back yard, which was only about 5 mins away. I lost the object then.  It was gone by the time I got home. There were more clouds, then, as if they just appeared out of nowhere; where it had been was not clear any longer.  Jupiter was there as was some duller stars, but no object. The object was very consistent with a fiery ball, although it did not sent out sparks or trail any flames or vapors, it was like watching a flame wax and wane, change color and intensity, get brighter, then snuff out.

I’m a skeptic on these kinds of things.  But I just can’t get over what I witnessed last night.  Hopefully with this post maybe someone else can help identify what it was or possibly witnessed it too.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,46.1933,-123.0548

Circular/Crown Shaped Last Saturday about 6:50pm (1 December 2012) I was leaving home heading to a local store to get in a few lottery tickets.  No sooner than I had came outside to get into my car.  I looked up into the sky as I noticed a light being emitted from some type of flying craft.  I was thinking that one seems a bit unusual as it turned and went out of view. I thought to myself, I wish I had my digital camcorder or something.  I felt as though I had missed a chance to obtain a nice shot of a UFO. Just as I got ready to get into my car, I noticed three more of these objects, first there was one, then two, then three.  I paused for a moment took out my cell phone and captured a still photo image of the vessels. I was able to capture all three in the frame of my cell phone.  As they went out of sight I got into my car backed out of the drive way made an almost immediate right turn and headed straight down the street. I noticed there appeared to be more objects approaching.  They also went as far as the others and turned into a right bank and out of view.  By this time I was wondering if more were coming as I had already see at least four. I slowed down my car reaching for my cell phone again and started taking photographic images.  I pulled over and stopped on the right hand side of the road. I managed to capture a couple more still images.  Then I slipped my phone (trail and error) into video mode and managed to capture even more evidence of this rare event. The first video displays an object approaching as if it is coming up out of a cloud and it makes me wonder if there was a mother ship over top of the cloud and obscured from sight.  In the first video it is so short that you can barely see the lead UFO moving.  However, I filmed a second video which was about 52 seconds long.  This video clearly shows at least three of the objects coming from the same direction and approaching my direction but off to the left (drivers side of the vehicle). I was able to capture some of the objects approaching and observed them flying the same pattern in the same formation as the rest. All of the objects that I could clearly see, looked the same. The bottom was a bright fiery color and was circular. Now that I think about it, it reminds me of a crown. The top portion of the vehicles was darkened into the night sky and they were all seemed to be hollow at the bottom and with an intense uniform fiery glow. These vessels seemed like their power source was centered at the bottom of the crafts and circular. In the first still image that I captured you can see a portion of what I described as crowned.  I did not note any navigation signaling lights and this is clearly displayed in the video I was able to capture. I did not bother to call the authorities or the local Air Base as I have already been there and done that years ago. I figure they are not going to tell me anything, at least not at this time. I would like to state that I would love to be working for the Government in this line of work. I do have experience as a Police Officer and was called to a UFO seen way back in 1983. This is the first time I have ever been able to capture UFO footage. I have lived around Military Installations my entire life and I have flown overseas three times. I see many aircraft around here and the all fly with navigation lights and these objects did not. I would estimate that there were about 9 - 12 uniform objects that were involved and in plain view. It is like they just rolled in and the airspace and sector was all theirs. I was so busy focusing on the UFOs and trying to obtain photographic evidence, that I didn't even pay much attention to the normal aircraft in the area.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,39.73540852059925,-84.16762780898877

This store is located in Dayton / Riverside Ohio, and very close to Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  Dad is currently buried at the local VAMC and is retired Air Force. When I stepped outside and was going to get into my car, I noticed a strange object flying overhead and breaking into a turning pattern to the right and upwards movement.  I thought to myself how odd and I wish I had my digital camera. I thought oh well, it is gone and I missed my chance to get it on tape.  No sooner than that happened and I was getting into my car, I noticed that there were three more of these flying vessels identical to the first. (All of these objects seem to have the same flight path / plan).  At this time I took out my cell phone to try and capture still images or video.  Oddly enough, I was able to capture a photo of three of the objects in one still frame photo. I thought to myself, oh well at least I got a still image photo and will look at it later.  I put down the phone and backed out of the drive-way, pulled forward and made an immediate right-turn and proceeded to travel down a street that I drive down everyday.  Oddly, enough I didn't get very far and I observed more of these strange looking vessels coming my way.  I slowed down to a stop on the right side of the roadway and started capturing what I could on my cell phone again.  This amounted to a few still images and a few short segments of video. Once the last one went by, I called my mother on my cell phone and told her to go outside and look up to see if she saw a UFO.  She did, but was unable to see anything.  She stated that it was cloudy outside.  From experience I know these objects do become obscure by clouds sometimes.  Even in the video footage that I was able to capture, clouds can be observed in the night sky.  Another strange thing is that there seems to be a moon like glow coming from over top of the clouds.  Therefore, it is possible that there could have been an obscure mother ship in the vicinity. I could tell these UFOs were not regular jets as the lighting was different looking.  There were no airplane lights mounted on them blinking at all.  There is always aircraft in this area and you will see their lights twinkle when flying over-head, or off in the distance. NOTE: The objects were dark on the top and firey orange and circular on the bottom.  The power source seemed to be coming from the bottom area and you could look up into it and observe a circular pattern.  The objects appeared to be some type of circular shape.  It is so astonishing to look at something for such a brief period of time and try to rationalize what you are looking at.  I am so use to the after-burn being on the back-end of a flying vessel that it was very puzzling. Strangely enough during this event I did note other regular jets flying at much higher altitudes but off to the far right and left sides of these vessels.  When I think about it all, it makes since that they would break off.  This is a populated area and I think it would be very bad to intercept or try to intercept these objects over our cities, unless we had no choice. This is just my opinion and is based on what I observed.  I can't say what the military or civil agencies had up and flying in the area during this time.  I did not contact anyone at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, been there done that.  I have been involved with UFO Research off and on since 1983.  This is the first time in all those years that I have been able to capture photographic images. I did some brief internet searches utilizing key words pertaining to what I witnessed and the first search turned up positive and interesting results.  I am submitting this report to various UFO Agencies within the USA as they are trained in working with the Public and private citizens in this field of research. I am a US Veteran and if called upon to work with the Government, I would gladly do so and assist in anyway I could.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,39.73540852059925,-84.16762780898877

It's not unusual to see birds that are quite large flying over the marshes. On this particular day, the Mystic Seaport Aquarium was releasing a young seal that it had rehabbed after an injury into the Atlantic on my left. At least 50 people were there watching this, so all of their attention was focused onto the left hand side of the lot on the beach. I walked past and noticed to my right, over the marsh, a very odd shaped, large object that I naturally assumed was a bird. It seemed to be just suspended up there, very slowly moving. The size was approx. the size of a dime held in my fingers with my arm extended at a 75 degree angle. Once I started to pay attention to it, I noticed that as it slowly moved, it reflected sunlight and appeared silver with a shape that made me positive it wasn't a bird. I have since looked up online for the shape and the exact match to what I saw was the 1947 Kenneth Arnold craft sighting. At this time I saw that it started to speed up, so I was struggling to get my cell phone out of my pocket to take a picture, but it streaked out of sight in a flash before I could even turn it on.

I am with a friend, who is seeing exactly the same things I am. By some odd luck, I brought my binoculars with me, so I was able to get a kind of look at them. They hover, several 100ft off the ground in the air, and sit for up to a few minutes at a time, then they slowly move away. Then one appears at the spot it was before, but they start off dim and get brighter over a period of a few seconds. They appeared to flicker. When I looked with the binoculars, they emit a sort of yellowish light, as well as a reddish light that appears to spin around them. I can't tell the shape, but they look almost dome-like, like a bell, but I can't tell, as my bushnell's only have up to 15x. They appeared above Toronto several times, but just for no longer than 30 seconds. The 2 'UFO's mostly shown up above what I think is Mississauga or Burlington direction. One appeared near Hamilton direction earlier on in my sighting. There is one posing as a 'star', staying present the whole time, between Hamilton/Mississauga, but high in the sky. Upon closer binocular view, it looked just like the rest, but had rotating green lights, as well. In the other direction, looking towards ajax area? I saw another object just like this, doing the same thing. The first 2 objects hover, so they cannot be planes.  They cannot be helicopters, because when they move, they cover ground much faster than a heli.  A heli does not explain the red and white light that rotates along it's whole body just a few times a second. Currently, they are hovering west of Toronto, what I'll call Mississauga/Oakville. One is hovering a bit away, but higher. The higher one vanishes, then the other got brighter, now it has vanished, too (10:28PM). Note: I am typing this from my phone, and the battery is dying. As I finish this email, the 2 higher stationary objects are still in the sky. The Hamilton/Burlington one has moved slowly more towards Burlington/Oakville area. One of the moving objects has reappeared. Please let me know if you have heard of this before, or any possible explanation?  If anything, this kind of made me believe there might actually be aliens out there, or maybe craft that the government hasn't shown us.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,,

I have Seen Several UFO's in the Sky Starting in July till Today 9-11-12  On an occasion around the 3rd of July, Myself and My boyfriend were laying in our backyard watching the stars, I saw a very bright light bluish light, I told my boyfriend to look at what I was seeing, then he proceeded to look and recognized it was a bigger object than I was Seeing, there was two lower lights below it, making a shape of a triangle, to me it almost looked transparent as if it were trying to blend in with the sky, the lights were on the bottom of the craft that looked flat, the only way you could tell it was a triangle was the fact you could tell it had a light on the top of the craft but unable to see it but it illuminated the shape.  As we noticed it we laid there watching it for almost 2 hours, approx. 1hr and a Half. it was rotating slowly around and it seemed as if it were floating there, around 45 minutes after seeing it, it began to move slowly away, until all the lights dimmed out and as it just disappear, than 20 to 30 seconds later it seemed like the lights powered back up like a generator does when it turns lights back on, it began moving slowly away again until it reached another spot, and stayed there, this was around 12:30 am and lasted until we got tired and went inside because it just stayed there hovering, I think more like floating, it scared Me I thought we were being invaded because it just stayed there and it was so low in the sky, no sound. I’m not good with guessing on how high I thought it was but it appeared to be way lower than any plane in the air would fly, we live almost 3 blocks away from the Grand Coulee Dam, which is a no fly zone, so it definitely scared me seeing it so low! to the ground in a no fly zone, that was the first encounter I had seeing something, after that I purchased a pair of binoculars and have been constantly watching the sky since,  We have seen objects that appear to be having orange lights strobing around it, they don’t go all the way around it they go right until it hits a spot and goes back around left, something the light switch ways and start going from left around till they hit a point and back to the right, they move straight up into the sky. Or will stay there in the same place move really fast to a different part in the sky I go inside and they stay there. I’ll wait an hour or 2 and come back and they will be gone. Nowhere in sight. We have witnessed a lot of the ""fireballs"" going very fast in the sky, with no sound whatsoever, one night we saw a helicopter chasing one, and it was trying to get away from it, moving in a zig zag, going up and down. We had 6 people with us that night. I can’t stop thinking about what these things can be, I’m freaked out about it so I finally search recent UFO sightings in WA state and found your page, and as I scrolled and read the sightings I finally feel like im not alone in this and what I’m seeing is real if they are sightings other places, I haven’t seen another triangle in the sky since the night I was saw one, That’s the one that scared me a lot, it was huge, I say it's the mother ship and maybe those fireball things are little aircrafts they take out and fly from it, whatever they are there's a lot of them. I heard there were more crops circles found near Wilbur WA. and i live 26 miles from Wilbur , WA I went to the crop circles they found around the same area in 2009, until recently I heard there was more found, if it were a hoax, I don’t see people doing it in the same spot 2 times, that’s what gets me wondering..What are they? Who are they? And why around here?",2012-09-24T00:00:00,48.0372,-118.9436

Unable to tell how far away they were but it appeared they were at an altitude much higher than the traffic pattern for the commercial jets.  They were illuminated but it appeared to be reflected light as there were no lights or beacons on the objects.  I at first thought they were two meteorites that had broken apart and were going to burn up but as I observed them, they appeared to deviate from a straight course! and turned about twenty degrees to the south in tandem.  I lost sight of them as they went behind the green belt behind my home.   I am a private pilot and a pretty good judge of military hardware.  I did not see anything that would indicate that these were conventional military craft and I did not hear any sound as they passed.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,47.53360000000001,-121.7997

I was looking north from near the intersection of Rt. 132 and Rt. 611 in Warrington PA.  My first thought was it’s an odd looking airplane or helicopter.  Though, after another look I spotted a second “fireball” moving with the first at the same steady speed just at a lower altitude.  About 10 second later a third “fireball” came into view trailing behind the first two.  All three “fireballs” were traveling perfectly level at the same rate of speed. I would estimate their altitude at no greater than 500 feet and their distance from me at a ¼ mile.   The second “fireball” seemed to fade after 15 seconds of viewing as the other two kept traveling out of my view due to obstructions.   There was absolutely no sound associated with these objects.  Because of their straight flight path, sp! eed and formation I would have to rule out any type of RC toy, fireworks or balloons.

It did not appear to be an air plane because of the reversal of direction and the.  Rightness and color of the light.

After visiting my grandmother on Saturday, August 4th, 2012, my mother and I were on the drive home from her house. It was a little after 10pm. I vaguely noticed a light in the sky, I payed no attention to it at first thinking it was an airplane. My mother then pointed to an opossum that was crossing the street. We watched it scurry to the sidewalk for a moment, that's when I looked back at the sky and realized that the light I had just seen was hovering in one spot, very unlike any airplane I'd ever seen. A split second later I realized I was looking at several hovering orange glowing lights, 5 in total if I can remember correctly, together forming a triangle/boomerang shape. My mind went immediately to the Arizona ufo/lights sightings a few years ago. I had seen a program about it on TV. I said ""mom, is that a UFO!?"" My mind hadn't fully comprehended what I was looking at just yet. We stopped at a stop sign and gawked for a few seconds, which felt like minutes. I kept saying ""I bet it's military. That can't be what I think it is."" I then began to feel very creeped out. I told my mother to keep driving. She just said she didn't want to stop looking at it. I begged her to keep driving. So she finally did. We turned right and I saw that there was a lot of lightning in the distance in the opposite direction of the lights. I don't know if this is pertinent information but I saw lightning and never heard any thunder. As we resumed driving, I looked back at the lights again and there were only three left. It then appeared that the three remaining lights were moving directions. And suddenly I could see no more of the lights. They were gone. This all seemed to happen in less than 5 minutes. Ever since Saturday I have been looking on UFO report sights to see if anyone else had seen what we had. When I saw a report here from someone else in our area that had witnessed the same thing on the same night, I just knew I had to submit a report of my own. So glad we weren't the only ones to see this! I'm pretty sure my dad thought we were crazy until we showed him the other report.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,35.738345499999994,-81.35074

As usual, I looked for cars, first to the right then to the left; however, when I looked to the left, something caught my attention out of my peripheral view.  I looked up in the sky to find three strange lights high enough in the air to be an airplane.  These lights did not look like any sort of airplane I had ever seen.  So I was quite confused.   As the lights were moving, I hurriedly shouted for my children to look out the window up into the sky, and I asked, ""Do you see what I see?!  What in the WORLD is that!??”""  Both of them were able to see the lights, and they did not think the lights looked like airplanes either.   I stayed at the stop light for a few more seconds studying the sky.  I thought to myself, there is no way that is an airplane or jet, as the lights are a strange color, and they are not blinking, so they must be balloons?  No, I know!  They must be lanterns, since they are a reddish-orange-like bright color.  They are lanterns that have been set free, like in the movies.  Yet, as I studied the sky more closely, I noticed that these objects were NOT floating UP like a balloon or a lantern would.  These objects were very quietly moving across the sky. The three objects were in a "" V"" formation, and they were traveling across the sky towards the north, towards my home.  So, knowing my husband watches UFO stories, I rushed three houses down and ran inside to get him.   By the time he came out with the video camera, the third one (that was the lead light) was drifting from the other two.  Its glow seemed to grow fainter, and it seemed to be traveling further away, when all of the sudden, it just vanished.  The other two stayed in view as they traveled further north.  We all got back in the car and followed the lights for a better view away from our huge pin oaks in our backyard.   About ten minutes later, the second light vanished just as the first had done.  We watched the last light, hoping it would not disappear as quickly.  As I was watching it, I noticed that it seemed to be changing shape, almost as if it was in a circular motion.   I remember my husband, who was taking video on the street, telling me what he was seeing AFTER! I had already seen it as well.  Our children also seemed to have a similar account as to what transpired.   A few minutes later, the third was gone in the same fashion as the other two.   The four of us sat in the street, dumbfounded and perplexed by what we had just observed.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,35.738345499999994,-81.35074

At the location where I work I have been observing something that I feel is very much abnormal and should be seriously looked into.  During the past month or so I have been noticing 2 large and exceptionally bright star-like objects appear in the sky coming from the Northeast direction.  This occurs between about 3 – 5 am.  Over the last 3 days it has been occurring between about 2-5 am.  Unlike other stars that are in the sky throughout the night, these objects change position in the sky with my movement on the ground.  No matter where I go I can see these objects from exactly the same angle.  Over the past several months I have been making this same observation but the star-like objects came in from the western sky and they usually remained in the area throughout the night.  I have considered the possibility of a private person with illegally obtained technology, attempting to harass and intimidate me and my coworker just to make himself or herself feel important.  However it has been recommended that I report this as possible UFO activity. When I make observations of unusual activity I usually have no doubt as to whether I am seeing what I think I am seeing, but I still attempt to confirm it by pointing it out to others.  My coworker said he has made the same observations and I have pointed it out to at least one other person who works in the area.  While making these observations I have never felt nervous or afraid that I was being pursued by UFO’s or Extraterrestrials.  What I have felt and still feel is mental distress from the belief that this is very abnormal and so far no one has given me any assistance whatsoever with understanding what this is. In the past I have contacted the Arizona Society of Astrologers, but no one has answered and attempted to assist in any way. Your attention and consideration will be greatly appreciated.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

Hello. I am the same guy that reported the sighting on August the 2nd after leaving the Glasgow Park. This time I was on the deck of my backyard during the brewing of the late afternoon thunderstorms that were quickly covering Northern Delaware around 5-6 PM Eastern Time.  I was sitting on my deck watching the clouds swirl as there appeared to be one frontal system coming from a Southwestern direction that was bisected by another from a Southeastern direction.  As I stand on my deck watching the clouds move with grace and speed, I noticed in the distance at what appeared to be a great altitude, maybe that of what you would typically see inbound and outbound flights appear at, but just under the main cloud layer that was forming. They were a silvery white colored and my initial thought in trying to recognize what these 2 objects were is that it may have been 2 seagulls flashing their white underbelly as the sung shines a reflection from it to my direction. Howe! ver, what happened next lead me to believe these were not birds or traditionally inbound, outbound passenger airliners as they disappeared as if they were cloaking for 2 seconds and then they reappeared in the next breath to only disappear for good after a few more seconds (another 2 to 3).  They were flying in the general direction that the storm system was heading, a Northeastern direction (they were following the frontal system that was coming from the southwest).   Both of these objects were far from where I was standing, from what I could tell but they were tightly grouped together. They did not zig or zag, they merely were flying in what appeared from my parallax as a straight pattern toward a northeast direction. Maybe due to the sunlight's distortion or other exogenous factors, the crafts appeared to be silver at first but then they appeared to be more of a pure white color. I did not see any flashing lights, just merely the objects themselves. And as for the shape o! f the craft, they were a spherical or circular fit. I did not ! see any visible wings, but that does not mean there weren't any wings b/c from my vantage point, I was quite far. The reason I decided to report this is b/c of the peculiar cloaking and reappearing nature of these crafts. I have never seen any aircraft ever do this to my knowledge. As to the specifics of weather, it was not quite raining yet, it was cool outside due to the coming frontal system, daylight was still visible although it was quickly dimming due to the dark cloud systems forming, and this is my 2nd late evening sighting within 3 days. Also, the objects left no visible contrails and I did not hear any audible jet or engine noise.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,39.65195779310345,-75.71214262068966

I was trying to adjust my eyes to make sure it really wasn't a plane…  The light became! clear and brighter, in a full circle/ball shape, about center of the cloud. It was a stable light, not flickering like a burning flare appears.  Then the round light went back into the cloud with about half the round shape visible/hanging out of bottom of the cloud, bright on the bottom and diffused in the cloud.  Suddenly the light just went out.  From the lights of the city, the little cloud was still visible with a black, perfectly round hole in it.
