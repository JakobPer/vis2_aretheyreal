I was looking out of a window in our house which looks out onto the eastern/south-eastern portion of sky, because I had noticed an unusually bright light in the sky through the blinds. My first thought was that it was an airplane heading in our direction, as we do experience airplanes and helicopters flying over and over this section of sky on a frequent basis, but this light did not seem to move from it's position at all. I would say it was similar to seeing Venus at it's brightest from our home in Colorado recently, only in the East, instead of the West, and much brighter and definitely bigger. It was just above the line of trees which grow a couple of houses away. I know the exact time, because I was awakened out of a peaceful sleep by a very loud, sudden impact noise (like the sound of a stomp on the roof, or a big door slamming closed) and immediately heard a low-flying airplane approaching, it zoomed directly past our southern facing bedroom window, low enough that I could see it's lights, going from the west to the east. I looked at the clock and it read 3:33. this is when I went into the ajoining room, sat down in a chair at our computer, and witnessed the light through the window. I was up for little more than a half-hour, all the while keeping a loose eye on this light, which in all this time, never moved from it's position. Just before going back to bed, I looked out of the eastern-facing window once more, and noticed for the first time that the light was flashing, or twinkling somewhat like a star would do, but this object was much larger than any star I've ever seen in the sky! In fact, I have never seen anything like this before at all. Around 4:00 I retucked the kids into bed, and went to my own bedroom. Out of curiosity, before lying down myself, I looked out the southern-facing window of our bedroom, to see if I could spot this light, and I just barely could. It was as bright as ever, and still seemed to be in the same position. I have no clue as to how long it had been there before I saw it, or how long it stayed after I went to bed, but I did not sleep well after that. This morning, it was all I could think about, so I immediately got online, and have searched for a couple hours for anything showing the star/planet configuration for last night and today, with no luck. finally I decided to come here, and see if anyone else has reported seeing anything similar. I am sure others must have seen the same object. Perhaps it was something easily explained. My ear will be glued to Coast to Coast tonight, though, in the hopes of hearing someone else's report.

This writer spent about 20 minutes debriefing the witness as he CONTINUED to observe this episode, which he said he had been watching for some 10 or so minutes before calling.   The witness is a 20 YOA male citizen of Stockbridge Georgia. While it is impossible to fully vet a witness without some form of in-depth investigation, during the conversation and questions, he seemed to be a sober minded and observant individual. He was in amazement while describing his observations to this investigator, indicating he'd never watched anything in the sky that performed in the manner he was witnessing.   WITNESS ACCOUNT---- On Tuesday, 3Aug04 at 5:16AM, this writer was reviewing reports previously filed to GUFOG when the UFO reporting phone rang.   The above described witness immediately explained that he had been outside of their Stockbridge home and observed an unusual LARGER than star-like light off in the distance toward the City of McDonough (Stockbridge is about 13 miles SE of Hartsfield Airport.....McDonough is about 8.7 miles SSE of Stockbridge). This light was also described as being about the size of a BB held at arm's length, definitely circular in shape, being about 1/4 of the way off of the horizon, and changing from glowing blue to yellow. Said light had been observed to move slowly, then DART up and to the right, then up and down, back and forth, moving about the width/length of witness' hand held at arm's length. The light reportedly passed behind a tree limb at one time. Witness was frustrated because he did not have a videocam or binoculars. Not knowing the exact distance to McDonough, the witness guessed the light might be about 2 miles away, and when asked, said definitely in the direction of McDonough (which is 8.7 miles SSE). The witness stated he was familiar with the various commercial air traffic all around the Hartsfield vicinity, but this was not similar to that. As the witness watched, he stated that the light seemed to change into a boomerang or V shape.   At that point, this writer decided to ring off and move to a location outside where a view toward that event location is possible. My location in Fayetteville is about 17 miles due west of McDonough. Efforts were made to observe in that direction with 7X50 and then 10X50 binoculars.......with negative results. There are some large trees obstructing part of that view toward McDonough.   WEATHER----Temperature 73 degree, little or no wind, predominantly clear, with some thin dissipating patches of Altocumulus directly over Fayetteville, but clear skies in the direction of McDonough and Stockbridge.   INVESTIGATOR COMMENTS--- Distant lights in the vicinity of a major international airport are often mistaken for something anomalous. (Hartsfield, generally about 13 and 20 miles to the NW from locations described). Additionally, weather conditions, optical illusion w/celestial bodies, as well as the natural eye phenomenon called ""autokinesis"" might also readily contribute to such an assumption.   (A subsequent phone call to the witness' residence on 9Aug04 found him to be at work. A short conversation with a family member seemed to indicate that the witness took some form of scoffing from his family for reporting his observations).   This FI feels that the Stockbridge report, while NOT of the unmistakable ""up close and personal"" variety, needs documentation for several reasons, to wit;   1) The above described witness seemed sure of what he was observing, and described it in real time to this FI. PLUS there appeared to be sufficient CLEARLY OBSERVED and RADICAL movement, to include shape changing of the light, to PROBABLY preclude any tricks of the eye or other illusion in the clear mild weather;   2) Additionally noticed by this FI were recent reports to NUFORC by Georgia witnesses...... these events being similar in nature to the aforementioned Stockbridge/McDonough case; (19July04 Atlanta-Sphere; 20July04 Lagrange-Unknown {Multiple Lights}; 23July04 Atlanta-Sphere).   3) ODDLY ENOUGH, upon taking the initial call from the Stockbridge witness, this FI had been reviewing newly received written accounts from MULTIPLE witnesses that observed an ALMOST EXACT event on 10July04 in the vicinity of Cherry Log Georgia. Said group of witnesses were in a REMOTE mountainous part of Georgia. HOWEVER.....subsequent to the aerial portion of this mountain experience, their episode concluded with an encounter with an UNKNOWN GROUND BASED GLOW and STRANGE ODOR near the position of said witnesses. This Cherry Log Georgia case remains under investigation as GUFOG looks at the possibility of natural ""night orbs"", spook lights etc., and local military operations, in an effort to identify the culprit. (Certain areas of this mountain region are used by the U.S. Army Ranger School for training purposes). If the causation in Cherry Log remains unknown to the point of indicating a suspected anomaly, the case will also be posted to the NUFORC data base upon completion of the investigation.   CONCLUSION-----Any Georgia residents in the vicinity of Stockbridge/McDonough, or any other location, that might have information regarding these events, please contact this investigator at 678-817-4555 or at; <<<georgiaUFOgroup@webtv.net>>>   Please note that GUFOG, a small group composed of scientifically oriented active and retired Georgia law enforcement officers, WILL KEEP THE IDENTITY OF ALL WITNESSES COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL, per the group's SOPs.

It seemed likely that the object was an airplane at first, because it bore the blinking red, white, and blue lights typical of airplanes.  However, after a few blocks the object was nearly directly over me, and it definitely had the shape of an isosceles triangle with the short side not much shorter than the two even-length sides. Two aspects of this sighting made it strange. First, the object was barely moving. Although I was driving, I had slowed way down to maybe 5mph and it seemed to be hovering. Becuase the car was on, I cannot say whether it was making any noise, though I heard none over my engine. Second, after driving by the object about 5 blocks, I turned the car around to look at it again. It still seemed to be hovering, so I reached under my seat to grab my binoculars. When I looked up, it was gone. I didn't see it zip away or blink out. It simply was no longer visible. There were some high clouds, but definitely higher in altitude than the object. Of course, turning off its lights would have been sufficient to hide it from my sight.  I guess I'm not an unbiased reporter, since I frequently scan the sky in the hope of seeing something.

I got back in my tent and was laying there looking out when I saw a large light in the sky above the tree line.  I could hear other campers say ""Did you see that?"", so I jumped out of my tent with my binoculars.  The light was gone.  It had only lasted a few seconds.  But about a minute later a large round orange light came on suddenly just above the trees. It was the size of a nickel held at arm's length.  I looked at it through my binoculars and it was just a very bright light.  I couldn't make out any structure.  It disappeared after about 10 seconds. I could still hear a jet in the distance and followed the jet with my binoculars.  It was far away and many miles to the right of the light. All I could see was the red light on it's left wing as it made a huge sweeping turn to the left. The next morning people were talking about the lights and someone said he had seen three different lights within about ten minutes.  He thought it was the afterburner from the jets.  I don't know what afterburner would look like but for it to have been that big in the sky I would think the jet would have to be visible nearby with the binoculars.

I was driving westbound on M-14, an expressway in Southeastern Michigan. I have driven this expressway for the last 20 years (I am a serial commuter) and I know it like the back of my hand. It was dark out and as I rounded a corner I noticed a large, bright object just over the trees up ahead of me. As I got closer, I noticed that the light came from three large circles with a flashing orange circle in the middle. They were in a triangular pattern. The light was an extremely white, very intense light. I was the only car on the westbound side of the expressway so I slowed way down to around 10-15 mph, almost to a stop. The object was about 200 feet in the air, just past the Gotfredson Road exit (going westbound), on the south side and about 50 yards off the expressway. At first I couldn’t see the structure that the circles of light were attached to but as I got closer and was more directly under it, I noticed that the lights were attached to a triangular shaped object. The only way I saw the structure was because it was slightly darker than the night sky. It had some depth but probably wasn’t more than 30 feet deep. I thought it was odd that the lights did not throw any reflection up to the structure. The lights had no reflective properties at all. Even the ground below was not lit up by any light. With as bright as these lights were and how close it was to the ground, I couldn’t understand why nothing was lit up. This thing was large. It was the size of a 747 or so, if a 747 could be triangular. The ends of the triangle were blunted, they were not sharp. The object made no noise. This particular section of the expressway has no development and is surrounded by crop fields and stands of woods. There is no lighting or large buildings. When I slowed down to a crawl, I noticed that this thing was staying stock-still and was making no noise. None. I watched the object for about two more minutes. It never moved. The only motion was the orange light blinking in the middle of the three white lights.",2004-08-24T00:00:00,42.28027533875339,-83.73625456187895

At approximately 2210 on 19 August 2004, I was in the company of a co-worker and seated on a patio in the area of East York, Pennsylvania.  The atmosphere harbored a considerable amount of light pollution, but an object appeared very noticeably.  An orange sphere appeared to be traveling from west to south-east, and traveled in a steady, fast pace, and was totally silent. This object was traveling faster than an aircraft, but far slower than a meteor.  I would estimate that the object was below the clouds, due to the distinct view and minimal dissipation of light to the surrounding atmosphere. The object was visible for approximately five seconds, and abruptly disappeared.  It was peculiar that the sphere disappeared instead of “burning out”.  Immediately after the object was visible, a helicopter traveled over our location in the exact trajectory that the orange sphere was bearing.  I can not determine if the helicopter was commercial or military, only that is was quite loud like the military variety.  At the same time, there were two aircraft traveling in different directions directly overhead.  These aircraft were at a high altitude. From 2210 until 2310 there were 18 distinct aircraft traveling in an eastern to western direction.  This seemed like an extremely high number of aircraft to be located in a particular vicinity, especially in the time period of 2210-2310.  These aircraft appeared to be non-commercial, due to the close proximity and flying pattern.  The formation was triangular and staggered. I had the impression that the aircraft were military. There was a great variety of beacon lights on these aircraft; some displayed an extremely large wingspan, giving the impression of a bomber style or “AWACS” (radar) style aircraft.  My co worker and I traveled to a location approximately three miles away, where there was less light pollution and elevated so that our view was not impaired. From 2330-0200, there were absolutely no aircraft visible.  The saturation of aircraft in the timeframe of the sighting of the orange sphere causes a profound suspicion in the witness, and is lead to draw no other conclusion that the a governmental entity was in pursuit of the same object  that I observed.  This individual contacted the York Airport in Thomasville, and received no information or further direction.  This individual also contacted Harrisburg International Airport, spoke with an individual in Operations, who then contacted his supervisor who was an FAA employee.  His response was that “Obviously the Federal authorities knew of the occurrence, but you should feel free to contact your local authorities to inform them of the situation.   This witness feels fortunate to have seen such an event, but is left with more questions than answers.",2004-08-24T00:00:00,39.96327543160691,-76.71886879150067

On the night of 8-19-04 while we were setting up our scopes and checking on the sky condition we noticed what appeard to be two satelites slowly moving together so we grabbed our binoculars to take a closer look. In the binoculars we could see a third light in the formation. The lights moved in a tight isosceles triangle formation about two degrees across with the sharpest angle at the front. Stars could be seen unaffected inside the formation. There was no sound. The lights moved across the sky in a northwest to southeast direction and maintained their exact positions in the formation. After traveling about 45 degrees across the sky the lead light disappeared followed by the other two lights that disappeared together exactly at the same line in space where the first light disappeared.  This is the second time we have observed this  type of phenomenon by Mt. Rainier. The first time occurred August 12,2001 3:20am. That sighting was similar to this one except that there were two lights moving in a south to north direction with the third member of the formation catching up to the first two lights it than slowed down and moved over towards the second of the two lights and then all three lights moved northward together maintaining their exact positions to each other. The formation continued to traveled northward for about 5 min. until we could'nt see it anymore with our binoculars.

The craft then changed direction at a 90 degree angle and then dove toward the ground at a 45 degree angle, stopping 5 feet from the ground and hovering with the craft tilted to the north. The craft was about 200 feet away across the north bound lanes of highway 5. I did not see anything else because I was driving. The craft was shaped like a Stingray with 3 white lights on the top of it. I first noticed the craft because it was not flying like a normal aircraft because of the sharp take off angle (I did not notice it taking off from the ground)and then the sharp turns, diving toward the ground and the hover.  My wife first saw the light of the craft and the saw it making a 90 degree turn and then dive toward the ground and since she was not driving noticed the stingray shape. She noticed the 3 white lights that if we used the stingray shape was two of the lights at the outside as the flippers and one light at the front where the nose would be. My wife heard noises similar to a jet engine making different noises like a acceleration and deceleration noises, I did not hear them. The craft looked to be about the size of a normal passenger car.  The area that we had the sighting was not populated as most of highway 5 is between Bakersfield and Stockton. The craft would have been sighted by cars in the north bound lanes, with a better view of the hover.

We watched it for almost 45 minuted, rewinding it, in slow-motion, freeze frame, frame by frame, we tried to analize it but still could not begin to explain it. They flew in a v formation and at one point it almost looks as if one of them get too close to another and sort of ""bounces"" off of the other, and at times you can see the formation ""adjusting"".  You can plainly see that they are in between the helicopter and traffic that was backed up from the accident on the ground.  You can also tell that they are traveling over at least 75 mph, because they are going faster that the traffic on the highway below.

On August 20, 2004 from 10:25 to 10:27 pm we witnessed a triangular shaped object moving across the sky from a north to south direction.  The event only lasted maybe 3 minutes.  It was right over our heads. Not very high at all.  The length of the object may have been large enough to allow three large commercial airplanes in it. At first glance it looked as though it was three lights traveling simultaneously across the sky.  However, I looked at this object through Tasco mini binoculars.  I then was surprised to see this was one large object with three lights located on each corner. I need to add that I saw this object tilt toward the west and then level off.  Now I have grown up in Elk Grove Village with a commercial flight path over the top of my parents’ home since I was two years old.  I have seen probably every type of plane and size.  This was something that I have never seen before.  My wife agrees that this was the strangest object we have ever seen.  What is most interesting is this object only stayed in sight for maybe three minutes.  It completely vanished right in front of us.  I don't know if it went up or we just lost it in the cloud haze.  The night was partial cloudy and then clear allowing visibility to the night stars for a while. Then a haze would roll through for short time and obstruct a clear view of the night sky. This is why I say we don't know if we just lost it in the cloudy haze rolling through.  My wife says the object did not fade into a cloudy haze.  I was busy trying to setup a telescope to look at this object closer.  I never got the chance.  We have no idea what this was, if someone does let us know.

In the sky, slightly above Wilson Mountain, I observed an extremely bright white light, which appeared to be stationary.  The luminosity of this light was exceptional, and looked exactly like the white sparklers kids use on the 4th of July.  The light was radiating out from a central point, in brilliant sparkling rays, just like a sparkler.  The light also seemed to pulse a bit, getting bigger and brighter, and then dimmer and smaller.  I was almost transfixed by it, it was so  extraordinarily beautiful, and I did not want to leave my observation of it, but I did want a photograph, and so I went upstairs to get my camera and shoot from the outside balcony there.  When I got upstairs the light was still there, but lower on the horizon, and closer to the top of the mountain.  My sense of it was that it would soon be gone, and I hurriedly grabbed my digital camera, went outside and observed it very close to the top of the mountain, and getting lower.  I took one shot, lowered my camera, and it was gone, so I do not know if I pressed the shutter in time, but my image is completely black, except for the wall of the balcony, which shows clearly.  This is unusual, because there was enough light in the sky so that the mountains should have been visible in the photo against the dawn sky,  but that area is completely black.  Something else unusual is that I do take very many paranormal photographs in which I do not see the lights and shapes that appear in my photographs, but this time, I saw a mysterious light, and the landscape in the image is completely black.  There was no noise from the light.  I looked at the clock on my kitchen oven, and the time was exactly 5:00 a.m.  This light was like nothing I have ever seen.  The color white was unparalled and pure, and it sparkled and radiated in such a way that it seemed to be intentionally wanting my attention.

I have reported this type of event several times over the past month.  Once again, I was looking east from my back patio.  The sky was mostly blue with a few patchy areas of high clouds.  I see the starlike object again, like a small point of light; through binoculars it looks like a whitish sphere.  I am an avid skywatcher and am very adept at spotting tiny objects in the sky; no one else would have likely seen this unless they'd been deliberately looking closely.  In fact between trying to find it in the binocs (my arms get tired holding the binocs up) and looking with naked eye, it was not easy to keep track of; yet it remained very nearly stationary for about 2 minutes.  As I was looking at it through binoculars, it very quickly took off moving to the south/southeast.  I did not take my eyes off it until it went past the line of my roof, which took roughly 15 to 20 seconds.  So from stationary to very rapidly moving, yet again -- as reported earlier in the month.  I was not going to report the following but since I'm submitting something, about a half-hour prior to the white sphere sighting of today, I also saw a metallic red sphere, also seemingly motionless and very high in the sky (hard to notice).  Could not tell through binocs whether it was a red mylar balloon or what; but I lost sight of it and couldn't find it again after just a minute or two.  Four minutes later, at 1.32 PM, I saw an aircraft fly overhead and over the area of the sky in which I'd seen the red sphere: in the direction of DIA (to the northeast).  Some aircraft today have been leaving short contrails, others have not. This was leaving a contrail, two streams rather farther apart than a normal aircraft; I looked through binoculars and what I saw took me by surprise.  This was some sort of military craft I'm sure; a dull gray, flattened triangle.  There was no fuselage; it was just a large gray wing, much wider than long, with the shorter point of the triangle in the direction of flight.  The sound was similar to a regular jet, although it did seem to rumble a bit longer than I would have expected as it disappeared in the distance.

I was looking North out my bedroom window and saw an unusual light heading toward our ranch house.  I retrieved my field glasses and observed a set of red, white, and blue blinking lights. The aircraft was traveling slowly from north to south and was at a 30 degree angle from where I was standing. I went outside with the field glasses and focused on the object.  The aircraft was closer now, but I could only see the lights, not the aircraft.  The lights began to blink and blink twice the rate of aircraft strobe lights.  I lowered the binoculars and watched the aircraft begin to dart about much the way a hummingbird would. This activity went on for several minutes.  The shape of the craft was not distinguishable.  The rapid gyrations were covering about 10 degrees of sweep right to left, left to right and up and down.  I hurried into the house and asked my wife to check out this object in the sky.

The object was the size of a small car and very bright and totally illuminated the car on the inside. The driver stepped on it and the object followed up to a speed of approx. 100 mph. When the car approached a few houses close to the road with street lighting, the object gained altitude - perhaps to 50-150 meters. About two kilometers later, the object suddenly turned left and crossed a fjord ca 4 kilometers wide, and took position above the drivers house. The driver arrived about 20 minutes later and the object was still above the house. Driver and passenger went inside and brushed their teeth, intending to go to sleep. As the object was still outside, the driver then went out and took some pictures with a digital camera.  The object was bright and multicoloured. The photos are not particularly clear, probably because the shutter on the camera closed because of the bright light. However, some lights in a triangular shape can be made out on one of them.

I went and got 2 sets of binoculars for us to see better.  We had a stationary tree as a reference point.  In the binoculars we could see it was round, silver and moving slowly west.  Then a smaller light, could only make out it was shining in the light, a glistening spec, blinked in slowly next to it.  The larger sphere always moved slowly west.  Thought it may have been a weather balloon.  The smaller one moved from above the sphere to below it, around it and then to the east.  The sphere moved with the clouds west.  It seemed as if the small light was moving around the sphere in several different directions at different speeds.  Then a red sphere appeared in the field.  So now 3 objects are visible all next to each other.  The small light moved southeast and blinked out.

The first object was initially seen at 8:45 am. I saw it at 11:30 am. Over a time span of about 90 minutes, the object was witnessed by at least 30 people, including campus police officers, police cadets, teachers, staff and students of East Los Angeles College. One witness is a MUFON member. He told me to note that the oject was 265 degrees west. I would estimate the object's angular distance above the western horizon at 80 degrees. The object was seen through a single lens spy glass and through binoculars. My impression was that the object was a flat oval shape, reflective with a black coloration at the bottom that I took to be a shadow. It was parallel to the horizon, not moving. I phoned in a report to NUFORC at around 11:45 am. Shortly after, a second object was witnessed by about 10 people, including the police officers. The second object approached the first one, stopped, moved around a bit then "" took off "". One witness said the second object disappeared.Campus police returned at around 1:15 pm and found the object again. About 6 people, including myself, looked at the object again through binoculars. This time the the object appeared tear-drop shaped, white and at a 90 degree angle to the horizon. It's angular distance above the western horizon had decreased to about 50 degrees. I took a digital picture in which a tiny white dot can be seen when you zoom in. My co-worker who had the original sighting starting at 8:45 am, and who found the object again at 11:30 am, returned that evening and located the object a third time at around 7:30 pm. Now the object was about 50 degrees above the eastern horizon! I took several digital pictures. The object appears as a tiny white dot. It seemed to slowly drift north.

Hello, Ok Mr. Davenport you finely wore me down.The frequent C2C reminder to report our older sightings, has worked it's charm on me... The date,as best as I can remember was early Aug. of 1975. I was 10 years old. This sighting occurred in my home town Hollis New Hampshire, which bordered the #1 city in the country to live in at the time, Nashaua N.H. Hollis sits a little higher in elevation than Nashaua which gave us a clear shot of the whole city of Nashaua including the municipal airport, and it was common to see planes take off and land at night. We must have been 4 miles away, I would quite frequently watch the planes as they made there approach to land, but this evening and the next several nights to follow changed me and are etched in my memory FOREVER... Nashaua sat southeast of our yard and at night the lights from the city cast a glow over it, above which was the glow from the setting sun and above that the dark of space. The planes were never very high, hardly ever over the glow of the city. And you could easily make out the strobe on them, they had a predictable path and were easy to identify. The objects we saw were coming in at a very high speed from the black of space, from out of the star field. They were circular luminescent spheres and seamed to arrive in two's or three's or more. They chased each other performing remarkable maneuvers, reversing direction at speeds that would have turned any human being into a puddle. Then all of a sudden they would take off in different directions at such a speed you could not track them with your eye. I ran inside and got my parents out to look, they were speechless. After a wile the neighbor kids saw us looking and came over, we all stood there staring not saying a word. Soon after the two younger neighbor boys arrived they bolted home and returned with there brother and parents in tow. Now there were 8 of us all looking at the same objects. To this day I have never seen anything like them. This continued for about a week, it eventually became almost normal to see them each night, and soon my interest waned and when I remembered to look again they were gone. I did watch them for at least 5 or 6 nights in a row. Thanks for all the excellent work you do Mr. Davenport I always look forward to hearing you on C2C & Rense. And thanks to your WebMaster as well Mr. Stepien great site easy to nav. and well laid out. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates both 1965 and 1975 as the year of the sighting.

Two very large mother ships were first observed across the lake approaching from the west. They appeared to be an iradescent glowing green from a distance, and seemed to ""fuse together"" twice while they were still approaching us. It was a Friday night at 1:10am and prior to noticing these UFO's, one witness first observed all of the stars in the sky ""shaking"" and ""pivoting"" in the sky. This was then confirmed by all other witnesses who saw exactly the same thing, before all of us were inclined to look to the west where we first saw the UFO's approaching from. The craft flew parallel with each other keeping a good distance between them, could have been a few hundred yards or more, and were silent. Their size was easily much larger than any suspected craft I had seen before, about several hundred feet long and very wide as well. As they got closer the green glow seemed to fade and their shape was something like a turtle shell oval shape but with the back flat. Many different lights glowed from the bottom, at least three rows of lights, with one particular constantly pulsating white light closest to the front of the craft. Some of these lights were strange iradescent changing colors I had never seen before. Nothing seemed to be in the back of the crafts to be powering the crafts forward, and the outer part of the ship was not itself lit, or glowing, or metallic. It seemed to be much more of a protective covering much like the turtle shell shape I mentioned earlier. The ships flew right over the north side of Lake Havasu City on a Friday night in the middle of the summer no less, so there had to be more witnesses like the hundreds of people that were probably still on the lake. The ships continued to the direct west and never appeared to be aware of our near presence, although we all experienced about 15-30 minutes of missing time prior to the sighting. This was noticed by the position of the moon in the sky both when we first all went outside, and then went back in in what seemed like a ten minute trip outside, but the moon had moved across the sky a good distance for it to only be ten minutes. No picures were taken, although they could have been, and that has always been a gigantic regret on my part and the witnesses involved. They themselves had never witnessed any sightings before this one, and I believe they still havent since. Myself, however, I have seen things since I was young and I still see things. But then again, I live in Alaska, and our skies are just as UFO active if not more active than the Arizona skies. I sincerely believe this sighting was something important in all of our lives, and the answer to who and what that was will come to us shortly.

My brother-inlaw and I were returning to our homes (in Tipton) in his truck, from our factory job in Kokomo, IN. We had driven nearly the full 21 mile drive from Kokomo heading south on US 31 to just north of hwy. 28 (appox. 800 yards north). Just across hwy. 28, behind the ""Flamingo"" motel to the west (about 800 ft. west),and in an open field, an unidentified sphere shaped craft hovered stationary, about 50 foot above the ground. It appeared about the size of a DC-8 or KC-135 jet in size. The craft was britely lit with small orange/yellow lights enveloping its ball shape. It appeared to be searching the ground below it with several intense motorised search beacons that were scanning the ground from its undercarraige. The object remained illuminated for about 15 seconds and then went ""lights out"". We saw a small red light depart the same area and pass in front of us (across US 31 and southeast bound), at instant mach +++ speed. Several other motorists ahead of us saw it as well as they applied their brakes as we did, to take in the sight. My brother-inlaw and I decided to turn off on a side road after we turned east on hwy.28, to see if we could see more activity. We turned off our headlights and pulled over on the side road. What we saw when we got out of the truck, was no less amazing. There were 2 huge vapor trails, or what looked more like rocket exhaust plumes, that arced across the sky (about 3 miles in length) from the ground where we first saw the craft hovering. Over the next few minutes we also observed what appeared to be several unlit stealth type flying aircraft, very high up in the thin cirrus clouds. Those craft soon departed, and we got in the truck and went home. I woke my wife when we got there, to show her the rocket/vapor trails and she saw them as well. There was a low pitched hum from the sky above, but not very loud. We are not crazy, we saw what we saw. It was a clear/starry evening, and the craft was solid clearly visable. I'm not saying they were aliens, expermental aircraft, maybe???? Who knows....... A shame we didn't have a camera, we could have gotten some VERY detailed photos.

I have this information in my word processing program.  I would prefer to send you hard copy of the events.  I saw them on two different occasions exactly 1 week apart at approximately 5:30 p.m.  The first one was 15 miles away from the second one.  The first one was approximately the size of a medcine ball, the second was different.  It was shaped like a set of bar bells, 15"" spheres separated by a 12"" bar of glowing light.  The light was a gloden glow like the filament of light bulbs.  Had my car windows been open I could have reached out and touched either of them, therefore, they had to be within 2"" of my face.  Both objects glowed like the filament of a light bulb.  Both were silent.  The first or perhaps both of them were highly energized.  The first one occurred during an ice storm.  My boss sent me home from work early due to the weather.  I was a bit out of Coates, Minnesota southbound on Hwys 52 & 56 when I noticed this large ball of light drifting across the field towards me. Due to the foul weather I was only driving 15 or 20 miles per hour, the UFO I would guess was going about the same speed.  The road was very icy and I couldn't stop.  It was so icy the car was sheathed in a coat of ice 1/4"" or more thick.  The ice hadn't even melted directly over the center of the engine after having traveled about 15 miles from my work place.  The ball came across the field, into the ditch and up onto the road.  I thought it was some form of ball lightening though I had never seen that phenomena previously.  It came across the shoulder and onto the pavement.  I couldn't stop because of icy road conditions.  Also, I thought I'm in a car with four good rubber tires under me and as soon as this ""lightening"" touched the car it would dissipate.  The ball came up the corner of the car and across the hood at a diagonal.  It just missed the corner post on the driver's side of the car.  It then went down the side of the car and continued across the highway and the field on that side.  It continued on it's path from the southeast to the northeast.  During it's transit, the car engine cut out cold.  I don't recall if I had to restart it as the car did keep moving, I may have turned the key again to start it.  Where it had come across the hood the metal was instantly dry.  The right side of the hood was still encased in ice.  The edge of the 'cut' was smooth as if cut by a knife. The rest of the ice remained on the car for several hours after I arrived home, my husband commented on the dry section and remaining ice when he saw the car.  Precisely one week later, same time of day, 15 miles south of the first encounter and on my own street, 1/2 mile east of my home, another UFO appeared.  This was the one shaped like two basketballs with a bar between them.  This one circled the car twice as if pearing in on me and checking my out.  Why, I don't know, but nine months later I gave birth to my only child.  The car was a 52 Chevy in almost new condition.  The contact melted the component where all the wires and distribution system for the electrical system was.  The annoyance from all electrical components malfunctioning repeatedly after that got to be too frustrating for us and we got another car.  Two men in black did come to my door following this incident.  I didn't want to get involved with them and I told them I thought it was two incidents related to ball lightening.  However, I have lived a lot of years since and have never met with the same phenomena since.  Unbeknownest to me, I had serious birth defects in my reproductive system.  When the doctors finally found them and removed my uterus; they were amazed that I had been able to have a child at all.  When this boy and I were younger we both could change traffic lights at will, switching the lights from red to green.  Since then there have been changes made in traffic control technology and that is no longer possible.",,44.6069,-92.9557

I could not move and my Siamese cat was beside me (2 times) and did not move and his body felt rigid.  Red lights whirled as if a red light rotating on top. RRR-rrr-RRR-rrr sound as it landed and the whole time. We had a part wolf dog who did not bark. The object stayed in the garden for about 10 minutes, it seemed but probably was less. Then it shot off and I was very aware of the dopler effect when it left. I think the lights became white when it took off. This happened 4 times over a period of 2 years and usually when my father's garden was flourishing. He had a lot of hybrid corn that he aquired from a friend. I told my family (I was 25-26 year of age at the time but spent Summers with my family) and they sort of laughed. Then my brother who had the room next to mine had the same experience and he heard someone going up the steps that went up to the upper yard and then believed me.  My father finally heard it and saw flashing lights in the upper yard (their bedroom was upstairs and on the other side of the house). This was probably five years after my experiences. My Father heard the sound and saw red lights through drapes but by the time he got up to look it took off.  Some years ago I mentioned to a friend who had just moved to Prune Hill if she had ever seen UFO's there and she gasped----She awakened her whole family and they watched a UFO in binoculars for 45 minutes in the middle of the night. This was probably 10 years ago. Camas is a papermill town and helicopters sometimes were heard there patroling the river where logs were often kept and I thought this was it at first but no chopper blade sounds. It was too close and I would have heard the blades. My explanation of landing there several times was to get samples from the garden.

When I lowered the camera, two more lights had appeared to the right of the first light, with one being distinctly further back, forming a triangle pattern.  The first light moved behind some trees, while the two newer ones remained hovering for a few moments.

I think the reason that we see the same sightings quite often is because we are star gazers. I couldn't possibly count how many crafts I have seen, but I know it would be over 50. I just now found this site, so I thought I would report my sightings that I have had over the years. The first time I seen these ufo's was when I had just got a brand new telescope for christmas in Hawaii. I decided to take it out the night I got it to look at the moon. I was amazed by the detail I could see with the telescope, and I even got to see Saturn behind the moon. After I had my fun with looking at the moon and Saturn, I was packing up the telescope pieces and loosening the scope positioner. I looked up for a second to just gaze at the stars and wonder whats out there, when I seen a light, which I thought may have been an airplane at first. I stared at it for a while waiting to see the lights blink, but it never happened. I continued to watch as it went further and further. I called to my Step-brother to come look at what I was seeing. He was amazed by it also, and we both noticed that it seemed to be slowing down. It slowed down to where it looked like it was not moving at all, and then made about a 90 degree turn and headed south of the island of Oahu. After about 30 seconds it sped up, and left nothing but a streak of light across the sky that laster for about 2 seconds. We were both stunned by this, and talked about it the whole night we stayed up. We have also had an ocassion where a number of people seen what we spotted. One night one of our neighbors were having a party for their friends daughter's birthday, and me and by step-brother were told to come over. We hung out by the trampoline, and talked with all the other teens there. We ended up getting on the topic of UFO's some how, and that led me to tell my story of what me and my step-brother had seen. After I told the story we all looked up and I noticed, out of the corner of my eye, a small-bright object going very fast. This was very different than the first one I had seen because it was more hostile. It was moving in a violent way, zig-zagging, and turning sharp. I told everyone to look to where I was pointing, which was West of Oahu. An overwhelming fear came over the crowd as they looked at the object. We continued to watch, and more gazers came out to see what we were looking at. That same night, when me and my step-brother left the party and were on our way home, we both happened to be looking north-west, when we seen what looked to be an explosion, or super nova of a star. It lasted for only a split second, but was so bright that I could still see it do to the strain it put on my eyes. We didn't have any other reports of it on the news, and I wondered why. It had to have been seen by more people than just me and my brother. There are many more sightings of UFO's that I have seen, but they will not be described here, as there is too many to remember.

I called the manager over to observe it and he was also astounded by it. It was stationary from when I first  observed it until it started moving(drifting?) slowly from east to west. The stationary position lasted about 2 minutes. We observed several commercial jet aircraft on flight paths directly below it also. I can easily say the the orb was about 10,000 to 20,000 feet up. It drifted then for approx. 10 more minutes and stopped for about 30 seconds and vanished from my sight. What is very strange is that it just disappeared. It didn't shoot up furtherinto the distance or zoom off, it just disappeared. Vista is south of Camp Pendelton Marine base.

I think I mentioned to you in my last communication with you that over the last few years we have experienced some pretty amazing sightings right from our back yard here in Saskatoon, but I never took the time to report them to anyone. After each experience, I always tend to think, well, that will be the last one we will every see, but it definitely isn't turning out that way. It seems myself, my family, are seeing way more than our fair share.  I do plan on sitting down and writing a report  of descriptions of what we have seen over the past few years, but for now, I thought I would send you a quick report of what we have seen over the last few days, with a couple of photos attached. On June 28th, my wife and I were sitting out on our back deck around 5:00 p.m. discussing our day when I noticed something in the sky to the east. From past experiences I have learned to always have a pair of binnoculars close by on the deck, and immediately grabbed them and focused in. I think my wife could see my jaw drop as I asked her to quickly run into the house and get a Christmas present she had gotten for me just for this purpose, binnoculars with a built in digital camera. While she was doing that, what I was focused in on was a series of bright white spheres, very high up, but yet very clear. I would say a series of 9 spheres that where joined to form a unbroken ring. I could even see the blue sky through the middle of the ring. The ring kept changing shape from almost a circle to oval and everything in between. I was stationary at first and then, the best way to describe it was, it just kept increasing in altitude until it disappered. Any ways it turns out that the batteries where dead in the binnoculars with the digital camera, so no photos of that one. Needless to say, we replaced the batteries. The very next day, at the same time of day, we where out on the deck again talking about the day before, both of us not expecting anything, but sure enough, as we were talking something out the corner of my eye caught my attention. In almost the exact same location as the day before. Again, grabbing my binnoculars (without the built in camera, that one is sitting on top of the fridge in the house, geez) I focused in on a single sphere, very metalic looking as you could see light refecting off of it. Moving very slowly towards us from the east, it was hard to tell if it was changing in size or just increasing in altitude. What ever it was doing, it was doing it every few seconds. Something I hadn't seen before was a strange haze or distortion of some kind around the object, almost making it blurry at times. Meanwhile, my wife had run in and got the binoculars with the camera and I managed to get a few photos which the best two are attached in this email. Although not very dramatic, I think they give you the idea of the shape and also the distortion around the object that becomes clearer when you enlarge the photos. Have a look and any comments would be valued. An interesting aspect of what we have been seeing here is that they are all in broad daylight.",2004-07-08T00:00:00,52.1078373650108,-106.66923239740821

Witnesses say they saw a large, fiery object zigzagging through the sky at about 5:30pm yesterday.  The witnesses say the object left a trail of thick smoke and then they heard a bang.  The observatory says it appears the object was travelling somewhere between Perth and Albany in a south-south easterly direction.  Walpole resident Heather Burton was in her backyard when she saw the object.  She says it was unlike a normal shooting star.  ""A shooting star usually just goes straight across or straight down - this one had these gradual zigzags just coming down,"" she said.

""We're certainly picking up reports of a bright fireball and sonic phenomena associated - I'm absolutely sure - with the fall of a meteorite,"" Dr Bevan said.  Dr Bevan says it will be difficult to find where the meteorite landed.  ""Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be as many observations, so actually pinning down where the object landed might be a bit difficult and in that area, the vegetation might mean searching for it would be difficult,"" he said.",2004-07-08T00:00:00,,

My friend and I were coming home from a casino taking the back roads home as we normally do. It was a bright night out-almost a full moon and the stars were very bright. Very clear. We were coming up a hill and at the top of the hill on the other side of a row of trees was a bright blue light. I was driving slow because the area is known for alot of deer. The light was nothing I had seen before and I asked my friend to look at it. I slowed down to almost a stop and observed it for a short time. We were talking about it being a strobe light like on a police car or something, but it was solid blue and wasn't emitting light in a fixed manner. It was almost throwing light like a laser but like ribbons of light. It didn't light up the field it was in so you couldn't see what it was attached to. We discussed it being a tractor but the light was so weird I had never seen anything like it before. Then the light started coming  straight towards us at a fast rate and I freaked. I hit the gas and started down the road. I told her to keep watching it and tell me what it does. We came upon another hill so we lost sight of it for a second then she said that it must have been an airplane because it's in the sky now. I asked her what it looked like(I couldn't see it-we had an old Rambler car and I'm missing the side mirror). She said she wasn't sure what kind of plane or what it was. Then I told her I would stop and take a look. We slowed down and I rolled my window down and I looked out and I knew immediately it wasn't an airplane or helicopter. It had two panels of light on it and they were changing colors randomly from left to right. They would be green, yellow, red, white, orange and blue. At this point I had no doubt in my mind what it was we were observing. We were a ways from the next town and no cars on the road so I drove the old Rambler as fast as it would allow. The thing in the sky followed us at a distance of maybe a mile. When we came to the next intersection and I had to turn it turned wi! th us and kept following us out the right side. It stayed a mile away from us at all times until we got to the next town. There is a lake there and it was hovering over the lake and that is the closest it got to us. We got to a major highway 4 miles down the road. I figured we would wait for a car and follow it. We waited at the stop sign but nobody came so we sat and watched for it and it appeared north of us again. I sped out for home-15 miles. My friend saw it only once in the next 4 miles. It stopped dead in the sky and headed due east and a high rate of speed. We had to go through another small town to get home yet and nobody was in sight so we kept speeding home. We never saw it again until we got home and it was coming at us about 1-2 miles out over town. The lights were doing the same thing on it the whole time it followed us. We were so freaked out we headed home and ran in the house and thought about what to do next. We went into the yard after our blood pressure came down to look for it but nothing but stars and the moon. Thank God.",2004-07-08T00:00:00,,

We were commenting on how nice the weather is and looking up at some very high, light clouds and someone pointed to a normal high-flying plane in the sky, which is common since we are close to O'Hare Airport. As all of our attention was on this plane, we all spotted another object, much higher in the sky, which was in the same line of sight.  It looked about the same size as the high altitude plane, despite apparently being much much higher.  It looked white and moved about 1/20 the speed of the normal looking plane (very slow).  Our impression was that it was so high, it might have been the International Space Station.  However, upon looking up the current location of satellites and the station on NASA's public J-Track website, the station was actually over Africa and no satellites were overhead at this time at all.  The object moved so slowly in the sky that I was able to run inside and grab some low power field glasses I keep in my office.  As the object moved slowly in the sky in north by northwest direction we were able to watch it for about 5 minutes. Under the field glasses it looked like two large globes with a large metallic connector.   The size must have been enormous considering the extremely high altitude we observed it to be.  Wind speed and direction at the time as reported by the O’Hare weather station was due West 8mph.  Although I know wind speed and direction at very high altitudes can differ dramatically, this is clearly at odds with speed and somewhat at odds with the direction of the object we observed.  The soft, wispy clouds I referred to had the dispersed chem-trail look to them familiar to us in IL.  Depending on the object’s size, it may have been at or just above that altitude.  Can anyone offer an explanation? Perhaps chem.-trail related? Perhaps a secret DoD blimp of enormous size as has been reported to exist?",2004-07-08T00:00:00,,

She said to look to the East and see if I can spot 3 red lights just hovering in the Eastern sky. My wife and I, along with a few neighbors were siiting in my driveay enjoying the evening and waiting for Trick or Treaters when I recieved the call. After a few seconds I, along with 2 of my neighbors, spotted 2 red lights in the East, North East, sky, about 20 degress above the horizon with 90 degress being directly overhead. One light was directly above the other separated by a few degress. The bottom one moved a little South then went back to being right under the other one. The sky was becoming overcast so we lost them both with in a few seconds of each other. I received another phone call about 90 minutes later from the same family member telling me to go look outside again because one of the lights had returned. From her vantage point she told me to look a little to the West from dirctly overhead. I could not see any thing in that direction. So I looked in the direction where she lives and we, (my wife, son, and I), saw 1 red light in the sky identicle to the ones earlier. The light was North, North East from my location. I live South West of Tinley by @ 12 miles or so. I knew we were looking at the same light because I could see airplane traffic in the vicinity and I would ask her if she saw the same traffic and she concurred. We watched this together over the phone for a minute or so before I lost it in the cloud deck. Soon after that she lost it too. I am an aircraft technician by trade and my hobbies include astronomy and photography. I had a few of my pictures of the Perseid Meteor shower on display at the planetarium in Chicago. My neighbors and my wife and I also enjoy satellite watching on summer nights. I am familiar with the differnce between aircraft, satellites, and meteors as to their apperance in the night sky. As a point of interest, I saw 3 white, satellite colored objects, back in late August at @ 21:00 passing directly over head in a triangle formation. They were heading South with the base of the triangle leading the way. It was not a solid object between the points of light because I saw starlight between them. No one else saw this for I was alone at the time. As I stated before, I look for satellites all the time and have been since I first saw one as child. I've spotted countless times were there were more than 1, sometimes 4 satellites visible at the same time in the sky, but I've never seen where they seemed to be flying in perfect formation, and had the same brightness between them. I did report this to a different website at the time but to no avail. I came across your website in searching for others who might have witnessed this.

I took my Canon A80 digital camera which has a 11x digital zoom and snapped some pictures at full zoom.  They are blurry at best but do show the metallic coloring.  I then looked at the craft with a pair of cheap binoculars I have in my car.  I was able to make out 3 things.  First of all the Craft consisted of three parts.  The top was an indescriminate shape, neither round, nor square, but has mass like a crumpled up bunch of aluminum foil.  The second part in the middle was square and segmented like 4 or 6 silver lady fingers.  There then was a silver line going down a hundred feet or so, and I couldn't see what was hanging on it but it was a small white dot. It hung in the air for around 10 minutes and then when I came outside from a store 5 minutes later it was completely gone.  If I had to say what it was my first impression would be a long distance travelling ballon, like the ones millionares use when they try to travel around the world.  But the top of the craft had no distinctive sphere shape and was not at all like that.  Perhaps it was a survelliance craft of some sort?   There were some aircraft in the air, just passenger jets and they seemed below this craft, and they were very small themselves.  I am posting hyperlinks to the images I took along with a sketch.

The wife and I were returning from mushroom hunting in the Blewitt Pass/Snoqualmie pass area on Saturday afternoon. We stopped by a river to fish around 7pm, and I decided to rest a bit, and have a smoke break and watch my wife fish the river. The sun was going down over the mountains, and the sky was clear. There were some faint stars becoming visible and I looked up towards the northeast, over a mountain and saw an unusual looking 'star'. I say 'unusual' because it wasn't a 'whitish' color but more of a whitish/bluish color, about half the size of the north star. I watched this object for a minute, then realized it was moving very slowly, what appeared to be coming towards us.  It was difficult to estimate the distance or altitude of the 'star', but I would guess it to be at around 7500 AGL, and I can't even guess at the distance. I am a commercial pilot and have been flying for close to 30 years, so I know what aircraft and other types of objects look like. Anyways, about maybe 2 minutes later, the object is getting brighter, again with a bluish tint, and it appears to coming towards us.  There is no noise, and at this time, I yelled to my wife to come look at this object. She came over, and quickly ran to our SUV to get my binocs. I stood watching the object while she was looking through the binocs, saying........'oh my God!!'........I got a look through the binocs and could make out what looked to be a perfectly round, translucent 'orb', with lights around the outer 'edge', if there is such a thing, on a round object. About this time, the hairs on the back of my neck are standing straight out, and I get this very uncomfortable feeling of being 'watched'. I'm probably mumbling someting while watching this thing for another minute, and then, suddenly, it shot straight up and disappeared. It was one of most unusual objects I or my wife have ever witnessed. There was no noise from the craft, and where we were fishing, there was no sound at all, we could not even hear the sound of the river, since the water was so low, so, it was dead silent out. I would estimate that we watched it for about 4-5 minutes total. The sky was clear at the time and no other aircraft flying in the area.",2004-09-29T00:00:00,,

Through binocs, it was a steady, white sphere, but to the naked eye it resembled a bright star or planet shining in the blue sky.  Using the overhead wires as a guide, I confirmed the object was stationary, and remained so for 20 full minutes, not wavering at all, while clouds passed either through or behind where the object sat.  The clouds were so thin and wispy it was hard to say.  At about 6.25 my 16-yr old daughter came home and I called her out and she looked at the object through binoculars, and said it just looked like a white ball.  Her 19-year old friend arrived at about 6.30 and also came out and took a look at it through binoculars.  We were discussing how strange it was that it seems whenever I look for this sphere, I see it.  I looked up again after a few seconds of not looking, and it had vanished.  We were all very surprised that it had been shining so brightly and then suddenly disappeared.  The time was 6.35 PM. The only thing I can determine may have led to it vanishing is that the sun may have dipped far enough behind the mountains that, if reflecting light, it very quickly lost its light source.  But we all agreed that it was an inexplicable sighting.  The two other witnesses are willing to make a report, should you wish to interview them. ((ADDENDUM FROM THE WITNESS)) Following is a correction to a report I made Sunday evening.  Instead of the object appearing about 30 degrees south of zenith, it was in fact about 30 degrees EAST of zenith. ((END))",2004-09-29T00:00:00,39.615879827400214,-104.88518732470335

This may be nothing to really report because I have this scrutinizing suspicion of what I saw was just possibly one of those parachute rides being pulled by a boat. On April 16, 2004, I was working outdoors on the new condo construction which is located inside the bay area in Orange Beach, Alabama, and it is nearly in direction in front of the Alabama point bridge which is located near Orange Beach, Alabama.  At 12:00PM, I took a lunch break.  While I was taking my lunch break under a shade, I was admiring the beach direction view of this condo location.  I was wearing polarizing sunglasses at the time.  I noticed a helicopter flying around in the air.  It was a small helicopter like those of a small Huey or traffic watcher type.  It kept slowly flying around in the general area inside the bay/gulf channel near the bridge on the fishing side.  It would occasionally descend in each pass where people fished then ascend back to its slow, flight pattern of just wandering around near the bridge area.  My first thoughts of this odd flying behavior was a news helicopter trying to make some news because of the recent bonanza of whitings congregating at the fishing site. To the left of the bridge are two condos located on the bay side which I think are still under construction, and the height of those buildings I think is twelve floors.  On the Gulf side of those condos is undeveloped land and the beach.  From the bridge to my location, I think the distant is about one mile.  From the bridge to the two condos, I think the distant is about one-eight of a mile.  From the condos to my location, I think the distant is about one mile.  The sky was partly cloudy, and the temperature was about 80 degree F.  While I was watching this helicopter flying around, I noticed what appeared at first to be a large balloon drifting in the wind.  The size of the balloon object is about the same size of the condo's window from my viewing location.  Its path when first seen originated by the bridge and possibly out in the Gulf near the beach.  The balloon object altitude was above the two condos, and the balloon object altitude was at least 1 and a half condo high from my perceptiveness. The balloon object had no colors except for a minute grayish color that reflected no sunlight similar to the color of a water droplet. The balloon object was perfectly round.  As this balloon object moving from west to east drifted pass the two condos starting from the bridge in an estimated time of about 30 seconds to a minute; the balloon object completely stopped drifting and almost seem to hover in the same position for about 15 seconds.  Then the shape of the balloon object changed to something not roundish.  Its color also changed to something like a black dot but still not roundish in shape.  Then this object travel back towards the bridge location at same speed of 30 seconds to a minute.  Then it stopped and reverse coarse towards the two condos.  It appeared to get slightly smaller.  Then about half way towards the condo, I saw for a brief moment a color of paper white appear for about 3 seconds, and it was definitely not a sunlight reflection.  I realized that this was no balloon, so I was trying to figure out what it could be.  After the fourth back-and-fourth trip of this object, an advertising plane appeared trailing its advertisement.  The object on its way back towards the two condos seem to disappear from view behind the two condos.  I was waiting for it to reappear on the left side of the two condos which it did not reappear. On the right side of the bridge are some condos.  I notice a bright red/orange parachute probably being pulled by a boat.  The distant to those condos is about a mile.  The size of that parachute ! from my location was about the size of a quarter if I was to held it up in front of me.  When comparing the size of the object to the parachute, the object was like a pea to the parachute.  Then the object that disappeared behind the two condo reappeared from the right side of the two condos.  I thought to myself, ""I wonder if the helicopter pilot is seeing what I am seeing?  Surely if there was something out of ordinary, he would investigate it.""  I was thinking, ""Gee!  If only I could talk to the helicopter pilot and ask him to investigate what I was seeing, then he can tell me what he saw.""  I took off my sunglass to see if I could still see the object without the aid of the sunglass, and I was still able to see the object, but not as good, so I put the sunglass back on me.  I kept watching this object going back-and-fourth between the bridge and the two condos when I noticed a white dot way out near the horizon in the Gulf.  It was probably about 5 to 10 degrees above the horizon, and intermittently it was hidden by the clouds.  It didn't look like it was shining a light, but it did appeared to be just a paper white dot.  It is possible that it could be a jet coming towards my direction, but that object defiantly did not pass over my location to get to the spotted location unless it was flying way up high if it did pass location. All of this viewing took place during my 30 minutes lunch break.  When I went back to work, I was still able to see the object, and I explain to one of my co-workers what I saw during my lunch break.  I pointed in the direction of the object and my co-worker was able to see it too.  He seem like it was nothing since he just glanced at for a few seconds, but I find it strange that all this object did was go back-and-fourth during my lunch break.  If it was one of those parachute rides pulled by a boat, it would had to been at least 2- 4 miles out in the Gulf.  Another possibility of what the object may had been was another helicopter, but when I first saw this object, it was perfectl! y round and drifting almost like a balloon.  When I first seen the object, it may had been up closer, but possibly it may had zig-zag a coarse out into the Gulf becoming smaller as it went which may explain how the two condos were able to make it disappear for a brief moment.  It may be nothing, but I saw it, and I can't explain it, so I'm reporting it.",2004-04-27T00:00:00,30.2802,-87.5918

Around 8 p.m.  I was alerted to check out the UFO's outside the house. There were 4 round orbs and they were basically the color of fire. One moved over the neighborhood and seemed fairly close, perhaps as low as 2000 feet, but it did not seem  to be terribly high over the rooftops in the neighborhood. Rather than acting shocked or suprised, I tried to observe carefully along with the other witnesses. These objects made absolutely NO sound. No helicopter sounds. No sounds of a plane or jet. No sound whatsoever. They would hover and then move in linear directions, occasionally gaining in elevation. But they would not ""bob"" or ""bounce"" as they moved. They traveled a slow but still manner. They seemed to exercise control in their movement. At one point the other three traveled further away and up into the night sky becoming smaller and presumably more distant. At this point two of these orbs dissapeared. They did not fade out, but simply disappeared. The effect was like holding a lit match and then blowing it out. That quick. The third object continued to travel away off into space until it was no longer visible to us. Then the last remaining one which at one point seemed so close appeared to drop three little balls of light while it was moving.  Yet as these little orbs were released they would dissapear maybe 1 to 1 and1/2 seconds after being dropped. Finally this last object  took off up into the night sky and was gone in barely second. According to one of the witnesses who is one of my family members, there were other people along the street watching this event take place. We all agreed it was very strange and that the objects appeared to be under some sort of control.

Our friends , father and daughter also watched it for several minutes before it went behind trees and horizon. There was no following tail, no noise, nothing else in the sky, clear evening, no wind and it was traveling opposite of where winds normally originate. I'm sorry but this is unexplainable to me . We checked the internet for comets, strange objects or anything else and found nothing so we went to this site and called in a report. Just for validation the two witnesses make around 6 figures each, are homeowners , married for ever and our daughters are A students or grounded, no wacko's here. The grossly enlarged pictures show an elongated smokey or hazey cigar or streak. I will send the pictures on friday since I am in Denver until then.

At approximatly 2030 hours MST 11/07/04, there was an object in the North Eastern sky that was about the size of a nickel. Though there is no way to estimate distance. Call it the size of a thumb nail with the thumb held at arms length.  The unusual part of the object was that it had many red lights that flash around the perimeter in a half arc (Northern half). There appeared to be about six or eight of them although they were difficult to count as they flashed in a random manner. If this object was at a great distance from where I was standing, that would cover a very large arc. The object appeared to be green, although there could be flashing green lights also. It had green highlights that came and went. They too appeared to be random as to placement. It also showed a great deal of yellow although the red and greens kind of overpower the yellow. Further, the yellow seemed more concentrated at the middle of the object. The colors were not opaque, they were distinct and bright.  My first thought at seeing it was an airplane with navigation lights and the cabin lights on brightly. However, it didn't move. Not in any direction. I was visiting a friend at his house and called him out to view it also. He saw the same as I and got his binoculars. What we then saw was the same thing, just a little more clearly. The most powerful he had were 7 X 50's. We watched it for about a half hour when some cloud cover moved between us and the object and we could no longer see it clearly at all. (Although it was still vaguely visible.) One of the main points being, it did not move in all of that time.  I have since come home and can still see it but not clearly at all. I have to look though tree limbs as well as the cloud cover.  The second part of the evening that is interesting is that we saw what appeared to be the Northern Lights, but.... they went from the western horizon in a complete arc around to the east. I've seen the Northern Lights many times from here, but NEVER in a 180 degree arc. An odd part of that is they appeared to start from the horizon and arc up to a single point just slightly south of overhead. I have seen the N/L's jump and shimmer all over the northern sky, but never arc to a single point overhead here in Montana. Both the eastern lights and western lights as well as those from the north all arc'd to that single point.  Just to mention, that point was no where near where we saw the object. It was in the lights, but in a much more easterly direction.  I still wonder about airplane, but have never seen one of those with an entire series of lights that flashed in a large arc. Nor one that appeared to be an disk.  Such fun. I have never seen anything like it in either case.  To add, my location is about 8 miles east of the town of Lavina, Montana out in the hills. There is no possible local lighting that could have caused that. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the witness for the original report, and for the follow-up, which allows us to close this case.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) But, was wrong. Thank you for your response, Mr. Davenport. Tonight the sky is clear and I went just went out and looked again. Sure enough, it is there. So you are correct. (As you knew, I'm sure. lol.) I do kind of believe the Northern Lights affected what I saw last night (wondering about which being partly why I included that in my report to you) for I had never seen coloring quite like that. Yet the star is there in the same place and while not as bright tonight (northern lights have not been turned on at this time) it does have the chromatic effect and the coloring is there, merely not as pronounced.  Which must be why I have not noticed it before. I do watch the sky frequently. Be assured, if I see another 'flying star' I will contact you again. Be well. ((END))",2004-11-09T00:00:00,,

It moved ""smoothly"" across the sky, and no type of movement that would be consistent with flapping of wings was visible.  Moreover, even though the object was not well lighted, its shape seemed to be peculiar.  It appeared to be either triangular, or ""boxy,"" in shape, although that is a subjective analysis.

This compares to a similar sighting in June 1982. Montreal Expos hosted the annual all star league game. At midnight Nov 7th ( sunday night, our telephone rang , my 17 year old son answered. It was his sister on the phone telling him to ""wake Mom, there is a magnificent aurora outside"" He folloed her request and imediately came to get me out of bed to come out to look with him. I love all celestial phenomena and since I had alredy been woken by the telephone, I got up to look with him. Before I even opened the back door, I was obvious that there was something spectacular overhead, as I could see incredible distinct rays touching down on the horizon behind our home. I opened the door and we both observed that the rays were now all around us , 360* ! ""Wow ! He exclaimed...What is Northern Lights anyway ?"" I told him that there are many theories, that it didn't matter because this was not northern lights. And as the verse resounded in my brain, the words spilled out of my mouth...""And the glory of the lord shone 'round about them, and they were sore afraid"" ""What..What... What the hell are you talking about ?"" ""Mom you are freaking me out"" I recound the sighting that his father and I shared on that night in 1982 ... It's exactly the same ! What we saw last night was a central swirling light emiting source. Rays of light radiating from its periferal. It had several central lights like that from an airplane or boat would have in indicating port or starbord sides . There were six or seven such lights. In our initial sighting , these such lights seemed to be hovering and moving in and out from this central port of swirling mist/cloud. Last night , I was really spooked, as I was sure I knew this was the same thing, which we had observed so many years ago. We are sure this was a sort of mother ship, with several anex/scout type craft that seemed to be doing reconaisance flights. The Indcredible lights , rays and swirling effects , we concluded , are perhaps a kind of cloaking...radar block ...I don't know. My daughters account, will no doubt be more spectacular, as she was out in the woods of Ile Bizard , calling and communicating by cell phone with other friends in other regions whom she also allerted of the phenom. My husband wakes every morning at 4:45 am, I got up with him, and the light rays were still prominent in the sky. This morning, I have spoken to a few people who have heard of, or that they observed nothern lights last night. Their sighting was much earlier , aprox 8:00 pm and in the area of the laurentian mountains, St.Sauver area.

I have never seen anything like that and neither has my husband.  I know that Venus passed by the sun the next day so is it possible that Venus was able to be seen the evening before also?  It looked alot like a shooting star or meteor with the exception that it was alot larger, brighter, and was traveling horizonally instead of vertically and seemed to be just above the treetops. I could not even begin to tell you how high or how big the object was but if you hold your index fingers together and your thumbs together to form a circle and extend you arms all the way out, that is aproximately how large it was in relation to where it was located and how far away it was. It could have been a large object very far away or a fairly smaller object closer to us but it was too bright to really tell but it seemed to be approx. about 100 feet away and up just above the treetops. Please feel free to contact me and let me know if anyone else has reported this same object. I did not know where to look to see if any other strange sighti! ngs were reported that night in this area and this is the first time I have ever gone to a site dealing with this subject. Our neighborhood is very quiet with very few street lights so I doubt it was seen over by us but hopefully it was seen by someone else in Crestview.  It's kind of difficult seeing something that cannot be defined or explained.  Needless to say, we did not go walking last night or tonight.  Maybe tomorrow though.  Thank you! ((NUFORC Note:  We, at first, thought the sighting might have been caused by an overflight of the International Space Station, but the ISS was not visible over Florida on this date.

Then it turned into one big red light. I called for them to come back and look. Just as they were getting back to the door, it became one large white light again. Then I watched it slowly turn and became really bright, then dim again. Everyone alse went back into the house because they though I was joking, but then it turned red again so I called them back. As they were coming back, it turned into a long line of several red and orange flashing lights, like you would see Christmas lights in their running fashion. It had an orange glow over the top of it.

Just back from walking the dog around the block for the usual 10 p.m. jaunt. I live on the eastern edge of Reno, along the Virginia mountain range. A few commercial planes in the sky, as I'm about two miles east of Reno Tahoe Intl Airport.  But coming from the northwest was a strange thing. Two reddish blinking lights seemingly connected, but at a distance that would fit maybe four commercial planes between them. No sound, either with or following the pair of lights. I *think* I could make out dim stars between the lights, but I'm not sure.  It covered the sky at a lazy speed. (One commercial jet was at about 7,000 feet moving in for the landing loop they do from the south, and the jet was moving faster. Reno is at 4,500 feet elevation.)  This was a weird one. I guess it could've been some sort of military jets flying at very high altitude in perfect time with each other, but if so I've never seen such jets before. (We've got a big Naval Air base about an hour away, and every now and then we see/hear a fighter jet over Reno.)  I watched it for the second half of the walk around our very long rural block, and stood outside my house watching as it disappeared over the Virginia range.  It appeared to be *huge.* And, to clarify the direction in case anybody else saw this thing, it went from the northwest to the southeast. (Not a satellite -- we have a pretty clear sky here and enjoy watching the space station when it comes over our part of the world, especially in the summer when my family is out on the deck.) A pair of blinking aircraft-style lights, but very erratic in the flashing. I held my hand up and the distance between the lights was about four fingers wide.  I'm very interested to hear if anybody else saw this thing. It is still fairly early and lots of people are out for the famous Reno old-car show, Hot August Nights.  My dog didn't care. He was sniffing the garbage cans & such, as tomorrow is garbage day. I'm sorry I didn't get a picture. It wouldn't have been much of a picture from our cheapo digital camera, but anyway it was headed over the mountains as I got back to the house.  I've seen one thing previously that might have been a ""UFO."" That was about three-and-a-half years ago with my wife, driving up the 395 between L.A. and Tahoe.

On August 21, 2004 at approximately 10:10 P.M. CST I noticed a very odd phenomenon  over Interstate 90/94 southbound between Poynette, WI and DeForest, WI.  My wife and I were driving home from central Wisconsin from a friends cottage.  No alcohol or drugs were consumed at the outing. It was a very clear night and the stars were very visible.  My wife and I both noticed a bright white light in the sky.  She asked what it was and I responded jokingly, a UFO.  It was extremely bright and was composed of four lights in a row flying perpendicular to our line of travel.  At first we thought they must be landing lights on an airliner.  However the four lights in a row were not right.  Usually there is some separation between the lights. There was none.  Between us and the lights there was a microwave tower with a red light on it,  the lights appeared miles beyond the tower.  We passed the tower in about a quarter to half mile.  Then the lights started to descend.  I thought it might be a plane landing at the Dane county airport a few miles to the south.  But it wasn't turning toward the airport as it should have.  It proceeded straight across the highway about what initially looked to be about a quarter mile ahead of us.  It then came down very steeply and I though it was going to crash in the woods next to the highway.  Instead the lights dropped in intensity until it looked about the size of a flashlight.  It then winked out and appeared to land on the shoulder of the road directly to our right.  When it winked out it was the size of a computer keyboard and appeared to fly into the woods next to the road.  It was not a bird.  We could not stop as it was a crowded interstate and had a steep ditch next to the road.  We proceeded home to Madison and I filed this report.  It was definitely an Unconventional Flying Object.",2004-08-24T00:00:00,43.066514168714164,-89.38736175266175

Witness One: At 3:39 pm on August 31, 2004 I was out on the balcony of my sixth floor residence in a large building inside the no fly zone in Washington, DC.  The day was perfectly clear and I was looking at a contrail in the sky attempting to determine if the contrail was currently being formed.  My sister joined me on the balcony and I pointed to the contrail and told her what I was trying to determine.  She looked away and started to sit down and I saw a large object appear out of one cloud.  I looked at it for a second or two, realized that I could not distinguish any features that I would normally recognize in a plane.  I immediately said to her ""what's that"".  Both of us watched it for approximately three to five seconds until it disappeared into another cloud.  The diameter of the object was slightly larger than a full moon appears in the sky.  It was flying in a south-easterly direction and ascending slightly.  There was no sound.  The object was not shiny and had texture to it; it was not completely flat; and was a sort of gunmetal color, maybe bordering closer to gold than silver.  There was no sound and there were no lights.  My sister said immediately, ""that was the classic cigar shape"".  She was right.  This object was flying well within the no-fly zone and away from the traditional flight paths that we observe from here which are well to the north.  The object was flying at an altitude common for helicopters.  I got my camera immediately afterward and got a photograph of the two clouds, the one from which it first appeared and the one into which it disappeared.  On May 21 of this year, my sister and I saw balls of light moving furiously in a counter clockwise circle from windows about 10 feet from the balcony where we were today.  Though those balls were much lower in the sky, the location of that incident and this one are almost identical.  Witness Two: It was flying at about the speed I would expect of a commercial aircraft, although it was far, far off the usual commercial flight path.  The thought that kept going through my mind was ""that's not a plane, it's not a jet"".  It was a classic cigar shape, no wings or markings  other than what appeared to be a dark band about one third of the length from the back end. It's difficult to judge size based on distance, but my impression is that it was extremely large, that it was double or more the size of a commercial airliner. It moved very smoothly and silently.  Color was a dull metallic gunmetal and there were no visible lights on the craft.   I agree with everything in my sister's report. ((NUFORC Note:  This appears to us to be a high-quality report, and it is submitted by a witness who has submitted another credible report, in the past.  Based on her description, we do not see how the object could have been any type of conventional aircraft.  We would welcome reports from any other witnesses, who may have witnessed the same event.

At first it looked like a solid white balloon that had been released from a nearby shopping center seconds earlier; like an 18"" balloon that was maybe 150 feet up.  As I and my wife watched we both said that it was no balloon of any kind because it was rising straight up with no sideways movement at all.  Second, it was moving way too fast to be a helium balloon.  It was at this point that I had the impression that the object wasn't as close to me as I first thought.  It continued to rise in a non-swirling uninterrupted manner until it was about 80 to 85 degrees over head from horizontal.  I had been viewing this through an open window of a car to this point.  I looked down to open the door and get out to continue viewing.  When I looked back up I no longer saw it beneath the dark clouds where I expected to find it once more.

I was the first person in my family to see the shape in the sky around 8:35 P.M. EST. I watched the shape for several minutes, which upon first glance resembled an exploded airplane to the naked eye. It never once seemed to be a comet or round object, but I could tell it was very high in the atmosphere. There was a distinct long, white, horizontal bar in the center of what looked like ""debris"", or ""white light"" radiating from the bar. Watching it five minutes later with binoculars, the shape had moved north and the ""debris"", or ""white light"" had dissipated enough so that the white bar had disappeared, and the ""debris field"", or ""white light"" had separated into two very distinct halves. I had spoken to an older sister around 9:15 P.M. EST who lives in Florida, and she did not see it. The shape had continued to dissipate and move north toward Canada, then due east toward Pennsylvania until it had disappeared altogether around 9:30 P.M. EST. Please remember that much of my own account was seen by the naked eye. The moon had not yet risen, so it was fairly dark outside.

She told us that she saw a UFO in the sky.  I was very skeptical when approaching.  I really did not expect to see anything.  However, there was clearly something to see in the sky to the West of our location.  Our Daughter went in the house to find the binoculars and I went in to find the telescope and camera.  My Wife watched it while our Daughter and I went into the house.  When we came out, it was still there and was visible with the naked eye and very distinct when viewed through the binoculars.  I could not focus on it through the telescope nor could I find it in the viewfinder of my camera.  There did not seem to be enough light from the object to get it on the camera.  The night sky was dark, but very clear.  The moon had not risen yet.  And there were no visible clouds in the sky.  Two airplanes were visible in the sky, but appeared to be flying lower than the object in the sky and the size of this object was much larger than the airplanes.  The shape of the object, when viewed through the binoculars was like a cigar shape in the middle and 4 jetting protrusions curving away from the cigar like center.  Also, when looking through binoculars (7x50 power), the overall object looked to be gaseous in form.  However, it never lost its shape (I watched it for about 30 minutes).  The color was a gray to white, but of course this was about 8:45 pm and dark outside. The only other way I can describe the color was that it looked similar to viewing a comet, but of course the shape was not typical of a comet.  The tip of the object, on the cigar like center, had an intermittent flash that would occur about every 30 seconds.  This flash was not visible with the naked eye, only through binoculars.  The flash was like that of a dimly lit star, but as the object moved slowly across the sky (toward the East), the flash stayed at the point on the cigar portion of the object.  When the object was almost directly overhead, it appeared to move further away (higher in the sky).  It became fainter and harder to see.  Even looking through the binoculars, it held its shape but became smaller and dimmer.  At this point I went in the house. ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

Looking North from Chelsea in central London I saw a strange looking light as I went to close a window before bed.  This light was bright, and it was hanging in the air in line with the 30 St Mary Axe building in the city.  I am familiar with the daily and nightly flow of helicopters and planes in this area, and this light did not look like either one of those normal types of air traffic, which is why I took notice of it. I have lived in the same place for over 15 years, and I know the sky here. This light was was motionless and oddly colored, without strobes.  I grabbed my telescope and took a look at it out of curiosity. At full magnification, it appeared to have three lobes in an equilateral triangle configuration, each one being an orange color. Whilst I viewed it, the three lights dimmed to nothing. The whole event lasted five minutes for me.  From where I live (more or less Sloane Square), I can see the Post Office Tower, the London Eye and the top of 30 St Mary Axe, as well as the top of Canary Wharf, in that order from left to right. I could not tell precisely how far away it was, but I imagine that it must have been hanging over the city of London, judging by my familiarity with my telescopes zoom. From where I was observing, it was presenting at approximately 10deg above the horizon or less, at a guess, 5 times higher than 30 St Mary Axe. As for its size, all That I can say is that I distinctly saw three lobes at maximum magnification, which is 60X on a Bauch & Lomb Discoverer Zoom Telescope.  The sky had broken cloud cover, and there were no stars visible to me at the time.  I am sending you this report in case someone else saw this object, in the hope that it might corroborate the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

At first, I thought the object was a satellite or perhaps aglimpse of the shuttle as it followed a straight east-west path towards the sickle.  It moved at a fairly good pace then angled south about 120 deg.  The common way to give rough distances while stargazing is to hold ones arm out and gauge by the number of fingers between stars.  Using others stars as a reference point for its movement, it moved anywhere from two to four fingers between turns.  It made it's next turn at about 90 deg  and a few more turns as it circled around behind the sickle and over Leo's back. It made a sharp 25 deg turn and turned again to head North.  It covered the distance at a slower rate and then went from bright to fade out, possibly going straight up.  I made my way back to the house and it was 11:15 EST.

It looked metallic because even though it was overcast, it did produce a glare. The bottom portion of the object looked to be red in color, but I saw no lights of any sorts. At first I thought it might be a meteorological device that scientists use to actually get into the eye of a tornado. They are similar in shape and usually painted red and often are lifted and thrown great distances to later be picked up and studied.  As I realized it was headed my way, I also realized that this was much too big to be such a device.  This thing was at least 20ft in diameter or more and moving in a controlled manner.  At that time I lifted my camera and took two photos before the object stopped for two seconds, hovered, and shot vertically at a very high rate of speed. Then it was gone. I was puzzled and in disbelief at what I had witnessed and immediately began trying to rationalize that this was some sort of debris from a nearby storm, but it simply wasn't.

One night a friend and I were sitting on the front deck, enjoying the cool breeze and our view of the ocean. The sky was fairly clear, with numerous stars and a few thin clouds. Several airplanes (both jet and prop) were visible as we talked. Suddenly we both saw a bright orange ball of light to our left, towards the fishing pier at Carolina Beach. The object appeared to be a considerable distance away, at least several miles off the coast. The object moved in a straight line and was extremely bright. It abruptly lost its brilliance and became a tiny point of light (which was still visible), and then several seconds later it regained its former brilliance before completely fading from sight. As my friend and I discussed what the object could have been, a few minutes later we saw a remarkably similar object (perhaps the same?) to our right - this time it was a little closer, and it behaved in the same manner as the first object. Finally, about five minutes or so later, we again saw a similar object - this time it was almost directly in front of us, higher above the horizon, and it was much closer - I would guess it was a mile or less off of the beach. It appeared to be simply a large, brilliantly lit orange ball of light. The object was in view for only a few seconds before it vanished. We did not see the object(s) at any other time that night. My friend and I considered our options - the objects couldn't have been lights from a ship as they were too far above the horizon. They could not have been fireworks or flares, as we saw nothing go up and the objects moved on a steady flight path - they didn't arc or go down. I have never seen a shooting star behave in such a manner. The objects might have been lights from one or more airplanes, except for the fact that the objects bore no resemblance to the numerous airplanes that we did see at night throughout our trip, and not one of the objects made any sound what! soever. I have considered the possibility that the objects were satellites reflecting the sun, except that we saw three lights in fairly rapid succession (fifteen minutes or less) in different parts of the sky.

I was on a annual summer camp trip from Ukiah, CA. to Calavera's county in 1951 when an event happened that changed my whole life!  I had spent that day as any normal kid would, playing with my best friend then we raced across a small creek and my foot was cut through my tennis- shoes.  The cut was very deep across the pad behind my left big toe.  My friend ran to get a Conselor to help me.  The cut would not stop bleeding. He carried me on his back piggy style.  I had to pull my pant leg cuff to hold my foot up because of the throbbing pain.  I went to bed that night as the other boys did, (gabbing til sleep).  Somewhere in the night I woke up and startled as heck, realized I was sleeping on the cement serving place.  The cement circle was where the conserlors set all the giant serving food pots which was about 4 to 6 blocks from our cabin.  What woke me was this weird blue-ish green light that I could see with my eyes closed.  It was about 2 telephone poles above me slowly rising with a small noise in my head.  It looked like a huge (city block wide) black disk with pieces of silver around it's edges.  In the center was that blue-ish green light.  It slowly rose over me straight up then zipped out of sight.  I wasn't scared, I was actually very calm and relaxed untill I noticed where I was, (in the wilderness at night) I got up, steped down off the cement circle and yelled in pain!  I forgot my foot was injured.  All the pain came back again as I tried to walk on that heel.  As I entered the dark cabin, I accidently went to my best friends bed and grabbed the covers, (It was my friends neck I grabbed and boy did he yell) I tried to tell him what went on, but the other kids yelled , 'shut-up!'.  The next morning we saw my bloody foot prints coming from the cabin front door to my friends bed.  I tried to explain to our 'conselors' what happened and they said, I must be mistaken, there's only God in the heavens.  And then the memories came back.  A female entity, large head, giant shinny black cat eyes, dull white skin tone, small being. It sounded like a soft gentle female.  It spoke to me with tenderness.  She said her name was, I couldn't say it right, so she said,'NANE' that's close enough.  She said she was the leader of a force that protected her planets security.  In an instant, we were on a planet who's color looked like white-ish grey everywhere. My feet weren't on the ground and she said, It's not safe for you. I said where am I, she said, your at the 'place of ashes'  she said, you call it The moon.  She said a huge civilization lived there a long time ago.  She said, those craters are not from things hitting the moon, their from a great all out war that destroyed the planet.  She pointed to a UFO in the distance and said, many visitors from other planets come to the 'place of ashes' to remember, and collect 'artifacts' to take home. She said the Universe was a big giant highway,just like our highways on earth. When she talked, I didn't see her mouth move, I heard her in my mind.  She told me about different UFO's, aliens, planets, She said the story of 'Jesus Christ' was just that,a story She said governments on earth just used it to control the people! She said, do you think a real all loving God would let Disease,murder,war,hatred,- death,natural disasters exist!!!!?  She said she could do everything and more all by herself than anything I've ever read. She has visited me about 3 times and say's she's always near.  She has shown me and told me so much that it's sort of scary!  I am now a movie actor with one academy award film and I still don't talk about my encounter to anyone. (people think your crazy as the government likes it to be on this topic!) All I can say is, my life 's not the same since that encounter!!!  I can do many,many, different things that I never studied, perfectly!  When I look into a persons eyes, or touch them it's like a fast visual movie of their life!(I don't like it at all!!!) When that visual thing happens, it makes me want to throw-up!(feels like I'm going to die!) I've learned so much from'NANE' that it would take a lot of writing to explain it, and it's coming true!  I'm going to write an E-Book on the net about, 'NANE' and give it away free, just download it.  I want other people to know what happened to me! And just maybe, just maybe, there's others who were visited that night and I could meet them.  There's so much more she said that I believe is perfectly true!  The free 'NANE' E-Book has been ready to download but, I'm a little worried about my movie career! Will people think I've lost my mind!? A person can only shut their mouth for so long!  Time to tell the other people what happened! She showed me so much! I hope all read this with intelligence and wisdom for it will come to pass!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They would move in different directions and in different ways. A typical move would be to move in a straight line and then take a 90 degree turn without slowing down. I am familiar with aircraft movement since I lived near Pease air base and was used to seeing the high speed f-111's that were stationed there. These lights were in the 30 to 80 degree range off the horizon and were moving at times at speeds like a jet fighter and at other times they would be still in the air. One even was still in the sky and then just took off at speed , went up in the sky and disappeared. One time several moved to a single point in the sky but there always seemed to be 6 or 8 or maybe more craft visible at any time.There came a time when I caught sight of a Cigar shaped craft moving slowly through my field of vision and across the road we had come up to our present  position. The craft continued to moveacross the road and settled down over what seemed to be a field on the other side of the road and by this time I was 50 to 75 yards down the road from the VW and on the left side of the road. I was somewhat excited when it settled down and was furth! er conflicted when lights came on and blinked around the craft. I say around the craft because a light would blink from right to left and as it reached the left of the craft it would disappear and shortly thereafter it would reappear blinking at the right edge of the craft.I say the plural lights since I believe there were many lights with only one coming on at a time. And there were other lights that stayed on that appeared to be windows above the centerline where the blinking lights were located. I had mixed emotions at this point - wonder and fear. I turned and ran over to my friends up the road - they nwere still watching other lights- and told them there was something they have to see. We headed back to where we could see the cigar and it was gone. Some traffic came by- one stoppedto see if we needed help and after that all craft were gone. The whole experience from first sighting was probably about20 - 30 minutes and the cigar sighting I had was in the 2-4 minute range.",2004-05-04T00:00:00,42.9661,-70.9881

It was a clear day with no cloud cover or smog. Suddenly a disk-shaped craft, not very big, zipped down over Crown Mountain in a curvilinear movement and hovered over southern Vancouver, directly in the center of my vision. There was no sound or fumes, and, although the craft was clearly technologically skilled in design and fabrication, it was equally clear that there was a sentient being controlling it, as it moved with choice and a certain sense of style, and not in a robot-like way. And although it was still quite far away from my window (approx. 2 miles) i felt uncomfortable by the way it was hovering so deliberately in front of me; as if it was looking directly at me somehow. That was just my subjective feeling, but i record it in case others might also have felt that way. Before i had a chance to draw my breath and yell to my family, the craft zipped off again, down the valley, going at an incredible speed. The total distance covered by the craft in the space of under a minute (including hover time) was approximately thirty miles. At the time i was 12 years old and not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, devout and not given to lying. I thought i had witnessed an experimental American aircraft, but have not seen anything like it since. Just wondering if anyone else in the vicinity might have noticed it also.

I noticed a very bright object toward south of the driveway which was moving horizonally at an elevation of approximately 40 degrees above the horizon.  I pointed this out to my wife and she commented that it must be an airplane.  We watched for several minutes and I pointed out that there were no other lights ( red or green) as normally seen with aircraft.  She said the object looked like a sphere with a halo adound it.  She went into the house to get the binoculars and I continued to watch the object which continued traveling toward the west at a slow rate of speed.  The moon was very bright and was at an elevation above the object and east of the object approximately 30 to 40 degrees.  Only a few stars were visible to the south an these were much higher in the sky.  At this point something very strange happened. A bright object ( not nearly as bright as the original sphere ) eminated from the sphere and traveled at a very rapid rate to the east at an angle of 120 degrees from the path of the bright sphere.  This object ( much smaller than the original sphere) had a faint red glow to it.  It continued moving at high rate of speed in a straight line until it was no longer visible at an elevation of approximately 75 degrees above the horizon almost due south.  I returned my attention to the original object which was no longer moving to the west but appeared to be moving away from me as the size continued to get smaller. It also appeared to be slowly gaining altitude above the original elevation when moving to the west.  I continued to watch the original sphere for another 10 to 15 minutes.

LISBON (AFP) - The Portuguese airforce has been on alert since late Tuesday, when several authorities and witnesses reported seeing a luminous unidentified flying object.   AFP/File Photo    ""Military radar surveillance has been increased and F16 planes are ready for take-off,"" tabloid daily Correio da Manha reported Thursday.   It said the Portuguese civil protection service had received scores of calls from people who reported briefly seeing a silent, luminous object in the sky on Tuesday night, giving off white smoke.   Air force spokesman Colonel Carlos Barbosa confirmed to Lusa news agency that military radars had detected ""a target... that was not identified as a plane"" for two or three minutes.   The national air traffic control authority, Navegacao Aerea de Portugal (NAV), also confirmed a UFO had been spotted in the north and south of the country just before midnight on Tuesday.   ""The control tower in Oporto (north) detected a flying object which had been observed 25 minutes earlier in Montijo and Beja (south),"" NAV spokesman Paulo Lagarto said.   The authorities were unable to say what the mysterious object was.   But Jose Fernando Monteiro, a geology researcher at Lisbon's science university, said he had consulted US air defence officials and the UFO could not have been a meteorite.   If it had been a meteorite it would have travelled much faster and made a lot of noise, Monteiro told Correio da Manha and Lusa.   The European Space Agency said the UFO was not a falling satellite either and the Portuguese weather service said there was no meteorological explanation for the phenomenon.   The only person to come up with a possible explanation was astronomist Jose Matos, who said the UFO might have been an Iridium telecommunications satellite.   ""These satellites orbit at a height of about 780 kilometres (490 miles). They each have three antennae, which are polished like mirrors and reflect the light of the sun,"" he told the media.",2004-06-04T00:00:00,,

I was 16 and headed home from school across the back field when i noticed something wierd up in the sky. I had a good view of everything from the school to the North Shore Mountains and have always had good eyesight, but couldn't really fathom what was hanging there... maybe people will laugh but it was a perfectly hatbox-shaped, very minty green cloud, about a mile away and hovering over the city about 2 miles up.  It was also huge, covering about 2 miles with it's shadow with a height of about a mile. The thing looked like some kind of oval hatbox, hanging up there in the sky. And it didn't move. It had a puffy surface texture that clearly showed an effect of wind, sort of like a knife moving icing, for want of a better description... but the cloud itself looked solid and didn't move, although a couple of smaller and more normal-looking clouds in the sky were moving along at quite a fast clip. I remember remarking to myself that it was interesting that the wind made no dent in the shape, all the edges were sharp and regular. The whole thing showed an almost perfect symmetry. And the colour! I'd never seen a cloud that was mint GREEN before!  I stood in the middle of the field watching this thing for about 10 minutes. Nothing happened, so i went home.  I felt at the time that this might have been the result of an industrial gas accident but there was nothing on the news. Even if it had been, i wonder why such an emission would have taken on this shape and not dissipated in the wind. Anyone have any explanations?  Never saw anything like it before or since.

On the evening of July 17, 1996 I was travelling by car from Ann Arbor, MI to Saline, MI when I spied a bright white light under the low cloud cover to the south at about twenty degrees latitude.  I had the am radio tuned in to 760 WJR (Detroit, MI) to listen to the breaking news reports of the TWA 800 crash off of Long Island, NY.  This light was much larger and brighter than the landing lights on the passenger jets which continually fly in and out of Willow Run Airport (Ypsilanti, MI).  Two night previous (July 15th) I had witnessed a large circular array of lights float over my car from east to west in the same area at about the same time of night.  I wondered if I was witnessing a routine flight out of Willow Run Airport of an unconventional aircraft.  I felt somewhat agitated at the sight of this bright light, yet, drawn to it.  I turned my car onto a series of sideroads in order to get closer look at it.  After five or so minutes the light was much larger in size and was about sixty degrees in latitude.  I was on the northern outskirts of the tiny town of Bridgewater, MI when I stopped my car, exited it to see the huge bright light descend out of the sky toward my position.  The light dimmed dramatically to reveal a barbell-shaped craft comprised of two internally-lit, milky white spheres connected by a thin bar which had two, evenly spaced, bright bluish-white blinking lights.  These lights blinked in unison at regular intervals much the way that aircraft strobes blink.  The craft was huge.  It revolved horizontally on an axis and was completely silent.  I measured the craft to be the size of a large canteloupe or human head at arm's length.  At this time I noticed that several cars were passing by, both on the road which I was parked on the shoulder of as well as a nearby state highway that ran through Bridgewater.  Not a single car seemed to stop or notice this object.  I attempted to motion down a passing truck with one hand while pointing to the object with the other but the d! river seemed to not see me.  The craft continued to revolve and occasionally one of the internally-lit spheres would slowly extinguish its light and after a few seconds it would re-illuminate.  Each time that this occurred I felt a flood of anxiety.  Finally, after about five or so minutes of this dramatic display, the craft slowly ascended into the sky, became a bright single white light and moved off to the south east at a slow rate.  I felt as if this sighting was meant solely for me.  I did not notice any EM problems related to my vehicle or static on the AM radio through the duration of the sighting.",2004-05-10T00:00:00,42.1482,-83.8148

I saw it up there, toward the cliff house- it was silver with some spikes sticking out, jutting out of two of its sides- like black poles which were sticking up. It also seemed to have a tail at one end- kind of like a stalk stem of a mushroom. I looked around me to see if anyone else was seeing it. I stopped and tried to see if I could flag someone down to look, too. I kept thinking, ""God, is that a UFO?"" There was noone likely to stop, it somehow didn't seem appropriate and the beach wasn't that crowded. It was sunny, clear, I know what I saw and it was very weird. Anyway, the even weirder thing is is how I actually felt looking at it- extremely serene and calm; it was almost like whoever was in charge of it or actually in it wanted me to see it. It lasted a long time, about 1 minute. I remember thinking, ""This is like on Art Bell."" I've neevr felt whatever it was I was feeling before or since when I saw it. I also rwemember thinking, ""What's gong to happen?""  I kept my eye on it and next thing I knew it was gone. One second there, the next, out.

My Family and I were returning from my inlaws house at around 9:00p.m. traveling on 24 west toward Peru as we  aproached town I noticed the sky seemed to iluminate with no apparent light source present, then a bright orange/amber light slowly appeared as if it were coming out from behind something until it was a full round circle. at the time I thought it was coming out from behind a cloud. My wife asked ""are you seeing that!"" I replied yyeeaa then like the first a second amber spere slowly appeared exactly like the first as if it were coming out from behind something. this was happening directly in front of us as we traveled down the high way the first globe slowly went away in the exact way it appeared then the second. at this point we approached the bottom of the hill and turned into the median then a third amber globe apeared exactly as before, and fade exactly as before I estimate these to have been mabe a half mile away from our location and quite large, I'd guess from the distance mabe 10 ft across unless the globes were closer to us than I am estimating each globe seemed to stay lit for mabe 10 to 15 seconds. I pulled over and got out to see if any others would light and to my suprise I could see all the stars, there were no clouds to explain the ""ducking out from behind"" way in which they apeared and disapeared. My wife was nervous and wanted me back in the car so we went on into town. An intresting side note to this, I picked up a pizza the next day and mentioned what I saw to the girl working behind the counter she told me she wittnesed the same thing a couple years previous while sitting outside her job eating her lunch, also a co-worker of mine wittnessed the same thing on 9/10/01 the day before 9/11 thats how she remebered the date this w! as in Ne w Waverly.

I saw no aircraft in the area, have your people done any checking in on this? has the local Indiana chapter checked with Grissom radar or anything? please post some informaion on the progress of your investigation in Northern Miami county and Rochester.

My wife and I were driving north on US-101, to visit some family in Sonoma County.  We started out earlier in the day in the Orange County area and we saw many airplanes and stars throughout the drive up.  When we got into the bay area, it was socked in and raining.  The clouds didn't let up and I would estimate that the ceiling was down to about 500 feet when we got to Windsor, CA.  We were looking for a motel to stop for the night when I noticed a dull reddish orange light off to the northwest.  (I would estimate the size of the light to be the size of my fingernail held at arms length.)  I asked my wife, ""what the heck is that?""  She said, ""it's an airplane.""  Then I said, ""that doesn't look like an airplane because it has no anti-collision 'strobe' type lights on it.""  I also said, ""who would be crazy enough to be up flying in rural northern california, at 3 in the morning, when the visibility was down to about 5-10 miles and the ceiling was about 500 feet?""  That is a true statement because this area is dark as a hammer and it would be almost impossible to fly using dead reckoning at night, especially in extreme IFR conditions.  After coming to an almost complete stop on the highway, I decided to exit at the next offramp.  I did and when I stopped to look at the light, I noticed another car on the freeway that had slowed way down, to about 15 mph.  I wonder if they were seeing the same thing we were seeing.  That car kept on going and we were sitting there on the offramp at a dead stop so I rolled down the window to see if I could hear any aircraft noise.  We didn't hear anything.  At this point my wife said, ""you're right... that isn't an airplane.  What is that?""  At this point the object was moving really slowly, but in an erratic motion where it was travelling sideways, but also in an upwards motion, then it would instantly change to a downward motion.  Definitely not how I have ever seen any airplane fly.  After about 10-15 seconds of this erratic flying, it moved in a straight! sideway s motion, at a high rate of speed, covering the distance of what I would estimate was about 300 yards and disappeared into the rain clouds.  At that point, the hair on the back of my neck was standing straight up.  My wife and I spent the next 10 minutes or so driving down the side road that parallels the freeway with our heads hanging out the window looking for the object.  We never saw it again.  Just thinking about this incident as I am sitting here typing this in is giving me goosebumps.  Whatever it was, it was really weird.  Never seen anything else like it.  Let me try to explain what this thing looked like.  The best way I could describe this light is this:  You know when you see a jet on approach to an airport, but it is a long ways off, like 10-15 miles; you can see the landing lights on, and it looks like a reddish orange glow because of the smog and impurities in the air?  That is exactly what this thing looked like.  And that is what I thought it was right at first, but then it dawned on me... it couldn't be because of the low clouds and limited visibility.  That was when I realized that it had to be only a mile or so away from me and I realized I was looking at something else.  And it wasn't until I stopped the car that I could tell it wasn't flying straight and level and it was actually flying erratic.  The fact that there were no strobe type anti-collision lights on it really made me think this was something other than an aircraft.  If anyone else reported anything similar to this, I would like to know.  If you need further clarification, feel free to contact me.  Thanks",2004-05-10T00:00:00,38.5369,-122.81230000000001

As I turned my head to face east, the light became so bright that it illuminated the inside of my car and all of the surrounding landscape in my field of vision. This white light was a gradual brightening, not a flash like you would see at a fireworks display. It was VERY bright, many times brighter than any white flash firework and also very high in the sky. Also, this event appeared very close to the local power plant (NIPSCO). I estimate that from the time I first noticed the brightening of the sky to my east until I had my head turned to look in that direction, about 2 seconds had passed. As I watched the eastern sky I never did see the source of the illumination, I could only see the illumination fading very fast. It took about 1 second for the sky to go from bright white to darkness again. Then immediately after this, a yellow / orange double streak appeared in the sky similar to a contrail but it was diffused and had ""sparkles"" inside it. This streak ""drew"" itself from the bottom (what would be closest to the ground) going UP. This streak did not come from the top of the sky going down, it appeared moving UP. I could tell this streak was very large in the sky and ""drawn"" faster than any contrail I have ever seen. The streak disappeared as fast as it came. I stopped my car to continue watching the eastern sky for about 5 minutes and no other events occured. At work, two of my friends saw the same thing and as I described it to them they both agreed that it happened just as I have said here. One of the 2 friends that saw it said that the white light illuminated the inside of his truck like an arc welder would, and he has tinted windows on his truck. Also interesting is that this friend lives about 30 miles from me and it seems we both agreed on the intensity of the light. It was VERY bright. The other friend lives even farther away from me (about 50 miles) and it illuminated his car just as brightly. I noticed here: http://www.nbc5.com/news/3846130/detail.html?z=dp&dpswid=2265994&dppid=65172 that there was a plane that was forced to return to O'Hare airport shortly after takeoff because of flames shooting out of an engine. If you read this article you will see that this was not what I witnessed. I live about 60 miles from Chicago to the southeast. Lake Michigan is northwest from where I witnessed the event. This plane was headed to Brazil which I imagine the plane would be on a southerly course. The event took place in the eastern sky, almost due east from my position in Wheatfield, Indiana. I estimate that the streak was several miles away in the sky, maybe as far away as 50 or more miles. Also, there was no mention of a tremendously bright white light in the sky in the article. I have never seen anything so bright in the sky. The article says that a ""boom like thunder"" and explosions were heard, the event that I witnessed was completely silent as far as I could tell. Please contact me if you need further details. Also I would like to know if anyone else has reported this event to you. Incidentally, a friend of mine at work said that the local Chicago news has been reporting UFO sightings over Indiana for the last couple of weeks or so. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.

On Sunday night, October 24, 2004, at 23:27 I was driving through Ashland County in Ohio around mile marker 197. I was in a van on I-71 heading towards Columbus. All of a sudden the entire sky turns bright. So bright in fact, that it looked like the middle of the day. This “flash” of brightness lasted about 2 seconds before the sky faded to dark black again. Although the moment was brief, I can recall certain aspects of the event. First off, I was staring into the horizon and/or just above it since I was driving (about 85 mph). I immediately thought to myself that a serious lighting bolt just dashed across the sky. But I also thought that never before had I seen one light up the sky like that. As I was thinking that, it immediately occurred to me that there were no clouds in the sky at the time and that I had not seen other lighting activity. As I was thinking this I was leaning towards the driver’s side window to look outside and up. As I did, I noticed a black/dark, long tubular object (I couldn’t guess its size/length) “take off” from with the middle of the sky. The term “take off” is used lightly here. There was no slow and steady acceleration. Instead, it looked like it went from 0-300 in 1.0 seconds. The only thing I could see was that it went in a West/Southwest direction. And the only reason I could see what direction it went in was because the sky was still slightly lit up, but fading fast. In it’s wake, this object left what could be quite normally explained as a jet stream (??), or the white, long cloud-like formation we see planes leave in the sky. But this stream was different in the fact that the outer streams were a bright fiery red/orange. The middle of the stream was white. These bright red/orange streams hung in the sky for about 5 seconds before they turned to white streams and simply faded away like thin clouds. I should explain that the reason I didn’t follow the object was because my brain knew it was too far gone. If you would have seen how quickly it jettisoned across the sky, your brain would also have “known” that it was visually untraceable. Therefore, I focused on the “stream” above me.  I called the FAA around 01:45 on Monday, October 25, 2004 to inquire about others who may have reported something similar. The person I spoke to mentioned that he saw “numerous” reports on his way to his desk that had been filed tonight regarding this event. He mentioned that they will be following up with the National Weather Service to see what other explanations may be available. He was quite interested when I told him about the fiery stream and the object appearing out of nowhere. He also said that it could be a meteor, but that meteors do not usually behave in this fashion.  I can understand lighting, and skies lighting up, and even meteors (although I’ve never seen one that close). But what I can’t understand, and this is the reason I’m reporting this, is that the object I saw “took off” from within the middle of the sky. First off, how did it get there? Second, why did it take off immediately after the bright flash? And lastly, but more importantly, how the heck does an object move across the sky at that great a speed?

This occurred as I was on my way to work driving east on Raccoon Valley Rd. (State Hwy 170), July 2, '04 at around 1815hrs. As I was approaching the entrance ramp to I-75 south, which was on my right, I was admiring the dramatic storm clouds ahead of me, as well as scanning for airborne anomalies; I spotted a dark dot among the clouds. It was moving uncharacteristically fast for a conventional aircraft, zipping from left to right in my field of view. I grabbed a digital camera that I keep with me at all times now, and started taking pictures. I took the first pic through my windshield just before I hit the on ramp. As I drove down the ramp going south onto the highway, I took another pic, through the driver's side window. I just pointed the camera and snapped the picture without looking through the viewfinder, obviously, since I was driving.  I had traveled approximately one mile when I took the third pic out the driver's side window. I lost sight of the object, but did not dare look up too long for fear of running off the road. I took the next two pics through my windshield hoping to catch something even though I could not take my eyes off the road. I did not pull off to the side because I was in the left lane and I did not want to be late for work.  The distance traveled from the taking of the first pic to the last is around 2.5 to 3 miles and the time interval around three minutes. The camera is an hp Photosmart 315 digital, a fairly cheap camera.  I experienced no electrical disturbances with my vehicle or radio. No one else seemed to notice what I saw, but it was a very busy time of day for traffic. I was too busy negotiating the road to experience any emotional or psychological phenomena. However, I did get a cold chill Sunday morning when I looked at pics and saw what I had captured. In two of the photos I took, there are distinctive disk-shapes.

They hovered and moved too slowly.   The fighter jet was in the same area. 11:35 am. MST: I was sitting alone outside at Brewer's Market in Boulder Colorado having a cup of coffee reading the paper.  The location is between Arapahoe and Canyon on Folsom street.  The coffee shop patio has a panoramic view of the Front Range and continental divide.  The skies were clear with some clouds to the south.   I happened to look up and see a very small spherical, metallic white object to the west about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It was very far away but had a uniform color, and spherical shape (i.e. not an airplane, jet or glider shape). Because it was spherical it was difficult to determine the altitude of the object; but I would guess that it was about 10 – 15 miles to the west, somewhere over the continental divide in West Boulder county.  I would guess the altitude was at 20 – 50 K feet.  It was not moving which I found to be strange.   I marked the position of the object using a tree in the parking lot.   I thought that it might be a weather balloon.   I noticed that without my polarized sunglasses the object was almost unperceivable in the hazy blue sky.  11:40:   I notice two airliners (DIA is 15 miles to the East).  One was flying West about 5-10 miles North of the object at about 15-25 K feet; the other airliner was flying East about 5-10 miles south of the object at about 15-25K feet.  Both airliners were traveling in regular flight paths into and out of DIA.  I live in the mountains and watch aircraft fly into and out of DIA and Jeffco Airports regularly.  I know the flight paths.  11:45:  The object started to slowly move East toward my position.   It moved too slowly to be an aircraft at any reasonable altitude.   It moved too quickly to be a weather balloon propelled by the wind.  12:00 :  The object had moved almost directly above me, from 30 degrees to 90 degrees from the horizon.  It was still at a very high altitude.  It was still a metallic white spherical object.   It was at this time that I noticed another identical object moving past the first object heading due west both at similar altitudes.   Both moving at similar speeds.  I doubt that both objects were weather balloons, moved by the wind in opposite directions. Clouds had started to form to the west.  12:05:   I watched the first object move slightly to the east of my position towards the sun. As it approached the sun it appeared to shine a red color around the object, like the light was shining thru or around the object.   I soon lost the first object in the sun and clouds.   I tried to find the second object that had moved to the West, but was unable.  12:08  To the west at a very high altitude I spotted a fighter jet moving towards the West at about 45 degrees above the horizon.   It was clearly a fighter jet, not a Lear or Gulfstream, or airliner.   It has wings swooped back at a sharp angle.  It was moving very quickly, even at the high altitude.  I would estimate the jets altitude at 20-30K feet.  Conclusions: The objects were too high to clearly discern any features other than the spherical appearance of the object based upon the way that light reflected from them.   I was surprised to see the fighter jet.   The appearance of two objects passing each other did not support my theory that the object were balloons.  They did not appear to be any type of aircraft that I would recognize.  They were not gliders that frequent the Boulder skies.  These objects were very high up.  There were barley visible to the naked eye, but definitely objects. ((COMMENT FROM READER)) The fighter Jet this person is talking about is most likely a Mig-15.  I am a private pilot and fly out of Jeffco Airport.  There is a private pilot who has restored a Korean War Mig-15 and flies it all the time.  By the flight path and swept back wings and altitude I would guess this is the fighter he saw.  The only fighters in Colorado are Air Guard and those are F-16's.  And we all know they always have a wingman, they never fly a mission solo.  Just my .02 ((END))",2004-07-08T00:00:00,40.024403601895735,-105.26873952606635

A Very bright red light was moving from East to West just North of her location. It appeared odd since she did not see any other customary lights as on an aircraft. It also was so slow moving as make her wonder if it could be a helicopter. After a few minutes it appeared to hover to the West & she decided to have her husband come out to view it. Her husband had been a private pilot in previous years and spent time boating. Since he was familiar with various lights of navigation and aircraft she felt he might be able to add some insight as to what this was. He watched the light but could not identify what type of aircraft or blimp or balloon would appear like this so he brought out his binoculars. In looking through the binoculars he felt he could see 2 red lights, 1 slightly above and to the North of the other. He was not able to see any craft nor was he able to tell if the lights were independant or associated with a single object. They were moving syncronized. There was no engine noise detectable although throughout the sighting other aircraft were still in the area. From the time he observed the lights he felt the location of the lights was approximately 10 degrees North and 45 degrees West of where they sat. The lights headed back East (no apparent turn just changed direction) and ended up at about 10 degrees North and 45 degrees East when the husband went back into the house to see if he could see them from the front windows and if so he would see if his telescope could pick them up any better. He could not view them from the front windows and his wife informed him they were now gone. As his wife watched the lights moving East they had again seemed to hover as planes passed. This East area of the sky was hazy and cloudy. Although most airplane lights and the moon light was visable through the haze, the red lights seemed to either go on and off several times (or went behind clouds)and then were gone.  Throughout the viewing the lights appeared to become intermittently brighter or more brillant.

The movement was barely discernable and lasted maybe 10 or 15 seconds, then stopped.  I wasn't altogether certain that my eyes weren't playing tricks on me, so I watched for a while longer, and it happened again. I don't have a video cam, or I would have filmed it, and it wouldn't have served any purpose to take a still photo, since the image would have just shown a starry sky.  At any rate, I went inside and watched TV for an hour or so.  Just before going to bed, I went out on the deck and had another look at the sky.  That ""star"" was no longer there.  There were plenty more stars cleary visible in the immediate area of the sky where I had seen it, so I doubt seriously that it was now hidden behind clouds.

It became apparent that the object was not being tossed about by the wind, but was proceeding from north to south, straight as an arrow and contrary to the wind direction. It passed almost directly overhead, reflecting the sunlight as it passed. It appeared to be shiny, opaque white, not self-luminous. There were no wings, fins or other protrusions visible. The shape was a short tube with rounded ends, like a vitamin capsule or maybe an aircraft drop tank. I watched it until it disappeared in the distance to the south. I estimate that it was at least several tbousand feet high, as there were jetliners visible in the sky at the same time on approach to LAX and Ontario airport. The airliners appeared much higher that the object. The speed of the object reminded me of a military jet making a pass at an airshow, fast but not supersonic. There was no noticeable noise from the object, but there was a lot of background noise due to the wind in the trees.

We are use to seeing all sizes of airplanes, from large jets to small twin engine planes most every night.  We also see satellites, the ISS and occasionally a shooting star (Meteor).  Tonight my husband noticed and pointed out to me either several smaller objects flying in a tight formation flying in unison or one big object  with sharp edges silhoutted with multiple lights on the underside all in a  tight but sort of flexible pattern.  It was flying  at about the  speed than most big aircrafts would be flying but lower altitude.  It was flying  from  (from Orlando area) East to West toward the Gulf of Mexico.  The object changed direction, it turned more to the Southwest, but stayed in a tight formation, which is why (without our eyeglasses) we are not certain if the object(s) were one large one or several smaller ones. It almost looked like how geese fly in formation, and maybe one deviates, only these ""geese"" had lights on them.  Our first thought was it was something like the flying angel's small jets doing a night time formation up very high.  But there were no jet noises at all, which we normally hear the jet noise at some point.

It appeared to turn sideways after a few moments which made the profile a slender oval in the sky and then it disappeared.  We both could not believe our eyes as we watched.  We both felt certain it was not an aircraft typical to our night skyline.,2004-04-27T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

Just wanted to let someone know about what 3 of my companions and myself witnessed on our balcony at the hotel Riu Cancun Sunday morning (2am-4am), 4/18/2004.  My roommate and I walked in the room and I walked to the balcony to catch a glimpse of the ocean and the night sky only to find a triangular illuminating object hovering in the sky. The distance was hard to determine but I could hear the sound of it breaking the wind, for that night happened to be windy. I called my roommate to see if he could help explain it and we stood there in amazement as to what it could have been. After a few seconds the object darted into the clouds and what seemed like into the atmosphere, then it faded away. We both decided to run to our other friends across the hallway to tell them. After explaing what we saw we all ran out to their balcony to see if it could be seen again. After a couple of minutes of staring into the sky we spotted it again but not as close as the initial sighting, now it appeared as an illuminating circular object. It seemed more energetic then before because its was speeding left to right zig-zagging in out of the clouds. Minutes later after settling down and deciding there is not much we could do but just observe it, I went back to my room and sat on the balcony viewing its maneuvering in the sky for a good hour. At one point I gestured to it so it would come closer and it stopped briefly and hovered in the sky for a good minute as if it had seen my gesture and was contemplating coming down to my level. It was quite the experience that I shall never forget. I still can't rationalize what it could have been, high tech Government project or a unexplainable natural phenomenon.

My possition on the ground was 1 mile north and 1 mile West of the town of Arlee. I turned West on the country road towards my house. After taking a turn, the road paralleled Highway 93. I was facing South. To the East at an altitude of approximatly 4000 ft. was an Orange light. It was a dark orange with a flashing white light. At first sighting, it seemed to have an erratic movement. Then it smoothed out and continued South at the same altitude. I stopped the car and told my passengers to look. I rolled down the window and turned the engine off. I wanted to listen for distinct airplane or helicopter sounds. I could not hear any, only the sounds of the dogs in town barking wildly. I asked my passenger to get our new Sony Cybershot digital camera out of the glove box. I fumbled out of the car and tried to take some pictures. The first picture the flash went off. After I turned the flash off, I tried to take a couple more pictures. By then the object had continued heading South, and went beyond the mountains. I got back into the car and proceeded to drive South towards Missoula. I got to the Missoula valley, and searched the sky. I also checked the airport runway. There was an airplane just taking off.

After it rained about 8 inches 2 days ago at my father's house in China Grove, a suburb of San Antonio, TX, 2 circles (one inside the other) appeared behind our swimming pool.  Our yard is about 1/2 acre.  The circles are dead bermuda grass with live bermuda grass in the rest of the yard.  A few dirt patches happen to cross the lines of dead grass, and there are no tread marks.  There are no tire marks leading into the circle either.  I found a few long strands of the grass, and the part near the root is green.  The part at the very end is also green.  The middle of the strand that crossed the dead zone is brown. I took a lab-quality ferrous/non-ferrous metal detector to the entire portion of the yard and found nothing unusual in or out of the circle (my first thought was maybe a really old septic tank started seeping through cracks due to the extensive rain). There are no tread marks at all.  This happened immediately after a big rain, so the dirt spots would easily accept tire tracks. There are no bent or broken strands of grass, and nothing else seems unusual except for the dead spots.  The geometry is too perfect to be natural.  I know there are lawn diseases that cause brown circles, but the lines are too thin, too much diameter, and too perfect.  There is too much live grass between the circles. On the outer circle, there are two equally geometric ""dashes"" as thick as the circle's line, pointing outward. I have lots of pictures I will send if you like.  I still want to make sure this email account works before I take the time to zip and attach them.  I have pictures up close, far away, with/without flash, 12-inch ruler in scene, and the strands of crab/bermuda grass that crossed the dead line. The lines that make both circles are 5.4 inches wide.  The large circle's edge is about 27 inches outside of the small circle.  The outer circle is about 8.5 feet in diameter.  The inner circle has a 5 foot 4 inch diameter. This is driving my curiosity level crazy.  Please tell me if you have heard of anything like this before.

I caught sight of this object to my right (south-east) as I reached the speed limit. I rolled down the passenger window to make sure I wasn't seeing a reflection or distortion in the glass. It looked the same.  The object was illuminated in white light although it was somewhat dimmer than the full moon would be. It looked like a round tube standing on it's edge straight up and down. Like the core of a paper towel roll. Except this one had a ring that circled the entire object. Somewhat similar to the rings of Saturn if seen from beneath. The whole object was as big as a penny held at arm's length away and hovered 25 to 30 degrees off of the horizon.  As I drove it seemed to float a little higher and lower in the sky but kept pace. I had my little camera with me so I decided to drive down to the next exit (Pokahontas) and pull off to try to get a picture. If nothing else but to prove something was actually there. I didn't want to stop on the innerstate on a late Saturday night/Sunday morning.  The problem was it slowly started to fade away and by the time I got to the exit it was gone from view.

"Large, bright silvery object moving very rapidly inside chemtrail.",Fargo,ND,2004-08-08T15:30:00,cigar,1 second,"Occurred : 8/8/2004 15:30  (Entered as : 08/06/2004 15:30) Reported: 8/9/2004 12:21:05 AM 00:21 Posted: 8/11/2004 Location: Fargo, ND Shape: Cigar Duration:1 second",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38536.html,"Large, bright silvery object moving very rapidly inside chemtrail. On the afternoon of the date noted above, I was helping my neighbor repair his backyard fence which had been downed by a windstorm. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon, with bright blue skies and a few of those puffy marshmallow-type clouds so typical of summer in these parts. I was using my body weight to brace an upright from behind, while my neighbor drilled screws into the fence sections from the other side, and had my head turned to the left facing west. I noticed a persistent contrail (a ""chemtrail"") was being laid in the western sky, coming in my direction, so I kept my eyes on it, as I had nothing better to do and realized in short order that this particular chemtrail was rather unusual: it was what researchers into this phenemonon refer to as an ""intermittent"" chemtrail - in other words it was not a single long contrail but rather was broken up into many shorter pieces almost like a morse code in the skies...dot, space, dot, space, dash, space, dot, space, dash, space, dash, etc. - obviously *not* an ordinary contrail. The plane itself was quite difficult to see immediately in front of its trail, and for some reason seemed to be most visible in the intervening open spaces. I finally lost the plane and leading edge of the trail behind some nearby buildings in the backyard, but the intermittent chemtrail itself was very cohesive and retained its shape so I kept watching it to see if another plane would come over the horizon. I had in mind to compare a follow-up contrail to the first. After watching for 2 or 3 minutes, I was stunned to see a very large and bright silvery object shoot through an open space in the original chemtrail path, in other words from one side of the trail, through an open space, to the next section of the chemtrail. Whatever this thing was, it was obviously following the trajectory of the chemtrail perfectly. I was unable to see any wings on this craft nor was I able to hear any sounds from it, but it obviously was metallic as inferred by the very bright silvery flash it made when out in the open and reflecting the sun. The entire sighting actually lasted less than one second, and if I hadn't been lucky enough to be looking in precisely the right spot I never would have seen it. By the way, I referred to my sighting as ""cigar-shaped"" but that impression may have been due simply to the speed of the sighting...this event happened so quickly that it's possible I suppose, that the object could have been almost *any* geometrical shape. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, this is a correction and an addendum to my original report filed recently, from Fargo, ND. The correct date of my sighting was Sunday, 8 August, 2004, and not the 6th as I'd originally entered.  My sighting as I've stated happened very very quickly, but after running or looping it over and over again through the camera of my mind, I came up with a few more details: I actually saw the craft twice. The first time was a very bright flash, which alerted me to focus my attention on that small area of the sky. This was obviously a result of the bright sun reflecting off of the surface of this bright silvery craft and also occured in a gap of the chemtrail, but more distant. A very brief interval later, the craft came shooting out the end of another break in the chemtrail in plain sight but moving very fast. For some reason the dark band running from the front to the back of the craft that I mentioned in my original report, has now resolved itself in my mind to be a row of very dark windows which also reflected the sunlight, and the shape of the craft seems nearer an ovoid or large circlular shape rather than cigar-shaped. Also and for what it's worth, it almost seems as if the craft STOPPED for the briefest of intervals, the instant it breeched the chemtrail and then continued on its way, but this may only be my mind trying to explain to itself something highly anamolous.

The evening was perfectly clear and there were millions of stars visible with little moon light.  At approx 2241 hrs, 21 Aug 04, we noticed a light high in the atmoshpere heading in a South Eastern direction that looked just like a statellite, but the we noticed there were two more behind it (in a right angle trinanlge formation), and one trailing about at a distance behind.  I noticed that all of the lights seemed to be oscillating slightly as they moved, unlike a statellite which moves smoothly and swiftly.  As we were talking about these lights, the fourth light that was trailing at a distance began to speed up and looked like it was going to pass the other three on the left hand side, but just as it met up with the middle two, it quiclky veered off to the right (south) and sped off out of sight. A few seconds later the remaining three formed an almost perfect triangle and then disappeared (the lead one first, followed by the remaing two).  I do not believe these were aircraft b/c the lights were constant, resembling what a statellite looks like, plus there was no sound or vapour trail.  I also do not believe these lights were statellites, since on obviously changed course and the remaining three fluctuated in speed and laked the fluent, smooth movment consistent with a statellite.

(I checked the clock in my kitchen)  Usually I go right back to bed after a sleep interrupting 'pit stop' but it was late enough in the morning and I was not ready to go back to sleep so I did what I always do on such an occasion which is go into the living room preparatory to turning on the light and engaging in some mindless reading till I am ready to zonk out again.  At that point, I looked out my window (which has a southeast exposure over 26th street in the neighborhood of Chelsea, Manhattan (only blocks away from Madison Square Garden where the convention was held) and I noticed an orb of light pretty high up in the sky suspended over 8th Avenue.  I immediately got my field glasses and trained them on this orb, which appeared sparkly with refracted light, like a diamond.  I put my field glasses down and it was then that I noticed that this was not the only orb of light in the sky.  I began to count and saw that there were between 11 and 13 other orbs of light that were hanging, motionless and soundless, in the sky to the south of the first one.  There was at least one more light  far to the left of the first one to the north.  The other orbs had a softer glow to them, perhaps because the sky was slightly more overcast to the south.  The orbs to the south were in an odd formation that actually looked, on closer inspection, like the big dipper constellation.  (I can say with certainty that I was not viewing the constellation itself; I know what stars in the night sky look like and they are considerably smaller than these orbs.  Furthermore, the amount of light pollution in New York, even at 5:00 in the morning, and the fact that it was somewhat cloudy and overcast, would make it impossible to clearly see any astronomical phenomena easily, or even at all.)  I continued watching for some time and finally went into my kitchen to make some decaf.  I set up the pot and walked back into the living room.  The lights were still there, unchanged in their position.  It was about 5:45.  I walked back into the kitchen, loaded up the pot with ground coffee and water and then noticed that the sky was beginning to lighten in the east.   I walked back into the living room for another look, and the lights were gone.  I did not (I'm sorry to say) see them disappear.

It was still dark, just the barest beginnings of dawn.  Very quiet.  Northwest Austin, rural area, very little artificial light in this neighborhood.  Saw two soft white lights in the southern sky moving in straight line at steady pace northward.  I assumed it was an airplane but there was no sound, and this is not any kind of usual flight path I've ever observed for commercial flights.  As I watched, I realized it had the appearance of a triangle, which my logical mind doubted, but as I kept watching, there was no doubt.  I had read a bit about black triangles (just enough to know that they had been reported); this was soft silver, giving appearance of rounded edges (not points).  There was no sound at first.  Later, I thought I heard a soft constant roar (like a distant ocean) following it, as it came nearer.  After it had passed, the sound was associated with it, not with something behind it or following it.  Four or five lights became visible as it got closer.  Two were colored, soft red and blue or green, blinking.  The two white lights seen initially were soft and constant.  This thing wasn't hiding.  I observed it constantly for at least 30 seconds.  It never deviated from a straight path.  Its speed did not change.  Its path went directly over my location.  I cannot describe its elevation in feet,  having nothing to compare it with besides commercial airplanes.

Then as I watched them I realized they were aircraft as the reflection of light made it obvious that these were metallic.   There were two of them flying in formation.   We have an airshow coming up later this month, so I assumed that they were military jets practicing for the show.  I stuck my head in the back door and told my husband what we were watching and he came outside.  As we watched them, we began to think they were birds again, not because of the way they looked but because of the way they were flying. Constantly in formation the two aircraft were manuevering several different patterns including tight circular patterns that we have never seen aircraft perform.  I'm not good with estimating altitude, but these two objects were flying below the few clouds we have in the sky today.  As they turned away from us and toward us, the reflection of the sun hitting the objects made them seem 5 times larger. They were silvery white objects of triangular shape.  There were no sounds as the aircraft went nearly over our heads.   There were no vapor trails or contrails coming off the aircraft either.

It was making unbelievable circular maneurvers We were traveling northbound on Interstate 79 north of Pittsburgh on Sept.6,(Labor Day) 2004.  Traffic was heavy.  As we crested the hill past the Evan City entrance to I 79 we spotted a Y shaped white/silver craft above the treeline west of the highway.  At first we thought it was some sort of remote controlled airplane because it was making unbelievable circular maneurvers above and within the treeline.  However, it seemed too large (over an inch in size) to be a radio controlled toy airplane. Also, the Y shape was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. The air show lasted for less than 20 seconds. We lost sight of the craft for approximately 15 seconds as we were traveling about 70 mph.  After we began to descend down into the valley towards the Zelienople exit, we saw what we believed was the same craft traveling in a straight pattern at a high rate of speed east by north east toward the Evan City - Butler area.  The craft was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon. At this height, the craft was about 1/2 inch in length. My boyfriend was surprised at the speed and size of this craft.  After we got home I had everyone (my son age 13, my boyfriend and myself) draw a picture of what they saw.  We compared pictures.  Each was Y -shaped - simliliar to a Mercedes Logo.  If this was an experimental plane (remote controlled or otherwise)and not a UFO, it was certainly beautiful to look at and remarkable to watch.  It would have been very dificult to make circular patterns above and into this heavily forested and hilly terrain next to the highway.  The sky was blue with some clouds, and the Y shaped craft really stood out. It should have been visible to many people on the highway. I would be very curious to know if anyone else traveling on the highway at that time of day happened to catch the airshow.

It was heading directly over my head when it suddenly stopped and then about 5 seconds later just vanished.

I also saw a satellite heading straight towards it until it could not be see anymore with the naked eye. Most likley it's reflect was over-powered by the light from the object.

The object at its distance would be as bright as a garage flood light about 50 ft away. It seems to stay low to the horizon, and a variably slow straight heading.  This is now the 4th occurence I have had so far.  There are only 2 quirks about this I have noticed.  I am now keeping notes of when i see it and what it does.  Then i noticed tonite, that the moon was out, waxing crescent.  The last time i saw it, the moon was at half phase.  The last thing was that soon after I observe the object, a plane or chopper of some type, appears from the direction of our local airport which is southwest of here.  Once that plane is airborne and climbing, the object begins immediately, almost, move in the opposite direction of the plane, until I lose sight of it in a treeline or building height.  Tonite however, the craft was about a ruler and ahalf away from the first plane following(holding a ruler to the sky), then two more planes or choppers(they had a distinct red light on each) joined in, but the object was too far ahead and they seemed to give up and turn due south.  The object still headed into the west, until i lost it in the treeline.  I happen to catch this object when i step out into my balcony for a smoke.  The last thing which i doubt is possible, i took my office sized(3inch) laser pointer with me the third time i saw this object(early last week) and pointed where i thought wsa directly at the object and it suddenly sped up, moving at a constant distance until it disappeared in the trees once again.  Although when i first see the object its moving away from the same location in the horizon each time, which is in between two towers of sorts with 3 red lights each.  The space between is where i first observed the object last month, and i believe i saw it lift from the ground(horizon at that distance), and continually head west as all the other times.  I am 26 yrs old and originally from New Jersey.  I am in the field of Security and i also do some work from home.  I am a deeply studied person in UFO's and phenomenon.  I believe i was in sound mind each of the times I have seen this lit object.  The color of the light that this object is would be a pale yello, leaning towards white, and sometimes will seem to pulsate.

Back to what I saw:  I was on my way home from a movie at Desert Ridge in Phoenix with three of my friends.  We had talked about my sightings from earlier in the week and even had a good laugh about them.  I couldn't help looking at the sky when I noticed the lights were there again.  This time there were two orbs.  My friend who was driving exited 101 at Scottsdale Road and proceeded south.  We made a right turn at the first street (Mayo) and headed west and stopped 1/4 mile down to watch the lights.  They were blinking on and off just as they had done two nights previous.  There was also another car pulled over just a little further down the street and the driver was standing outside of his car watching them too.  I noted the time immediately when I saw the lights (10:00 p.m.).  The show lasted for about 10 minutes.  This time I took a picture with my cell phone.  The resolution is terrible but it did capture the objects as well as some planes that were in the area.  Interestingly though the color of the objects is not orange in the photo.  One is brown and the other is green.  During the 10 minutes, the planes appear to fly above, below and all around them, going about their business as if it's nothing unusual.  I just don't understand why the pilots don't report these lights.  Are they not seeing them?  In reading the reports in the database, there appear to be a high number in the southwest sky that are very similar over Phoenix.  With all the cameras around recording our every move these days, why do we not have one focused on the sky to capture this phenomenon in Phoenix?  I'm really curious now as to the origin of these lights.  I've purchased a compass that I'm keeping in my car to provide better details.  At least my friends saw it this time.  I will see if I can get them to submit their report as well.",2004-06-23T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I has on a swinging bench as he was barbqing. I saw the strange diskus shaped thing. At first glance I thought it was a ballon. Then I of course as usual when seeing a ballon I watch it until it disappears into either a dot or into the clouds. So I took a second glance and noticed it was not a balloon. I called Andrew over and he thought I was insane, until he saw it himself. It was in the shape of a disk. The best way to describe it was it looked like a black tube and the inside was silver but was sort of concaved in, making a wide cone lacking a perfect filled doughnut.  It lasted for about 25-30 seconds. It was wobbiling and the size was about 9-10 meters in diameter. There were a few clouds, on a nice hot 90 degrees early evening. While watching it we called my cousin once removed to come out and see it, shortly after shouting his name, it just vanished into the blue sky. No clouds, just vanished, neither I nor my friend took our eye off of it as we called my cousin in. Just vanished miraculously into thin air.

( about 1979 July or August) My Dad and I had stopped to speak to an old friend. I was looking towards the west in the direction of the town of Hamilton. The evening was warm and overcast. I have tried to show this in the attached drawing. When I saw the first object, it was emerging from behind the hills to the west, which are about 8 or 10 miles away. Within a few seconds the first object was totally visible, then the smaller object rose up from behind the hill and was soon totally visible also.  The objects were both orange in colour and seemed to shimmer with long flowing tendrils. The second object was about half the size of the first. I am a lousy artist but the objects in the drawing are very close to the things I saw. The perspective in the drawing is about correct, so you can imagine the size of the objects from 8 or 10 miles away. My Dad and his old pal were deep in conversation. When I told them to look at the fireballs floating up through the clouds they didn't seem to be able to see them. My Dad seemed to be agitated with me for disturbing his conversation and they continued to talk as if nothing had happened. I know that this was no hallucination. The objects merged together before floating up into the dark clouds. My Dad never had any time for this sort of thing (UFOS) so I never spoke to him about it. The whole thing from start to finish took about 2 minutes at the most.  I am now 45 years old and this scene has been in my mind since the night I saw it.  I will send you some more info on some more odd sightings I have had if you want. I do a little amateur astronomy and watch the satellites often with the naked eye, but when one stops and stays there for 2 or three minuets, brightens up like a flare then zooms off in the opposite direction, it makes you think. I know the Sun can catch satellites and make them brighten to about the brightness of Venus at the moment, but I have never seen one brighten as much as this and then shoot off in another direction.  Hope this helps,  Regards,  Thank you to the person for the report and image.

A friend and I were walking through a park in the early evening of May, 1983.  We were both 17 year old high school students, and just strolling and talking together on a warm, clear evening.  As it got dark we laid on the grass to watch the stars.  We saw an object moving from West to East --- seeming to be at a similar altitude but faster speed than a commercial aircraft.  However, it was visible against a starry sky, seemed larger than a jet, and it had an obviously different shape.  The object was comprised of 4 or 5 metallic balls connected in a straight line, front to back.  What really caught my attention was the fact that it would move across the sky from our left to our right and disappear over the right horizon, only to return in five minutes or so from the left horizon again --- but higher in the sky.  This happened maybe four times --- each pass starting higher in the sky.  It gave the impression of the object possibly mapping the earth.  And the fact that it always went left to right started my friend and me on a discussion of the possibility of there being more than one craft versus one craft circling the globe at an incredible speed.  This sighting took place in an extremely quiet, rural town of 7,000 people.  If a jet came overhead or a truck passed on the interstate on a quiet night you would hear it.  This object made no noise.  There was also very little light polution in our location.  I have never heard another account of a craft shaped like this one --- several orbs in a row.

Note ; {unabe to enter date in report form}. Dear Mr. Davenport. Thank you for your time and effert.    In 1987 I was assighned to The United States Dept. of the Interior, B.L.M. at the Olancha Ca. This was a prototype Uni-Mog test,we were responsible for over one million acres. At approx. 22;30 we were dispatced from heatquarters in San Bernadino to a fire reported by a deputy sherrif, in the Panamont valley area, this I thought unuseual since a unit was available much closer than us. We responded, and on the highway to death Valley, Panmont Valley and to a small town called Darwen, in 15 minite of Traval time,at appox 60 mph we saw what I at first thought was a semi-truck on the left, we whre going east,just off the road. We did not have on the overhead lights since we were in the midle of nowhere and did not use lights and sirens in unpopulated areas. We slowed and stoped in the middle of the rd. We all saw a saucer, at least 60 feet wide,appox15 to 20 feet high, below the raise road bed, light up by a bright :bug light yellow interior light,showing through portholes across the upper area that was nearly even to the road,since it rested on the desert floor and not the raised highway. My engeneer became very frightend and rolled up into a fetal possition on the floor of the vehicle. He is a Georgia country boy, and not a small man at all. My Capt. who was driveing at the time looked catatonic, and simply said,""Ive seen these before"". I turned on the overhead rotaiting lights,the saucer turned off its lights. I tried to radio headquarters and the radio was dead. I left the engine and approched the saucer. I knew this was real and was very excited and interested,so I touched it with my hand, wearing a glove. The saucer rose up, no noise,lights out,and I could see it blocking out the stars, they were very bright. It rose to perhaps 30 feet,crossed directly over my head and landed just as it was before,just off the road and slightly b! elow it,  now instead of arms length away,30 to 40 feet away. At this time for the first time during this incident I felt fear instead of amazment. I thought something was trying to sneak up on me from behind out of the dark. My memory is not clear from this point. My crew remained in the engine the whole time, somehow I foun myself handsignaling my Capt. in the back up lights of the engine , dircting him to back down a very narrow winding road. I dont know how we got their, engine,crew and all. Eventually we came to a gate, lock in place,but unlocked, and ended up in the town of darwen. I think we were on China Lake Naval Weapons Depot. and drove in to Dawen. You do not just go to  China Lake . You will be shot if you manage to get far enough, even in uniform. I understand the Navy took the wholle town of Darwen and leveled it, due to its closeness to the base. It was just a few gold miners their.I filed a report with the navy and was contacted by a rear Admeral who interveiwed me and kept asking me if I was aware they had a captured Russian gun ship, helicopter and that it was classified. He aked what I knew about helicopters, and when I informed him my duties requiered to fly offten, he said,""with your knowladge of helicopters,what type would you say this was"" Fially I responded with"" I would say it is no type of helicopter I am familure with. He was content with tat answer. I will reach the other officers who were with me. You can reach ((name deleted)) at 530-((number deleted)), ((name deleted) Station. U.S.D.I. B.L.M.

I am over what ever affect this had on me now, However, I did have some physical symptoms, and begain sleeping with my Ruger Pistol chambered under my pillow. I had some fear after this.

As I was lookng at the light, I caught sight of a large, round, lime green circle with a misty perimeter, crossing in front of the moon which was at about a ten'o clock position in the sky. It was about 1/4 to 1/3 the size of the moon, and the size remained  the same in it's orbit till it disappeared over the trees and the horizon directly south of us at 12'o clock.

In 1999 at approx: 3:00 p.m. on a Sunday in St.Catharines we were stopped at the lights on Welland Ave. in front of the A & P my husband noticed something just above us. Sticking my head out the window and yelling at the hubby to do the same. We saw a long ship hovering about 500 yds and I could also see people looking our way. They too seemed to be in a bit of a shock, then in a instant it vanished. (the sky was clear, not a cloud insight. We will never forget this once in a life time ""great experience""  Additional information provided by the witness below:  Hello and your welcome,  St.Catharine's Ontario, that's correct. Yes my husband and myself were the witness in the vehicle. We had no pets with us at the time of the sighting. There were a few people on the street but I'm not sure if they noticed what we saw. We were pretty shocked and a bit dumb-founded. The shape was like a silver-bullet trailer but alot longer and larger, quite frankly it was huge. There looked to be an observation deck and I could see the people inside. Underneath this platform were many small shaped windows like seen on a ship. It was white/silver in color. No blue, red or orange lights that we could see, no haze was seen either.  One thing I will tell you is that the people on that craft did notice us looking back at them and for a brief moment I made eye contact with one of them. This being looked just like me, female. She nor the others appeared to have large heads and big eyes. Then it vanished in a instant, I blinked and it was gone. There was no sound that we could here. I said to my hubby how could something that big just hover? He has always been interested in planes etc. and he said I don't ""explanatory"" know! What the heck was that?! No aircraft did we see or hear afterwards. An older lady once told me: if your always looking up towards the sky this means your a good person, I think my hubby and I are fortunate soul's for having the opportunity to see what we did that day!  In addition my hubby would like me to tell you that this ship was,what he could figure,about 3-4 hundred feet long and about 1000 feet up from us.He also said to make sure I tell you that it was a clear summer day not a cloud in the sky.  Enjoy your day.  Thank you to the witness for the wonderful report.

I remember that got my attention. I decided to study it and not take my eyes off. As it passed over I noticed the sun was reflecting off the surface of the object, without that sun being at that angle at that time of day it would have reflected its surroundings and dissapeared as it did a few minues later when my viewing angle changed from the proximity of the sun and the craft. I could almost be certian that there would be very few different angles that you would see the object. The reflective qualities alloud me to observe what was imediately on the other side of the craft. I determined that this quality of stealth reflection could only be achieved if the craft was a perfect sphere. The extra light from the sun gave shape to the object. The farther it moved from my position the more faded the suns reflection became, until it was gone, but I still new it had to be there. That was really frustrating. I new it was close enough that I should still be able to see it. It wasn't like a plane that you see how far you can watch it for. It wasn't even close to being that far away.

I am submitting this because I heard that lights in the sky had been seen at this time by others.

It then gradually smoothed to a low rumble, and maintained the same volume for perhaps another 5 seconds.  During the next and final 5 seconds it very gradually faded away, so gradually that I was not sure when it was completely gone.  I am familiar with the tendency for people to overestimate the duration of events, so this morning I ran several timed tests with a stopwatch, reciting to myself the changing nature of the sound, and only looking at the watch after.  I consistently measured within 2 seconds +- of 15 seconds, trying 4 times.  The sound occurred at 2:44 am according to my nightstand digitial clock, which I subsequently found to be about 15 seconds fast relative to WWV.  I do not know the time more precisely - there is no seconds indication on the clock.  The sound was not loud: it did not awaken my wife sleeping next to me, and I only heard it because I happened to be awake.  At first I thought it was the precursor rumbling to an earthquake, having experienced the 2001 magnitude 6.8 Nisqually quake.  When I realized that it was not being followed by shaking, I thought it must be a heavy jet transport leaving Sea-Tac airport.  We can occasionally hear those, although they typically do not depart at 3 in the morning.  Then I recall noting that the sound had a real ""feel"" to it, even though it was muted, and I could sense the pressure waves, not just hear the sound.  I went back to sleep thinking it might have been a distant earthquake.  The next morning, the 6 am local news mentioned that a number of people had reported lights and fireballs in the sky ""a few minutes"" before 3 am.  I did not see any lights, but I was not facing a North-facing window.  This sound may be connected to those sightings. ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor.

Included with the report is the photo you see below, plus a 2 mb video clip of the object moving slowly across the sky. As it moves through the sky it changes the most brilliant colors, or for a better word it flashes at a fast rate of speed. The footage is truly amazing. In the photo the witness made a large number of still shots from the video clip and this is what you see below in the photo.  Photo can be viewed at: http://www.hbccufo.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1253&mode=&order=0&thold=0  Hello Brian,  Here is something which you may want to get out to a wider audience in whatever format can be done.  The last week in April skies were fair and clear around these parts, in Portland, OR. On several nights between 9 and 11 pm I saw some apparent star-like objects on the east or west horizon which seemed to strobe in multiple colors. I could remember seeing red and blue strobing lights with white either accompanying or alternating with the red and blue.  While this was, I thought, an uncommon occurrence, I also took some photos with the digital camera. The object did not show much in the photo, even though 10x optical zoom, because the strobing light was not much bigger than a small point of light. On to Plan B.  I also have a 127mm diameter x 1250mm focal length Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope to which the camera can be mounted. With the camera-telescope combination , I can zoom from 31x to 310x power, all of this is optical zoom. At this level of zoom you can begin to see more than a speck of light. I took some regular digital photos, and some short video segments to show the strobing light.  The camera & telescope was on a tripod so did not move (except when I kicked it or made camera adjustments). I have attached the short video here, and also the first 48 video still frames which were cut and pasted into a single image. The top row of 8 images are the first eight frames, the 2nd row the second 8 frames, etc. All told there are about 3.1 seconds of time represented by the 48 still frames, one every 1/15th second.  In the movie, the object appears to move to the upper left. Since it is viewed thru a telescope without any mirrors, it has to be rotated around 180 degrees so as not to appear upside down and backwards. It actually moved to the lower right before me.  This particular object was taken at 9:32pm local time on 4-30-04. The object was on the WSW horizon. I had to constantly track it by moving the scope to the right in small increments. That would make it's path travelled proceeding approximately to the northwest.  In the 48 frame composite photo, the blue outlined frame in the lower right corner is a copy of the very first frame, and I pasted it there as a check for my printer to be sure that it reproduced all the colors. This composite of 48 images has also been resized to 2048 x 1536 to show more detail than the original still frame size of 320 x 240.  There is an amazing array of colors and shapes displayed, much more than could be seen even looking through the telescope. The reason I believe this is so is because the eye-brain connection cannot process all the data so quickly as can a video camera. The brain only reports back what limited data that it can process.  Some questions I have are,  1. What is it?  2. What is it doing?  3. What is signified by the different colors?  4. Is it in our atmosphere (below 200 miles), or beyond it?  5. The object seems to be flinging something off of it. What could this be?  6. There seem to be traces of apparent gaseous matter around some of the frames.  7. How big is it? It covers about 12 pixels of width in the 320 x 240 pixel frame, at 310x power.  8. Has anyone else captured pictures of a similar object?  9. Could it be a satellite?  10. If we knew how far away it was, a good estimate could be made of the object's size and travel rate.  11. What kind of technology can strobe this fast continuously?  12. Whose technology is it?  Thanks for looking,  Thank you to the witness for the report, video footage and still photo.

As I drove toward town from the East, I noticed from about a mile away that there was a bright amorphous, stationary light, or possibly closely clustered lights, that seemed to exist in an area where there is nothing more than the intersection of a couple dirt roads, and a normally well-traveled highway. Though it was near the airport, it was too far North to be a tower, etc. As I approached the intersection, I began to realize that this was absolutely an aircraft of some kind, hovering at appx. 100 feet. Being an Air Force veteran, I instinctively turned down my radio, rolled down my window, and put my ear to the wind in order to detect (or not) audibly the sort of power plant that could be lifting this immense craft. There was nothing but the sound of my slowing engine, as I eventually found myself completely bewildered, and at a dead stop ion the highway, head craning out the window. There were three distinct points, each with its own circular, whitish light; no windows, etc. My first thought was something like, ""Whatever the hell this is, why would it choose to hover idly right here. Then, I slowly turned back East onto White's road in order to observe it more closely. As I gazed up at the craft, innumerrable possibilities flashed in and out of my mind, each being dismissed as an impossibility for any number of (known) scientific and avionic detractions, and as this went on, I started to become a bit anxious (again w/regard to any fathomable agenda the craft's occupants/operators could possibly have), and so I let out the clutch and began rolling forward. As I did, to my utter astonishment, it began moving in the same direction, at the same rate of travel, as I. Anxious to somehow verify what I was seeing, I realized that not one other vehicle was even in sight for about the last three minutes- unusual at the time. Anyway, desiring to hasten fate, I hit the gas and noted that the craft was keeping perfect distance and rate of acceleration to me.  Confused, and somewhat frustrated with my inability to conventionally rationalize, or at least share the experience with even another motorist, I began yelling and giving the SUV everything it had. Almost as if it (they?) had sensed my increasingly negative emotional state, it suddenly broke pace w/ me (@maybe 70 MPH), and began to arc upward and to the West, as its speed increased at an eye-popping rate, and then it went lights out. I hammered the brake, skidding to a stop just in time for the first oncoming vehicle to see nothing more than a cloud of dust around my truck. This was one, though not the first of 4 or 5 events of similar magnitude and inexplicability. Another time, on another well traveled dirt road further East in the valley, I viewed a seemingly identical craft hovering over a house at appx. 40 feet.

There are two ways to go home, the short way and the long way.  The long way is only about three minutes longer, but 99 percent of the time, we take the short way.  My wife was driving and for some reason when we came to the point where we could chose between the short and long way, I told her, ""take a left, let's go the back(long) way home.""  Right before we took that left turn, I noticed a small single-engine plane flying S/SE at around 500 to 700 feet.  I could easily see its red and green lights.  Bessemer Municipal Airport is about six miles NW of this location.  This airplane looked like it may have departed from Bessemer due to its altitude.  We continued to drive the long way home and I thought to myself, ""why did I tell her to go this way?"" and ""I hope she didn't mind me telling her to go this way.""  We turned right at Highway 58, going west in Helena when I clearly noticed this big object in the sky with three white lights, the center light being the brightest of the three.  I could see the grayish outline of a boomerang shape, with the bright light in the center and the left and right white lights on the edges of the ""wings"" of the object.  For some reason I nonchalantly pointed to it and said, ""see, things like that.""  I don't know why I said that.  We had not been talking about seeing strange things.  It was like the whole reason why we went the long way home was to see this thing.  When she saw what I was seeing, she stopped the car and asked, ""what is that?"" and ""it's not moving.""  It wasn't moving.  It looked like it was stationary in the sky.  The object was about 35 degrees, NW of our location at a range of about 1 mile and an altitude of anywhere from 1000 to 5000 feet depending on the size of this thing.  It was ""pointed"" in the direction of SE and none of the lights were blinking.  The pure-white aspects of the lights on this thing really stand out in my memory of seeing it.  The center light was as bright as Venus is currently in the evening, and I recall seeing this object and Venus at the same time, with Venus to the left and higher up in the sky, maybe five degrees away.  At an arm's length, the boomerang-shaped object was about 1-1/2 inches wide and 1/4 inch tall.  A car was coming up behind us so we had to start moving down the road.  As we did, I kept my eye fixed on the object.  Intermittently, trees would pass and block the view that I had of the object, but it was still there.  We came to Highway 17 and instead of turning left to go home, my wife turned right to get a better view of this object.  My view was blocked by a gas station and the bright flourescent lights of the outside of the gas station.  When my view was clear again, the object was gone.  We continued to drive north on this road.  Oddly enough, there was a vehicle off the road and in the ditch on the side of the road with its headlights on, but we didn't see anyone in it.  This distracted us briefly, but it didn't seem to be a serious accident.  We continued to drive and we saw what appeared to be the object again, but now it was way to the north, about 5-7 miles away, much higher in the sky and what appeared to be headed to the north.  It was now moving away from us quickly and we soon lost sight of it over the northern horizon(toward Birmingham).  We drove through a subdivision on our way back home, driving slowly to see if we could notice the object once more, but we never saw it again.  We circled around by the forementioned gas station and saw where a police cruiser was arriving on the scene where the vehicle was in the ditch.  We made it home about 90 seconds later where we discussed what we just saw.  These questions remain:  What did we see?  How did it move so far away, changing directions and altitude so quickly?  What made us go home that way?  Why did I say what I said when I saw the object?  Did the driver of the vehicle in the ditch see this thing, thus distracting the driver to cause the accident?  I guess we will never know that.  Maybe I am over-thinking this whole thing, but my wife and I know that we saw a large boomerang thing with three lights floating stationary over Helena, AL for at least 10 seconds that night.  Weather at the time: skies were clear, the air temperature was in the 50's(F) and there was a light northerly breeze.",2004-05-10T00:00:00,33.2507,-86.9211

Also they were in a parellel position then they would change to a vertical positioning from each other.They had a haze around them during the time of sighting. They were fairly stationery and after about 10 minutes of watching they joined up from a vertical position then separated again. They began to move NorthEast  to the Northwest after this separation took place. Once over what was close to being directly over our house they remained stationery for about 10 minutes.

I have seen numerous, red/white/green/yellow blinking, non-moving points of light for at least two years now, but I never gave them much thought, always passing them off as stars or planets. The following sighting begins with one such occurance.  I work third shift, and when time allows I take a break and go to another building where I work to speak with a friend there. We usually talk outside while I smoke. On 4/18/04 I pointed out one of the above mentioned points of light to my coworker and we spent some time talking about it and what it could be, my coworker noted that it seemed to be pulsing (growing brighter and then darker) The object appeared to be just above the tree line (in what direction I do not know, I never was good at that sort of thing) but it was clearly in space, like any other star. I went back to my building passing it off once again as a planet or a bright star.  Around four hours later I returned to my coworkers building for another break. To our suprise, while the rest of the night sky moved on as it does, the ""star"" was in the same place, as we talked we kept gazing at it, and both of us made note that it had move higher in a matter of seconds. My interest was peeked at this point, I continued to watch the ""star"" I also noted that it seemed to get brighter and dimmer with more frequency and intensity. The only movement it made was the moment it seemed to move upwards.  As I watched the ""star"" directly under it and what seemed at the time just across the way a bright light flew directly under our ""star"" It was very bright and left a trail, I had a good 45 second view of it and it seemed to be round, and it left a slight, trail as it went, the trail was very close to the object. It passed out of my field of vision behind another building on the complex. Unfortunatly my coworker did not see the sphere of light. The sphere was certainly close, just behind the trees, it seemed to only be as high as a second story building. It was not a plane, there was no sound, no flashing lights, just a sphere of bright light.  The next evening there was no sign of either the ""star"" or the sphere of light. Interestingly enough, the coworker mentioned to me the nxt evening on the phone that friends had called and talked about seeing a strange pulsing red star that did not move with the rest of the night sky. I am not sure if they are connected. Both happened in Maine, about 100 miles from each other.

In the end it headed east towards Cleveland national park then the sphere slowly faded away.  I ruled out a blimp as it was 4am in the morning and no attractions going on. It was not a hellicopter or plane for it had no flashing lights or blue or red of any kind. Planes only fly that low over orange county to land at John Wayne Airport. There is no such flight path as it headed east instead of south to Irvine. Most convincing was how it remained idle or barely moving for about a minute.

This sighting occurred this morning as I was driving home from work. It was a beautiful, clear morning with the usual crisscrossing contrails in the sky. As I entered the interstate, I-75 northbound, I noticed an unusual contrail rising vertically from the horizon. I pulled over, looked up through my windshield, and saw that the contrail continued straight up for about a third of the visible sky and then made a 20 to 25 degree course change to the left. I followed the path of the contrail until I could see that a small, triangular shape continuing to travel almost vertically into the morning sky was making the contrail. It looked like a rocket on a path into the stratosphere. I watched the object moving upward until its altitude was such that I could no longer see it. The contrail dissipated until only the initial vertical contrail was still faintly visible; it remained so for about another ten minutes. As I continued my drive homeward, I could see the vertical contrail straight ahead of me in the northern sky.  There are no large military bases in this area from whence a rocket might be launched. The only base is an Air National Guard base located to the south of the city. Is it possible that I witnessed a rocket launch that originated at a distant location?  This was definitely NOT an airliner or a typical military jet. I see those almost every day and I am quite familiar with their characteristic contrails. This was quite different. I would appreciate an opinion as to what I might have witnessed this morning. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Contrail?  PD))",2004-04-27T00:00:00,35.96156134085213,-83.98011528822055

I was surrounded by tall buildings (warehouses) and couldn't watch it at all as it sped away,toward the Capitol Forest.There was also a search light (white light beam) in an area about 5 miles north of my location at the South Sound Shopping Mall in Olympia, Wa, that was also working at the time.

They appeared to be light (yellowish) but also kind of transparent/slightly glowy. Each had a smaller circle within the circle,like a dot in the middle, which was darker.  The three flew at the same speed in the same direction.  And then disappeared. I often enjoy the evening skys here, and know there is lots of airforce around.  I have seen many different types of planes at night, never anything that looked like this. My husband asked how big they were and if I could put my hand over them when I was watching. Which I believe I could.The time was very short in duration that I was able to see this, but the sky was clear and my first reaction was, ""Whoe,...what the heck was that!""

Please know that this was no hoax, and do not discount it just because I may not know how to use this computer properly. I do not remember, but may have thought it did not enter and resubmitted it.  I have never sent one of these and was not enthusiastic about giving out my personal information.  My husband had suggested I write you because he said he has heard about these flying spheres/in a triangle form before and thought it was worth noting. And with that, I will also tell you that on 04/27/2004 at about 10:00pm, I went out in the yard again.  Curious from the night before and now instead of coming from the south to the north I saw crafts going from north to south.  These were not the 3 sphere shaped/triangle I saw on the 21st. I would say 1 every 10-15min flew overhead.  These had noise (the other did not).  These had 3 round lights (not independent spheres). Some of them had 2 yellow and one red light.  And you could see the triangle shape on these.  My impression was that this was some sort of airforce practice run.  Or my personal interpretation was that someone wanted anyone who saw the thing on the 21st to think it was one of these because they were so loud I kept coming out of my home every time I heard one. (I had called your hotline, but it was always a recording).  Thank you. ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was facing almost due west, looking almost straight up to 45 degrees- scanning the sky.  Something, coming into my peripheral vision from my left, caught my eye and I turned to focus on it.  I could not make it out clearly.  I could tell it was chevron to bow shaped, clear to orange-ish, but very faint colored.  There was either another, but smaller, or a same sized but higher object to the left of it, both were chevron/bow shaped.  My first thought was that it was a flock of geese, but before I could tell my son to ""look at the geese"", I realized it was traveling entirely too fast for birds and there was no ""honking"" or sound what so ever normally associated with geese.  The only thing that I could say was,""son, tell me you see that."" and his response was ""that is awesome.""  From the time I first spotted it to losing sight of it over some trees in the neighbors yard was 5-8 seconds.  It was almost directly overhead.  It was somewhere in the neighborhood of 2000-2500 feet off the ground.  Size of the object??  All that I can honestly say was that it was big.  It was not just a dot or a line.   For lack of scale, looking up in the sky, it was 10"" to 12"" in the sky and the smaller one was 6"" to 8"".  The ""body"" of the object was 1"" (middle) to pointed end (actually it faded to nothing at the ""wing-tips""), it was hazy looking almost like a cloud. It travelled south to north.  Sky was clear (not a cloud in the sky) with light wind out of the northeast (6mph). I have worked in the aircraft industry for almost 10 years and I know what an airplane is, and I know what geese look like flying in formation.  This was not either. I live 10-15 minutes south of Tinker AFB and see military aircraft daily, it wasn't anything I have seen flying overhead from there. (Also, note, I did see either a 7! 07 or AWAC on final approach around 5-10 minutes following my sighting of the objects.  It was east of me, and I could clearly see the strobes and landing lights as well as hear it, it was several miles away.)  There were also several small aircraft (3-4) in the sky each going in different directions at different flight levels.",2004-04-09T00:00:00,35.23330889679715,-97.45347508896798

Photos can be viewed at: http://www.hbccufo.com/index.php  I have continued to see various assorted craft off and on for well, years. Tonights craft was particulary interesting because of the apparent shape. Which was different to me. I noticed a bright flash and went for my camera. The lights hovered in the eastern sky for about 5 minutes and then diappeared by imploding or shutting off all at once.  Let me know what enhancements might show on this.  Additional Information Below""  In describing the brilliant flash - I would say an electric white/blue, as lightening.  In describing movement – It would be best to say it was like something that had been moving very fast and suddenly stopping. It had a hanging sense to it as if an unstable slight spin. The turning was slow and it gave an appearance of adjusting the actual lights. The lights appeared to have a sequencing effect. To say they went from odd positions to a more uniform alignment. After they came into ‘straight line’ forming a V with an odd nose. A ‘W’ type of nose. Then they just faded down and a quick white/blue flash and it was gone.  I do not know what direction it came from. I can only say it ‘materialised’ in the eastern sky. With the exception of maneuvering the lights it made no drastic moves. I do not know which way it went because it seemed to implode or leave in the manner in which it appeared. Flash and gone.  The sky was clear. All other natural and satellite features were in normal placement. The temperature was in the 20’sF. Slight breeze.  To take a wild guess as to elevation of object I would say just above small craft path. The placement was toward the lake. I think it was above the lake. The lake is 7 blocks east downhill from my home.  To describe structure I would call it a very interesting bit of ‘piecework’. I mean to say it was not in alignment when it first ‘appeared’. It performed some kind of structuring act.  It may be best to call it W shaped. I say that because though it was V in overall shape, at least by the manipulating of the lights it also formed an indent like the W or a ^ at the V center.  I did not detect any sound other then a humming sensation at the top of my head.  Myself and my dog and cat were the witnesses for this that I am aware of. The cat a HUGE Orange Tom Tabby went to the west in the bit of thicket to hunt. The dog a miniature Schnauzer/Lhasa (Benji) was mildly distressed. He could hear something and wanted to go into the house. He growled for sometime but that could be because he does not like his cat to be hunting in the dark! We have sighted strange black dogs…they look like hienna’s in stature, they stalk the deer trail through the west hillside.  Thank you for your time. I bring this one up because its shape was new to me. I see allot of oval shaped objects and Spheres. Orbs abound! I stand contrary to ALL digital orbs being Blurfos. I have seen hundreds of orbs pass through this part of the world. They can be seen with the naked eye. They are not an aftershot. Another words they are there before a picture is even taken. I have seen ‘cloud’ forms in a number of locations in this area. They appear to be intelligent and have a set purpose what that purpose is…I do not profess to know!

It was nice today, so we had the sliding glass door open. It was a cool, clear night. My youngest son who is 17 was in the kitchen and I was in the office on the computer (I am 48, and a housewife)and I suddenly heard my husband hollar at me.  He told me to look outside. My youngest son and I ran out onto the back porch, and my other son who just had gotten out of the shower (21, two years of college, works at Costco)also came out to see what was the matter. My husband told us to look at that bright light in the sky that was moving north at a high rate of speed.  We watched it and then it turned back south. My youngest son went and got our binoculars and we all took turns looking at it. Suddenly it stopped and then went straight up into the sky towards the moon. I was looking into the binoculars at that time, and as it was almost to the moon, my husband and both sons yelled out,""There is another one!"" As I was looking at the first object which was going straight toward the moon, out of the left came the second one straight toward the first one.  I watched them as their paths crossed. They were both just bright objects like a star, but my husband said for us to be able to see them so clearly at such a far distance, they had to be huge. The second one continued to the South and we lost sight of it quit quickly, but the first one came back from behind the moon and turned back toward us and then went in a NW direction.  We watched it for a couple more minutes and then lost sight of it.

Also a link to the March 31, 2004 sighting is included in this new report below.  My wife and I saw the exact same thing over downtown St Paul last night heading south around 8:30 PM.  We believe it was a flock of geese flying at a high elevation that were catching the last rays of sunlight.  Additional Information Below:  We live in a high rise in downtown St Paul, Minnesota, so I believe we have a different vantage point from which to view the phenomena than someone on the ground would have.  At approximately 8:30 PM on Thursday we went out on our balcony to have a cigarette.  The sun had set and it was fairly dark.  My wife noticed the flying ""V"" formation heading due south.  The sight was identical to the picture you posted on Rense.com. or here at: http://www.hbccufo.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1150  She pointed it out to me and we stared at it.  Our initial thought was that it was a UFO.  But as we observed for about three minutes we noticed that the formation metamorphised into a sloppy looking ""W"".  Then we saw a piece of it break off and go to the other side forming a lopsided ""V"" formation again. There was a cloud formation to the southeast that was slightly illuminated on the top as well.  Both the formation and the cloud to the southeast faded out simultaneously.  There is a large Canadian goose population around here.  Typically we can see flocks flying south near the end of the evening.  Based on our observation we thought that the ""V"" was a flock of geese flying at a higher than normal elevation and they were catching the last rays of light on their underbellies.  Again, we could be wrong.  I have seen unexplained sights in the sky before but this was the first time I had ever seen an illuminated flying ""V"".  In this particular instance though, I think that the sight we saw probably had a natural explanation.  It may very well be that what you observed portrayed different characteristics and was not the same phenomenon we observed.  I wish you luck in solving the mystery.

I did not hear any sound coming from the object but did hear the sound of the planes that flew over. It was about the size of a pea/dime.  There were no other witnesses to the sighting, only myself. I went out side to see why there was so many lights in our alley. Some kids decided to spray paint their initials on the side of our garage last night and I thought they were back. So I went on to the porch to have a look. I saw the moon and I decided to take a picture of it. Then I looked at all the stars in the sky when I noticed that one was was sitting there as the first plane flew by, then it moved. I grabbed my binoculars to have a closer look and then it moved again. I played this game you close one eye, see what happens, it moved further west and then north. The red light kept pulsing and I noticed it turning and then it stopped. I wanted to go chase it, but thought it would disappear.  After the second plane flew by, it left heading west by north. The first plane looked like a normal commercial airline, the second plane I paid no attention to it.  Sorry that's about all I can tell you, I hope someone else saw it too.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

The other 2 just stayed where they were and moved everyonce in a while not to far, but enough to watch them move. They moved like nothing I have ever seen. The one that moved to the East moved very fast like a fighter jet, but then made very sudden moves in circles, and up and down. Then it stopped and has remained there since I was last outside. This is the 3rd time this week I have seen this. They also seem to emit something. I can see streaks of light, that are dim, around them. There is always 3 and they are never together, or in the same place. When they aren't flying around they stay pretty motionless, moving from time to time, but they have strobe lights on them.

Hello:  At about 1250 to 0110 am on August 9 2004 I was sitting outside on my deck smoking a cigarette.

The lights were white in color, and in a V pattern.  I stood up because the lights were moving very fast, and I was going to loose sight of it.  My first thought was that it is a very fast airplane, but I couldn’t hear any noise, just that of the city.  I couldn’t tell how far away the lights were or how big the object was.  As I watch trying to think what I was looking at, it moved straight to the west (right) without any wing tip or signal.  It was as if it was going forward then just moved to the right without stopping.  I just said what the hell, still trying to make something out of what I was seeing.  The lights then began going out as if the object had some thickness.  The problem with this I couldn’t see the object.  This I can explain, after all it was very dark and if the object were black I wouldn’t be able to see it in the dark sky.  This incident only took a few seconds and the object moved very fast.  My only explanation would be a B2 bomber with landing lights on; I just can’t explain the turn.  Thank you ((name deleted)).  I already filed this report earlier today.

I live in the desert SW of Maricopa and have lived here for the past 26 years.  I am very familiar with the fact that to our west is the Gila Bend Gunnery Range and that often at night they launch flares that are suspended in the air for about 3-5 minutes, at different elevations.  They burn a golden glow until they burn out then just seem to disappear.  What I saw was not this.  What I viewed was due south.  I have seen it twice now, the first time was about a month ago.  Both times it was above Table Top mountain, which is about 4200 feet tall.  I would first see one light, then very quickly would see 2 or 3 others light up, then they would blink on and off.  At one point their were 7 lights. The lights were very stable and did not move, they just blinked on and off. They did not stay lit like the gunnery lights,(gunnery lights flare when they light up, stay a consistant brightness, then totally burn out...they don't keep lighting up over and over, again.) These lights  would go on and off, almost in some kind of a sequence.  Both times I watched the lights for the total time they were dancing about.  Then they would just stop.  Tonight I stood outside and just kept watching.  About 10 minutes later the lights all blinked one more time and then there was nothing.  In the direction I was facing, due south, I really don't believe there is anything there that can be doing this.  I drove out that way, the last time,  to see if maybe there was a tower put up on the mountain or something (this is a very rural area) and there is nothing.  I don't have a clue what I saw.

I live in Lake Zurich IL about 15-20 miles north of O'Hare Airport.  The area also has several smaller airports.  Given this location there are always planes in the sky...of varying size, propulsion, direction, height, color etc.    I have a Lab (dog) and walk him 4 times a day.  Our last walk of the day is between 10 PM and 12 PM.  While the dog takes himself for a walk, typically I check out the night sky...stars, falling/shooting stars, low flying and high flying planes.  I claim no particular knowledge or skill,  in making observations of atmospheric or man made airial objects. At about (I wasn't wearing a watch) 11:15PM...I was standing still just doing what I normally do...checking the position of the Big Dipper...noticing some distant moving lights in the sky, which always turn out to be aircraft lights.  The sky was clear...visability very good. Having set the background, I was totally relaxed, and just observing the sky when a bright white light flashed across the sky in front of me.  There was, by my judgment, a white...ball...that left a streak.  It took that object one maybe two seconds to pass through my field of vision.  I had no time to turn my head..my eyes seemed to pick up a moving light not much before it was just to the right of the direction I was looking.  My eyes just followed the white ball/streak till trees cut off my line of sight.  I just stood there, amazed, thinking (and still thinking)- what the hell did I see? And there was no sound that I could hear. Here are descriptive facts as my mind recorded them:   1)  This ball and streak was traveling HORIZONTAL to the ground, moving north to south (direction of O Hare Airport), at a speed that I (former accountant) calculate very crudely (I'm just trying to get a ball park idea of speed)...at a speed of 18,000 mph. 2)   Now the following is very difficult, because obviously I was not at all prepared for a special observation, and its longevity was very,very brief. I tried to guess at the height and distance it was from me.  Again, I am very familiar with aircraft flying at various altitudes and distances.  Nevertheless,this observation was difficult to nail down.  The altitude was low...and I  am perfectly aware of spacial illusions...and because of the size of the object and speed...all making me question each of my own conclusions.  I feel the object was surely under 5,000 feet, possibly under 1,000 feet and ...somewhere in that range.  And it did not seem very far away...here, as a very rough guess, I would say it was about 5- 10 miles away...just as a crude guess. 3)   This bright white ball ( as near as I can tell) left a streak or tail that went back about 2-3 miles...but of course, if I'm off in height and distance then my sense of distance for this streak would be distorted. In summary, this occurance was like seeing a shooting star, traveling low and horizontally, at an incredible speed. ((ADDENDUM REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS)) This is a supplemental report and inquiry. In my report filed yesterday 8/10/04 I failed to state the size of the UFO. My guesstimate would be -  about 10 feet.  Otherwise in reading case histories on this site I was shocked to note that many cases  involved circumstances much like I experienced. I have a few questions:   1)  For a very crude calculation of speed (i.e. how fast is ""fast""?) I made a simple (and I know it's simple, really). Using my best judgment I estimated the distance that I saw the UFO cover at 5 miles (I had trees to my left and right...so my field of vison was narrowed). My estimate of duration was one to two seconds (and though it was a blink) it could have even been three seconds...but lets go with one second. So for this calculation the object was going 5 miles a second, then multiplying 5 miles times 60 seconds...we get 300 miles per minute, which is then multiplied by 60 minutes to the hour...and we're up to 18,000 mph.  Remember, this is a crude calculation (strictly to determine a ""ball park guess"".  Now, if my sight duration was 2 seconds that would cut the guesstimated speed to 9,000 mph...3 seconds would bring the speed down to 6,000 mph.  This calculation alone is not enough.  If we had several such calculations, we might be able to draw some fairly good conclusions.  But by this conclusion I ""m pretty confident this object was going many times the speed of todays aircraft. 2)   After filing my initial form on this site, I called the FAA.  The man I spoke to was responsible for taking UFO sightings.  He was nice enough, but he questioned me like I was an pilot returning from a mission.  After all, I had a 1 -2 second experience that happened because I was casually looking at a small piece of the night sky.  Again, he was nice but he had edge of skepticism that I tolerated (after all under similar circumstances I might act the same ).  Toward the end of the conversation he asked if I ever saw a meteor?   I have seen many  a shooting star or falling star and I might have seen a meteor shower years ago.  I said that I don't think it was a meteor...and besides this object was going at a fast, constant speed, horizontally - parallel to the ground.  His answer was...just as you can point a gun in any direction...a meteor can go in any direction (...???).  I said I didn't know that.  At this moment I don't believe that bit of information...I'll check it out.  Before ending the call, he was nice enough to tell me there was a sighting a half hour earlier in California.  And it was  possible one object could have been in both places that night.   3)  Again, taking crude and possible numbers...30 minutes into 2100 miles equals 70 miles per minute...times 60 minutes...and that says  on a direct flight from LA to Chicago in 30 minutes the object was going 4,200 mph. Of course, the object might have gone to several places only to end up in Chicago.  If that were the case the calculation would be wrong and the speed much faster.  Anyway, based on what we have we know there is a possibility the object is doing it's traveling over the US at a speed of ...between 4, 200 mph and 6,000 mph (or 9,000 mph, or 18,000 mph).  4) FINALLY,  as already explained in the original submission, I'm within the O'Hare radar reach...is it possible to inquire of the FAA if the O'Hare radar picked up a UFO on Monday night around 11:15pm?  And if they would...would they tell the truth?  Would an object streaking at a fantastic speed even show up...and if it did would they conclude it was just a ""bug""?

I have a hammock up there, and I went up to have a smoke. I looked up as I always do when I smoke out there. I saw movement, looked like just another star, but moving. This object had to be way up there, it was a size of a small star. No blinking lights, no color, just looked like every other star up there, except it moved, and moved and stopped ever so often. I followed this movement , thinking it was a satlite ( which I have seen, they move in a straight line, and also look like a normal star, I see these often when I camp in the rockies) but the movement was all over, not supper fast, but the speed would decrease and increase, or even just stop. So this object, I followed, and then another one caught me eye, its the movement of these objects that catches your eye. Now there are two objects, I watched the two objects fly, and stop, fly and stop. Again no flashing lights, WAY to high up to be a plane, the movement is something i've never seen ever in my life! I watched till the two objects flew behind a high cloud thin cloud that was over partially over downtown. When I camp , the view of the stars is clear, but downtown there is light pollution. I took this into consideration, but the MOVEMENT , the stopping, the different speeds. I'm very skeptical person, dont buy into this hollywood, saucer, green little men thing. But what I saw last night had me a bit worried. Maybe other people saw this event, but again, its not obvious just looking up at the stars. I was watching the sky for serveral minutes before I saw movement and the objects. No noise, no beams, nothing of that nature, they were the size of small stars, very high up, and the same color of the surrounding stars ( probably due to them being so high up, that the sun reflects back just like the stars).",2004-08-24T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

I pointed the object out to the 3 other people I was with (we all adults late 30’s to early 40’s) and 2 out of the 3 others were able to see it.

Having seen numerous anomalous sightings from my patio looking east in recent weeks, I scanned the sky for another.  Within moments I saw a ""fast-mover,"" a dim sphere travelling due south at a good clip -- a bit faster than, say, a jet or a satellite.  Through binocs, it was circular and reminiscent of the others I've seen recently, appearing to reflect the sun a bit.  It was halfway between horizon and zenith to the east.  As I watched it through binocs, it travelled into a feathery cloud, and I didn't see it come out the other side.  Lowering the binocs, I noted that the cloud was not very large at all, so it was odd that the object didn't come out the other side, and I looked but couldn't find it with the naked eye either.  I noted that the clouds, which appeared to be cirrus and rather sparse, thus higher than cumulus clouds, were moving slowly northward. Just a few moments later, at 3 PM, I saw this object or another one which seemingly suddenly appeared almost directly overhead.  It was shining as bright as Vega but in the daytime sky.  It remained absolutely motionless, mimicking a star, for about 3 minutes, while clouds approached slowly from the south.  Through binocs it appeared to be a perfectly circular, white object, with the typical thin crescent of darker ""shadow"" area on its side opposite the sun.  It remained steady and very bright as I gazed at it through binoculars.  I lowered the binocs briefly as a cloud moved into the area of the sphere, and then looked again through binocs.  Now I noticed what I thought was something different -- a solid BLACK sphere moving through the cloud.  (Since the cloud itself was moving, for the moment I couldn't tell if the apparent movement of the object was an illusion or real.)  However, I soon saw that it was the same apparent object, only when it was in front of the clouds it was pure black, and when it moved out of the cloud (or the cloud moved away from it) it became instantly pure white again against the blue sky.  I watched as the apparent colour changed instantaneously.  If this foreground/background colour change is a known phenomenon with rubber balloons, I've never known of it before; anyway the object did not appear to be a balloon.  At 3.05 I noticed it had moved from its stationary position just south of an overhead wire to the north, by several degrees, and then it started heading to the east/northeast rather slowly, until by about 3.08 it had passed behind some trees and continued out of sight, now lower than half-way between horizon and zenith as it travelled away from me.

I'd just like to know what it is.  Tonight my girlfriend and I were leaving our apartment in Bellefonte PA and heading towards State College, about 15 minutes away. As we topped a hill, we noticed an odd disturbance in the sky. I thought at first that it was the twin landing lights of an airplane, flying through thin clouds (there are numerous flight paths over central PA). There were two elongated, grey-white luminous bands, surrounded by a gently glowing white haze, something like this:  . . . . . . . . === . === . . . . . . . .  where == are the bands and the periods are the haze. Anyway, I thought it was an airplane over some clouds. But I soon realized that it didn't appear to be moving. It was not very bright, and it reminded my girlfriend of a comet. Indeed, aside from the funky geometry, it DID look like a very bright comet (like a milky star, as Hale-Bopp looked, at its brightest magnitude, for example). But unlike a comet, it was moving very slowly across the sky (we parked the car to watch, and I tracked its movement against a church steeple). It moved from the southwest to the northeast, roughly, and its speed resembled that of a slow cloud: perhaps one degree of sky per minute. Several planes flew overhead during this time, and I was able to compare them both in terms of motion and appearance. There was no resemblence at all. The object was gray and nebulous; the planes were clear and their red and green lights were perfectly visible. Stars were also visible overhead and all around the object; although there were clouds on the horizon, the sky above was very clear.  As we watched the object for approximately three minutes, it very slowly began to disperse and fade. The parallel luminous bands became splotches, and finally the whole thing degenerated into a slightly luminous cloud approximately the visible size of my thumb held at arm's length.  The past-full moon was just rising, though it was mostly obscured by clouds to the south east. Those clouds and the moon were purple and yellow, generally, and I did not have the impression that the object was illuminated by moonlight (though I can't be sure). As the object faded and became more cloudlike, we drove to a darker spot to watch it, which we did for perhaps another 8 minutes. I telephoned by brother in Louisiana, and asked him if he could see it (I was hoping to decide if the object was in space, in orbit, or in the atmosphere). He could not see it, but reported strong light pollution.  By this time, the object had faded to the point that I would not have noticed it, had I not been looking. It was still perhaps 10 degrees from directly overhead and very dim, visible to the west and drifting east. My girlfriend and I continued our trip to State College, and when we arrived, clouds obscured the sky. The clouds cleared perhaps 20 minutes later, and there was no trace left of the object.  I have no reason to believe this was anything other than some odd weather or astronomical phenomena, but neither of us has ever seen anything like it. Any ideas?

I decided since there were no mosquitos evident to sit on the front porch. It was a beautiful clear sky and the full moon hadn't come up yet. I could see many stars above and since we do not live in the city, the lights of the stars were clear.  I could see the glow of the lights of the city of Belleville to the south of us.  At approx 9:10pm I noticed a strange orangy object on the Western horizon above the hill to the northwest of us.  I called my husband out to see this as this object was moving towards our house and it was bigger than any plane I have seen.  He came out and viewed the object in the sky.  Then went inside to get his binoculars.  When he came out and viewed the object with the binoculars he noticed its unusual shape.  ""I determined that it was shaped like a snow angel with a pointed head, that is it was an elongated object with four fan-like projections at its sides.  The pointed head had a blinking light.  As it approached its colour changed to white.""  We then called our son out to view this object in the sky.  He confirmed the same shape that we had both observed.  It was moving from west to east and heading right over our house.  All three of us viewed this object coming towards the house and its shape and size.  It seemed to be  a glowing cloud with a flashing light.  The 'angel' shape was glowing and you could see stars through it.  However at the 'pointed' end you could not see stars through it.  We also noted 5-6 aircraft all heading the same direction around the object.  Some did appear to be circling the object.  The object was considerably larger than any of these planes.  Approximately 9:15pm-9:20pm, the objects light stopped blinking.  But, the cloud 'angel' continued to move towards our house (easterly).  At this point (approx 9:25pm) Gordon went back into the house.  My son and I stayed out to watch this object.  It was now almost directly over the house.  I had the binoculars and watched as a bright circular orangey-yellow object flew out of the cloud.  This object was about the size of 1/4 of the full moon.  The object headed directly north at a much faster speed than the cloud had been moving.  The object appeared to be about 1/8 the size of the full moon when it reached the stars that make up the Big Dipper. It reached that position in the sky in about 30 seconds.  The object then turned 90 degrees and headed back west.  It disappeared moments later.  The cloud disappeared within 5 minutes of the object leaving it.  All planes then seemed to have left the vicinity when we looked for them again after the object disappeared. All the ones we had observed around this object that is.  It should be noted here that at no time did we hear any noise from this object.  We could hear and see the planes, but, not this other object in the sky.  Note:  It was moving laterally to its length across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

At first I thought it was the moon behind a cloud but I realized the sky was clear with many stars and the moon was just rising in the eastern sky.  It looked like a very small cloud with a light behind it.  I could not make out any shape but was aware it was drifting very slowly directly east.  Went to get a pair of binoculars and my wife and son.  Through the binoculars there was a distinct shape with a more pronounced light shooting south out of one of five arms (for lack of a better word).  The shape looked almost like a starfish with four of the arms evenly distibuted and then a fifth arm protruding south with the light coming out of it.  This shape could only be made out while looking through the binoculars and the entire object faded out of sight as it drifted directly overhead into the brighter sky (the sky gets bright to the east of my house due to a mall to the east).  It was odd that the light seemed to be facing out of the object like a headlight on a vehicle but yet the object was moving or probably just drifting to the east.  My wife and son observed the same exact thing.  It was visible for about 30 minutes.  Really curious if anyone else in eastern Ohio observed this.  It was not very bright and looked like a cloud with a light in or behind it, but maintained a very distinct starfish shape as it drifted/moved which I do not think a cloud would have done.

While she observed I ran down to find my binoculars (10x25 Nikon). I observed the UFO for a minute and then handed the binoculars to my wife. Without any comment from me she described what I had seen; three equidistant, white lights, apparently attached to some sort of object. After about 3-4 minutes of observing it moved to the east and remained barely in view for another 10 minutes and then become impossible to view.  This is the third incident in about two months of an anomolous occurance in the same area. The first was bright, stationary object that I thought was a planet. While observing it dimmed completely out and then came back ""on"". Unless I lost my bearings and confused it with a planet it remained there until sunup.  Second sighting was of a very bright object at 9:00 in the same area. Again it appeared stationary as I gauged it to the stationary horizon. Honestly, it looked like it could have been an airplane reflecting the sun just right, but then it dimmed out. It very well could have been an airplane but it must have been moving directly away from me as it appeared stationary.  The third sighting described at the beginning of this report was very distinct in that we could make out something that did appear to have structure.  Anyway, still can't be sure of anything but perhaps this will get some more eyes trained on the area east of Montrose. ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.

It was around 8:30 P.M.. We had just finished dinner and I went out on our porch to have a cigarette. We live in a second story apartment in Torrington, Ct. Our house faces almost directly Southeast. We get an excellent, almost unobstructed view of the sky. I am an avid sky-watcher and have enjoyed amateur astronomy from a very young age. I know most of the constellations in the sky on sight. Other than some clouds on the horizon to the Northeast, the sky was clear tonight with good visibility.  I sat down to enjoy my smoke when I noticed what at first I thought was a very bright 1st magnitude star. It was about 30 degrees above the Southeast horizon. At first I thought good, it is clear and will be a good night for looking at stars. But then it struck me that this bright star was out of place. This would be in the constellation Capricorn which does not have any bright stars at all. I could see the Great Square of Pegasus to my left. I could see the bright star Altair much higher in the sky and a little to my right. I could see the constellation Sagittarius low in the sky to my right. I am just telling you this so you will know I am not mistaking this object for a star. So I was confused by this ""star"" and stared at it, trying to figure out what it was. This star looked large as well, about the size of a BB held at arms length. And though it was very bright, it was not brilliant like a star. I looked at it for about 10 seconds, then I thought it started to move. There are wires from the telephone poles that run directly in front of my apartment. Using one of the wires as a reference, I could detect this object moving lower in the sky very slowly. Suddenly, it moved very quickly toward the South. As it did it decreased in brightness and faded from view. It also seemed to change from white to bluish, and then slightly green. Even as it quickly faded it was very strange. It appeared to be illuminated from within. At the last before it faded from view, it was very dimly lit and looked like a crystal ball. It looked transparent, like a globe or sphere. From the time it moved quickly till it faded out could have only been a second or two. This quick movement probably covered 10 degrees of sky. I see planes every night flying into Bradley Field in Hartford and further east to Boston or Providence. In fact, I probably saw at least 20 planes tonight. This object moved at least 4 or 5 times quicker than the planes I see. It never made a sound. This object must have been at a fairly high altitude.  I ran into the house and grabbed a pair of binoculars I keep on a bookcase by the front door for stargazing. I was back out in seconds and searched the area hoping to spot the object but it was gone. I stayed out for another 30 minutes or so, but saw nothing but stars and airliners crossing the sky.  This may seem like a long story for such a short sighting. But it was a very strange sight. I believe this object was under intelligent control. You even get the feeling that it knows you are watching. Wierd.  This is about the 4th or 5th time I have seen these objects in my life, all quite different from one another. I can only attribute that to the fact that I spend a great deal of time looking at the sky and have all my life. I am a very down to earth person. I do not really believe in extraterrestrial life, but I cannot deny that there are some very odd objects flying around. I have my own theories about this. I think they might be spiritual in nature, but that's just my opinion. I really don't know for sure.

I heard a low humming sound very soft at first then it was a low rummbling sound and as I looked in the direction and this huge ship or craft was approached right straight across my view to the right on us.  This thing was very slow and it was very low as well about 4 hundred feet or a little more as far as I could tell by my estimation. This ship or vessel was shaped in a triangle and it's lights were glowing from underneath it an those lights seemed to alternated in a pattern as it passed over me.  I grabbed my flashlight an shinned it up at the thing as I watched it going slowly over our area of town, someone else had to see this thing I would supposebut it was so quiet man.. it seems to take forever to go over the area..I was just in shock to see it I guess..under the circustances..guess I was kinda stunned just to see this ship..so low.  I called loudly to my mom in the next room after a few moments and when this thing came over us you could only hear the light rumbleing or humm or something, you know not like normal engine propulsion. All I know is it was very big and slow. I then grabbed my flashlight and ran off the porch to the street corner to get a better look as it left our area then after it reached the edge of town or my view the thing just to off out of my range of night site. This ship or whatever this was..like I said was two or three minutes seemed like I had view or watched the vessel, it seemed like forever to me at the time. What was so shocking about the thing was it was not a loud humm or just very little noise. my mom heard it too and we have also seen various other sitings as well in our area in the last few months, but this thing was huge.. my God what or who was flying this ship and where are they from..is it the military or what? is, well you want my oppinion? it is not the government in my view, but I don't know what this ship was, all I know it was the strangest thing I ever saw in my life...I just know this ""if I had not been wondering what the low humm was or had not looked up at just the moment I did, I would have never seen the thing at all I believe.",2004-09-09T00:00:00,35.353695348837206,-94.38678217054263

The windows were open because it's been very warm here in the Bay Area.  The neighbor's dog was loose (as usual), but it sounded like someone might have tossed a plastic cup on the street, so I went out with my flashlight.  Seeing the dog loose, I figured things were OK.  As I turned to come back into the house, something in the sky caught my eye to the east.  Being an amateur astronomer, it's quite common for me to give the sky a glance, even under such circumstances.  What I saw amazed me.  Just below the waning Moon yet above the constellation Gemini was a large burnt orange ""planet"" in the sky.  The reason I say ""planet"" instead of ""star"" is because it looked like a larger version of what Mars looks like when it was at its closest approach to Earth last summer (or the summer before, I forget at the moment, I'm nervous).  It was moving like a satellite, but it was too huge to be the space station.  I have seen it before.  It was heading towards the northeast.  The constellation Auriga was high above it.  I watched it for at least a minute.  It was moving so slowly, I decided to go in and grab a pair of binoculars.  The first pair I found was an old trusty 7x35 Tasco (114 m/1000 m-341 ft/1000 yrds).  I rushed back outside, took my glasses off, and zeroed in on it.  What I saw astounded me.  Not only was this object not circular, it had amazing detail to it.  The bottom of it shone with a bright oval glow, just like it was a propulsion of some kind.  It reminded me of the Gulf Breeze photos of that Polaroid UFO.  Above the smaller, oval ""bottom"" to it was a larger body above it, attached to it.  It looked like three orange beams with at least two dark columns between the glowing parts.  Above the ""columns"" was a dome of some sort, and it all seems to be one piece moving together.  It seemed to be turning, like a tumbling satellite, but I could actually see parts of the craft seeming to twist, giving itself new shapes as it went along.  As it continued, the bottom shone brighter and dimmer, and so did the rest of the ""craft.""  It took on a long string-like shape with three prominent oval orange lights, top, middle, and bottom after a while, and when it did that, orange sparks began shooting from the bottom of the ""oval"" glowing part.  I've never seen anything like it.  It made no noise, and I'm led to believe it was a dying satellite of some sort, but I've never seen such detail in a satellite, let alone with such a small pair of binoculars.  I watched it for at least three minutes.  I have a digital camera, but it's hard to even catch the Moon in it, and this object was not as bright in magnitude as the Moon. Venus was rising when I went back out to take a look at the direction it traveled.  It was much larger in size than Venus, although not as bright.  To the unaided eye, the object's magnitude was pretty much evenly distributed over its area.  Saturn was above and right of Venus, and you could have used 7 Saturns just cover this object with the unaided eye, easily.  Did anyone else see this???",2004-09-09T00:00:00,,

What I have been witnessing began on July 19, 2004 at approximately 2:30 am.  I live in a canyon of Palm Springs, CA that is surrounded by the San Jacinto and the Santa Rosa Mountains.  Our home has many large windows that open up to view the mountains.  I awoke to use the restroom around 2:30 am and was taken aback by a large white ""light"" that was literally illuminating my bathroom.  The light was too big to be a star and was very close to the mountain top (it was in the eastern sky).  It had some dimision to it but I can't really say what shape it was, it was just the brightest light I had ever seen.  I woke my husband because I didn't want to be the only one to see it, he looked at it and agreed that he appeared to be too large and bright to be a star.  The following evening at around 9:30 pm I looked over the mountains to see if I could see this light and it wasn't there, however, there was an orb that was flashing blue, green and red lights, I observed it closer with a pair of binoculars and it appeared to be pulsating.  My husband saw it also.  We went to bed and I woke up around midnight and again at 2:30 am, the orb was still there flashing but the bright light was not there.  I went back to bed to awake again at 4:30 am and the bright light was there again, in the same spot, there were more colored flashing orbs around the sky but not as close as the one observed earlier in the evening.  I have been watching the sky every night since.  On Thursday, July 23, 2004 I was driving down Highway 111 in Palm Springs around 8:30 am, it was dusk and I saw this bright light in the western sky over the Santa Rosa Mountain range, it appeared to be moving slowly downward towards the mountain.  I got home and got my husband to come out and look, he saw it also, the light continued to drift downward until it disappeared behind the mountain range.  I looked around the sky and with my binoculars, I could see several flashing orbs, all with green, red and blue lights. Every evening since July 19th I have awoken at different times during the night to see if the light is in the eastern sky, it has never appeared before 12:30 am and is always still visable until the sun rises.  As I watch the light it slowly drifts upward.  Interestingly enough, the light in the western sky that drifts in and down appears to be the same light that settles over the mountain in the eastern sky to only drift back up until out of sight. My siting last evening is what has compelled me to report these sightings.  I awoke at 12:38 am and looked out towards the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains and I saw a circular shaped orb that had red, green, and blue lights on it and it was hovering in a stationary position over the mountain.  It was the same orb that I have seen in the sky higher up only this time it was low almost sitting on the mountain.  I watched it for about 15 seconds and then it just disappeared, I stood there with my mouth to the floor breaking out into a cold sweat.  As I kept my eyes glued to the sky, the orb reappeared, flashing and hovering and then dipped below the mountain range. The bright light was not in the sky.  I awoke at 4:30 am again to find the bright white light hovering in the same position that I saw the circular orb.  I am pretty freaked out at this point and I am starting to think I'm crazy.  Has anyone else in the Palm Springs area reported such a siteing?  I know that I will see the light again tonight, It seems to be getting closer to the mountains every evening.  The orbs continue to flash about the sky around this area.  Any clues as to what this could be???????

It clearly wasn't a plane or some other object that could rationally be described, as it was truly unique to anything we have ever seen.   As we stared at it for a minute or two, it suddenly moved in a darting motion to it's left, then it darted again quickly to it's right, and it moved irradically for a another minute or two after that.  Again after a moment, it remained motionless in the sky without any apparent moment.  It was at this moment that after the rush of excitemnt had passed, I decided to get my camera to get a picture of this thing.

On the afternoon of Dec 27th,  2003, while sitting and talking to a man on the bench near the ocean In Myrtle Beach South Carolina about 500 yds from the ocean, there appeared in the sky above and to the west a disc approximately the size of a slightly oversized silver dollar. Above it and to the upper left hand quadrant was a smaller one about the size of a nickle. I observed the object kind of floating with the wind which was moving from SW by W (I'm A sailor and am very cognizant of wind direction and speed.) I commented that it looked like someone's balloon had gotten either loose or out of control. What made me think it was a balloon was the fact that it looked like a target, circular in shape with an orange center and a black perifory. This color combination changed from black out side to orange outside and as that happened the black moved to the center. I assumed I was looking at some sort of prismatic plastic balloon that changes colors as it changes angles to the light source. Then something happened that made me realize this was not a ballon at all, because it stopped and hovered for a bit then it began moving into what would have been the winds opposite direction. The smaller one did the same thing also. The two of them moved in a floating manner and there were no sudden or quick movements. At this time both the man I was talking to began to realize we were looking at something entirely new to both of us. However about two minutes into this sighting the large circle went up on it's side turning the target like image on end. It was at this point we realized we were looking at a disc.  There was no dome it seemed to be a flat disc with only a small thickness in proportion to it's size.  After about a minute more in this position it again went circular and turned once more to the side   Now we saw a glittering flash indicating that we were looking at something metallic. It flashed momentarily then went on it's side at this point the colored side would have been facing away from earth with the shiny side down. There was an instant when a blue green light best described as aquamarine in color emanated from the circular disk in a cone like manner,and completely around the disc, so much as we could discern form the angle we were looking at it. The light seemed to be widening as it shone down towads earth. This lasted for about two seconds. Meanwhile the two objects still close enough to be observed without having to look from one to the other, the small one went up on edge and we lost sight of it never agan to see it. After the larger one exhibithed the light phenomenon, we saw it return to it's original orange and black colors and still the colors seemed to bleed into one another and exchange places black inside orange outside and vice versa, kind of reminded us of a lava lamp. By this time we noticed another course change the large one still it's approximate original size began to change directions and again going with the wind began to move out over the ocean. We watched it turn from circle to flat and back to circle. all the time this object was not hurrying. We both agreed that we were watching something totally new to us, then without so much as a change in course the orange and black circular disc facing us back on the beach and still at this time the size of a quarter just absolutely and completely disappeard before our eyes.

I mean it was going at the same exact speed that the airplane was, without moving or turning or anything. The unknown object beside the airplane looked as though it was larger than the airplane and it had a very bright glow to it. But the oddest thing about the object was that, unlike the airplane, it looked as though it was floating through the air and there was no smoke cloud left behind it like all flying aircrafts make when theyre being flown. Which leads me to believe that this was a supernatural occurence and that it was a UFO. After about 4 or 5 minutes the object and the airplane got so far away that they werent visible to us any longer.

Not sure if this is the right thing to do, but here it is. Ever since I witness this strange object on March 29th 2004, I have had many strange things happen.  The evening was partly cloudy, and windy, and unusually warm, so I went outside to see the sunset and have a cigarette. While looking to the west at the sunset, I noticed a chrome ball in the sky, and I immediately dismissed it as an airplane coming towards me. After several minutes of watching this object, I decided to run in the house and get my video camera to film this, in case it was a UFO.  After I came back out side, the object had moved to the north, but still hovering over what looked like the Oakland area. As I started filming the object, it swiftly maneuvered towards my location. As it passed me directly overhead, roughly the height of the high clouds, it disappeared. It made no noise as it went overhead, and I could then see the object was oval or roundish, about half the size of a large airliner.  I went into the house and turned on the TV news and my radio, to listen if somebody else witnessed this. Nothing was reported on the stations I selected. As I listened to the news, I hooked up my video camera to the other TV to see the video, which I was expecting to remarkable.  I rewound the tape, and pressed play, and nothing appeared but fuzz. Now I had goosebumps all over my body. Something happened to the tape. The entire tape was dead, just fuzz. Then I started thinking, maybe this thing knew I was taping it and that’s why it flew overhead, but I still to this day cannot figure out why the whole tape is messed up.  Here’s where the fun begins.  A day after this event (which has dramatically altered my life) I notice items in my patio missing. An old electric keyboard is gone, and so was my fishing equipment. I quickly dismissed this as a neighborhood kid theft, but then I started noticing other things missing too. My hair brush, my dirty laundry, my tooth brush, and even some old video tapes that I used to record my friends wedding the week before.  I am the only person who lives here, except for my pet Doberman, who is very old, and semi-senile.  The next part of this might freak you out, as it did to me, and to this day I am afraid to sleep. The following two nights after the sighting, I heard noises in my garage, which is adjacent to my bedroom. Through the walls, I head movement and rattling noises, and what sounded like voices, but squeaky.  The third day after my sighting, I decided it was time to check on things in the garage, and swung open the large front door. All of the light bulbs had been removed, but other than that, everything seemed to be in order. Maybe kids? The doors were locked and remained locked, so I’m unsure what it could have been.  I have decided to move out and sell the house, as I am just too freaked out to stay there, and have been staying at a friends house for a while.  i am now worried I might be abducted. If you need to discuss this or see the fuzzy tape feel free to email me.  Thanks.",2004-05-04T00:00:00,37.6502901369863,-122.07600547945205

A lady called from Smithers, British Columbia to ask if anyone had reported seeing an unusual object hovering and moving slowly over the Ski Hill Road on April 8, 2004 at 11:20 p.m. Because the object the witness saw was so very strange she emailed the Smithers Interior News with her report as she wanted to have the newspaper run a short article on this in case others might have observed what she had that night. There was no reply from the newspaper so she went and paid them a visit enquiring about the email she had sent to them.  She eventually talked with the editor and the paper is going to run a short piece on what was witnessed that night in the April 8, 2004 in the Wednesday - April 28, 2004 newspaper.  What the lady observed from her home was a bright pink spherical shaped object and surrounding the object was a dark blue aura. The object sat low, hovering over the Smithers Ski Hill Road until it just disappeared at a extreme rate of speed. Before the lady lost sight of it, it was moving very slowly from it's hovering position. She said there was not a sound coming from the object. The woman said she usually heads to bed earlier but she wasn't able to sleep and had been watching a program on TV when she decided to go outside to take her dog a pet cookie. She turned around to go back into her home and saw the strange object. She told me that it was not a plane as they are use to seeing them flying over top of the area all the time due to the Smithers airport being close by.  A very important note is that the object was below the rim of the mountains. Also the object was ""not"" observed near any of the ski runs.

It was about 10:30 at night, and I was walking into my family room which is in the front of the house with a big bay window facing South.  it was dark in there, and I went in to sit on the couch and pet the cat while I waited for my husband to come home from work.  Wheile I was walking into the room I noticed a very bright white light in the sky.  I'm not sure how high in the sky it was, but from looking out of my window it was above the tree lines straight ahead.  I noticed it right away since it was so bright.  It didn't move, so I thought at first it was a planet, but was not familiar with their locations in the sky, so I didn't know which ones were visible this time of year.  Anyway, I petted the cat for a bit while I watched it.  It was beautiful, and so bright that it ""shined"" like a diamond would.  I began looking around the rest of the sky, and I noticed an amber colored light far from the other light moving rather quickly heading in the direction of my house  I noticed no blinking lights on it.  Now here is where I get concerned.. About a month ago a friend and I were out driving and noticed an amber light in the sky moving quickly and not blinking.  We pulled over and watched it.  It then suddenly vanished..just turned off like a flashlight would.  It had us ""freaked out"".  I had never seen anything unusual in the sky before, so after that I have noticed myself looking in the sky more lately.  Well, I then went to the back of my house to my back porch to see it pass over the house, and after it did, once again it vanished over the apartment complex behind my house.  Please bare in mind I cannot specify exact height or distances when something is in the sky moving.  I listened, and since I am close to a heavily traveled highway, I cannot tell if the sound I heard was a jet, or vehicles on the highway.  If it was a jet, it had to be military since it was moving much faster than a regular plane. However, I thought even military planes had to have some type of blinking light, or at least some type of light at all times, not just invisible in the night sky. Well, I went on with other things, and my husband came home around 11:00 p.m. and I still saw that bright light in the sky from my window.  About 10 minutes later we went upstairs to bed, and after I got ready I went into my son's room which too is upstairs and faces south (it is actually right above my family room) the light was gone!  I looked around, and I could see stars all over around where the light had been, so a cloud wasn't covering it.  I kept checking back for over an hour, and still no more light.  It too just vanished. It had remained in the same spot the entire time I had seen it, so it was't a low flying plane, and it was extremely bright!  Since I knew nothing about planets, and thought that's what it was at first, I know now that planets are really not that bright either.  Still, I can't find an explanation for it disappearing like that. I am hoping someone can set my mind at ease.  Two months and the same occurance, plus another disappearing act with a light on the same night. Are they connected to each other? Am I going crazy, or is there something else in the sky?

Through the binoculars, the object appeared oblong-shaped, with luminous sides that alternately glowed then dimmed as it continued to travel slowly along in a strange tumbling-like motion. All the time it maintained its near-satellite altitude. The middle of the oblong-shaped object appeared translucent, and I could see blue sky through it. At no time was the sun reflecting off the object. The object also wasn't a balloon, as it appeared to stop for 20 seconds or so before moving on.  The object was proceeding in a westerly direction, until two USAF tanker planes appeared close by from the south, at around 20,000 feet. The object then changed direction, gliding slowly about the sky in it's strange, tumbling motion -- falling end over end -- at the same altitude. I continued to watch the object through binoculars until it was directly overhead. A light aircraft, at around 5,000 feet, passed under the object. I eventually lost sight of the object in a big cloud. I gave up observing due to a stiff neck!

I work security at the hospital and have access to the surveillance cameras at the facility, so I went inside and decided to position the cameras skyward to see if I could get a better and closer view of the object.  Once I fixed the cameras on the object and zoom in on it the object appeared to be a bright circle with another circle inside of it, I then focus the view of the camera to view as near as possible and the object appeared to glow outward from the center and had the appearance of a huge eye.  The sky was clear and stars could easily be viewed by natural eye but this object appeared closer than the stars.  I took pictures of the object on the camera with my picture phone.

I ran inside to grab my binoculars and was back outside within about 30 seconds, but I couldn't find the object, so I scanned the sky to see if it had moved to another location, thinking it may have been a balloon very high in the sky.  I located it, or another object like it, substantially east of the original location, but again, appearing stationary.  (I subsequently checked the current weather report and found that the wind was coming from the north, so apparently the object was not simply drifting in the wind.) I sighted it through the binoculars and it appeared to be a single, round, whitish object.  As I watched it for a couple of minutes, sometimes with the naked eye and sometimes through the binoculars, it seemed to remain almost motionless.  Then SUDDENLY, it took off heading to the south very quickly -- erasing any suspicion I had that it may be a balloon.

Way too early in the evening to see a star, but that is what it resembled, with a spherical shape discernible with binoculars.

I looked up to early morning sky (pre sunrise) to see a commercial airline jet traveling from southeast to northwest at approximately 6:05 AM. Along the contrail I saw a pinhead speck of bright light moving irratically up and down the port side of the contrail.  It darted towards it, then back away from it several times.  The light then traveled up and down the one side of the contrail.  It followed the contrail back up to the rear of the jet then back down the contrail, again.  It then began to dart in and out of the contrail and finally passed through it to the the starboard side.  It repeated its motions up and down and in and out of the contrail, than passed back through it to the port side.  Once again it moved very quickly up to the rear of the jet and then disappear.  I cannot tell you the elevation at which the jet was flying.  I'm sure that this can be found out from one of the airports (Vancouver International) air traffic control.

Not only is the object I am looking at extremely close to the water, it seams extremely distant. Ignoring my self and thoughts based on things I have seen before I continue on. Its now 12:06, the clock is extremely bright in my car and clearly readable. The object proceeds to dart left, and down back around in a circular motion, continues back up to the general area it had started at and then moves right a significant distance. My jaw hits the floor, everything goes pretty cold. I dropped my phone, and I can hear Jenny in the distance babbling on continuously through the Nextel. I reached down picked up my phone and attempted to explain what I had just saw. By 12:08 the conversation has become pretty dramatic as the object moves at extreme speeds in a continual circular motion I decide its time for me to leave…Considering everything that just happened I call my mother who lives not far, I remember being at the end of the drive at Barrington Shore! s and it being 12:12 I told her what happened, what I had seen. She wants me to come get her and take her there, I agree to, when we returned 10-12 minutes later the object is no where in sight. If anyone else saw this that night please email me, ((e-address deleted)) Thankyou!",2004-04-09T00:00:00,42.4231,-86.2187

My wife and I were at John Martin State Park. There had been a drowning the previous week and portions of the lake were closed off since the Park Rangers had not recovered the body of a 17yr that had drowned. There was alot of government activity at this time from state,federal, and county personnel. The navy had flown in a special sonar to try help locate the body of the victim. The incident that was witnessed by my wife and I took place on a camp ground called Point Overlook. We were in our RV and were the only ones at the campgound excluding a Park Ranger in a vehicle approximately 2miles away. We were approximately 300 hundred feet from the lake and approximately 30 feet above the water on a bluff overlooking the lake, hence the name of the campground. My wife had just retired to the bed and I was in the process of securing the RV as we planned to get up early and go fishing. This a lake with approximately 3500 acres of surface water and a fairly large concrete dam. This lake is approximately 8 miles long and 1 mile wide. We were camped approximatley 4miles from the dam. I first saw a bright light comming from the dam heading west. I initially thought it might be a helo looking for the drowning victim as early in the day the authorities had used an airplane and dive teams. This light came closer it became apparent that it was not a single light but six lights strung together. The first was white with the succeeding lights red blue red blue and amaber at the end. It appeared that the lights were connected by some sort of stucture. I estimate the length of these lights to be 600 feet in length. I yelled at my wife to get up. She did in time to see the lights stop directly perpendicular to our RV. The lights were directly over the lake, altitude approximatley 500ft distance to object was 500ft. The lights stopped and rotated. I was in the process of getting the camera and bicnoculars and wife was w! atching the lights. I did not seet the lights stop and rotate she did. She states that when the craft rotated she could clearly see that it was a craft disk in shape with a dome stucture on top. She also stated that what we thought were lights were windows with lumanting lights from inside the craft. By the time I turned around the craft ""winked"" out. That is the best description I can give for its rapid disappearance. The whole thing lasted no more than 5-10 seconds for me.  I had an opportunity to talk to the Park Ranger that was 2 miles away the next morning and she asked me if I saw anything unusal. I told her and asked her if she saw anything. She said that in the past week they all have seen stange lights in and aroung the lake. She also said that they talk amoung themselves but that supervision frowned on making any offical report.

The weather was cool, and the sky was blue and cloudless. As I got into my truck, I noticed the moon had just risen in the east and was just above the treeline.  I headed west on Interstate 4, then to Interstate 275 which crosses Tampa Bay on the Howard Franklin Bridge. There was an airshow at MacDill AFB that day so I kept glancing to my left (south of the bridge) to see if I could see any interesting aircraft. (To give you some background, I'm 39 years old and have grown up on or around military bases my whole life. My father and ex-husband were both in the USAF and my daughter is now in the USAF. I know many USAF planes by sight and sound.) I was disappointed to see that the only thing in the sky was what looked like a commercial jet from the Tampa Airport, along with it's contrail.  I continued west, enjoying the beautiful sunset. After the bridge, the interstate takes a southern curve so I was out of the sight of the sunset for a few minutes until I headed due west again on the 118th Avenue exit. The sun was not yet touching the horizon when I saw what I first thought was Venus, since it was in the same location that I usually see Venus around 9pm or so. However, this was NOT Venus.  It was a very pure white, oval shaped object about 1/2 the size of 1/2 of a full moon. It looked to be over the Gulf of Mexico. It seemed very high in the sky and did not move, it just glowed. At this point I pulled over on the side of the road so I could watch it uninterrupted. As the sun lowered, the object went from an oval to more of a triangle with softened corners. As the last of the sun went below the horizon, the object faded away right before my eyes. Could it be the reflection of something?",2004-04-09T00:00:00,27.845455248618784,-82.71419337016575

There were about eight lights arranged into a sort of triangular shape, although it may have been more of an X.  It was hard to tell exactly because the lights were spinning around.  Whatever it was was moving pretty fast because it only took about 6 seconds to cross the sky.  In this time, it made at least 3 rotations tumbling across the sky in a straight line.  I guess it's possible that it was more than one object and that all the lights were separate, but they were moving as if they were part of the same object. From our point of view, it was hard to tell how high it was, and so also we couldn't tell how big it was, but it was about 10 degrees across (the length of your fist at arms length)  After seeing this thing, we were both pretty jumpy and left.  After telling a friend what we had seen, they told us that another friend of ours saw something odd also.  Talking with them, it seems we saw the same thing.  they saw it from the side, from the 11th floor of their building, they had a better judgement of its height, and said it was really low in the sky.

There were four of us in the front yard Me, my wife, and 2 cousins.  We are all in our early twenties.  We were just going to our homes from my mother’s home, which we visit every Sunday to play a game of Risk, when we found my sister had left her keys in the car.  So one of my cousins took the key out and put it on the doorstep because the house was locked behind us. Then my other cousin pointed up at the sky and my wife and I saw this transparent triangle shape.  It flew heading North to South.  I could make out the edges because the transparency did not go all the way to the edge.  It was kind of just fuzzy on the edges.  The object made absolutely no sounds.  There seemed to be no emitted light.  The sighting lasted all of about 2 seconds before it disappeared from view behind some trees.  The cousin who was putting the key on the doorstep did not get to see it there was a porch awning in the way.  He ran out after we all said ""what the hell is that?"".  He thought we were lying.  After we all described what we saw and speculated what it could have been, we decided to stay there a few minutes to see if it would come back.  The cousin that did not see the triangle went out to the middle of the lawn and started running in circles staring at the Big Dipper.  Then he all of a sudden stopped and pointed up. A smaller triangle had appeared in the sky and was headed from North to more Southeast.  It looked more like 2 shaded triangles that may have been linked by a transparent piece or something else.  This one had more speed and disappeared into the night sky.  At first we thought this one was just ducks or geese, but then realized that they usually make noise when flying and do not fly in such a perfect formation.  The cousin that had not seen the first one, now believed us.  We stood around and speculated on this one too, we all drew some pictures of what we thought both looked like on the hood of my sisters car, in the dust that was all over it, and the pictures turned out pretty much identical.  My younger brother, age 15, heard all the noise we were making and looked out his window.  We motioned for him to come down stairs and he did.  We explained this all to him then went back to watching the sky.  We waited to see if another would appear but after about 20 minutes we decided it is time to go home. All we saw in the 20 minutes was 2 Satellites in the sky righ! t above us. One went north to south the other south to north. None of us have ever seen anything like this.  We all agreed on the shape and transparency of the triangles.  We also all agreed that they appeared to be paper-thin.  They made no noise at all, and also made no apparent air disturbance that we could feel or see.  The night was perfectly clear. Not a cloud in sight or on the horizon.  We also could not see the moon in the sky, it might have not risen over the mountains at that point.  My cousins went home and found this article on this web page http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37316.html which sparked my intrest to post my experience.

Last night we were sitting on our deck and I turned to my wife and said, ""Well, what is that?""  Immediately I knew that it was out of the ordinary.  We live five miles from Offutt AFB and what I saw was in that direction.  It appeared to be at first glance an aircraft perhaps coming towards us.  We had seen many Offutt jets during the day and thought maybe this was just another one.  However, it was standing still.  Dead still.  We ovserved it for several minutes, maybe 5 or 6.  Marilyn then brought out the binoculars and we saw right away that it  was not an aircraft like any we had ever seen.  It appeared to be several thousand feet high and north of Offutt.  It was rectangular in shape, with the rectangle a light green, but with two wing-like protrusions which were brighter green.  It sat perfectly still so we assumed it was not a kite nor a helicopter.  Didn't look like either.  We are really not familiar with weather balloons, but it didn't look like a balloon either.  It held this positon for a good 20 minutes, and then it moved fairly rapidly to the south at what we guessed to be a half mile.  However, prior to its moving, a small single engine aircraft flew overhead.  Marilyn commented that it looked like the plane would fly over the object.  I watched with the binoculars and observed that in fact the plane flew under the object, which we then assumed must be much larger than we had first thought. It held its new position for about ten minutes drifting down slowly and then started drifting, again slowly, to the north and gradually dropped lower and disappeared over the rooftops.  We saw no lights, but its color changed from green to beige once it had moved to the south as noted above.  When it shifted from one position to another the wing-like protrusions had an appearance of gecko heads or modern day fighter aircraft cockpits. During the time we observed this, a couple of Offutt planes took off and landed, but went nowhere near the object. I reported the sighting to the local sheriffs department immediately after, and they said no other calls had been received regarding the sighting. We are both advanced degree college graduates in our mid sixties and have never before experienced any thing like this.

These lights were brighter than conventional aircraft lights but were in perfect alignment with each other, floating in the air without any observed movement.  Within 5 minutes, the lights in the string to the right began to go out, as if a dimmer switch was being used to slowly decrease the light until only darkness remained. There was no obvious logic to the sequence. A couple lights would diminish together and vanish, then a third, etc.  Finally, the string of lights on the left began the same sequence.  We rushed to get binaculars but saw no craft behind the lights. However, once all the lights were gone, we saw 2 helicopters fly into that zone and circle, as if searching for them.  I realized that just lights may not be sexy in terms of a ufo sighting, but it was one of the most startling events of my life, since this is the city known back in 97 for hosting a similar event. I cannot imagine that the military is still playing with flares over a metropolitan area of millions, although that is the obvious conventional explanation that was also offered in 97.

I'm 33 yrs old, I'm into astronomy and aviation. I live by a major airport and under a main approach for aircraft.  I've seen everything from actual meteor's entering the atmopshere and breaking up, to the Stealth Fighter during an airshow.  I've read a heck of alot about the UFO Phenomenon, but never have ever seen anything other than man made and natural occurances.  I met this girl who's also a UFO believer and has had some interesting dreams.  I had considered her to possibly be an abductee, as I have a few family members who have seen UFO's and whatnot in their lifetimes.  I however have been half skeptical because of all the time I've spent looking at the stars.. Well .. tonight things changed.  My GF saw a light which I could not crossing the sky.  I figured she was seeing a satellite.  since my eyesight is not too great I figured she was telling the truth but I ribbed her saying she was nuts.  It was the first nice clear night for a major city where the magnitude is pretty horrible.  We went into the backyard, she sat on my lap and we spent some romantic moments looking at the stars.  I told her jokingly ""ask the star to come back"".  Within 3 mins another star started moving across the sky.. I had my binoculars ready and watched it .. thought wow! A satellite but it disapeared too early.  Thought that it was odd but probably fell out of the sunlight's reflection..  It had moved both from South to North across the Northern Cross.  Then again we saw a bright light move, compared to other stars a short distance.  it was like a star that was there.. then started moving slowly,  then moved fast then dissapeared again.  I told her to send another wish up the aliens to confirm we saw something wierd as a joke to her again.  This time something beyond my wildest dreams happened.  I am still in shock at this moment.  So far I thought it was just satellites moving in a straight line..  I only saw 3.. she saw 4.. in the same area.. about 2 mins after she silently sent a message as I asked for a sign.. 3 lights reddish came out of nowhere right out of the southern side of the northern cross int eh same area we were seeing activity.. move across from the right (south) to the north at VERY high speed. 2 of the lights were converging .. it was like they were in formation getting closer.. then abrubtly turned at a 90 degree angle to the east and disapeared again..  My jaw hit the ground.  I've seen video of ufo's many times and other things.. but always.. ALWAYS said I'd never TRULY believe everything I've read about until I've seen it for myself.    After seeing so many military aircraft over the years and watching the stars all these years.. seeing bolides, shooting stars, and everything else.. I HAVE NEVER seen anything like this.  It totally blew my mind.. my GF and I were totally ecstatic.  We've both wished to see something ALL of our lives to confirm our beliefs.. IT FINALLY HAPPENED!!! I am still pinching myself!!  I felt no need to get a camera it happened all within liek 5-10 mins between all the sightings.  WOW!!! A lifelong wish fulfilled!!! That was nothig man made!!!",2004-06-23T00:00:00,42.3024,-82.87845294117646

Marginal Way exit, while driving north on highway 509 coming down the hill toward the First Avenue Bridge, I saw a medium size star bright lit object above me, about the altitude of 10K feet, moving from my left to my right as an extreme high rate of speed. It flew in an extreme straight line of flight direction with no slight movement, but with great accuracy in one direction.  It was flying downward at a slant toward the north end of Boeing Field just a tad before it reached that field where it made, in less than 1 second, an approximate 100 degree south-southerly turn, the white star light dropping down, like in a bank turn, to then quickly upward in a steady rise to leveling out going south toward the south end of Boeing Field, it’s speed dropping maybe 10-15 percent after that first turn. It then began to drop lower downward and slowing to about 50 percent less speed, going into a soft rounded south-west-westerly bank turn, the light dropping to the right downward then leveling up and out, for a distance of about one-fifth of a mile, then another similar sharp turn but to a sharp north-north-easterly direction for about the same distance, the light moving upward to the left and then leveling out, then another similar turn south-south-westerly for the same distance, the light moving down to the right and then leveling out, and then one more such turn but wider into a north-east-easterly direction, the light moving to the left upward and then leveling out, where it was then flew out of sight past the hill to the west of the Boeing Renton air field. I could not make out the shape of the object the light was attached to, but over the freeway I had the distinct image of it being long and narrow, but after the turns it made then more like a plane, but that could have been my eyes playing tricks with trying to attach some shape to it. It had no other lights on it. At first I thought it was a shooting star but it was ! not moving in a curve. Then I thought it was a comet, but it didn’t have a changing tail behind it – it did have a tail, but very very faint, but I knew it was too close to the earth to be a comet. Then I thought it was a meteorite since one fell near Chehalis recently. Then I thought it might have been a plane coming in for a crash or emergency landing to Boeing Field. And I also thought it might be a cruise missile or test drone craft that Boeing might be testing. I really did expect an explosion so the whole incident was quite scary causing me to quickly cross all the lanes on the freeway from the left to the right emergency lane to stop where I called 911 to report it.

I was driving West on Imperial Highway in Brea, California, after having turned left from going northbound on Kraemer Boulevard.  There are a lot of shopping center lights and traffic lights around there, but as I was looking up and towards the west at either of the first two upcoming traffic lights - I don't remember precisely where I was along this stretch of Imperial Highway - I was startled to see a formation of lights gently angling from the southeast to the northwest, and from there, symmetrically back to the northeast.  There were about seven lights making up the south-lying line, and one or two making up the north-lying line.  There seemed to be one light at the tip, but it may have been my mind filling that spot in with a light.  It was like seeing a marqueed side and tip of a triangle pointing and possibly also moving in the sky in the same direction in which I was moving in my car.  I would estimate that the lights were located above Brea, La Habra, or Whittier.  The color of the lights was uniform - a pinkish gold, similar to street or parking lot lights.  The size of each light was not impressive - about the size of a light from an airplane or jet.  It was the formation of these lights that was startling.  The lights moved completely uniformly, causing me to think that they formed the perimeter of a dark triangular or arrow-shaped object in the sky.  The formation disappeared in a couple seconds, and did not reappear.  I called my brother on my cell phone as I arrived home because he ""believes in UFOs"" and I ""don't"".  I decided to go back to the intersection where I turned left to see if I could reproduce the optical illusion, and he agreed, asking me to be careful driving.  I retraced my path, but the second time I saw no such formation in the sky, nor could I see how any reflections or glare from Kraemer Boulevard to Placentia Avenue, looked anything like the formation I undoubtedly saw earlier.",2004-06-23T00:00:00,33.925738378378384,-117.86529513513514

The witness was on her way to work as she works the graveyard shift. As she traveled around a corner on Harris Road by Harris Auto Wrecking she saw a extremely large bright pink object low in the sky.  The lady said she had never seen anything like it in all the years she lived in the area and also wondered if it might have been an airplane coming in for a landing at the Smithers airport. She told me the object had to have been the size of a full moon and on the outer edge of the object the color was a much lighter pink in color.  As the woman drove along she said it passed overhead at approx: tree top level and at approx: 100 to 200 feet away from her in distance. As the lady and the object passed one another she slowed her truck down and turned around to watch the object move slowly into the distance and as she watched it finally just blinked out. When the woman continued on her journey, after seeing the strange object, she told me that she was questioning herself, ""did I just see that""!  Later that evening and at her work place, her and another lady went outside for a coffee break and the witness mentioned that she had seen something very strange when she was on her way to work.  I asked the lady if she thought it might have been a flare or even fireworks someone had maybe set off. The witness said she has never seen a flare or fireworks travel horizontally just over tree top level and for such a long distance. There was no sound noted. The object was reported to be visible for approx: one minute.  This same object has been seen twice on two different occasions in the Smithers area.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

At 9:00 pm a person sitting alone downstairs in the house was looking out the window, she saw, into the forest, two trees go in opposite directions, as if one went far to the right and the other far to the left. She did not tell anyone of this until the morning when we told her of our experience which happened at 3:30.  At an undisclosed time of the evening the neighbor saw what she thought to be flashes out the back, (same direction), she thought we were taking pictures, we were not. She told us of this in the morning when I asked her if she had seen anything darning the night.  At approximately 3:30 am four of us were sitting downstairs in the house. One of the ladies jumped and said ""did you see that?"", one of the others said yes and they described that they had seen , as one going to the far right and one going to the far left, behind the trees that were ""splitting"" there was a very bright flash of light. About 10 minutes later one of the same two ladies jumped from her seat, started to cry and said ""what the heck was that?"", the other lady had seen it too.  They described what looked like a strobe light effect.  The next day we found out about the other two experiences.  I am submitting this sighting because of the fact that it was seen in three different time frames by three different ""groups"" of people, as well as the impact that it had on the two people that I was with was a very frightened reaction.  I am hoping to find out if anyone else saw anything that night.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

The witness was backing into her carport when she spotted the object and started yelling at her daughter who was with her to look towards the mountains. Her daughter looked in the wrong direction and missed seeing it. She said the back of the object looked like it was flared out. As she observed the object move across the sky it would fade in and out. Also she noticed when stated to fade she saw a red puff come off of it.  I asked what she meant by a ""red puff"". She really found it hard to explain and said it was a red something, like a burst of red. Every time the object gave off the puff of red the object itself became more visible, or a bright white in color.  There was no contrail left by the object. It was flying from the north heading to the south in a straight line. I asked if she was able to give me a rough idea as to the size of the craft. The witness said it had to be longer than the length of her arm. The lady said it was traveling at a very low altitude, between the mountains and her residence, but extremely low.  She also said there is a small airport close to where she resides. I wondered if a plane was coming into to land or one might have been taking off. But from the sounds of what the lady saw it doesn't seem to resemble an aircraft I am aware of, but of course hard to say. There was no sound heard, but another interesting point she made was that her pets (dogs) and the neighbors dogs were acting up all night long. (only this one night when the sighting took place) The lady said this is certainly out of the norm for them to carry on like this and she thought this was unusual.  It was interesting to note that on the weekend the local Airforce Base there was a aircraft fair taking place she told me and this was after her sighting.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

No detail visible, just white circles.  They were about the size of Venus at night quite recently except this was broad daylight and they were not shining.  They were moving east, or towards the ""white"" of the sky, all the while maintaining the same distance between them, until we could no longer see them. Two more (or the same, unsure) then showed up.  Similar distance from each other but not moving.  A third one appears, moving really quickly towards the two from the left.  It passes them and slows down, seemingly forming an equilateral triangle. A plane flew by, what seemed to be below these objects (the detail was much greater on the plane). Lost sight of them.

A witness called to file a report on what he and his wife saw back on April 24, 2004 at 8:30 p.m. The witnesses also said they took photos of what was witnessed which was numerous lights flying around the sky in an unusual formation.. The gentleman's wife was the first to spot the strange lights from an upstairs window. The lady called to her husband and when he got to the window she asked, ""what is that""? The husband first thought it was an airplane a fair distance away from them but moving closer towards their direction.  What started the couple thinking, was that whatever it was, moved along the horizon and eventfully passed from their line of sight due to a large pine tree which got in the way. Shortly after they lost sight of it, it came back into their view and again sat stationary. Six to seven minutes later the object still remaining stationary the two witnesses noticed two more smaller lights which appeared on either side of the larger light which they had already been observing. Seeing this was turning out to be really unusual the couple jumped into their car to see if they might be able to get a better look at the objects. They eventually reached a good location as to where they could watch the lights. They had pulled off the highway beside a farmers field and this is when they started taking the photos of the objects. The fellow told me at this point he is a bit of a skeptic when it comes to these matters, but after watching the strange lights in the sky he is re-thinking the whole topic on UFOs.  Still observing the three lights, one of the smaller objects shot off away from the larger object at a incredible rate of speed. While still watching, another light which was sitting stationary, started to flicker out. Then all of a sudden in about 2 seconds it was in another location of the sky hovering. Another light appeared, taking the place of the light that just had flickered out. In total there were 5 to 6 lights sitting in the sky at one time. The fellow said it certainly was a formation of lights, one large one and all the rest were smaller in size. The large light was extremely bright and the other smaller ones were a lot dimmer.  The couple were certainly baffled over what they were seeing.  Thank you to the witnesses for the report.  Sighting under investigation.

April 24 - 09:00 - Observed white light moving in an easterly direction across Indian Arm from Seymour Mountain. Approx:. 2500 ft. I assumed it was most likely a small plane but noticed it was traveling faster than most. As I watched the white light blinked out. A few seconds later there was a single red strobe flash and then the white light reappeared going back the way it came just as fast. There is no way a small plane could have reversed directions that fast. I grabbed my new Video camera and in the few seconds it took to warm up the light blinked out again. There was still a little light in the sky but I could see nothing in the area. I checked with my binoculars but found nothing..  April. 14 - Approx:. 10:00 PM - Observed what appeared to be a fairly large meteorite heading in a northerly direction. As I watched it suddenly shrank in size and within seconds just appeared to be a satellite still heading in the same direction. Very similar to that object I saw back in the summer of 2002.  I forgot to write this down but it occurred around the beginning of April 2004. The weather was overcast with low thick clouds. Approx:. 5 PM. I was playing on my computer when I noticed, Two dull yellow disk shaped objects, flying one behind the other in a SSE directions. Cloud level was approx:. 1000 ft. and these glowing disks appeared to be either in the clouds or just over them. I would estimate they were about over the area of 108 and King George and from that distance appeared to be about the size of the full moon. Estimated speed approx:. 3 to 4 hundred miles an hour. Time of sighting about five to ten seconds.  My new camera has night vision and can see better than I can in the dark. The other night I saw that strange light which appears to flash white, blue and red. I aimed the camera at it and started zooming in and it must be in near orbit as the image filled my view finder even before it got to full digital zoom. (900X) Normal stars still look like stars slightly magnified. Anyway I did not see the blue and red lights which I've seen through my binoculars but did see reddish looking protudences on the sides. Reminded me of Mickey Mouse. The white object appeared to be rotating quite fast but that may just have been an effect caused by the atmosphere. Just for the heck of it I left the camera running while pointed up at the sky, to my surprise I saw what appeared to be very two very faint satellites pass through the rather narrow field of view within about five minutes. I also noticed several dark shadowy objects passing in front of the stars in the view finder. I tried looking at the same area through my binoculars but could only just barely make out the stars.  One other thing I just remembered I got my new camera on the 13th. of April and spent all afternoon playing with it. My wife was getting annoyed and told me to put it away. About five minutes later I saw what appeared to be a small plane flying by about two blocks from here. The lights didn't look right and it was flying not much higher than my apt. I grabbed my binoculars and took a look but was unable to see the fuselage if it had one. Could only see the lights. Two small lights on what I took to be the nose, one red, one white. Where the wings should be I saw a bright blue light and a red one on the other side both larger then the nose lights, behind the wings? I saw two more lights mounted one behind the other one large white one and a large red one. As it passed the Green tower at City Centre Mall I could see a small white light on its tail. It had been heading east but swung to a southerly heading after passing the tower.  Anyway it looks like it might be a good summer for sightings, hopefully I will manage to get something on tape. I got a little excited this afternoon while playing back my tape from yesterday evening on my TV. I saw this thing with two big yellow lights and what looked light a dark saucer shape in the background, after watching it for a few seconds I realized it was an aircraft with its landing lights on.  I have also noticed a number of times now those single strobe flashes which seem to be coming from space. my camera has picked them up numerous times now. I've played them back one frame at a time and they only seem to last for one frame and I can see nothing around them even with the camera set at about 20X zoom.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

When I saw them,appaering at about 45 degres out of the dark, they went in a N/east S/west direction, as if crossing the upper-atmoshere. I called muy friend thinking for a second it would be a shooting star visible for a second or two. But I quickly realised it was't as brigth and there was 5 of them one ahead of a four formation, the were ligth grey in color(i'm colorblind)sort of triangle shaped. they did't go brigther or darker, they seemed to be very high and very fast, and were moving independantly but never breaking the general formation.We were absolutly silent both thinking we could't be seeing this, but we did't speak for the whole time.They went straigth over our heads we had to twist our necks to follow them. There were no flashing ligths, no apparent source of ligth at the back of the craft(reactor).It was eerie but the adrenaline was rushing throught me. They disapaered at the same angle in a thin cloud going just slightly more south.  We both knew what we saw when we went back in the flat. But we knew no-one would believe us( I think they didn't, even two friends from 10 years). I had just arrived from work and had one drink only. I've only found the web site today, but I'haven't heard any similar report coming from London. Has anyone seen these??  These were not regular planes, or meteorites or spy planes. But it was scary at the beginning when your senses can't recognise what you see.And you analyse things to rationnaly categorise the phenomenon. You can't so you accept what you see.But we did't call at our friends two rooms away, I think because it felt like a privileged moment, meant to happen. I could't care less if no-one believed me, now I know...  It was amazing, awe inspiring. ((name deleted)) (french) London",2004-05-04T00:00:00,,

Hello Brian,  About 30 years ago on my parents farm about 4 miles out of North Gower on Century Road. It was late fall or early winter. I was coming back from putting straw down for our horses in the barn, I often looked up at the night sky to see the stars and the moon. This time it was around 9:30 p.m. I looked up at the sky towards the southwest and there was a kind of longish oval shaped object. It had bright flashing lights around the outside of it, there were white, red and green colored lights. It seemed to hover in one spot for about 5 minutes.While I was staring at this weird object it dawned on me this must be a UFO and I wondered if they knew I saw them or they saw me. A short while later it started to move and then just a flash of light and it was gone from sight. I wanted to tell someone really bad but waited about 5 years after and told my brother. I never told my parents as I knew they would never believe me. I met a farmer once from Montana who told me he saw a UFO also and he is the only person I know who ever told me he had seen one. Hope my recollection of events is ok, I pretty much remember it clearly as it is not something easily forgotten.  Additional Information Below.  Good Afternoon Brian,  1. - The location it took place was outside North Gower. North Gower is about 20 miles south of Ottawa. 2. - The sighting lasted about 5 minutes.The lights on the object were horizontally around the object and flashed in kind of a sequence. 3. - The object did not change shape.There was no sound heard during the whole time. 4. - I am guessing 10,000 feet, hard to judge as it was dark at the time. 5. - I think I recall a whitish flash when it took off. 6. - That night it was very clear skies with stars out and quite cold. 7. - There were no other aircraft that I could see in the sky that night.  I hope this helps. Take care Brian  Thank you to the witness for the report.

I apologize for the lack of info regarding the exact date, but I was 10 years of age at the time and not aware of your work or where (other than the local police), I could possibly report such an incident. It was about 10pm, and I was on the third floor of a two-family house, owned by my grandparents since the mid to late 1960's. The part of the house I was in was inhabited by my aunt L (my mother's sister) and her son, my cousin, F. He was three years of age, almost four, and I was babysitting. My mother lived directly below, which pertinent to this story, and I will relate to it later. We were both in the bedroom which has one window facing Northeast (in approximation to the way I was sitting). We were on the bed, watching television, and the window was open. From the corner of my eye, I noticed a light that suddenly flashed on, or appeared out of nowhere and seemed to be moving. I turned toward the window and that is when I noticed an oval object sitting directly above the moon. The moon was full and exceptionally bright (perhaps the fact that the moon was full will make it easier to deduce what day it was..., and this object sat above it and did not move. It just sat there.However, everytime I looked away this object would move and go from one end of the window to the next and then stop once again, to rest above the moon. If I hold my hand out in front of me, at arms length, I can assess that the moon was the size of my fist and the object was the size of the pad of my thumb! It was HUGE and it was LUMINOUS. I told my cousin to take a look, to confirm that I was indeed seeing this object and he reacted with genuine fear to which I too became increasingly frightened. I grew up on sci-fi, was an outcast amongst my peers and was even nicknamed E.T., so I was fully aware of the UFO and EXTRATERRESTRIAL phenomena, seeing as at that time I believed I was an abductee, and I think this is the reason why I was so frightened. THe object stayed there for over an hour to which I called my mother and told her. I was frightened and asked her to locate my aunt and to tell her to return home because I did not want to be there anymore. Now, when I asked my mother to check for the object, she did originally deduce that I was just looking at a satellite, however she did agree that there was indeed something there and that it was far too big to be sitting above the moon that way. When my Aunt did return, some two and a half hours after the object first appeared, I had already had the shades down so as not to agitate my young cousin any more. However, when I opened the shades to show her...it was gone! I have since seen satellites in the sky, and I am an amateur astronomer, and I can honestly deduce from my current knowledge of the night sky, that what I saw that day was intelligent, perhaps even mocking me, but it was not a satellite nor was it Venus...it was something else entirely.

I went to sleep on the living room couch one night because the living room has a large window looking out to the west. Anyway, I woke up in the middle of night (midnight was the time on the VCR) on my back, and surprisingly I was not groggy, almost as if I had been up the entire night. But I had decided to then count the stars until I go back to sleep because I couldn't sleep. Well, there was this one star that was moving in north to south direction (from my point of view it was from left to right). I mistook as a plane and so my focus followed it. I decided to play a mind game with myself thionking it would make me tired and thought I could control the direction of the plane by looking at the direction where i want it to go. I said to myself, ""I'm going to control you with my eyes.) and the exact moment when I finished that sentence, the ""plane"" then flashed a very bright light into the living room where I was. I shut my eyes and pulled the covers over me. When I opened my eyes I was on my back with my arms at my sides and the covers were still over me. At first I couldn't breathe out of fright, I was so afraid to move or even think. When I finally got the courage to pull away my blanket from on top of me, I saw that the clock on the VCR was about 2:30AM. It was still dark, so I immediately got up, ran to my parents' room and asked them if they saw a light flash inside the house, they groggily said no. I climbed in bed with them and went to sleep.

It dropped another blue light, so I flashed my lighter again.

I heard of a sighting of a sphere shape object around Denver where the sphere followed cars. Tho photo taken by witness was smaller than what I had seen,but color was much the same as well as shape.

The lights maintained their position relative to each other, but I couldn't see whether they were part of the same craft.  One light was behind and to the left of the other;  if one imagines a triangle moving point-first with lights on the leading point and on the leftmost point behind, with no light on the right, then one can get an idea of what I saw. The lights had an orange color similar to that of a sodium street lamp.  The sky was slightly hazy, and the haze appeared to be at a very high altitude, since a commercial jet observed a moment later appeared very clearly.  The lights of the unidentified object, on the other hand, looked as if they were above the haze.

Upon crossing under the Harlem Ave. overpass, I noticed a single cherry-red colored light hanging motionless in the sky south/southwest of the expressway at about a 70 degree angle to the horizon. It was about the size and intensity of a very bright star.  At first I thought it to be the port-side red wing light on a plane but the odd thing was there were no other navigation lights visible (no belly or tail strobe, no green starboard wing light, etc.) I also thought that it might be a star or planet at first, but as I drove westward I eventally passed under it at which time it was then behind me (but still motionless in the same position on the sky). I then got off of I-80 and headed southbound on U.S. Route 45 (LaGrange Rd.) and the light was still there in it's original position with my car now headed south and the light being to my left still at about 70 degrees to the now eastern horizon.  Although I couldn't tell how big or high up it really was, I got the impression that it was lower than planes would be heading into Midway Airport (I was at 19500 south and Midway is at 6300 south on the Chicago area's street grid).  Also of note was there was no noise, and if it were a helicopter, I think I would have been close enough to hear the rotors, see other navigation lights and probably even see some of the body of a helicopter.  There was no shape discernible here...just the bright, hovering pinpoint of light.  After briefly heading west on 195th St., I then turned south, but when I looked for the light in the eastern sky, it was gone.  I noticed the light had a vey crisp, clean color to it...no twinkling like a star and it's color was differant than a red radio antanea light or plane wing light...it was almost the shade of those old ""blue dot"" taillights or maybe those bright new LED lights used on new stop lights and railroad crossings.  NOTE - Although I do have an interest in UFO's, this was the first time I've seen or reported anything unidentified first-hand. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar reports for 21AU04 in same location.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS)) Tinley Park Follow-up I was the individual who submitted the original Tinley Park ""red light"" sighting back in April. I can't possibly imagine that the light was caused by advertising lasers as there would be absolutely no way to determine where the advertiser was located on the ground (hence not a very effective means of advertising).....also, there was no light trail leading to a spot on the ground like a traditional advertising spot light would have (either the single oscillating beam kind or the newer 4 -beam type that makes the ""figure-8's"" in the sky).  Also, when I saw the light, it was in the early AM when all retail would be closed.  While brighter than a star, it really wouldn't have been all that noticable unless you looked up into that exact area of the sky and you realized it wasn't the ""normal"" red color of an airplane wing light and that it was stationary (in other words, it didn't appear to be anything designed to attract the attention of peo ple on the ground).  Lastly, the area I saw it over contains warehouses, some residential subdivisions and vacant fields but no retail or late night places such as bars or all-night restraunts.  Here's a thought - The Tweeter Center (the Chicago area's main outdoor music amphitheater) isn't far away from the area in Tinley Park where I saw the light....could they possibly have a laser projection system that was pointed upward instead of towards the stage???  I've been to Tweeter in the past however and I think all of their lighting and projection stuff is under a pavilion roof so it wouldn't have exposure to the sky...also I don't recall any clouds the evening I saw the light that a laser would bounce off of....it just seemed to be hovering mid-air in a clear sky (but no indication of anything solid attached to, or behind the light).  Also, I think 4/24 was too early in the season for Tweeter to be having concerts and even if they were, the event  would have been long over at the time I passed the area.  Anyone else have thoughts on the mystery?? ((END ADDENDUM))",2004-04-27T00:00:00,41.570927272727275,-87.7941956937799

After looking at the comet with binoculars and through his telescope and taking pictures,  we saw 5 saucer shaped, silver objects flying from the direction of the Salt Lake, and flying towards the area of Kennecott's copper refinery.  The objects were small with the unaided eye, but were much more clear through binoculars, and his telescope.  We focused the telescope with the telescope viewfinder. and brought them within view.  Originally the objects moved slowely, to the site mentioned, and then stopped in flight and started hovering.  We could see through the instruments, that there were several distinct separate objects, and they were not the lights from one single craft.  We looked for insignia to se if they were possibly US Air Force vehicles, or army helicopters.  There shapes told us that they were unusual crafts.  We brought it to the attention of GL's father, and he also looked at them also through the instruments.  He stated that we should mount the camera on the telescope and take pictures of them.  The occurance took about 10 to 20 minutes in total.  After the 5 saucers where hovering in a still position, which appeared to not spin, they suddenly started moving and spinning, and headed at an increasing speed, up over the Oquirah Mountains, in the direction of Tooele Ordinance/Deseret Chemical and Dugway Proving Ground, and suddenly disappeared out of sight.  They didn't change color, and there was no trails, and no noticeable sound.    We discussed afterwards the event.  When I went home,  I told my pare! nts also of the event.  Dad said that I should report it, since there had been a number of UFO sightings in the area.  I talked to GL over the phone about the matter.  He said that his father told us to wait until the pictures are developed.  After the pictures were developed, we also had them enlarged.  One could clearly see that there was some advanced technology, w;h;ich we were not familar with.  My friends dad, then said that since he was a newspaper editor, he had an obligation to first call Hill Air Force Base, because he didn't want to reveal any Government secrets to the public.  After calling them, an appointment was made for the Hill AFB Investigating Officers to come and talk to us.  Three officers, including an AF Major came to talk with us.  After sitting down with us, discussing and recording the event. and looking at the pictures, they started mak;ing recommendations and requests.  They said it was in the interest of the sec;urity of our nation, for us to release the prints and negatives to them for analysis.  My friend gave up the prints, and negatives as reequested to them.  They told the edi;tor not to release the materials or report to the press until fu;rther notice.  We waited a few days, and an answer came.  A call from Hill AFB's rep came, and he strongly advised us to forget the happening, otherwise action could take place.  The Editor questioned him, and the rep answered that he was advised by the Army CIC that severe penalties could take place if the word would get out.  I followed the advice, and didn't ever mention the incident until 1966 when I attended a UFO Conference in Denver, and also talked to Dr. E. U. Condon.   GL eventually graduated from MIT,  and I believe that he still has some secretely kept prints.",,40.704464857813726,-111.88213884685625

At first I thought it was a plane but the dot's red color didn't seem to flash, it retained it's colour perfectly as it flew. It was when it started going back and forth as it flew west that i knew it wasn't a plane or helicopter. It was fairly low on the horizon so it was far yet it sped back and forth FAST. The speed and manuverability of it stunned me. Then when I knew this thing wasn't explainable, another two red dots flying in formation quickly joined up with the first and they all sank below my line of sight because trees were in the way. I hopped out of the tub and ran to where I could see, but they were too far. All of this happened in around 6 seconds...these little dots were moving way too fast for any vehicle I know of.

We were on our way back from West Virginia, stopped for dinner, and we had gone about 20 miles, and had to turn around, because I had forgotten something at the resturant. Another couple that went with us, were driving behind us, and we pulled over told them we had to go back, go on ahead to Cleveland, we will see them the next day. On the way back I was in the passenger seat, and happened to look at this bright low star, or so I thought. It caught my eye, because it was so bright, yet so low. Never thought anymore about it. We made it to the resturant, then headed back home. Now my husband, was driving, and he said wow what is that, here he noticed the light, because it was now on his side of the road. I told him I noticed it on the way back to the resturant. We pulled off the road, in a spot where we saw radio towers, just to compare it. It was as high as the towers, brighter then the towers, and the sky was clear, with a full moon. The towers had to be about five miles from us, and we could see the frame of the towers, but no frame on the bright light. The light slowly moved to the other side of the towers, and it grew lighter then darker, in brightness. So we assumed it was a plane. We got back on the road, and continued on, but pulled off the road again,because it had moved now behind us. At that point we called our son in Columbia Station, Ohio. He went outside, and could see it also, and this was 80 + miles away. We told him to get his camera, and get a picture. Then we called my sister-in-law, in Elyria, Ohio, she went outside with my niece, with binoculars, the saw it, and said it had lights like a blooming flower, with rays off of it, and it twisted and turned. My son called us back saying he could not get the camera to keep it in focus for the shot, now at that time we pulled off the road agin to get our pictures with my cell phone. After I took two shots. We all saw it dissappear. No light at all. We were all amazed. Then it reappeared. At that point I took a total of four pi! ctures with my cell phone, all have an accual star in the sky and this light. We called the New Philidelphia police, they said they would investigate it. The cell phone my husband used to call 911, went out of emergency mode, finnaly, and he called my son back, and he was taling about it being a possible ufo, his phone went to a loud static, and and he kept loosing signal, but my cell phone was fine, that just added more to our thoughts. We called Channel 5 news in Cleveland, Ohio, to see if there were any reports. No one belived us. We then called the other couple that was first driving behind us, and they also saw it, but they noticed it only because they saw a bright light shooting off it, thinking it was lightening, they watched it for awhile, because of the lowness of it, and knew it was not a plane, but didnt think much of it till we told them how we watched it for 45 min.

It was several miles away but the outline and wings were still easily visible. As I continued watching, I noticed a white object approaching it from the southeast.  Assuming it was another plane too far away to show any detail, I didn't think much of it.  However, when it approached the jet, it changed course in a wide arc underneath the jet's contrail, then continued to the west. Once or twice during it's flight, a flash of light glinted off it implying it may have been metallic.  At this point I called for 2 women who were in the cubicles closest to the window to see the object.  They came over and watched for a few seconds, and after approximately 1 minute, the object stopped in the middle of the sky and reversed direction back to the east. No arc, or 180° turn or quick bank, just stopped and started travelling back east.  When I saw it stop and change direction I became very excited, though the women with me weren't impressed even though they also saw it stop and reverse course.  I continued to watch the object fly east till it was lost in a developing cloud formation.  It was roughly 2:00 p.m. (I forgot to look at my watch for the exact time of course), the weather was sunny to the northwest but became cloudy to the east due to a developing thunderstorm system coming over the mountains, and the sky behind the object looking north was blue. I was inside so I could hear no noise, but I assume it was too far away to hear anything at that distance if I was outside.

I put forward the notion that perhaps it was a meteor but dismissed it myself as it left no trail nor did it appear to be moving as fast as one would expect a meteor to. It stayed on a steady course heading west at a somewhat leisurely pace comparable to an aircraft at 30,000 feet. It seemed to flare when it was about 60 degrees above the western horizon, growing brighter for a second. I lost sight of it shortly after as it got further away and trees obstructed my view.",2004-06-18T00:00:00,45.3813825,-75.70850071428572

I wonder if anyone else has seen a similar thing.  We live in a house at 1,400 ft elevation that sees clear across the Valley, and often watch the city lights and night sky. As usual, before going to bed, I took one last glance out the window southwest toward Phoenix. There I noticed two bright, orange-hued lights that appeared to be above or past (to the south) South Mountain. I assumed they were on a landing pattern (one behind the other) to Sky Harbor Airport and the orange tinge was due to haze in the air and the angle I was seeing them from. There is always alot of air traffic and though this approach was unusual (for me) to see, an approaching aircraft made sense. They were very bright, though. Then all of a sudden there appeared four, then six. All bunched together (extending my arm they covered the width of about one, maybe two fingers) but not in any perfect geometric formation (at least from my angle.) I thought this had to because the glass in the window was making them appear double or triple. I got my wife on her feet and out we went to see them outisde. There they were, at least six of them (maybe 7 or 8). Very bright, quite orange. They almost seemed to be dancing (this could have been because of refraction due to the heat). Their height was about the same as the radio towers on South Mountain but they were more to the east of them. I got the sense they were over the valley to the south. Then, just as suddenly as they appeared, they one by one disappeared, all in about 10 seconds. It was as if they went below or past the horizon of the mountain, but it's odd to have so crisp a departure from such a distance (South mountain is about 20 miles away.) Maybe this was due to their brightness. I have seen other objects and lights I've wondered about from time to time over/beyond South Mountain but this multiplication, and abrupt departure was unlike anything. Maybe military formation? If they were commercial aircraft why did they appear so suddenly as a group and leave as quickly? Also, usually when I see commercial aircraft that appear orange it! is only from a great distance (or dust storm, smoke from fires, etc.) and they are dull and not nearly so bright. The visbility (from haze, we don't see clouds in June:) was about average or better last night.",2004-06-18T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

Hovering over wooded area Some brief but much needed history behind this sighting is needed before writing this report to you.  My wife is as un-likely a person, in my mind, to discuss UFO sightings as I've ever met.  We were sitting on our back deck just talking about our work days the night before when we stumbled upon a dual sighting, hers much better than mine but ironic to say the least.  I am a veteran ((law enforcement officer in Lake County, Ohio)) (20 miles east of Cleveland on Lake Erie)and in good standing within.  I'll tell you the story in a chronlogical order as it occurred to me and how it unfoled to me as well.  To begin, this is not the first sighting I've had but the first in which my wife and I saw something together. We were apart when it occurred and we did not have the opportunity to talk about it when it happened. This is, however, my first report I've ever filed with any agency.  I signed up to work a side job for the ((deleted--local community)) and was waiting for the rest of the bingo crowd to arrive. I was in the parking lot waiting to direct the patrons into their spots when there was a lull in the traffic coming in.  As you probably know, there has been some pretty violent weather in the area and I was checking a storm that had blown over (approx. 1745 hrs).  I first saw a very normal jetliner cruising through the sky at normal height and speed when I saw an object not familiar to me.  I've seen satellites, helicopters, small planes, big planes and weather balloons due to the fact we live 25 miles from Hopkins Airport and have three smaller air fields in our patrol zone as well as a nuclear plant 10 miles away (busy with with activity).  I followed the plane for about 15 seconds and lost sight of it after it flew over a cloud deck.   I continued to check out the sky to see if threatening weather may be on the way.  I then saw this object in the sky that was much higher than the plane I'd just seen. The speed was unreal compared to the speed of the plane lower in the sky.  I picked it up much further to the east that I'd seen the plane just seconds prior.  At first, I thought it was a satellite because of the small overall look it had and incredible speed it appeared to be cruising at. I then realized that it should have been difficult to see a satellite with it being daylight.  After just a second or two, it appeared to get bigger but I realized it was getting closer.  I saw what appeared to be a triangle object that was still far away...probably at 10,000 feet, but it was oddly shaped and had no wings or tail.  It looked to be about the size of my thumbnail in the sky. I dismissed it, as I have in the past, and just wondered as to its origin.  My day ended with nothing else worth noting.  That brings me to my wife and I talking on the deck.  She and I were just talking about everyday things and our work days the day before, I never talk to her about UFO's and the like and had pretty much forgotten about my ""sighting.""  My wife then said something about her needing to call me at 1645hrs the day I worked the bingo detail but she didn't because I was probably enroute to the location or already in the armory (location of the bingo game) where my cell phone gets no reception.  My wife then told me what happened and said she was driving east on I-90 eastbound between SR 91 and SR 306 and said, "" I saw a triangle thing in the sky, I was so scared cause it looked like it was watching something.""  I asked her what she meant and had still forgotten about what I'd seen and expected a normal explanation from her.  My wife proceeded to tell me that the 'thing' was hovering and not moving.  She said that the 'thing' made no sound and didn't even bounce in the sky.  I asked her if it could of been one of those self-made gliders moving real slow like they do and she became adamant that this thing was ""HUGE, no way.""  I realized at this point that she didn't have a clue what she was describing in respect to the relevance to UFO reporting. She's never heard of the triangle phenomena or even the UFO research being conducted. It was like asking an innocent kid about seeing a crime or describing their first home run....it was completely honest and very compelling.  I then recalled what I had seen but didn't tell her because she gets really freaked out about these types of things, you'd see if you ever spoke to her.  I then asked her if she could tell how close it was to the ground. I figured she'd give me an airplane type altitude.  She looked at one of the trees in our neighborhood and said ""about 100 feet above that tree.""  I then became very curious but skeptical about her sighting and asked her if she was sure it wasn't a plane or something else she'd seen before.  I know my wife and it was clear that she was freaked out because she had went to work and told her friends she thought something was going on with ""911"" and we were being watched.  I told her that I would have been the first to know being that I'm in law enforcement and being next to an international airport and nuclear plant (at least I'd like to think so).  My wife then told me that she thought it was a plane but she couldn't believe it was a plane because it just stood still in the air.  She said that she had to stop looking at it because, as she kept driving, she was losing her field of vision at it, and thought she might wreck if she kept trying to watch it as she kept driving.  She said she saw it over a very thick wooded area and thought it was looking at something.  We live only 5 miles from that location. She then arrived at work and her sighting ended.  She described the object as being a triangle with no wings and no tail.  She said it was a darker grey shape with no lights or no other markings worth noting.  Anyway, our story and wherabouts can be easily verified as well as her telling her co-employees about it and our wierd way we came about this story.  I would have never written if she hadn't told me about her story. Times dates and actions during the sighting can be verified. Thank you.",2004-06-18T00:00:00,,

We observed several bright lights hovering in the southwest sky. first there were 2 lights that looked  like huge street lights.  they were amber colored and  flickered brillantly in the night sky. then we saw another set of lights multiply from the first two and then two more from the four.there were  six alltogether and a seventh appeared a little further away from the six. they would stay on for 3-4 mins. then they would dissapear like dim away. just seconds later.. further west over near the tonopah area two more lights appeared. these were atleast 20 miles apart from the set of six that we saw in the estrella mountain sky. First one light came on then quickly went off then another light right next to it. if I had to explain it in detail i would say imagine a tractor truck in the sky and it's tail lights are what show as it is leaving  going west, well the tail lights being the distance from one ""Light to another "" is how far apart these lights were to each other. while the other lights are far east more again near the estrella mountain they are a pretty great distance apart in my opinion to be flares or anything military operated. weird as this is we saw them appear and disappear for 3 hours changing location and traveling slowly west toward the palo verde nuclear power plant (while in the off mode of course.) the lights as we saw would vibrate and dance next to eachother and even  seem to colide as if generating energy from one another as to multiply. these lights have been here since we moved in to our new house in May of this year 2004. what are they? nobody seems to know.",2004-06-23T00:00:00,33.37972857142857,-112.56263516483517

The object seemed to fade, then disappear when it reached about the centerpoint of the skyline. Moments later I began to observe at least three smaller objects move in irregular patterns in small regions of the sky surrounding the spot where the first object disappeared. It was difficult to say what shape the objects were, but they definitely appeared solid and light reflective. They were at about a 40-50 degree angle in the sky. The altitude appeared to be about the same as a commercial jet liner would fly in. These were no ordinary craft as they appeared to change both altitde and range in jerky and sometimes shaky motions. They exhibited zig-zag patterns, back and forth motions, rounded or circular fire-fly like flight patterns. They changed directions at will and at an incredible speed. Considering their distance, and comparing with the speed of a commercial jet airliner, I would say unhesitatingly that the were capable of hovering, then traveling at several thousand miles per hour and making a 180 degree flight change. They seemed to hold their patterns in a region of the sky as if committed to that area. There was some kind of a haze around these objects. No sound could be heard at any point, including the original large, lower flying object. I brought my wife and 18 year old daughter outside and they too sat in chairs and agreed that they saw the objects and that there was irregular, freakish, awesome movement. We then began noticing that several more bigger, brighter objects similar to the first object I sighted were traveling across the sky. Two went south to north together. Others went seperately in a southerly direction. These sightings were followed by the prescence of many more of these smaller objects, all with jerky, rocking, up-down, fire-fly, incredibly fast speeds/ changes. It was hard to say how many total craft there were  but it was starting to seem intimidating. My wife, in fact, found it important to rationalize these away as military aircraft defending us from terrorists. We are a professional couple with excellent reputations.

The fellow I talked with had told his father of a sighting he and his wife had tonight. His dad gave his son my phone number and the man called me and told me of an unusual sighting which he and his wife witnessed this evening. The fellows wife was the first to notice it while the couple were sitting outside of their residence having a cigarette. The sky was completely clear.  The object was visible for approx: 20 to 30 seconds before it left the couple line of sight and was certainly a triangular shaped craft. The witness said it was a glowing white in color, no lights were seen on the craft. The man guessed the object was flying at approx: 20,000 feet. Because of how high the craft was and being night time I wanted to make sure how the witnesses came to be able to view the object. This was due to the color of it. They explained that it was extremely bright, but went on to say you couldn't miss it either.  There was no aura or glowing light surrounding it, there was no trail or tail following behind. The witness said he saw no aircraft before or during the sighting, but said right after the object passed by a helicopter was seen flying at a low level shinning it's spotlight down towards the ground.  The craft flew in a straight line towards the northeast over Okanagan Lake. At arms length the witness guessed the object would have been 1 to 2 centimeters in length looking from his location. No sound was heard. The man said the craft was solid in color and not just points of light in a triangular shape.

This was a very peculiar sighting because Coalition fighters were in the area, flying sorties, and seemed to scatter away as the object approached Ramadi. It flew low (10,000-15,000ft), made no sound at all, and sped up and slowed down frequently. At first I decided it was a fighter formation. So I waited for the sound. It never came. My relief, walking up, saw me looking up and asked what I was looking at, he looked up and said ""oh... One of ours?"", I said,""I dunno? It isn't making any noise"". Then I lost sight of it over a building. I briefed my relief of what took place on my shift, what to expect that night, and special orders from our CO. I started walking back to my rack when I noticed the object had stopped shortly after it left our sight. I hovered in the distance. As I watched, I noticed one of the 3 lights on the right move in and out of the formation repeatedly. I stood there scratching my head. I got angry for not being able to figure out what it was and said, ""what the F%$k is that?"" My relief, now on guard, walked over, looked up and said, ""huh, thats so friggin wierd"". As he said that it started moving east fast. Then it slowed almost to a stop, and shot off. I realized that both me and my buddy were staring at a black sky with our mouths open. I shook myself out of whatever trance I was in, looked at my buddy, who was still staring, and tapped his shoulder. He jumped a little and looked back at me.

UFO Description: As seen by myself (36 year old graphic designer) and my girlfriend (42 year old events manager) from our apartment balcony - A dramatically moving bluish-white light. Through binoculars we could just make out an oval shape and a slight glowing purple mixed in with the blue. It was like looking at both a star and an oval-shaped, lit, flourescent black-light tube.  Duration of sighting: 45 minutes.  Direction (best guess): 290 degrees W by NW from our location.  Location in sky: 17 - 20 arc degrees above the horizon.  Weather: Unusually windy - very gusty.  UFO behavior: Zipping, darting, sharp and rounded/sharp sudden changes in flight, lazy zig-zag pattern, abrupt descension and ascension, inverted arcing patterns (opposite of ""Falling Leaf""), sudden speed changes, long and short bursts in a direction. All the while a liquid smooth flight that was a testimony to the mastery over gravity. We eventually stopped watching only due to the fact that the UFO had eventually made it's way far enough North/West that the dust in the air (due to all the winds that evening) made viewing almost impossible at that distance. When we went back inside it could just barely be seen by us but, was still doing it's thing. We went back outside 10 minutes later and it was still there, barely visible. I went back out alone another 15 minutes later and both the UFO and the gusty winds were completely gone.   Special Note: I have FIVE MINUTES of video footage! Yes it's your typical ""grainy footage/blurry light"" evidence BUT, what makes this video stand out is that on three seperate occasions I had a stationary refernce point (power lines, tree tops and a plane that flew by) to be able to campare and signify the UFO's movements!!!  Opinions: Considering the duration of this sighting (and the fact that the only reason we stopped looking was that the UFO had moved off to another location for others to witness), I still can't believe at the time of the filing of this report (two days later) that I still haven't heard anything on the news.  May my UFO footage be a testimony to the fact that there can, indeed, be a UFO ""right in front of our faces"" and no one would even know because most of us are too preoccupied with trivial things and we have forgotten to look up.  I feel fortunate to have witnessed two events, now, in my life (first sighting was late November, 1994 in San Jose, CA.  I feel even more fortunate that this time I caught it on tape! ((NUFORC Note:  We surmised that the witness might have been looking at Venus, but he took strong exception to that suggestion.  We include some of his comments below.  No other sightings reported from this area of the country for the same time and date.   We believe that the description of the location of the anomalous object matches the location of Venus in the night sky, but the witness strongly disputes that fact.  He claims, after the fact, that he could see Venus, as well.  The video would resolve whether there was one, or two bright objects in the northwestern sky.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Pardon my bluntness but, IS THIS A JOKE?      I am an amateur astronomer and I know EXACTLY what Venus looks like and I know EXACTLY where it is every evening. Along with - as far as all the other naked-eye planets that can currently be observed - Saturn, then Jupiter and in the Eastern sky, Mars, all seen as of 9:00 p.m. every evening.      Lets say we are up in the sky looking down at the land and setting Venus in the west is in the 12:00 position, making north in the 3:00 position. The UFO would have been between the 1:00 and 2:00 position. Like my report said, about 290º west by north west. A significant difference in position.      I can imagine you have to be extremely cautious about screening people who think this whole UFO/Contact subject is a joke and I can respect that but, please DO NOT treat me like half of the populace on this planet (opinions may vary) - too uneducated to know the difference between a planet and a street light.      I have video evidence, I mentioned that in my report. All someone has to do is view the footage I shot and the evidence is clear. Three times I caught the UFO on tape flying ""next to"" (as seen on a one demensional screen) stationary objects. These three objects were across the street from my location so it's not like I could just move the camera around to make a stationary object in the sky look like it was moving around. I have the UFO flying behind POWER LINES, around TREE TOPS and sharing the same section of sky while a PLANE FLEW BY.      God, almighty! I take the time to try and share my experience with the organizations that can benefit from this (one problem has always been a lack of proof) and I actually HAVE some proof that can help support and legitimize this highly controversial subject and I get the typical Project Blue Book treatment. ""You saw Venus""      I don't mean to be rude or disrespectful, Peter, but, REALLY. You know darn well the description of the movements of the UFO in my report doesn't even come CLOSE to describing Venus or any other planet. Nor did it look or behave like any type of plane, helicopter, balloon, remote controlled object (which still has to obey the laws of physics as the big objects like a jumbo jet and can't turn on a dime), flare, meteorite, fireball, comet, satellite, the International Space station or any kind of bird, bat, or owl.      This is VERY frustrating and I could understand when I had my first sighting in San Jose back in '94 why very few believed me. Evidence is key. Otherwise you hear, ""Do you live next to an airport? Di dyou have anything to drink tonight?"" That is why I bought my $1500.00 digital camcorder two years ago. I told myself I would never forgive myself if I didn't at least try and be prepared for another sighting (although I never expected to see another one). I just couldn't take the chance.      I have a massively bruised shin from hitting the door jam when cutting the corner too close when running into my bedroom, and a door to my balcony who's bottom hinges now ""knock"" whenever I open or close it due to the fact that I slammed it open too hard when I came in from my balcony to scream at my girlfriend to ""Get out here and look!"" all in the name of trying to get my digi-cam as fast as I could. I truely expected the sighting to be over by the time I got back outside. Please reconsider this. You're passing up a legitimate sighting with video evidence!

They reported that they were watching three unusual objects and giving me the description over the phone as they observed them.  The witness said she was watching the objects through her binoculars and said the one object was huge and the other two a lot smaller. The large object was circular in shape, bright white and filled with what she described as darker dots. In the center of the object there was nothing, or one would be able to see through it. The object was also rotating and had two smaller objects flying around it. One of the crafts was reported to be triangular in shape and the other again more circular. The triangular craft would move a distance away from the larger object, makes sudden turns and at times they were able to observe the full triangular structure and at other times see if being flat. The smaller circular object would travel around the triangle shaped object and also move around the circumference of the larger object.

I was walking around central park, looking for a place to sit where there weren't too many people. I'm sorry I can't be more sure of the exact time, but I was working on a screenplay all day and was a little but pre-occupied with my own thoughts. At any rate, ust off the 80's of the west side of central park there is a large field with three baselball diamonds. I rested for a while looking at the game, when as I stood, I caught a glimpse of what I thought was a child's balloon (the silver kind) floating away, above the trees. It was clearly evident. However, it seemed to change shape, and flatten slightly, then round back out again. And it was pulled in a consistently western direction. This didn't seem to me like the normal behavior of a floating balloon. As I recall, they usually wobble from side to side as the tie at the bottom swings the weight around. There was nothing like this that I witnessed. It seemed to be moving deliberately. to see it clearly for more than about a minute and a half necessitsated walking over the baseballe diamond, which I neglected to do, as there was a game playing. Or, more accurately, a man was hitting balls for practice and others were catching it. So I only saw it briefly. The object was silver, I could not judge the distance accurately, and so cannot judge the size accurately. It seemed like a blimp, at times, which it may have been. but it appeared to flatten and behave more like a balloon. I could not identify it, hence I'm entering this report. It changed shape as it moved, or at least it seemed to. There was a lot of light in the sky, it was overcast but not directly sunny, with a white, bright sky. It read as silver to my eyes, not emmenating light. It must have been either a blimp, far away, but moving very quickly to cover the distance it did in the sky, or a balloon, moving very slowly, but deliberately. Or something else, I suppose. If anyone else saw this, I would like them to tell me what they observed, just for my own curiousity. Thanks! - J",2004-05-04T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

As I was young I was put to bed earlier but was listening to the adults talking in the living room. We had no electricity or running water so when I wanted to go to the toilet which was an outhouse in the corner of the shed my father escorted me to the shed and went back inside the cabin door to get away from the mosquitoes where he could still see the shed.  While in the outhouse every minute or so I could hear a whirring from far away getting nearer then going away.  When I ran back inside the cabin and told my father he said it was probably just an owl or other creature. A few minutes later all the adults were outside the back door as someone had gone to the outhouse and saw this disc shaped object which seemed to be slightly lit up and making a whirring sound coming into view from the south, passing almost overhead and disappearing around Mount Baker.  I sneaked out and actually saw one ( one passed every minute or so) before I got caught and was sent back in.  We had an old battery radio (tube) and when listening to the local news the next day we heard several reports of the same sighting from the village.

My brother & I were both teenagers at the time and were throwing each other ""high fly"" balls in the backyard.  So we were both looking up when an oval, silver disk flew across the sky from east to west and stopped almost directly overhead.  It did not make any sound.  It remained stationary for around 30 seconds.  The day was bright and sunny and there was only one little cumulus cloud in the sky.  My brother and I stopped playing catch and remarked to each other about the object.  We couldn't believe it stopped in midair.  It was about the height that small planes normally fly at-(pretty low).  It was the size of a medium sized aircraft.  After about 30 seconds it suddenly shot north at a high rate of speed.-(perpendicular to its former direction). We ran into the house and I called The Cleveland Press newspaper to report it.  The person who answered the phone said that so far no one else had reported seeing that object. The strange thing is that a couple weeks later that same summer I saw another strange object in the sky.  This time however it was a more conventional type aircraft. It was a regular sized jet aircraft that did not have a body. (A flying wing) One of the wings was on fire.  It looked like it was going to crash. I also reported this object to the Cleveland newspaper.  The next day in the paper they reported that an experimental air-force jet had crash landed. Based on the fact that both of these clying objects were seen so close together that summer, I have always considered that the first object was also some kind of experimental craft.  However, the first one did fit the sterotype image of a UFO. Incidentally, my brother & I never talked about the object until a few years ago at a formal dinner.  He asked me if I remembered that UFO-type strange object that we saw together when we were teenagers.  How could I forget?  We just never told anyone. ps - I had to put a date on the sighting but to be honest I really don't remember. I know it was in the middle of a bright summer day when I was a teenager. (13-15 yrs old).  But that's about it.  I could ask my brother if he remembers.  Also I thought we could look up records of experimaental aircraft crash landing.  It was the same summer.  By the way there were no other aircraft in the vincinity at the time. My brother's name is ((name deleted)).  He is a professor at ((name deleted)) University.  I doubt if he wants to talk about the incident.  Like I said we didn't even mention it again for 30 years to each other. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The time and date I logged in for this report may be off.  Dear Mr. Brian Vike  Hello once again I hope you are doing fine and well also.  As I told you in my last e-mail back in the 1970s I think it was 1978 or 1979 I had just turned 18 years old as well as many of my friends that I grew up with in Dorchester, Massachusetts.  When we all got of age we decided to take a cross country road trip to California, so 4 of us went cross country on a Greyhound bus to San Diego California to see just what the west coast was all about. It took us about 5 days to reach California from Boston and before we ever heard anything about UFO's we found out after being in San Diego for only 2 days. We all shared a motel room and on our second night in California we were watching the local news in San Diego. The news reporter said that thousands of calls were coming into the news station as people were reporting sightings over the area of Palo Alto, California.  The strange thing was no T.V. footage was shown and it must have been the government trying to cover it all up. The people reporting the sightings said they saw huge discs hovering over Palo Alto in the middle of the day and it was starting to cause panic for some people. I do remember the news people saying that it was not a good idea for people to travel up to Palo Alto because of too much traffic from all of the on lookers. All of us at the motel just thought it was strange and never gave it any thought after hearing the report on TV. Well we stayed in San Diego for about 3 weeks before we all decided to head back to Massachusetts, so we did. We pooled our money together and bought a 1968 Dodge Charger for the big trip home so we could have more freedom than being stuck on a bus for the next 5 days.  We left California during the late night hours so the car would not overheat during the day as we crossed through the areas of desert. Well all was fine until we crossed into the area of Arizona known as the Black Hills. We had to drive over a mountain range that seemed to take hours to get over, once we were headed down hill to the desert areas and level highway we noticed something very strange indeed. We saw 3 blue beautiful lights ahead of us, they were the color of cobalt blue like the old vicks salve jars.  It seemed that no matter how far we drove the lights were always in the same location in the sky ahead of us. We decided to pull over and get out to see if these lights were aircraft or radio towers as it was hard to tell moving at 70 miles per hour in a car. Once we pulled over we got out for a closer look and noticed that these blue lights did not make a sound at all and they were in the same exact spot as an hour before when we first spotted them in the sky. Another strange fact is that we were the only car on the highway at the time and not even a truck or anything was spotted during this time. So we got back in the car and drove for almost another hour before pulling over once again because the lights were still in the sky in the same location as before. We started getting a little nervous and wondered if this was what the people in Palo Alto have been seeing.  We decided to turn on the car radio to find out if anybody had called in anything about what we were seeing in the Arizona desert but as fate would have it the radio was nothing but static on all stations. We just thought we were so far away from the nearest radio station and that was why we could not get any music or news on the radio. We all looked at each other in shock asking one other if we all saw the same blue lights and if we could still see them, we all said yes to that. After a few minutes my friend who was driving decided to turn off the car head lights and shut off the engine and as soon as he did we then became instant believers of UFO's because when he turned off the lights the 3 cobalt blue lights that looked as if they were at least 500 feet apart from each other began to move towards each other until the 3 lights became one large blue light that headed away from us and then went upwards at the speed of a shooting star.  My many thanks to the witness for the sighting report.

The night was calm and clear...I ran about 150 yards or so and when finished put my hands on my hips and looked upward while gasping for breath...I immediately saw six star-like objects that appeared to be at an altitude that a small cub plane might fly at or even less...I was immediately transfixed and just stared at them for about two minutes...A car came by and I ran over to it to ask them to come and be a witness to this but they thought I was some kind of nut and just kept going...I ran back over just 30 yards or so back to where I was and stared at them some more...I knew in my heart and mind that this was something unique, and I began to feel as though I was having a religious experience-- I remember saying to them, "" Take me, but please bring me back...""  Then all of a sudden, two of them left the irregular grouping and slowly traveled upward a little ways above the other four, and then they just stopped and stayed...I watched them even more intently then for just about 30 seconds or so, and then ( I will never forget this ) all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, these six star-like objects went from being totally stationary to taking off and getting in a single file formation while at a speed that was just totally unearthly...The only thing I can even compare it to is like watching fireflys fly...There was no noise, no sound, no flashing lights, no sonic boom, just simply an unreal experience...I estimate that they traveled 25 miles in less than 5 or 7 seconds...I have no way of knowing that, it is just a guess...I saw them travel in a southerly direction following Highway 301 South in the direction of a town that I knew to be 22 miles from where I was...It appeared t! hat they had traveled that far in that short amount of time as I watched them travel for as far as I could see with my naked eye on a clear night....They were like miniature stars, very bright white, but with no color or lights...They were silent and could move slow or EXTREMELY fast-- I know enough about physics to know that if there was a human being inside one of those objects, his body would have exploded like jello due to the G-forces ...But human beings in association with this event have never entered my thoughts-- I knew then as I know now and will always know, that these were not of this world...",2004-03-23T00:00:00,32.3986962962963,-81.81958814814816

I saw a silver disk with lights circling around it.D saw A silver disk that was balled on the bottom .The disk was low about tree top level.D at that moment says she heard a robotic sound like talking but could not understand it.I heard a dull static like humming sound kind of like a TV sounds when it first kicks on .We both got scared and took off running to our trailers front door and began beating the door hard. No one answered,In the house where three people and one was a very light sleeper.No one woke up.So then we ran around to the other side.Our side yard was very close to Rickenbacker property.We then began beating on the light sleepers window.At that moment D says she heard a commotion coming from Rickenbacker men yelling truck motors running,racing.At that moment an apple fell out of our mid-sized apple tree in the yard.D and I turned around and looked up in the tree.This is what I saw in the tree.A very small man hunched, crotched down with his very long arms hanging out in front of him,his body was half in the light His color was bluish grey his legs where silky smooth like a womens and his hands where funny looking not sure why.I got the impression he meant us no harm and I got the impression we where interrupting  something.D saw this from her view point she saw a very small man in a gargoyle like stance with his long arms hanging out off his knees.D says his color was dark she did not see him in the light.D says his head was elongated in the back.That is all she can recall of him.We both saw him not move at all he was very motionless. Now we where freaking out we ran to the front again and this time D went to the corner of the deck and started crying.I beat on the door and started yelling for dad.This time  I could see him through the glass  He was asleep in his recliner and did not move.Then I remember nothing .D and I only remember waking up the next day in our beds.My mother recalls us talking about it but insisted we must have dreamt it all. If that is so then how come no one that night ever recalls letting us in the trailer.Also I have had a birth mark on my thigh all my life it was barely noticeable until that night.Even my mother says the next day is was much more plain to see.Also i have a weird creepy fear of black shark eyes or a bulls eyes.D has no such mark.D has no such fear.We are not insane we are very close twins and what happened was real. I just hope someone else can gain from what we are sharing here.We have no desire to recall anymore than we have.This has taking some courage to do and fear of being made fun of and laughed at has kept us quite till now.

I didn't think much of it at the time so we went about getting the rifles cleaned and put away for the night.  For some reason I looked back in that same direction about 5 minutes later and the lights were still there.  I brought this to my girlfriends attention and had her hand me my rifle scope.  I removed the red dot sight, attached the scope to the rifle, and set the bipod on the car roof to get a steady look at this strange set of lights.  When I got the scope on the lights the were not in fact sitting still but moving very slightly from side to side.  I thought that could be from my breathing but then remembered that I had set the bipod.  I told her it must be a helicopter just hovering out there for some reason and put the rifle away.

Good long view, good details. My father and Uncle took me along on an evening fishing trip. I have clear memories of this evening...even to the clothes I was wearing. I remember I sat in the ashes of a previous campfire and my father told me that my mom was going to spank me for ruining my clothes.  We were sitting on the river bank with my father on my right side and my Uncle on my left. My Uncle had a clear space on his left, but my father had a large tree (oak?) on his right. It was leaning out over the water as river-bank trees are wont to do. As a result of this every so often, my fathers line would snag in the overhanging tree branches. He would curse and reel the line back in. Although there were trees to the sides of our spot, there were none directly over head.  My father had just cast his line and it must have snagged the tree, because something made him look up. I felt him go very still. He nudged me and said ""K., look up."" I looked up and directly over our heads was a very large flying saucer. It looked as big as a house....bigger. I could see that it was bigger than the relative size of the large tree beside my father...even at the height it was at. Which seemed to be not much higher than the tree top.  The sky was black and there was no moon that I recall or could see, but I could see this object very clearly. Obviously it was round. It had 6 round white lights on the bottom. 5 surrounding one, all the same size, and the 5 rotated counter-clockwise. It was dead silent. It was a silvery pewter color. Not shiny, and as I recall with....seams in the metal. In other words, it was not a perfectly smooth skin. I knew I was seeing something extrodinary, but I wasn't the least bit frightened. We watched it as it crossed the river. As it got about half way across, I saw that it was a shallow dome, like a lens. But instead of a smooth top, it had a little bump on top. A true dome that sat in the center of the ship. One the right upper side of the dome was a white light. The color of an incandescent light bulb. (in contrast to the lights on the bottom which looked more ""bluish"" and did not ""shine"" like a light.  It crossed the river slowly and moved on a little further. Then it hovered for just a moment. Then it just dropped slowly into the woods. I looked at my father. He was still looking across the river. I guess they figured that they were far enough away, because as I recall, my father and uncle kept right on fishing.  As I was young and it was late, I don't recall going home. I was most likely asleep. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,,

Occurred during the time of my wife's birthday, when I was consulting for a Contractor at Oak Ridge.   While at the Y12 facility, after dusk, one of the employees after coming from his car saw a craft approaching the facility from another facility on that Government Campus.  He rushed in and told us to grab any cameras, and come out and see something spectacular.  Five were able to obtain cameras,  and approximately 40 to 50 employees, including guards saw the saucer.  It hovered almost over the Y12 facility for over 20 minutes.  It changed colors from time to time, and emitted light beams.  We five took many pictures from the basically same vantage point.  The Craft was much larger than a B2 Bomber!  It was estimated to be at least 400 meters from us for a time.  MUFON members were told about the incident, but they wanted pictures from daytime shots of a classified facility - which obviously are not allowed by the Government!  Since the film had to be turned over to the Contractor, and the Government,  the original negatives and slides are their property.  Afterward, some of the prints of pictures, and some slides, that were taken in the dark, which didn't reveal any clasified secrets were returned to the respective photographers.  When the FBI was questioned about the nature of the object,  they said they couldn't answer about the nature of the craft - ""since it was highly classified!"".    Copies of some of these pictures were given to a book vendor at the 1992 or 1993 Eureka Springs UFO Conference, in exchange for some Bible UFO related books.  Also at the time, myself and an FBI Agent gave some of the pictures of ""Ball Lightning"" that I had taken over my farm north of Willow Springs, Missouri.  We asked the vendor, what he thought of the various pictures, and what he thought they were, and what he thought was their origin?  Pictures have been recently furnished to people at Laughlin UFO Conferences,  to ((e-address deleted)), The Museum of the Unexplained, and others inspite of some of the! m being published (1998)in ""Pleiadians from Alcyone"".  (The pictures on pages 1 and 2 are  of the craft over Oak Ridge - which is not near Nashville, Tenn. but are of ""Ball Lightning"" north over our farm !).  ( The Pictures on pages 3 through 11, are some 35 mm slide pictures that I took, along with pictures that a Contractor Employee took with his poloroid camera, and two pictures were taken by another employee with a press type camera!)  By-the-way,  those pictures belong to the Gov't/Contractor/ and the employees were given permission to share them as they saw fit!  When one reads the referenced book, pages 12 through 27, they are interesting, informative, and make an interesting tale.  Is there a coincidence here with another similar sighting?   The bit about the photographer is very interesting.  I know nothing specific about Teygeta or Zeta-Reticuli-I, Alpha Centuri, Pleiadian Alcyone crafts!  So I did not create that story.   So what is the truth, it has to be scientifically investigated, and tbd.  I can only stay with facts as I understand them.  At the near end of the hovering of this spectacular, well defined, colorful craft;  the craft lowered a portion with different lights, like from some type of antigravitics/ superconductive propulsion unit (that is attributed to be the opinion of some so called observers?),  and then the craft slowly rose, headed off in a northerly direction, sped up and suddenly (without sound), and ""like a bat out of hell"" lifted up vertically, rose speedily out of sight and disappeared.  Was this experience a projection or a Hologram, I believe not so because of the definition in the shots taken by the various cameras!    greetings- fj/bf",2004-04-30T00:00:00,35.9743,-84.28936000000002

It was traveling very slowely.  When it passed Kings Mountain, and was in the neighborhood of the Kings Mountain Ranch, it suddenly headed in a east northerly direction towards Sims Lake and disappeared (like a bat out of hell over the horizon).  We called up a TV Station in Springfield, and they said that it had been reported that a Russian Space craft had come down, and that was what the people were seeing, because of the many telephone calls.

It had lights all around outlining it, which from time to time changed color from blue white to red.  It moved slowely at first around 20 mph.  It was just above the trees,  and its size was estimated to be 3 to 5 times the size of the B2 Bomber!  At one time while I was driving, our son saw a huge blurry red light in the middle of the underside of the craft.  Sometimes the craft seemed to have a halo, or force field around it. When it almost reached Kings Mountain Ranch, it suddingly crossed the road, flew over the ranch, and disappeared into the direction of Sims Lake/Whiteman AFB! Like said, it flew like a ""bat out of hell"" suddingly over the horizon and dissappeared!""  The object was also seen by another witness!  While some attended the Tri-Lakes-UFO Convention last November 2003 in Kimberling City, one of the vendors at the conference who sold UFO related books,  also admitted that he had seen the same object at about the same time,  when he was living in the area between Sims Lake in line with Whiteman AFB.     -   Therefore there were at least 6 witnesses to the craft who were qualified observers, and can state that it was not a Russian Satellite or similar object,  that the TV Stations were aluding to.

The sound was like that of a pick against the rocks about every 20-30 sec. We went to investigate thinking it might be other cavers, or unlicenced miners. We had to climb down a shaft that was about 30' in diameter and on a 60% slope for about 200m. As we came closer the noise had stopped. We went on closer to where we thought it was coming from and at that moment we saw a craft or object fly by us at a high rate of speed. (25-30 KM/hr). It had to be hovering because the ground was to rough and steep for anything to be moving along the ground. No light or sound came from it and we also noticed when it passed us that it didn't even create any wind. Our lights are bright for caving and it didn't reflect the light as any kind of object I have seen before.

The Sun had gone down and the Moon was on the rise it was very bright that night. I had brought some glow sticks with me and I had tied them to the end of a 6'string, a red one and one blue, one at each end. I started to swing the string with light on it in circles around me, going from big circle to small ones, I did that for about 10 min. or so and my friend did the same for about the same amount of time. We put the light sticks in my truck and we split up to do our own thing. I walked up to the top of a small hill thats was on the edge of the water, and when facing the water you would be facing South and if you turned 180 degrees you would be facing the volcano Mauna Loa and North.

After afew min I ran over to one fo my friends who was just 50 yards down the hill from me and told him that I thought the Police were on there way over to see what we were up to. My friend said that maybe they think we were UFOs and that someone had probably seen us swinging thoughs lights around and called in. So I walked back up the hill to get a better look but the lights were gone. I looked back to the ocean for a few more min and when I turned back around I saw my other friend had gotten out the lights again and was swinging them around and instead of just two police lights there were now 10 police lights come from the mountain, as I watched in amazement more and and more light started apearing.  I ran back to my friend and told him he had to come see the lights.  We saw now 50 lights, forming a large circle about 200 yards away.  The three of us watched and I tried to videotape it but only got a few minutes.  It was nighttime and I couldn't tell if it ! was working,but I did get something.  I decided to walk towards the lights, swinging my light sticks around my head.  I got to within 50 yards and could see the lights moving in the trees.  It was very disconcerting.  I turned around and ran back to my friends and told them it was too scary, they had to come too.  We walked towards the lights, to within 20 yards and they appeared to take the shape of trucks backing out and pulling around.  One of my friends said, ""They're just trucks.""  My other friend said, ""yes, they kind of look like trucks.""  At that moment I turned around and heard a sound behind me, and when I turned back around my friends were gone, the lights were gone, and I was 1 1/2 miles from where I had been standing.  I looked at my watch and about 20 minutes had passed.  I was disoriented and could not remember where my truck was, so I just headed towards the water to find it.  When I got back my friends weren't there, so I went to the hill to see if I could see them, and waited for another 20 minutes or so before they appeared, coming from the opposite direction from where we had been.  When I ran down to them and asked them if they were trucks, they both said, ""They weren't trucks.""  They had run into the middle of the lights and said the last thing they remembered was the lights swirling around them, and then they were 1 1/2 miles from where we were in the opposite direction from where I had gone.

watched lights for 20 minutes in the desert.,Maricopa,AZ,2004-03-23T21:00:00,light,20 min,"Occurred : 3/23/2004 21:00  (Entered as : 03/23/2004 21:00) Reported: 4/27/2004 7:36:39 PM 19:36 Posted: 4/30/2004 Location: Maricopa, AZ Shape: Light Duration:20 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36576.html,"watched lights for 20 minutes in the desert. Myself and two other friends were Varmit calling the night of march 23 in the Hasiampa river bottom west of Surprise,Az. we had taken Sun Valley parkway around the whwhite tank mountains (west) then into the dry river bottom. we like to call at night from the back of a pick up to locate any locations of preadtors then come back the next day and hunt there. We had headed south and had made 3 stops to call some 15 minutes each time. I have been around and in this wash all of my life, I ride my quads with my family in it 20 or so times a year. I know every bend and every part of that area. On the 4 stop while still moving south slowly I saw thur the tree's 2 light that appeared in the sky just ahead of us. They weren't there a few minutes ago but they were there now! Eric stopped the truck and we all got out and watched the lights. that were perfectly still bright yellow orangish color and very big. I know this area there is nothing out here except a few high line wires but these light were much too high to be the lines and I know they dont have lights on them anyway. I climbed up onto the truck and looked at the with a rifle scope and couldn't see anything except lights. I am a Vietnam veteran and I know chopper lights and chopper sounds.these were NOT choppers. I have shot flares off hundreds of flares in Vietnam. Flares swing down and leave a smoke trail.These lights were NOT flares. As I stood on the truck I could see the ground was lit up under them I couldn't see any lights from them but the ground was Illumated anyway. I estimate we were at least 1/2 mile from thse lights maybe more its had to tell at night. the boys got real scared and wanted to leave so we started the truck and headed back the way we came. as we were traveling north up the wash Eric the driver saw these two light go out! we stopped and looked again then they came back on. As we watch them again I now saw another light to the west of them across the wash several miles away. Then the lights went off again. We headed ! north again stopping at a fence gate as I got out the lights had came back on for the third time and were in the same place. We left the wash and headed east toward sun valley parkway watching these lights all the way. As we approached the highway we stopped and looked thur the scope again to see if we could tell what this was.We could see very clearly the light of the Palo Verde power plant to the west of the lights. I tried to pin point where their location was and the best estimate I have is east of the power plant and west of White tank mountains. I dont have any other explanation other than this was a UFO..I have elmiated all possible causes in my mind.Planes,choppers and flares. as we drove north we saw these lights untill the road went around the mountain and we couldn't see them any longer. I wish I could have talked these scared boys into going south on the highway to get closer but they were just to shook up to go.  this must of been a UFO!! I have who friend asked me to put this on here. It is very interesting there was another report about these lights on the same date and almost the same time.

It didn't look mechanical, more like some kind of animal. It did not have extended wings like a bird of any kind, but seemed to have some sort of stubby wings which were part of the body, like a flying squirl or some type of bat. They protruded out near the head, & tapered back to a point at the rear. The creature appeared to be around 3 ft. from head to tail, & a little over 2 ft. wide at the shoulders. It was moving very fast in a straight line at an altitude of approx. 150 ft. I saw no method of propulsion such as wing movement. It just seemed to be gliding, but at a high rate of speed. It maintained level flight moving west where I eventually lost sight of it. Other details were a light brown color along the sides of the wings, like skin, with a dark body color, possibly dark brown or black.",2004-04-09T00:00:00,35.950759999999995,-83.18667333333333

I am giving you this information so those of you who live or know New Jersey know exactly where I viewed this event from.  I was eyeballing the sky, off towards my left, in the direction of South Plainfield, and this object may have been further off than that in fact. Now, I am 32 years old, have been a skywatcher (day and night skies) for all of my life and have been driving an automobile for over 14 years as well. I have 20/20 vision and can identify and spot the difference between a small plane, a jet liner, a helicopter and a satelite. In fact, I have performed formal research in the field in UFOlogy as well.  What I first thought was a jet plane, taking a North by North East flight path and which I was waiting for to hook towards the vicinity of Newark International Airport never did. I first thought this was a plane and although it was slowly becoming a clear blue sky at 11:45AM, with some very high level clouds, scattered and disapating as the day wore on. I also gussed that this plane still had its headlights on and what I was seeing was one of two things, lens flare or reflection of the sun off the planes exterior. Neither was to be the case.  This object was more of a sphere type ball of light and was more orange in color than it was yellow or light. This is what caught my attention most. Second, instead of the object banking left (it's left, my right as I assumed it was heading in my direction), it proceed to accelerate upwards into some high level clouds and then out of site rather quickly  I am submitting this hopes that others in the area who may have also seen this thing can have some validation that others saw it as well.
