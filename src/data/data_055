My Microsoft Word is expired so I pray this is read by someone in charge.  Watched 3 real UFO craft enter above Orion's Belt in a streak of white but it stopped its streak. One shot straight for the small stadium and no steak was emitted, stopped just short of the main lights to the stadium and hovered around the stadium, wisping from side to side just outside the small stadium as if unhindered from Earth's gravity.  The second seemed to dart in and away from the stadium.  The 3rd was flying up at incredible speed and just stopped in mid-air.  It turned in several degrees of turn I am not able to fathom.  No manned or unmanned craft is capable of such of what I saw.  An incredible sight I kid you not.  The 3rd one showed its belly as it darted up and down in the air with no plausible way to decern how it was able to stop in mid air and go a different direction.  I saw 7 (seven)bright blue and white rotating engines underneath as it flew vertically yet diagonally down for several hundred feet and then it stopped.  This duration happened within about 1:30 to 2:00 minutes time.  Captured a bit on my camera but not enough to give an accurate description.  Sorry. I waved and hollered at the objects to get closer to me but I was not within audible range. The belly of the craft as would be the belly of all three craft had 7 bright blue and white lights.  The shape appearred to be hexigonal or octagonal.  I could see their shapes as their engines made streaks of light in their turns.  Phenominal.  I'd say their weight could not be determined.  The size, if they came face to face would have to be about 13 maybe 14 feet in diameter.  No sound was emitted when they entered, hovered or left.  They left because of a police helicopter was patrolling near the exact area which the 3 craft were hovering as the police helicopter was approaching slowly as it neared the one near the stadium... all three disappeared into the night sky.  As if all were informed of the threat, the police helicoper, and shot out back into space.  After they left, the police helicopter made a b-line to wherever they saw as well.  The one I was watching, didn't change shape, none of them changed shape, they clearly had a top and bottom to them. The top had a curvature to the front of the craft and all three were extremely versitile.  Hope this is enough for further investigation.  Remember. Police Helicopter saw them too.  Very real, not a hoax or a stupid joke.  Odd thou, when they stopped from time to time in flight, I heard no sound, no sound at all.  No shockwave of any sort was audible.  10 years ago, saw a different craft hovering in the same position before the small stadium was built. Tomorrow I will investigate precisely where I saw one of them hover.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,33.60235384615385,-117.65907692307692

This light stopped suddenly, remained stationary for about 10 seconds and accelerated downwards. In about 20 minutes, this light reappeared and seemed closer, or bigger.  This time it jumped to the left and right a few times which would leave a tail like yellow trail.  It stayed for about 10-15 seconds and again accelerated downwards. In about 20-30 minutes it reappeared again and stood still before accelerating downwards. In about one hour this light reappeared for the fourth and last time, this time a lot closer.

Continuing to examine the object I noticed that it appeared to pulse slightly into a haze, as if the object were having some sort of lensing effect applied to it, so I rolled down the vehicle window and looked at the object in the clear, and sure enough the hazing was not an effect of the windshield or any other glass or reflection. While I was observing the object it pulsed and winked out.  I would have thought nothing more of it except that it returned about 4-seconds later.  Upon further observance as we approached berry blvd, the object again pulsed but the effect seemed longer and brighter with angular stabbing lights extending from it briefly.  I looked and noted it was not a plane, had no running lights of any kind and as I was checking to see if it was mounted on a tower, the object disappeared again.  4 seconds or thereabouts later, it re-appeared. It was certainly not the moon, it wasn’t a plane and the object didn’t move, nor was it mounted on a tower.

As we watched the airplane, my sister asked, ""Do you see that thing above the airplane?"" I looked around the plane and then finally I picked out what she was talking about.  It looked like a metallic sphere that was flying at an incredible speed to the north.  It was much higher in the sky than the airplane, and was traveling at a much greater speed.  All we could see was this sphere that reflected light sometimes as it traveled northwards.  We watched the craft for anywhere from 10-15 seconds before it eventually disappeared out of view.  Then my sister claims that she could see a second metallic object identical to the one we both saw, but I never was able to see it. My sister and I both looked at each other and immediately agreed that there was no way that was a plane. There was no way it was a satellite, helicopter or a blimp. This was an object like I have never seen before. I am very interested in a UFO and go sky watching at night many times, but I’ve never claimed to have seen a UFO before. This is the first time I can honestly say that I can not identify the object, so it IS a UFO by very definition. In no way am I jumping to conclusions and saying that it was an alien spacecraft. All I am saying is that it was an incredible event that I won’t soon forget. A quick background of my sister and me would prove to be very normal.

I noticed something revolving behind a tree like a child's top you spin on the floor.  I watched it for a few minutes, as I watched it I noticed it was moving back & forth West to East.  It came out from behind the tree that was obstructing my view, I was amazed to see the shape of this object.  It was a bright silver and it was revolving mostly in the middle of the craft.  It was shaped sorta like an egg, but more or less flattened from the top. It hovered in the same spot for about 8 to 10 minutes. It was moving back & forth for about maybe 3-5 minutes. I grabbed my camcorder & filmed it while the view of it was still in my sight. It seemed to be staying ( hovering ) in one spot.  It was just sitting there hovering a brilliant shine off it.  I think the sun's rays was making it more shiny & gave it more detail.  I went to grab another tape for the camcord, when I went back to film it.  It was gone.

I noticed a craft moving from West to East over the mountain & then move back from East to West at a very calm speed.  It keeped going in the direction towards Alamosa Colorado (Northwest).   In 2007 when Colorado was hit by a massive snow storm for Christmas 2007 & the New Year of 2008.  Several witnesses including myself observed a craft hovering Northwest of Trinidad, over a-little town known as Hoehne 10-miles out of Trinidad.  The craft seemed to be studying our weather that fell on our town.  It hovered in the same spot for about 3-5 minutes.  It moved East to West, then it was gone.  The area I had seen the first sighting is closed off to the public.  No one is allowed up there, only certain vehicles & people are permitted up there.  I was curious to go up & see if I could find anything from the first sighting.  But they didn't allow me up there.  I will be submitting my video on youtube later this summer of 2009.

I was in second grade and the planets were out my next door neighbor James had his telescope out.  We were trying to focus on the rings of Saturn.  It was a cool night, with a dark blue sky and along the horizon a orange line ran across.  I was at the end of James drive way with him, his sister Kerry was also with us.  The road we were on was North Virgina Ave.  It runs east to west.  We were in the middle of the block near Boundry ave.  So our gaze was to the left.  The 135 Seaford Oyster Bay express way is at the end of the block.  We could see the tree line from the express way.  Just above the tree line suddenly the object came going North to South.  It was moving very slowly, it did not stop and it did not pick up speed. From our view we see the houses on the north side of the ship, as well as the houses on the south side.  Trees as well on both sides.  Coming from out of nowhere out of these trees I am the first to see it.  I scream something a long the lines of ""Ah!"" or ""Oh!"" Kerry then said, ""What?"" She then looking up saw it and screamed very similar to me.  Next James said ""What?"" He sounded more annoyed at us both, then he saw it screamed as well.  Next James and Kerry ran into the house to get their mother.  I watched the object and when it finally crossed the street and was behind the trees and homes I ran inside next.  I was scared to move and I couldn't move till I could no longer see it.  I then ran inside and got my own mother, and both me and my mom came out to Kerry and James outside with their mom talking about what we just saw.  I was in second grade, I was seven about to turn eight I believe.  My birthday being in June.  I only remember that I was in second grade.  I do not have the note book I wrote my experience in anymore or the picture I drew.  My mom told me that she had called Grummen and that they said it was a new plane to pick up the people in the Gulf who were at war.  This I found out many years later was false she did not call at all, she told me this so I would sleep at night.  Kerry was a year younger then me, and James was a year older.  I have not seen them since I moved in the fifth grade.  So I am not sure if they still live there.  The Object was just a light, and it was massive.  It wasn't one small light but huge.  It was a few inches in comparison to everything in the back drop.  So it was more then likely a hundred feet in length at the most I'd say.  I am not a good judge of distance.  But if I were to close one eye and use my thumb I would say it would reach my knuckle from the tip.  It was along the tree line of the horizon.  It was hexagon in shape.  With in the hexagon were shapes, triangles and circles.  The triangles were coming from the top part pointing down, while the ones on the bottom pointed up.  They met in the middle and in the middle is where the circles were.  The whole shape was a bright light.  That was the most confusing part of the object noticing the shapes with in the light, each shape seemed to be it's own piece as well as it's own light.  As if each piece was luminescent on its own. Though I am much older now and I've always wanted to report it, this memory is one of my most vivid.  I remember it so well because it is why I am a believer. Why no matter how much the subject scares me I watch programs, look up articles because I wish to know more.

Just outside Scottsdale, AZ we seen a light, VERY BRIGHT, behind a desert mountain, and it lit up the background of the mountain so bright it lit up the entire area.  We both said, Holly ****, and tried to say that is MUST be just a helicopter taking off behind the mountain, and there MUST be an airport there, so we hit the odometer on the truck and continued to drive slowly down the road.  The light started to get brighter, and brighter, and in an INSTANT the light (WHITE IN COLOR) shot straight up into the sky, and defied all laws of gravity as it streaked across the sky as fast as a shooting star, but it went UP, and after a ways, then turned right (horizontal). My brother and I couldn't believe our eyes?  We did continue on the the lake. (Bartlett Lake, AZ), near Horseshoe Lake, and fished the morning and afternoon.  On the way home we decided to stop and get out where we set the odometer, and we were still MILES FROM TOWN!  As we noticed in the daylight the mountain that was lit up earlier that morning could be seen as we drove back to Scottsdale. There was NO AIRPORT, and there was NO Buildings, or houses for MILES.  We decided NOT to tell anyone as we feared we would be called CRAZY or that we MADE IT UP?  I only now tell this to whoever reads this, so maybe SOMEONE ELSE seen the same thing back then?  Maybe this happened and was REPORTED BACK THEN? The date is approximate, as years have gone by, but I am sure it was the spring time, and I am SURE of the time in the morning!

The object moved silently across the sky, approx. 1/2 to 1 mile above us. The craft was long in shape, with a box shaped nose (front), a long bridge-like narrow middle and a tail that flared wider than the middle portion then tapered down to a point. The object did not streak by, but instead floated slowy across the horizon line, arriving from the south, moving in a north, northwest direction. The sighting lasted about 2 minutes before the object disappeared in the distance. The object was covered with many different colored lights, which highlighted its spatial qualities. In a frenzy my friend and I drove home to tell others about the event. The DJ on the radio station that was playing stated that he was receiving a lot of calls about a UFO sighting. The next day or so the newspaper had a small article dismissing the event as a ""russian satelite burning up in the atmosphere"". Sorry folks, but this object was crystal clear in appearance and moving slowly, not a streak in the sky. Another poster here described the object like a cruise ship in the sky and that description accurately captures the incredible nature of the experience because it was about as freaky as a cruise ship flying overhead. I cannot fully impress upon others the extreme size of the object... much bigger than any man made object known to fly at low speed and low altitude. FYI, The other poster mentioned here described what had to be the same event, but recorded an approximate date of June, 1987. I am quite certain that they were off by a year or two by virtue of the event having taken place at least 20 years ago. Gotta say though, no matter how much time goes by I can never forget that evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We were working twelve hour shifts during the crisis, it was near relief time when I looked out towards the sunrise, off into the calm, blue, orange sky and saw something strange. There was one small cloud with flashing lights moving inside of it, and he cloud was moving towards the no-fly-area.\ We K-9 units wanted to know what it was. We took a truck across the runway to the flight crews Quarters. Everyone was looking at the cloud as it slowly approached, making no noise, red, blue, yellow lights revolved inside the bubbling, boiling cloud like a carousel.

I would like to remain anonymous though - I will be as descriptive as possible. My two friends and I were camping in Dosewallips State Park in Brinnon, WA where the Dosewallips River meets the Hood Canal.  We were the last ones up at roughly 1am in our area of the campground and we were chatting and star gazing by the camp fire, facing the northern sky.  We had been drinking, but were fairly sober and lucid at this time before we went to bed – only slightly buzzed.  We are in our mid to late 30’s and don’t drink a lot in any given sitting anymore.  My one friend and I were looking at the sky and I was watching a high-flying aircraft (pin point of light but larger than a satellite) moving slowly across the sky from the west to the east.  It was partly cloudy that night so we could only see the brighter stars (no satellites). Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I saw a round white light shoot from the eastern horizon to the center of the sky directly above us and slightly north.  It was many times larger than the aircraft but still as high as the cloud cover.  It seemed like it was lower than the other aircraft, which at this time was still way over in the western section of sky moving slowly toward this fast moving object, but I could not tell how much lower (it was hard to discern).  At first I thought it was a meteor entering the atmosphere – it moved that fast – a second or two to cross half the sky.  But there was no trail of fire and it was not red or orange in color.  It then stopped on a dime, remained hovering for 1 second above us in the center of the sky and then suddenly changed direction 90 degrees and took off toward the northern horizon, making a couple counter-clockwise loops in the sky, slowed at the end of the second loop and then sped up and shot off to the eastern horizon aga! in faster than it had come into view.  I think the entire event lasted no more than 5 or 6 seconds.  We didn’t have a camera anywhere near us and it happened too fast – even my third friend didn’t look up in time to witness once my second friend and I started exclaiming when it changed direction. As it was happening, my mind tried to make sense of it, and once it changed direction I considered the possibility that it was a laser light from someone further away in the camp ground.  But the light appeared to pass over, through and even behind the cloud cover (there was dimension to it in comparison to the clouds) and even passed through the clear night sky.  The light was not ""reflected"" on the clouds.  I would expect a laser light would not have these characteristics, but could be wrong.  Also, typically the path of a laser light is a bit erratic and the movement of this light was intentional in nature – it was very smooth and almost gave the impression of propulsion.  I do know that there have been instances of people shining laser lights at airplanes near the SEATAC airport and blinding the pilots - they apparently have been trying to catch the culprits.  But we were nowhere near the airport. My friend (a psychotherapist) and I were left speechless.  We simply starred at the sky until I finally asked if we had both just seen what I think we did.  She slowly said: yes, I think we have.  Our other friend was not looking up to witness.  We discussed afterwards for a period and later in the light of day, and we still remain confused by what we saw, but certain we saw something quite advanced if it was aircraft. Obviously I am aware that this may have been some sort of military aircraft (we were located on the Hood Canal near many military and airforce bases), and that the military is very possibly capable of designing aircraft that can go that speed.  The strange thing was that the bottom of the aircraft was all light (I could not make out the shape of the aircraft in the night sky – it was merely a light) – it was not headlights directed through the sky – the light faced us on the ground.  Also, the speed at which it changed direction was astounding.  If we do have military aircraft that can accomplish what my friend and I witnessed, our military capabilities are far more advanced than I had ever imagined. Not sure if it is of any consequence, but the next night (8/15 - maybe midnight) we witnessed something else.  Facing the same direction we were looking up at the sky on a very clear night, watching the satellites and stars.  Third friend, a massage therapist, saw a flash of light from a satellite in the western sky (as if it took a flash picture of the earth).  It continued to move across the sky to the eastern horizon, and when it got to almost the same level on the horizon as before, the third friend and I witnessed the flash again (very visible – twice the size of the object itself).  It then disappeared slowly beyond the horizon.  I assumed it was the sun reflecting on the satellite.  No flash from the satellite could be this bright.

I was watching TV from my couch when the electricity went off. I then opened the 2 windows in front of  this couch to let in the cool air from the storm. As I knelt there, watching the storm through the screen, my eye caught a flash of color in all this dark greyness. The palms were being whipped by the ,at times,40 to 50 mph wind and the other trees branches were swaying so anything not tied down would have been whisked away. Angle of  Observation In  the front of  the house is a large tree at the bottom of the driveway. The house rises at a 30 degree angle up from the road and base of the tree. Looking out through a gap in this tree was,. what I thought,.. a plane on fire surely hit by lightning during this storm. This is key now, my reasoning being there is nothing but big open sky beyond this tree at the altitude of my line of sight. This is upwards almost another 30 degree angle at  most. This bright fiery thing was not very high up but lower than the glider people that fly over our  house during tourist season.. I could not tell how far away this was from my house as I  have nothing to use as a gauge. In this area you have to go downtown, ten miles, to see anything tall only 2 buildings.that are impossible to see from here. As I watched,  this orangey red pulsating thing, our fire house sirens went off,.. so it was a plane then ? However, this thing never fell but hovered in the same spot so that it was now past 6 minutes according to my watch. If it was a plane it would not continue to hover in the same place. What troubled me a lot was, it suddenly flashed an extremely bright red around the edges..,twice,.. as if it were winking at me and my hair stood on end and I got the weirdest sensation, it knew I was watching it.  Crazy feeling. I then ran to get my little camcorder but fumbling I only got the lightning flashes and my cursing that I missed it. Result I never had a good enough look to see the whole shape of it. Going outside was a definite danger. It  did scare me so I at one point I closed the curtains. This all lasted  9 minutes. The lights came back on the storm waned and when I looked out it was gone. I wonder if anyone else saw anything that night.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,27.310734441087614,-82.49044025679758

There were no airliners, private planes, helicopters or military jets in the sky at the time. I was alone, standing at the edge of the walkway, in the dark at my rural home, looking at the stars.  The only light was my yellow porch light which was 35 or    40 feet behind me.    I was looking toward the north west and noticed a large very bright round object moving toward me very slowly.  I thought it had to be either the ISS or STS so I ran into my house to get my binoculars so I could watch it clearly.  I also made a note of the time.  It was 18:59. As I watched the object approach I noticed that it appeared to be flying at an even altitude and it was traveling in a weaving pattern, moving from the left then back to the right.  The object made no sound.  It had no navigational lights and no FAA red and green strobe lights.  It emitted a steady white light.  I have no idea how far up this object was.  I had difficulty looking at it. It was so bright it hurt my eyes.  It did appear to be the size of a dinner plate  The object came to a dead stop right across from me and sat still for about 10 seconds.  Then it blinked out and moved to the south west, right above me.   Needless to say, I almost panicked and ran but I couldn’t move.  I was frozen and I could not breath.  I felt as if it was staring at me while I was staring at it.  I immediately thought, what is this thing and how can it see me in the dark?  It sat there for almost a minute, then it started moving again, to the south east, at a faster pace and in a straighter line.  When it was almost out of sight it veered to the left and disappeared.  I got my dog and ran into the house, closed and locked my door and looked at the time.  It was 19:03. I have lived either on or outside of military bases  my entire life and I have seen some pretty unusual objects in the sky and in the water, but I have never experienced this before.  I sincerely hope that I continue to see UFO’s, but only at a distance. I did not report this sighting to any law enforcement agencies but I did contact NASA in Houston to ask if they knew what this object might be.  They did not know but they did say that it was not one of their satellites.    Their satellites do not zig zag across the sky and they do not stop in mid air. I hope reading this helps anyone who has had a similar experience.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

One night, my wife and I were out on our back deck enjoying each others company, gazing at the stars. We noticed something rather odd. A star out of place, perhaps a jet liner. We do live near an airport and it's not uncommon to see lights from a jet high in the sky.  Sometimes even military aircraft go buzzing around making awful noise. I thought it was probably a jet.  It did not seem to move about at all, and it appeared far enough away to be a star. The object was blinking with red and white lights. We stared in awe wondering what it could be when all of a sudden. Like a star plucked from the sky it seemed to dive straight in at us at incredible speed.  Once it was close enough to make out, (which was within seconds) my wife frantically ran in the house scared.  I stared at it as it stopped and hovered maybe 150-200 yards above the ground, on my left side.  Right above my property. Not making a sound it moved at a slow speed across to my right side over and across the tree tops until out of sight. I saw the craft very clearly.  It was shaped kind of like a star destroyer from star wars but much smaller. I would guess its size could have taken up half a football feild.  Its color was a bluish grey, very dark.  The craft had a few very dim lit lights underneath of it.  The underneath was all I could really see.   Since the incident I've done alot of research on the web about ufo sightings and was glad to see that others have seen similar crafts. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

You could see the sun reflecting off the bottom and the top was darker where the sun wasn't reflecting from it.  I kept checking every couple of seconds out my window at it to see if it was moving or to figure out what it was but it was just stationary.  Anyone from this area knows the only aircraft we get around by us is crop dusting planes and small single engine props. and no other planes were in the sky that i could see at the time and this object was not moving at all eliminating the possibility of it being a plane, and the metallic appearance means it was not a star or the ISS. I went to look on! e more time it looked like the object just shot off due west and in a pretty vertical trajectory gaining altitude in a split second and was gone.  I wasn't going to think anything of this except for the fact that I saw the exact same thing in the exact same spot while driving in the exact same spot about a year or two earlier which is weird.  I also was reading reports on here about other sightings and noticed someone saw something similar in the Stevens Point/Plover area and thought maybe there is something to this sighting after all.

For three consecutive years, in the late 1990s/early 2000s, I worked the fall cranberry harvest at the Oceanspray fruit-receiving plant in Middleboro, MA, in the Cape Cod region.  The plant is in a remote area amongst historic cranberry bogs.  In late September of 2001, I was working through a second shift break on the outside of the large facility. I never talked about this with anyone at the plant, but it is likely that I was the only person working outside at that time. I looked up to see a craft passing over the factory. Briefly, I thought it might be a stealth airplane or some military craft related to 9/11. However, there were details of my sighting that make the craft I witnessed irreconcilable with known crafts of human origin. It was so low and large that it filled the sky to all horizons/tree lines(the factory was surrounded by pine forest). It was completel! y silent, and this was disorienting. It kept going and going and going. The bottom of the craft did look like something humans could make. There were panels, and it bore a slight resemblance to the bottom of the millennium falcon/starship enterprise. The colors were dark like a stealth bomber and it had the same smooth flat texture. I saw one red light on the end of a stem-like apparatus descending from the craft. It took about 60 seconds from the time I became aware of the object passing overhead to when it disappeared behind the tree line north of the plant. Generally, I would say that its shape was rectangular. More specifically, I would describe its shape as two large rectangular shapes joined in the middle but slightly offset, each the size of an extra-large football stadium. However, the size is difficult to estimate because it was a disorienting experience, but I would guess that it was 400 yards long and 300 yards wide. I couldn't determine any depth or height. That! is not to say that it was flat, but its width and length were! of a much larger scale then its height. I estimate that its speed was 30mph. When it happened, I said to myself that I was going to keep this to myself and that it was my special weird moment. I don't know why I had this psychological reaction. It was somewhat traumatic, and the memory came back to me a time after the event. I can't explain this, but I did feel that the craft was affecting my brain/thought process in some way that encouraged my disbelief. Was the craft silent or is there a superior technology that can make crafts inaudible to our brains etc.? I didn't tell this story to anyone until this thanksgiving and I am going to try and track down people from my shift at the plant at that time. Subjective speculations I have now about what it might have been are: secret human technology cargo ship, alien ship, alien slave ship. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The UFO was forced down into the channel between the 2 islands where it laid for a few days. on the 4th day a Soviet recovery vessel showed up in the vicinity, on a salvage mission.

I went down stairs into the kitchen, No it was not the kettle it was unplugged.   Still hearing the hum I searched for it's where abouts I pulled the bedroom curtains open to check outside the house.  There it was as plain as day, I could not belive my eyes.  A space ship oval in appearence with flashing lights around the middle they were white, and the craft was spinning.  This is where the humming was coming from.  It was stationary above the hill in front of me.  I called my husband to come and look because he was a none believer.  We watched it for about 15 minutes then all of a sudden it began to move, it went to the right, then to the left and was gone in a flash.   About 5 seconds later 2 military aircraft flew right over the position where I had seen and heared the spacecraft.   I have told a few people about my experience those that were close to me because people would think I was nuts or lying.

This was in the late 60's in California.  I was maybe 15 at the time, living with my parents. I was sleeping, in my own room at the rear of the house, when I was awakened by a noise.  It was the sound that a jet would make, however it was of a slightly different pitch, I knelt on my bed looking out of my window and was frozen in place by the sight of a UFO hoovering approx. 100' above our neighbors and our house.  This UFO was the stereotypical UFO for the time and I am not sure that I could even describe it accurately now.  This craft hoovered maybe 15 seconds in this spot ( which seemed like 15 minutes ) and then it departed in a vertical direction until it was pretty high, before moving horizontally.  The next thing that happened was pretty cool.  It was a clear night with a lot of stars visible and I was watching this craft depart out of frozen, excited, curiosity.  It was traveling horizontally when it came to a spot in the sky that was pure black, no stars, and darker in! color than the night sky, as it got to this spot it turned into it an vanished instantly. I was disappointed that it was gone because I wanted to continue to watch and follow this craft, but I was excited because I felt I knew a little something that others didn’t, and that was an explanation of how they are able to travel such great distances.  I have told very few people of this sighting because they tend to not believe you, and I have never really known who I could give this information to. If this information helps in any way than my job is done.  Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",,33.8872,-118.3548

There was a farmer who lived down the road from us who used to take me fishing at Lake McConaughy, just North of Ogallala. One day we went in the afternoon and set our lines out in a bay on the lake.  We could see the bushes on the opposite shore. When it got dark enough, the farmer lit a Coleman lantern and placed an aluminum sheet by it to reflect the light towards the lake. I saw a light to our left (do not know what direction), that was small like a headlight in the distance. The light came towards us very slowly, taking 20 to 30 minutes to become as large as a house and, seemed to be hovering over the end of the bay. I kept asking the farmer, ""What is it?""  And he kept replying, ""I don’t know, but it isn’t bothering us.""  The light was so bright that it lit the area up like daylight, at which time he said, ""We might as well save on fuel,"" and he turned off the Coleman lantern. We fished with the bright light for another 10-20 minutes, when it suddenly left the area at a right angle to the approach it had made.  It took less than 5 seconds to be totally out of sight.   Our eyes had become accustomed to the light and we had a difficult time re-lighting the Coleman lantern. I should say that there was never any sound from the object.  The color was bright white.

My recent ""lights in the sky, with military jets"" experience of 19-Oct-2009 (which I reported to you about) has prompted me to share two other aerial sightings I have had in the past. I am now 61 years old.  I spent my childhood in West Texas, up around Lubbock, Littlefield, Levelland...places like that.  My dad was a school administrator at two small towns, Pep and Bula, which were situated some 50 miles from Lubbock, 20 miles from Littlefield.  I think at least one of them is still on the map. As a young lad I often accompanied older farm boys, and my older brother, on jackrabbit spotlighting hunting trips.  I usually rode in the back of a pickup truck whilst older boys with 22cal rifles shot at, and sometimes hit, jackrabbits that we caught in the beam of a good spotlight.  Just drive slowly along any country road with that spotlight sweeping the pastures and you'll catch the eyes of many night creatures there on the high plains of the Texas Panhandle. If you've ever seen a Texas jackrabbit run you'll appreciate that this is a most sporting form of hunting, taking a great deal of skill and marksmanship.  There is a quote attributed to Chuck Yeager about country boy's marksmanship...""give a hillbilly a rifle and he'll hit the bullseye every time""...or something like that.  Those farm boys were good shots.  I got pretty good myself as I got older. On two occasions I witnessed ""green fireballs"" flashing across the night sky.  One I recall distinctly was traveling roughly southwest to northeast.  Being a young lad who read science texts avidly, I just thought to myself ""well, that meteor must have had a lot of copper in it"".  I thought this, of course, because I knew copper oxide is greenish in color. Years later, while reading a paperback coauthored by Kevin Randle, I read an account of many sightings of green fireballs in the US.  Some, it was reported, had their likely trajectories calculated to predict impact sites--but no debris was found. So they say. I saw at least two of these about 50 years ago, while riding in the back of a pickup truck underneath the brilliant clear night skies of the Texas Panhandle.

My light bothers them; I don't know why the light is an irritant.But, they move to my left and right as though they try to surround me. My flashlight dims over time and now I can see their wet black eyes. I hold back my tears and try to shout but I can't hear myself. Exhausted and with little light left they stick me with their pointy legs and smother my breath. I always wake up the same way I did that same morning after, soaked with sweat or lake water; I can't tell which.  I am scared to death every night I sleep, because I know they come in my dreams and I can't stop them.  I must tell you that I see myself like them in the mirror on occasion only to second look myself and see me normal again. I believe I was abducted but can't prove it. I was just a boy then and now I am in my 50's and still I am bothered with this horrible dream.  10 years ago I had a tumor removed from my body.  It was attached to my stomach. It weighed about a pound and! was about the size of a small orange.  The doctor said it was! an unus ual size and sent it to the lab for biopsy. That lab was flooded and the tumor was lost.  I have always wondered if that tumor was a spider sack?  I guess I will never know. If anyone has had similar dreams, I'd like to know?  I do have these red splotchy spots on my legs that my doctor says is a rash.  I have had them for decades. These spots end at the knee. Maybe some one else form your index has the same and we could share.  I am old fashioned when it comes to computers. And I'm too embarassed to let anyone know this fact, so I hope this is as good as your ""cut and paste"". ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I have held several significant positions since my retirement.  I say this knowing that my pedigree may mean nothing to my credibility once this story has been told. While returning from upstate NY, and heading south along the parkway, we saw a large, lighted object in the distance, hovering over the Throggs Neck Bridge.  We all thought it was a blimp. As we got onto the bridge the object, remaining stationery, was clearly visible as a flying saucer.  It was above the center of the bridge with a span that was much greater than the width of the bridge. Around its center were white lights, revolving in a counter clockwise manner. The ship was silent.  All passengers in EVERY other car, were looking at the craft, even the drivers!  It was amazing that no one caused an accident that night.  We were also motioning to one another to confirm that they saw what we saw, and they did. Then as we were just under the ship, it went from hovering over the bridge to gliding along a path that followed the parkway to the Northern State (I believe) and turned east and followed the lighted road out to Suffolk County where it turned south and flew along the path of the Oyster Bay Expressway and out of sight.  It was as if it was intrigued by the traffic and the lights of the cars and the roadways it was above.  Until it sped off towards the southern portion of Long Island, it was cruising at speeds comparable to our cars' speeds. Then it darted off so fast as to become a blip in a matter of seconds. There were times while we followed it that it darted up and down and east and west but did not deviate from the overall path I described above. As soon as we arrived home we called up the Suffolk County A/F base and Newsday.  Neither confirmed any other contact by others or that they had tracked anything on any Radar. My brother and our 3 other passengers all spoke about what we had witnessed and, to this day, 45 years later, we still know that what we saw was a huge saucer shaped object, capable of unbelievable maneuvering and great speeds.  We are convinced it was other worldly. Were there other accounts in the area during the time I described (actually it was the first weekend of the month of September '64 and we were bringing a friend up to Albany State College to begin college.

I could not see a shape yet as they were in the top of the tree line.  They hovered there for  about 1 minute when all of a sudden they started to rise slowly.  As they got above the tree line I could make out a shape which looked like two saucers laying one on top of the other. It stayed at this altitude for about another 30 seconds when all of a sudden it took off and was gone very, very quickly. I don’t remember my reaction to this as whether I was frightened or not.  I did not have much time to think about this anyway as I seen this car going very fast on this dirt road in Hartley field and hitting Woodland Avenue and without stopping sped away at a very ! high speed.  Now you would have to see how dangerous this can be as the dirt road is a steep hill and when you got up to Woodland  Avenue there was a stop sign because it is in the middle of a sharp curve and you don’t just run this stop sign without looking both ways.  As this car sped away I noticed that it was a police car! I thought wow here this police car had come out of Hartley field right where the ship was hovering!  I did not have much to to think about this though as a friend picked me up and asked if I had seen this. I really do not remember anything else we said, and I never really talked much about this. I think I was afraid that no one would believe me. I always wondered though if those two policemen filed a report or told anybody as it was plain to see that they seen this.

We would take drives during the fall to look at the flowers & foliage of this beautiful place that had scenic drives over brick bridges surrounded by large trees.

I was a very observant young person (I still am today) as I loved nature and would spend hours gazing and looking for any and all signs of wildlife. Suddenly above the tree line to my right I saw an object rise up from the trees.  It was disk shaped and eggshell color with what appeared to be small windows running circular on the upper portion of the saucer.  So there was an upper small section as well as the larger disk on the bottom. What caught my eye and will remain with me is the way this object moved.  It sort of floated up at a 45-degree angle and hovered for a second or two before descending back to earth at the same degree and speed.  I had never before seen or have since seen anything move the way this saucer moved. I told my parents and they believed me and we actually went looking for it.  However, it was difficult to gauge exactly where this was in proportion to where we were at the time.  Years later I saw this same saucer shape depicted in a small-scale model at the store that was built based upon a description from a lieutenant in the U.S. armed forces.

It was May of 1973 in Texas City, Texas.  I was 11 or 12. It started getting dark.  Everyone dispersed after an hour or so.  I stayed outside and set quietly on the grass in front of our new house.  Directly across the street lived a family, I will call Cark. I could see in their front window.  The family was all sitting around the TV. Their family room was brightly lit. Envy welled up in me. I so wanted a normal family life.  My step-father was a drunk.  There was a lot of dysfunction in my house.  I diverted my attention to the sky. It was an unusually cool spring evening with little or no humidity.  The sky was bright with what looked like a trillion stars.  The pollution was non-existent from the refineries that were close by and the air was light and crisp.  I closed my eyes and listened to the sounds of the bugs and distant cars.  All of a sudden there was an abrupt silence that fell over the area where I sat. Wh! en I opened my eyes, I noticed something hovering over the Cark’s house. I couldn’t make out a shape, because it was so bright.  Later I remember thinking that it had a half oval shape.  I remember feeling like I was getting a tan on my face.  I couldn’t move and I didn’t even feel like I could blink.  I tried to open my mouth to holler at someone in my house, but I couldn’t utter a sound.  My mind kept saying that I was not seeing what I thought I saw.  The last thing I remember was a feeling of terror. It seemed like a minute or two had passed and I found myself standing about three feet from where I was originally sitting.  The bright object was gone and the Cark’s were back to watching their family show together. The sounds of the late spring night had returned and I felt a chill go across my body. I turned and ran into the house.  I went straight to the bathroom to wash my hands. I felt dirty and kind of sticky. When I looked up in to the mirror, I saw my face. It looked like I had been at the beach all day long. It didn’t hurt, but I put aloe vera gel on it anyway.  I went in to the kitchen to get a glass of water and noticed that the clock showed the time to be 10:30 p.m. I immediately went in to my room to confirm the time on my alarm clock.  My alarm clock said the same thing.  ""There is no way 2 ½ hours could have past,"" I thought. It seemed to me to have been no more than five minutes. I walked around the house to tell anybody, but my step-father was passed out, m! y brother and sister were asleep and mom was at work. Fear overwhelmed me and I ran in to my room, jumped in my bed and put the covers over my head.  I thought about it for a couple of days afterwards. I even asked the Cark boy that was my age, if he heard or saw anything.  He said that he didn’t.  I didn’t think about it again until 1988 when I had an out of body experience hovering over my self and my new baby while we slept in bed.  A bright light came in to the room. It was pitch black outside, but it looked like broad daylight in my room.  The fans stopped and it there was no sound at all.  The next thing I knew,  I was back in bed and it was pitch black dark in my room.  The fans were blowing and I closed my eyes and went back to sleep. In 1990 I had a child and needed a C-section.  After my surgery and recovery the doctor asked me when I had my fallopian tube and ovary cut out.  I told her that I never had that kind of a surgery.  She documented the information and had nurses verify.  When I told my family, they said that the doctor had probably accidently cut them out during the C-section.  I bought the idea.  Since then, I have spoken to friends of mine who are doctors and they said that it was highly unlikely that one fallopian tube and ovary would have been cut out on accident by the doctor.  I have recently been writing in a journal I started in 2006 and as I came up to the 1970’s, my recollection of the May 1973 event became refreshed in my mind.  I did not feel the need to report this until, my 22 year old daughter who I have told the story, told me about a case called Dortery (sp) that occurred in a near by city of Alta Loma, Texas, in the same year of 1973.  I don’t know if there is a correlation, but ! I wanted to give all of my truthful recollection and let the professionals make that determination.

In 1974, I was 20 years old, working as a correctional officer in Volusia County, Fl., outside of the county seat of Deland, at a correctional road camp/county road  maintenance facility that was actually closer to Daisy Lake than DeLand.  Myself and another county employee were standing outside having a smoke and talking,  facing north, toward the Ocala National Forest just across the highway from the road camp grounds. As we were standing there, we both noticed a brilliant white light appearing over the treeline to the north, possibly a quarter mile off.  The light was streaking along almost due south in a perfectly straight line, emitting no sound at all, and trailing a perfectly formed 'tail' that faded out in a very even, regular manner perhaps 70 feet behind the head.  It appeared to be no more than 200 feet up, yet it did not seem to illuminate the pine trees below it at first, then there were no trees for us to gauge by in the mid-part of the flight. The visible portion of the sky, to us, was perhaps a mile and a quarter from the northern edge of the clearing we were in to the southern, and this object crossed that entire space in the space of 8 to 10 heartbeats, though we did not count it off while it happened.  We arrived at that number after comparing notes immediately afterward, when we were trying to comprehend whatever it was we had seen.  I do not know where that employee is, I actually only knew his first name, and that he was a heavy equipment operator for the County. It should be noted that the Ocala Nat'l Forest starts just on the northern side of SR 44 and continues northward for about 50 miles, with an average width of 30 miles, and has no paved roads traversing it E to W for the first 25 miles.  There are a number of fire roads through it, and they are used by people who have cabins on the Wekiva River. Which leads me to the second half of this sighting.  Fast forward to 1995, I have a lawn care business in the Orlando area, and one day I get to talking with a customer, an old school friend of my mother's, and I tell him about that night in late 1974 in rural Volusia County.  I share this with him because he was one of the lease holders for a cabin in the National Forest down by the river, and we had gone up to it to clear brush away in preparation for fire season. After hearing when my encounter had occured, he shared an encounter with me from about that same time, though I think his was in October of 1974.  He and his family, wife and 3 kids, about 12 to 15 years old, were driving back up to the cabin over the rough dirt fire roads after having had dinner in DeLand that evening, when one of his kids almost screamed that there was something in the air over the car and behind a little way, keeping pace with them.  All 3 kids saw it through the rear window, though he and his wife did not.  He stated that it was with them for perhaps 30 seconds, and there was no mechanical failure or engine stalling during that time.  I asked him specifically, as by this time I had read a good deal about UFO's and knew that was one of the things that oftentimes accompanies near sightings.  I do know where this man is still, and can put you in touch with him if you like, but he's getting up in years now,  nearing 80, I would guess. What ties these two together is the year and time of year, and the fact that his cabin is only 1.5 miles away from my sighting as the crow flies, a little farther if you follow the river.  Also, the Ocala Nat'l Forest plays a large, mute part in it, as I see it.  The area covered by it is vast, varied in land type, and largely inaccessible to anything but the most hardcore campers or hikers.  Look on Google Earth in Layers>Gallery>NASA>Earth City Lights and you'll see, the forest is a large black smear through the central part of the state for miles and miles, offering plenty of secrecy and out of the way spots to land a craft.

I am a nurse, my husband is a doctor.  Have not told my story to many people.  After watching THE FORTH KIND at the theater, my husband wanted me to relate this story.   I was approx 13-14 yrs old.  My brother was two years younger.  We were outside of our little country church with several other kids waiting for choir practice to end.   Someone noticed an object hovering near us in the cow pasture very close to where we were standing.  No sound.  The object was disk-shaped with a glowing red dome on top, hovering a few feet from the ground.  We were approx 50 ft (or so) away from the object.  It slowly came closer.  Everyone stopped.   Could have heard a pin drop.   It then shot off to the right of us toward the trees and was gone in an instant.  Again, no sound. While with my family at Christmas a couple of years ago, I had my brother (now retired military) tell his version to my husband.  It was the same.  We are in our 40's and never talk about this. He never forgot either.  I would love to ask the others, but they moved away years ago. Others have seen objects in the same area since then. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, I was surprised to get a reply from you.  My husband has been after me to tell someone about this since he has known me.  It was such a long time ago that I felt it was not prudent now.     Windsor,  North Carolina, is a small county town with a lot of farmland and open spaces. There have been multiple sightings.  My older cousin saw a disc-shaped object nestled in a field surrounded by woods on her way home just around dusk one evening.  (I believe it was not long after my sighting). It lifted up and over her car, hovered in an adjacent field then took off.  This was years ago and told to me by my mother.  This was when we lived a mile down a country dirt road, and she lived just past us with her husband.       The object that I witnessed was apparently seen by adults the following week at church.  I was not there, I did not see it again.  What I saw left a lasting impression on me.  I am a true believer.  I wish I could re-live the moment and remember everything.  I have always said that I would love to be hypnotized and return to that moment and see it again as an adult.  I would love to remember every detail of my experience.     I now live just outside Raleigh, NC, with my husband and children.  I have never seen a UFO again, but always look to the sky's in hopes of seeing one.  This experience is always with me, so many years later.  Never far from my mind.  Isn't that crazy?   I will ask my brother, but he is retired military and works for the government in Virginia and may not feel comfortable doing this.  The others, I have lost contact with 20+ years ago and have no idea where they are now.  Three of them were the pastor's kids, and they moved many times since then: ((three names of observers deleted)).   I hope this helps.  I know that there are many people out there with their own stories.  I spoke with one of my patients the other day about her experience (we were discussing the movie THE FOURTH KIND and she shared an interesting story regarding a sighting in New Jersey).     Thanks for listening.   Best regards, ((END ADDENDUM))",2009-12-12T00:00:00,35.9913,-76.9417

Sometime in the summer of 1974, me and a childhood friend, we were both 12 years old at the time, were at the local baseball field at around 9:00 pm in Kingston, Ma.  This night was clear but dark, not much of a moon. I remember this because I had dared my friend to walk across to the playground as it was unlit and two baseball fields away and it was, a dark night.  The area is nestled in the woods surrounded by trees and sparsely populated. As we started walking we got about to the pitchers mound when the sky in front of us flashed red. The flash was not like a lingering flash; it was extremely quick and seemed to span the horizon. My friend said” did you see that”.  It was very strange, and the color was vivid. I remember at the time thinking I hope it’s not the nuclear power plant exploding; the plant is about 15 miles down the coast.   As we continued walking east, I noticed an object about 20’ on the horizon coming from our 11:00 position.  My father fly’s as a hobby as I do know and I had grown up around airplanes.  It had red, blue and green lights in a circular pattern that were spinning. It looked like nothing I had ever seen.   As we watched it came closer, it was at our 9:00 position; it seemed to be flying along the railroad tracks when it suddenly stopped.  I new it was not a helicopter because it made no sound and no aircraft looked like this. At this time it began coming toward us.  I would say around 10 mph maybe. I could see it looked like two saucers facing each other with the lights spinning in between. It seemed to have no color that I recall. It was about 100 feet away from us when it again stopped and a beam of light hit the ground.  The beam had a sort of bright bluish tinge. The beam of light started to scan the ground, up back left and right. I told my friend not to move or it will see us. The object was around 100 feet high or so, it was hard to tell. The beam then went off and the object proceeded to m! ove about 50 feet to our right and did the same thing with the! beam, a gain the beam went off. Now the object moved closer, to just above our heads and again the light hit within 10 or 15 feet away and I heard my friend start to whimper.  The light came to a point so close that I felt I could touch it, then nothing the light was gone the object was gone with no sound. We never saw it leave although I was looking at the light on the ground moving around because I didn’t want it to see us so I never actually saw it vanish, but it was gone in a second.  We both ran to my house five minutes away and told my younger brother and mother what happened.  Naturally my brother wanted to go see so we went back.  The three of us walked down a steep hill, it’s a road about 200 yards to the ball field.  Once there we saw nothing then we only walked out maybe 25 feet and the beam landed right in front of us. We all ran, my brother got to the top of the hill first and I heard a car skidding down the road, it nearly hit him as he ran across the street. My father! , a policeman in our town drove me down in the police car after he grabbed a German mp-40 machine gun to take with us.  I don’t know what he could do with that but I later found out the police station had got a call from someone else who also saw it. We never saw any sign of it ever again.  My friend and I went down to the ball field many nights after that just hoping to see it again, but I can never forget what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

PD)) I reported the UFO sighting in Pawtucket R.I.of 1974 that you have on your website.  My sister and my brother would like to get a interview to talk about the craft in secret to protect our identity.  There is more to that experience that I felt I should share the rest of it now to your organization.  I left out the part to my abduction into the craft  My father still owns that house property with the 3 door flat top garage.  I was hoping if some how a team of your investigatrs can go and do a radio active reading on the roof.  The orginal beams our still in place supported by beams of wood my father had anchored to the damaged ones from the ufo landing.  Now here comes the shocking abduction story.  I was brought into the craft by two small aliens that stood at my eye level but with such strong strenght they shoved me into a room with a metalic table off to the side of the small room.  The lights in the room had a blue silvery incandescent glow.  A Female alien try to set me at ease by communicating to me not by speech.  I know this sounds off the wall but by telecommunication that we've seen in science fiction movies.  She said that they came from another world unknown to us and they plan on not hurting me but would like to perform some quick test's on me, I was frighented and tryed not to look at her large grey piercing eye's.  She said please disrobe from your clothing and I shook my head in fright.  It was icy cold in the craft it felt as if I was in the cold outside in the snow.  Then from behind her another alien came walking in and he seemed to be a little angry in the fact that I was still in my winter coat and clothing and was not yet even placed on the metal table for what ever they had in mind.  The female alien then said. look what you have done BoBo is now angry at me allowing you to waste precious time.  BoBo the alien who seems to be in charge looked at her angerly and said why did you reveal my name to this human ! boy.  She quickly than appologized and said look what you've d! one he i s now angry again at me.  He walked over to me and she said he is only a small boy he will not remember your name.  Getting away from this ufo encounter from that day on anytime I heard the name bozo or hobo I would feel a chill go up my spine until later on in life I remembered his name and realized why.  I noticed in the craft a engraved picture of a whale on it and it seemed to relaxed my mind a little because everything else in the craft looked alien to me and not reconizable. Bobo noticing I was transfixed on the whale asked me telepathically do you know what that is a picture of I nodded no in fright looking at his taller slender body with a large bulbus head because I was to scared to make conversation with any of them.  He laughed and said when I was your age I had already the intelliegence of five of your highly respected scientists.  The female alien then interrupted him and said that's not true.  You had the intellegence of 2 of their respected scientists.  That i! s true, maybe I am not giving your kind to much credit because I find you humans to be so ignorant and primitive you have so much to learn about your planet and about yourselves.  All this what you call war towards others.  He noticed that I started to look puzzled and stopped talking about what he thought of humans.  He than pointed to the picture and said that is a blue whale.  That is the symbol we use to identify your planet here in the milky way galaxie.  These whales when they communicate to one another in your blue ocean can be heard millions of light years away to our planet.  Their sound waves travel up onto iceburgs working like a radio wave and reached us millions of years ago and we followed the sounds here to your planet.  I am getting tiered typing this e-mail now and will wait to see if you would like a interview where I can share a whole lot more.  I must say I am glad the goverment keeps all ufo information hidden because what I saw can be mind bottling and! scary for most humans that our weak minded citizens could cau! se great stress in how humans think and excell in life knowing that their our intelligent beings way more advanced then us but the good thing is we have God and that is another subject I will talk about.  One quick data I did some reasurch and believe the craft I was abducted in was the ufo that crashed in Chihuahua, Mexico on 8/25/1974. It has the same discription that I reported and learned of this craft this year watching the new tv show on the History channel UFO Encounters.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,41.87182357142857,-71.3797407142857

Thinking about that news story later that night  I was wondering if they can read minds  So I kept thinking where I am with land marks and directions in my head thinking About new york by looking at a world map.  Right down to where my town is And what my house looks like and what’s near it. So later I sead and watched kojack on tv. As I lay on my bed watching tv what I first think was the moon came in view and maybe It was there all the time and I didn’t know it. Then it moved. Exact direction north east. The edges of it seem to have points and when it moved it looked like it was crawling on the sky. It was round. With small points all around its edge that get longer then Shorter like its pulling itself across the sky. What ever it was I think it was a living thing Of some kind. I was afraid to go near a window night for some time. Or go out at Night. I reported this to other ufo sites just check my story about the trips to eternity and Walter Cronkite. I don’t know how to spell his name so this is a sound like. And I was so afraid  because I could feel it knows me. And can see me. I hope I never see it again.

I have estimated a date/year in which this occured.  I am unsure if it was indeed 1976. It could have been 1975. First off, I am a realist.  I don't fall easily into the ghost/UFO sighting scene, but I know what I saw and it was very unexplainable. I was in my bedroom at approx. 2245 hrs. and just laying in my bed looking out the window when up in the sky in a west southwest direction I observed what at first I thought was a possible satellite.  I was in Boy Scouts at the time and we would always point out a certain satellite that would bounce up and down and change colors.  This object did not change colors but was moving up,down, and back & forth.  Then it raced away towards the North completely out of sight and at an unimaginable rate of speed, but within seconds came back to the approx. area in which it first was.  It then raced off again at an incredible speed and returned again, but this time it came back from a different angle.  Again, it raced off which looked to be a diagonal direction upwards but again to the North.  It never returned. I remained at the window for at least an hour just hoping it would return. My next door neighbors were out of town visiting family in Topeka, Kansas. When they returned, I informed my friend what I had seen and overhearing me was her mother. She informed me that while they were in Topeka that some neighbors of their relatives also saw the exact same thing in the sky. I am now 43 years old and a Deputy Sheriff.  At the time, I was approx. 9-10 years old.  This sighting has always bothered me since that time.  I read all these fantastic reports and they sound really silly.  But what I saw was totally genuine and I would really like to know of similar reports of this sighting.  I can't be the only one that saw this.  If in Kansas it was also seen, then I would think many people also saw it.

The night before an in house officer was shot and killed by intruders.  We were stting in a prefab guard house about 15 ft by 15ft and I turned off the lights so we could see if anyone would come over the outside walls. The unarmed officer sat diagonaly from me in the shack and neither of us could see each other's faces. (we were both caucasions).   Suddenly the guard shack filled up with a translucent blue light and at that point I could see the other man's face.   We were both amazed.  I looked up at the florescent lights and they were off for sure.  I looked outside thru the windows and could see no source of the blue light. After the light was gone I called the LAPD, asking if anyone hit a power pole in the area that could cause such a light to happen.  They stated no.   I added this incident to the nightly report and we continued the shift.  I have no idea how this light came to be.  It lasted about 15 or 20 seconds or so.

We were walking in a southeasterly direction in the 800 block of Wrigley Dr. near the northern end of the lake. It was just as the last rays of the sunset were lighting up a few clouds to the West. It was at that time that we noticed a saucer shaped craft above us, it was approximately 80 deg. from the horizon. There were 3 other people besides us also in the immediate vicinity, (within earshot that is). I remember making the comment that ""We are now experiencing a UFO people."" The 50 yd diameter craft was remarkably close, only about 150 yards away. We saw many details on the craft, not all of which we can remember. It moved silently and very slowly for 100 yards or so from west to east. It then changed direction to go away from us in a southerly direction at an ever increasing speed. We watched the craft until it was out of sight. My wife and I then proceeded to our car which was parked across the street and we left the area going on Hwy. 12 south. When we had reached an area that was approximately near where County Hwy. U crosses Hwy. 12, it was already nightfall. It was at that time that we saw what we have assumed is the same craft, however it was brilliantly lit up with a wide lateral band around the craft. We noticed that it was a very complicated pattern of everchanging multi-colored lights. Now this was 1978, it has only been recently that I have compared the lights! to what today we would call a very complicated screensaver or even fractal color display. I pulled the car over to get a better look, but my wife looked very terrified, so i pulled back onto the road. I know what I saw. I have worked for many years in the aerospace business as a R&D machinist. I know it was not of this planet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Together with a friend, we were traveling by car in the east part of France heading to Strasbourg. It was already night , might be 10PM or 11PM, 50-60 miles south of Strasbourg on a motorway and still we had to drive 1hour to our destination.  We have been tiered already , so we decided to stop on a park place for to take a little rest and to eat a snack.  It was a starlit night and while resting , we looked to the starry-sky. After a while, we recognized that out of the star-scene in the west of the starry-sky a bright lighting star dissolved out from the star-alliance and started to move.  That light point ( approx. 30º above the horizon ), moved, even jumped very rapidly up and down, left and right, zigzag and perpendicular. e tried somehow to estimate/scale the magnitude of those movements by stretching or arm forward for to see how many fingers the movement ranged.  So far I remember, the movement from the light-point covered approx. the width of 2-3 fingers on a stretched arm, crossed in less than a second. On the beginning from that ""light-show"" in the sky, we thought that an airplane or helicopter might be responsible for this , but we rejected this idea because:  1st  the movement started from a fixed-position and 2nd the profile of movements was so incredible, rapidly in speed and rapidly in changing of move-directions. From our location we could not estimate how far away from us that light-point was , as according our first impression , that light-point appeared just as a bright star. We could not hear any noise, either. The light-point movements went on for some time and after a while we decided not to look further to that light-show in the sky and not to bother ourselves with things we cannot explain. Somehow deep impressed and confused we left the scene and continued to drive towards to Strasbourg. We promised ourselves not tell anyone about that event , because we thought that nobody will believe us and we feared of ridicule. However, 30 years past, but the memory on that night is for me still present  as it was yesterday. I am reporting that case now, because internet does provide now the opportunity to share  those experiences with an open-minded community.  Maybe someone has a simple explanation for that .

It was a hot night and we didn’t have air conditioning.  My parents were asleep so I snuck out to lay in the cool sand of a construction site next to our house.  Arcadia is a small city that stretches along the main road for about a mile and a half or so. My house was on a hill at the end of the road, enabling me to clearly observe most of the city.  I enjoyed looking at the lights of the city in the cool night breeze, and as I sometimes did, I stood in the cool sand and looked down at the city lights.  As I was doing this, I perceived that dogs were barking at the far edge of town.  I didn’t think anything of it until I perceived that the barking was slowly getting louder and closer.  This caused me to pay a little more attention and as I looked down at the city I saw a small patch of sky that was darker then the surrounding sky.  As I watched, I perceived that this dark patch was maybe 300 feet above Main St, and coming straight at me moving slowly.  I didn’t see any lights and couldn’t make out the shape until the thing was maybe 100 yards from my position.  I began to hear a low “rum…rum…rum noise coming from it.

It was somehow hard to see, yet I could clearly make out the shape.  It moved on to my right until it went out of site behind a large hill.  At that point I couldn’t hear it anymore.   I never saw it again, but it just occurred to me that maybe  2 years prior to this sighting, a saw a meteor fly over my house so low that we could hear a loud burning roar as it passed almost directly overhead.  The shape I saw was going in roughly the same direction, no idea if they are connected. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2009-12-12T00:00:00,44.2527,-91.5015

It was in the early eighties, probably June or July, (I’m assuming summer time because we were at the lake for the weekend). My brother and a herd of our friends had converged on Lake Whitney located in North Central Texas to our favorite spot, Soldiers Bluff. We partied well into the night, and it wound up being just myself, my brother and two or three friends that were still awake at 2:00 am. While the two or three friends stayed at the campsite talking and playing cards, my brother and I went fishing off of Soldiers Bluff. It was there, while sitting on an ice cooler, rod in hand…eyes on the stars, that we witnessed this event.  I had noticed a white light moving across the sky that was to close to be a satellite in orbit. As I watched this light, I noticed a smaller one appear next to it that I assumed was the other “wing light” of the “Plane” and that it was turning towards us. As it continued to “Turn”, (One was slightly higher than the other) the lights got further and further apart. The further apart they got, the more I thought to myself “My God, That’s a HUGE Plane. As they leveled off, seven smaller lights appeared to swoop into formation with the other two lights. They now were heading in the opposite direction they had originally been traveling.  The first light was very large and round and white. This was being followed by seven smaller round white lights. The light taking up the rear was a large white rectangle. We stared in total disbelief as the 9 craft soundlessly floated across the sky in front of us.  We remarked to each other as to what they could be and finally decided it was a small plane pulling a lighted banner. AS SOON AS I said that to my brother, the craft in the rear raised up slightly higher than the others and SHOT forward halfway up the formation, very quickly, where it stopped and slowly floated down thru them to be below them where it hung there motionless until the last little light passed it. As the last light passed over it, It raised back up behind the last little light and continued across the sky, taking up the rear, till they were finally indiscernible. We had asked our friends if they had seen them also. They said that they had, but I don’t believe that they did, due to their  lack of astonishment (that was very evident in my brother and I) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The ship was northbound outside of the coast of North Carolina on its way to the New York Harbor.  I said to the others look at that star flickering.   Then suddenly what looked like a star flew at tremendous speed toward the horizon and suddenly stopped in the middle of the sky.  The object then zig zagged up and down like nothing on earth could do at a great speed.  It then stopped and turned a bright red. The man from Texas said it was taking our picture with infrared light.  After turning a bright white again it flew toward the starry sky and disappeared.

At present time I have Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and would like to report my sighting before I depart this life. At listed date and time ((TC)), ((MC)) and I were fishing, camping and hunting quail at Apache Lake, Arizona.  We were the only ones on the lake. On a Thursday morning in October, 1981, we decided to go home two days early on our week vacation.  We were camped at a location across from the boat ramp.  When we left our camp, we noticed how calm the lake was and that we were the only ones there. On the boat ramp, we saw something moving through the water and thought it was a beaver, however, when we pulled alongside it, it was a mule deer doe swimming across the lake towards where we were camping.  We thought that this was unusual as they run in herds and not singly as white tail deer. ((TC)) and ((MC)) wanted to drown the deer and take it home and butcher it for meat and I refused to let them do it because I was the boss at the time.  It would have been easier for the mule deer to walk around the lake by the ramp rather than to swim across the lake. After we loaded the boat, we drove south from the lake to the first hairpin corner.  As we turned, ((TC)) slammed on his brakes and jack knifed the boat to where we could not leave.  Hovering above the small box canyon on the sunny side, was a large shaped object as big as a football field from end zone to end zone. It was shiny like crumpled up aluminum foil and as it changed colors from the sparkling of the sun, we noticed it was vibrating and making no sound.  At this time we knew it was somehow mechanically operating. ((TC)) asked me to get out and walk up to it but I refused because I was in fear of my life and told him to do it.  He pulled out a 12 inch barrel 357 magnum and wanted to shoot at it, ((MC)) and I told him to put it away.  We were frightened and felt that we were being watched by the UFO. We rolled up the windows and locked the doors and watched it in astonishment to afraid to do anything.  We watched it for about 10 minutes like it was a Mexican standoff.  Trying to figure out how to leave without driving under it.   Just as we decided to back up and break the hitch on the boat, it took off faster than the eye could see.  It went straight up and you could see the curvature of the earth as it went straight up because it left a shiny image behind.  It actually left so fast you could see the shining image behind it. We made a pact together not to say a word to anyone because they would just say we were drunk and we had not drank anything that morning except coffee.     As a police officer I faced many conflicts were I could have been shot or stabbed and still was not as afraid as I was of the flying object seen at Apache Lake.  As a police office, you learn fight or flight, however, I was scared to the point that I could not hardly move, talk and felt like vomiting.  I am willing to take any type of lie detection test to verify the truth of our sighting.  As a police officer, I have taken many lie detector tests and have never failed. I wanted to report this to someone before my disease takes my life because, of all the nay sayers and scientists saying people who see unknown flying objects are crazy.  It’s hard to deny when you see one in broad day light. I know what machines are because I served in the Navy as an engineman and was a driller on one of the largest drilling rigs in the world.  I also have been a avid bow hunter and fisherman since I was about 10 years old.  I am now ready to turn 54 and have countless hours in the hills hunting and fishing from northern Idaho and Montana to southern New Mexico and Arizona.  It has cost me two almost three.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

I kept an eye on the target occasionally because in a few minutes I figured I may be talking to him.  Primary target only, but the target was exceptionally large. Visibility was unlimited and no cloud cover.  I expected to see some lights and here the pilot transmit on the common freq with closed tower procedures.  I glanced again and the the target was moving fast, so it got my attention.  I saw it the last time on the 5 mile range ring then I saw a round ball, no lights, unable on color zoom low level directly over the tower.  Unsure on altitude but it caused me to reflexively duck, so low very low.  I thought at first it went through the tower over my head.  But I realized that was not possible, I think it's speed and low altitude caused this feeling. Size, very small, smaller then an airplane.  Hard to estimate, dark, fast no lights, no noise.  I would say a little larger than a beach ball.  Maybe smaller though. Long time ago, I never reported this to anyone.  Hope this helps with your investigations.

This light did not move or apear to be moving but was fixed.  And then in seconds gone. I hope I was not upducted. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

June 21st 1992 - Southern End of Conesus Lake near Joy Rd. in western NY - USA It was a beautiful summer day filled with waterskiing and fishing with my college sweetheart.We cooked out on the grill at about 7:30pm EST and dinner was ready at about 8pm. Just as our meal was ready to eat, it very suddenly began to rain very hard, like someone had flipped a switch. It had been hot and sunny just previously. We quickly grabbed the food off the grill to avoid getting too wet and ate indoors. About 9pm we sat in my car while parked in the driveway to have an after dinner cigarette, as that I had promised not to smoke in my father’s cottage. I was seated in the driver’s seat and she was in the passenger seat. The front door of the house was located about 3 feet directly off the passenger door of the car. The front door had 3.5’x2.5’ glass pane window with curtains.Very suddenly, the rain just stopped.It was suddenly deafenly quiet compared to the rain pounding very hard on the hood of my car. I had the strange “sensation” that something had just fallen from the sky nearby. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. About 10 seconds later, when I turned my head to the right to face her and comment on the strange weather I saw the creature in the window of the house. It was inside the house holding the curtain back making eye contact with me. It was huge. It was crouching yet its head was still only inches from the 9’ ceiling of the room. I estimate that it must have been over 15’ tall when standing erect.  It’s hand holding the curtain back was as large as the window.  It’s  skin was black and shiny but not wet or slimy. It was very muscular and predatory looking. It had a snout about 6-9” long and had pointed incisor like teeth throughout its entire mouth. It’s eyes were very human looking and seemed to denote a  very focused look of sentience and/or intelligence. My mouth dropped and I froze. It seemed that even with the two doors between us we were already much too close (about 3-5 feet away) for safety sake.  It was clearly some kind of predator of great physical power. I didn’t make a sound. This went on for about 30 seconds. I was making direct eye contact with it. When my college sweetheart  finally turned to see what I was staring at, her immediate reaction was to turn back toward me and start punching m! e in the arm screaming “just drive away!” over and over again. This shocked me back to my senses. I started the car and peeled out of the driveway immediately. As I drove away I saw it running down the road in pursuit of us, but it seemed to “phase” in and out… almost like a bad TV reception. She saw it too. I drove very recklessly to put some distance between us. It worked but even so I continued to “feel” like we were being watched. We talked about what we saw but didn’t know what it was or what to make of it. We were too scared to return back to the cottage that evening. I dropped her off at her parent’s house and then drove to Geneseo NY. I still “felt” like I was being watched. I ran into a friend walking down the street and told him the story. He wanted to see it. I reluctantly drove him there. When we got there he too could “feel” the “vibration” and was now too scared to go inside the house. I however felt that I hadn’t come for nothing and also wanted to turn off the lights and lock the doors of the cottage. When we went inside! the “vibration” was much stronger and we both found it difficult to breathe.  I felt like I was being stalked. After about 5 minutes we left. I still “felt” like I was being watched. For about a week I still “felt” like I was being watched. Even at times even threatened. I was very scared. I felt like I was being followed. I finally couldn’t take it anymore, instead of being afraid – I got mad! I wanted to challenge it, wanted to physically fight it. That’s when it stopped and I never saw it again.  I still remember it like it was yesterday, even though for a long time had not a clue as to what it might have been. I just knew it wasn’t of this world. That’s all I knew. About a year ago I saw a sketch drawing on the internet and it was exactly what I saw.  It was from a conspiracy site dealing with Annunaki/Nephilim ideas. I still don’t really know but have the distinct feeling that it’s not over.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,42.7041,-77.6703
Red light/sphere seen over neighborhood of Charleston Heights with street lamps blinking on and off.,Las Vegas,NV,1992-06-30T21:00:00,sphere,30 minutes,"Occurred : 6/30/1992 21:00  (Entered as : Early 90's 21:00) Reported: 10/26/2009 5:20:52 AM 05:20 Posted: 12/12/2009 Location: Las Vegas/Charleston Heights, NV Shape: Sphere Duration:30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73016.html,"Red light/sphere seen over neighborhood of Charleston Heights with street lamps blinking on and off. This is something I have lived with for many years and was too afraid to ever write it down. I've only discussed it with the people involved and a few trusted people in my life. When I was about aged 13 this event occurred. I had been in my house one night while my parents and other family members were out, it was about 8:30 to 9 pm during the summer in the early 1990's I remember watching television and the power suddenly went out.  I was feeling very uneasy about being alone in the house in the darkness so I decided to go up the block to my friends house as I figured they were not doing anything since the power was out.  My friends came outside with me in their front yard and we were sitting on the block wall talking for about 15 minutes when suddenly the street lights on our block had started to blink on and off.  We thought it to be strange as all the lights were blinking in unison with each other yet the lights within the house were not blinking.  Usually the lamps warm up before they reach full brightness after sunset or when recovering from a power failure.  I had climbed up on the block wall to look over into the other neighborhoods to see if the! streetlights on other streets were blinking as well which they were not.  It was only the ones on our cul de sac. Suddenly coming out of the east very high up in the sky we all observed a red sphere or ball that suddenly stopped and hovered above where we were standing yet it was very very high up and hard to judge exactly how high it was or its size.  The street lamps were still blinking on and off in a Morse code fashion.  After about 2 minutes of this object hovering above us it suddenly took off toward the west which was towards the direction on Red Rock/Spring mountains.  We were baffled, yet we slowly realized between the street lights blinking and this object that we had just witnessed a UFO.  My friends parents were also not home that night.  No other neighbors came out to where we were.  It was the strangest incident in my life. My friends siblings who had staid inside the house had reported that when they were trying to contact their parents on the phone that the phone ! suddenly had when static and they had heard a strange whirring noise d uring the same time we had witnessed this event.  Now these children were strict a Mormon family that were quite average and good people that usually would not believe in such a thing, but were convinced and still convinced they had seen a UFO to this day.  The whole incident was strange.  No parents home at wither home, power going out for about an hour, street lamps blinking on only our block, and this very bright red sphere high in the sky moving at speeds beyond aircraft that we may know of.  We believe that it was trying to communicate with us, or it was studying us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I had picked my 5 yr.old son up at daycare.  Driving home we had to sit at a red light crossing the frwy at a bit of a downhill grade. My son sits low in the front seat.  He pointed up and slightly to the right and said, ""Mommy, what’s that?""   I lifted my sun visor and bent forward to see what he was pointing at.   We saw a large football shaped object hovering above an apartment complex.  We use to live in that complex years before so, I know how big the area is there.   This object hovered above the complex and was almost the same size as a football field including bleachers space!  It had a soft glow of white and no defined edges, no windows, no sound. I froze for a moment then shoved it in park, threw open my van door, and stood out on the step of the van.  I looked at the truck behind us, waved at them and pointed back up at it.  They too leaned down a bit to look under their visors, saw it, and they both raised their arms up to push up their visors at the same time their mouths wide open.   I looked back and it was still there and all of a sudden, I got scared and sat back in the van closing my door, looking up from inside with my son again the object sped quietly upward at an angle to the right, getting smaller.  Now the size of a baseball it stopped and changed course speeding upward in the opposite direction so fast and kept going till it disappeared.  Its flight path was in the shape of the letter V= (>) like this.  At that moment the light turned green we drove through and on the other side of the freeway was a field, parked along it was a man’s truck.  He was in the field staring at a deer that was frozen scared staring back at him.  As he inched closer, I pulled over, jumped out and yelled, ""Did you see it!?""  He said, ""See what?""  I said the ufo, it was over there above that apartment complex""  He said, ""In broad daylight, no?!""   He looked at me like I was nuts and I ran back to my van and drove away...I remember one thing really struck me as odd.  Just before my son said, ""Mommy, what’s that?"" !  I had be en repeating over and over in my mind-- Turn green, turn green, turn green.  When my son spoke to me it was as if he broke a trance I was in.  I had felt like I had been possessed to keep my attention on the red light in the intersection, the man and the deer too. It was as if he was made to stare only at the deer.  The deer was unusually frozen in its tracks.  HOW COULD HE NOT SEE IT!!! unless he was in some sort of trance too.  Why was my son unafected by this trance?  I don’t know, maybe they didn’t think he needed to be.  You know how you get a strange feeling someone is staring at you!   Well that’s the feeling that frightened me into getting back in the van.  I felt like many eyes were watching me!  They saw me!  It has taking me years to be able to say this.  Aliens from another world looked at me and only at me for that moment in time that I stood on the step of my van.  I've read many stories over the years, but none described the massive ship I saw.  Please tell me if you heard of any ships as big as this one. I can’t be alone on this one.

Suddenly a small disk shaped object about a foot across and about 10 feet off the ground flew directly over the fire and traveled out of sight in a perfectly strait line.  The only sound it made was a swhoosh as it passed.  It appeared to be metallic and about an inch thick, it had no lights or anything else -- very plain looking. My other friends saw it too and they were as stunned as I was.  There was no reasonable explanation for it.  The forest was covered in dry leaves and if this thing was thrown, we would have heard it land, not to mention heard the person who threw it.

On July 4th, 1997 (at night) ... One year my mom and I were in the back yard in Illinois (USA) and we saw a blue light right at the roofline of our first floor house.  We were facing the back yard, seated in lawn chairs, talking, and all of a sudden the entire back yard (about an acre of ground) lit up in blue light.  We looked over our left shoulders (both of us, there was no sound and yet oddly we both looked over our left shoulders at the same exact time) and there was a bright blue light hovering there.  It was just that... a light and it stayed there pulsating for about 5 seconds I'd say... then it started to move and just disappeared.   My mom and I don't tell anyone about this because we know people will think we are nuts.  This is the first time I've ever put something like this out there.  We have no reason to try to make people believe that we saw what we saw.  I just thought I'd post this so that others out there that also have witnessed something as strange as this don't feel like they are alone.  I'm sure that some day what we all saw will come to ""light"" - pardon the pun.  By the way, (in the US) from California to the east coast people saw this blue light at precisely the same exact time of day.  It was noted in the papers and news but was dismissed by scientists as possible meteors... though my mom and I, and everyone else who witnessed it, knows it could not have been - for it never hit the earth and it was hovering.  A meteor would not stop in the air.  I was not scared of this light... though looking back on it I'm surprised that I wasn't ... because it was so incredibly ""odd"" (that's the best word I can use right now to describe it)... nothing I'd every seen before and I don't necessarily believe in aliens or things of the like.  I did feel afterward that night that we had been ""observed"".  It's a strange thing to say... and it was a strange thing to feel at the time.  My mom and I joked that it was taking our picture... then over a year later we were talking about it aga! in  and discussed the possibility of it being some government testing type of object... but that too sounds too strange to believe.   Anyway, don't feel like you are alone .. all of you who have seen something like this... but then again don't try to convince anyone who didn't see it for themselves because they will only think you are nuts.  My own dad and sister don't believe my mom and I.... we just don't talk about it to them because we too would likely not believe someone had we not seen it for ourselves.

As I was filling the glass, I looked out the window,and saw a bright white light, out in the far back part of the property, in between the trees and the branches. I would say it was aprx 75-100 ft from the window. The orb of light was stationary at first,about 4-5 feet off the ground. It was about the size of a basketball, maybe a little smaller. It seemed to know I was there,because it started to move closer and closer to my location, until it got to the iron fence about 50 ft away..then it stopped. At that moment, it looked larger in diameter.  It just hovered there for about 20 sec.  I really started to feel uneasy/paranoid/afraid at this point.

I noticed the underside of the object to appear like rippling dark black liquid motion. As the object continued slowly gliding overhead, I realized it was so huge it blocked out my entire vision of any sky, this object appeared so much larger than my apt. complex, the street, the apt. complex across the street. And at this time, I also realized, the object was completely silent. I also recall like diffuse lighting to the underside, from possibly within, tho ! no light's actually on the outer surfaces.

Two formed the back ends or base of the triangle.  While the other two were on the tip, one being smaller than the other. At first I thought it was a plane but it moved to slow to be any aircraft I know of.  I watched the object for about 5 minutes until it disappeared to the east.  The really odd thing was that during the entire time no sound was heard from the object.  Later that night there was a glow in the eastern sky as if there was a fire, but no fire was ever reported.  Being a small town news of things like fires spread quickly. The next day there was a significant increase of military aircraft flying all over.  I don't mean way up in the sky but literally right over the mountain tops.  This went on for about 2 weeks. I counted at least 4 different types of jet aircraft though I know not of what models they were.  I don't know if the two are connected but it seemed odd to me that the increase in activity happened the next day after I saw the object.

This happened during the winter of 1998-99, but after 10 years I can’t remember the month or time of evening.  I remember the experience vividly, though. I was walking across an agricultural experiment field at the University of Alaska/Fairbanks, sometime in the evening (could have been anywhere between 18:00 and midnight).  It was overcast, with a cloud deck of somewhere between 300 and 600 meters.   When I reached the middle of the snow-covered field, which was roughly 1 km by 1 km, I could see a formation of lights to my SE headed in my direction.  Because Fort Wainwright and Eielson AFB are to the SE, I assumed it was a formation of fighters, bombers or helicopters.   The lights were in a delta formation, with one in the middle and 3 on each side, for a total of 7, and were a brilliant amber-orange.  They were moving at a low rate of speed, 100 km/h at most, and were flying underneath the cloud deck.  I watched as they passed directly over me.  I could make out no wings, tails or propellers.  The lights were brilliant as a welding torch would be, but they did not flicker.  The objects were completely silent; not even a whisper; whereas I could hear a raven’s wings flap out in that field.   As these 7 lights in formation continued off to the NW, an 8th one brought up the tail at the same speed about 1 km behind.  All of the lights were moving as if fixed, but the clouds were clearly visible between them.   I am confident these were not airplanes or helicopters.

Remember it was realy dark .No light post or any source of light but the headlights of our van.All of a sudden i see light on our dashboard.At the moment it took me a while to figure out why is there light on our dashboard when there is no light post outside.So I took a glance through the windshield and seen a round craft with lights pointing straight down right above our van realy close hovering over us.Right there and then I scream at my dad while he's driving and told him,""look up!"".He looked up and stopped the van right away with a look of shock in his face.I got out of the van not fealing any danger ,so my dad got out too.We looked up at this round saucer that resembled a pepperoni pizza but upside! down,but think of it like this.The pepperonies were the lights pointing straight down and this hovering object was realy quiet without making any noise what-so-ever.I could here my sister scream realy,realy loud,I turned to look at her but she was alright.She was only sticking her head out my window looking up and screaming and crying .This object was over us for about 2 minutes and then started to move realy slowly twards a field where we could follow it,there was no road.Only a fenced up field.Another thing ,this thing had a front and back to it .Even though it was round because what was the front had a spotlight going crazy lighting up,down,side-to-side.So this round saucer like I always seen on tv and read in fiction books was moving away from me until it disapeared.Me and my sister still try to remind each other if what we seen was real,but she shuts me up and doesn't want to talk about it.......life,is not the same for me.

Not unusual, as that the National Guard flew C130s in the area, but NOT on a Wednesday in the Spring. The craft then turned to the north and it was then I noted the lights in a odd pattern: a small triangle of red ligts (small point at the nose of the craft), with a slightly larger triangle of blue-green lights (small end attached to the nose setion) as the fuselage. Due to the distance from me, I cannot give a accurate size, though I would guesstimate it to be slightly bigger than a military cargo plane.  As it was turning north sharply, it's speed was faster than most planes I have witnessed, but unlike other high speed turns, it did this without any engine noise. After moving slightly north, it turned back to the west, again silently, and was gone. What makes the sighting even more interesting ws that f! or two to three hours afterwards, pairs of military jets were seen and heard patroling the area. Not protocol for a Wednesday night, I assure you. I am in the military, and I have flown most of my life, and to this day,I have never seen or not-heard an aircraft like the one I witnessed that night.

I was tempted to report the incident but was too baffled as to who to tell and who would believe me, as it occurred so fast, but the incident has always stuck in my mind.  I found this web site and realized other people did report the incident.  Anyway, my neighbor and I noticed 4 saucers in the sky to the west above the SFV, over Canoga Park, near the Pacific Ocean.  The clouds were streak like that evening and the red sunset was beautiful in the sky.  At around 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. (unfortunately not sure of the exact time) but right as the sun was setting that year, we noticed 4 aircraft with colored lights around each of them.  The aircraft were flying in uniform formation, all somewhat close to one another.  I think the lights were blue, orange, red and yellow (not sure how many colors I saw).  Anyway, the 4 aircraft hovered down ! for a short period of time (not sure how far down to earth or how large they were as they were miles above earth)and then as if by mental telepathy they knew we spotted them as we were commenting on them to one another.  Then, the 4 aircraft stopped, changed course and with a fast trajectory zipped into some sort of hyperspeed out of eyesight and were no where to be found.

I was fishing on a dock facing south on Clear Lake just west of Seabrook, TX. Actually I was in El Lago, TX.  In a south/southwest direction up in the sky, way up above the Hilton Hotel and was already in motion and continued in a perfect geometrical arc in direction and down towards and disappearing, not over the horizon, but just above the west horizon.  Object appeared to me about 1 and 1/2 times the size of a full moon, just off of round.  I would say slightly egg shaped.  Object had no sound and moved from where I started to see it to where it disappeared in about a fourth of the time it would take a fighter plane to travel.   Now then, the color and radiance of the object stayed the same throughout the sighting.  It was a very bright light green almost like a glowing type of green although it didn't do any glowing.  Just the object itself had the color and light.  There was no light emitting off of it into the surrounding dark sky or a! ny halo and I hope I am discribing this so as to give an accurate picture.  There is no way to come up with a guess on the actual size of the object or how far it was from earth.   And like I said there was no sound, perfect arc descending pattern,  size abnormally large compared to anything that we would normally see in our sky.  Speed incredibly fast compared to our F16's, etc. and the way the light emitted from the object was not normal.   This happened in Oct of 2000.  I reported this on this site back in 05 or 06 although I can't find my sighting in your archives.  I would really like for someone to let me know if this was something that has a logical explanation behind it.   Nasa is right there at that end of the lake.  If this is something of our government, we have nothing to fear from other country's military might.  This object was definitely unidentified by me, however until there is some proof, it doesn't mean that there were alien beings in it. Someone else had to ! have seen this!

It was so close I could have picked up a rock and smacked it very easily. There was no sound or lights at this point. It was just hanging in the air over our backyard.  At this point we were all very excited when all of a sudden a portion of the cloud kind of rolled back and we saw a bank of about 7 rectangular lights. Each light was about 8 X 4 inches. I saw the lights as multicolored, my kids saw the lights as all one color; purple.  Then the cloud rolled back over where the lights were and flew to the north faster then anything I’ve every seen and it disappeared very quickly.

I found this interesting and decided to transmit signals using my 2 meter ham radio (ten watts) and a cubical quad beam antenna to see what would happen.   I was transmitting for several nights on 146.520 FM (national calling frequency). I would transmit a series of mike cliks while aiming the antenna about 50 degrees off the horizon pointed at the south southeast direction.  This antenna was mounted on the roof of my van and i was doing this nightly from about 2am to about 4am.  I was also transmitting the audio from a digital timex 1000 program (sounds like a bunch of bees).  Then one afternoon around 3pm I was dialing in Michael savage out of san francisco on my radio shack shortwave radio. Suddenly the series of cliks i was transmitting around 3am in the morning were heard in the shortwave receiver.  The receiver was sitting next to the transmission cable leading to the cubical quad beam antenna on the van's roof.  I figure it inducted the signal into the small portable radio receiver. I was not able to figure from which night the signals were returned as I had been doing this for several nights. If it was from the night before it would have been about a 12 hour round trip if from 2 nights before it would have been a 36 hour round trip and so on. Then 9-11 happened and since I was sitting across the bay from Naval Air Station North Island coronado I decided to take the antenna off the roof so as not to be consider spying or anything as that.  So this is one more mystery in my life that I have not figured out.

My then girl friend ran in the house terrified & I fallowed feeling the same fascinating fear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

My wife, two guests from Denmark and me were sightseeing in downtown Atlanta.  This was a very bright, clear, deep blue, cloudless day in October a month after the WTC disaster.   We were all standing on a street corner right next to the downtown Atlanta post office and I looked up into the beautiful sky to take in all its glory and as I panned across the top of the Westin Peachtree Plaza hotel something caught my eye.  I saw what appeared to be a ""fleet"" of UFO's noiselessly drifting across the sky in a Northwest to Southeasterly direction.  It was an incredible sight to see at least forty or more objects floating at the same speed, silvery white in appearance contrasted against this crisp, beautiful deep blue fall day.   One of the most amazing views of what appeared to be inexplicable objects that I never would imagine I would see, ever.  There is one detail I have left out till now.   I would estimate that from these forty plus objects at least one third of them  there was a similar, silvery white “tether” or “cord” that connected between two of the spheres.  This was a very unusual sight.  From the distance I stood from these craft, estimated at approximately 5,000 feet, the “tether” appeared at arm’s length to be the size in diameter of thread used in sewing.  The objects themselves appeared to be the size of a very heavy “period” one would produce with a pencil on paper, held at arm’s length.  When I called attention of this remarkable sight to a local street vendor I was surprised at his reaction.  There was relatively none.  He could care less.  I thought this to be very odd behavior.  He looked up and as quickly as he looked up he went back to his business of selling handbags and sunglasses without uttering a single word.   Our friends from Denmark saw this and remarked that it looked like someone holding “parachute exercises”.  The parachutes of forty plus sky divers over Atlanta at 5,000 feet up, without a single hint of descendi! ng?   Highly unlikely!   This was a curiosity that has stayed wi! th me to -date and I just wanted to report it here and now.  I listen to you on the Jeff Rense show every single time you are on.  I didn’t want to be one of those 99% you talk about that does not report their sightings.  I always wanted to see the typical saucer shape craft with a dome on top.   Little did I think I would see an entire “fleet” of UFOs.   I’ll keep my eyes peeled over-head in hopes that I will someday catch a glimpse of my ideal saucer.  Until then, thank you for letting me share my experience of some 8 years ago.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,33.808705515846256,-84.38988231962239

I wanted to walk up into the trees to see what it was but my friend said i have no time to chase ufo undies thats my nick name. he didn't want to go up there because he wanted to go home as soon as pos! sible since it was a long walk home i didn't go and see. to cut a long story short we tried the car again and it started and got us home with no lights that was a bit freaky. but hes car trully was a heap of shit not because of ufo activities i reckon. but the car did break down before we saw any ufo enter the trees. it was a long time ago so the story is a bit hazy i have my friend on facebook but we never really talked about since then i might have to see if he remembers to.

I was out walking with the dog outside of my rural home when I noticed 3 large bright circular objects moving across the sky.  The objects were moving from the north west toward the south east.  They appeared to be following the same path the satellites follow, except the satellites travel a different direction before they disappear.   All 3 objects appeared to be at a fairly high altitude. They made no sound and did not have navigational lights no did they have FAA red and green strobe lights.  They were round white lights. One of the UFO’s was moving fairly slow almost stopping from time to time.  The second was moving faster and the third object was moving very fast.  All three objects were moving across the sky in a  erratic manner, traveling in circles and moving forward then stopping and moving backwards.  At one point the slower UFO #1 started to travel to the south east. UFO #2 was zig zagging across the sky at a high speed and flew directly across the path of the slower moving UFO #1.  I expected to see and hear a loud explosion but somehow they avoided a collision. The 3 UFO’s continued to move in a random pattern across the sky for almost 7 minutes. They finally regrouped and flew south east in a single line and disappeared. There were no witnesses to this sighting and I did not contact any law enforcement agencies to report this sighting.   This is all of the information I have on this incident. I am reporting this incident 7 years late because internet service just recently became available in our rural area.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,29.926000000000002,-97.5644

We went there to drink a few beers. We were setting on the tailgate of his pickup talking about work. A few min after we got there i noticed a light to the N/W. At first i thought it was a light on a light pole at a farm house. It looked like a tree was swaying in front of it. Then it stoped flickering and begain to get brighter. It was moving closer we kept talking. I thought it was maybe an airplane but it was moving kinda strange,  you know left to right and up and down. The closer it got the more I watched it after about 30 mins I began to get a little uneasy you might say. At this time I had drank no more than 2 beers so i was not at all drunk, although that might have helped my nerves a little. The light looked like it was watching us, that made me feel very strange. My frend was downing beers i told him to check it out he said (aw! w its just a plane) I said, ""You think? It dosent move like a plane."" (I grew up beside an airport and have seen many planes large and small military and civilan chopers and well you get the point). Well the (LIGHT) was very bright now and extremely close i was standing now I was very excited and scared and kinda glad or something I was finally seeing that thay were realy real!!! My friend was more interested in his girlfriend, and seemed to not realy care until it was directly over our heads. There was no sound other than me screaming at him and her to run or start the truck and repeating the F word many times as it set over us no more then 100 yards above the trees. It seemed to be moving slightly but so slow. I couldnt figure out if I should run or just crawl under the truck and hide. I was realy expecting it to be a choper, but when it got about 300 to 400 yards away and no noise was herd my brain just went stupid. I kinda panicked slightly but I wanted to see it so I d! idnt run. I was afraid of what it might do after seeing shows ! like FIR E IN THE SKY about travis walton I just had to stay and be sure it was what I thought it was. I mean hell its not every day you see something  like this. It was so damn close, but when it came to a complete stop it looked like it was turning its light down as if to shine on us or maybe the whole ship was tilting. As the light was turning down the whole damn thing lit up from the center out. It was like a row of floodlights but the lights werent lit the whole length of the ship, just the center edge. Now when they hit the lights I thought, ""O shit it was like being hit with two thousand volts, I hauled ass and ran as fast as I could for about 10 yards. I realised I wasent hurt or being picked  up. Although I was shaking so bad it was like i had been droped in ice water, the  shaking part I mean. So I stoped and looked back and they were still by the truck looking up with there hands shielding their eyes from the light. It was ripped from a scifi movie or something then the th! ing slowly drifted on past. Kinda a smooth oozing kinda glide. Just perfect and smooth my friend said it had to be a plane or chopper from the army in  stelth mode . Thats what he thinks. He realy never said any more about it. I told  him stelth meant that it was  not seen on radar. And a stelth bomber couldnt hover. A choper would put off a hell of a lot of wind. But because he didnt believe in ufos it had to be some type of military craft. What do you think???  I  have seen other things but this is the clearest and i know it wasnt a dream this time.

I was always very observent of strange weather so I watched the fog ""roll"" in.  In the fog I noticed a bright light peering thru the fog.  I just thought it was a helicopter flying low because of a car acciedent or something.  I continued to watch it and began to grow brighter and brighter like it was getting very close to my house.  When it was in the air over my neighborhood it was so bright I couldn't see the helicopter I thought it was.  All I thought was the spot light on it was pointing my way.  I left the window and turned on the scanner to listen what was going on and nothing indicated any thing was going on, in fact the chat on the scanner was very odd.  The police and station personel were laughing and joking around with no normal police codes being said with very personal like conversations going on.  When I went back to the window was when a stunning, in shock like feeling came over me wi! th what I saw then. A brillient gold like light was hovering approx. 20' above the trees and I yelled fo my girlfreind to come look and when she got to the window, before I said anything about what I was seeing I asked her what she was seeing.  When she explained the ""light"" as I was seeing it I grew terrified.  Then I saw another light not as bright but still brilliant gold like and the same size.  With this one I could make out the shape of the lit up object.  It was a crooked tear drop shape, moving slow and not realy in one direction or at least not in a straight line.  Finally I heard somthing that made sence on the scanner ""do you guys see the light up toward the hill""?  I waited for a responce but nothing.  Infact, nothing the rest of the night.  But back to the ""lights"", and third one apeered and this time the three I could see were shining a ""super"" spot light or beam in a patrolling like matter toward the houses, ground, and trees.  No sound realy came from them b! ut, I could almost feel them flying kind of like a train in th! e far di stance that you can't hear but on a calm quiet night you can feel a train coming.  I ran from windo to window looking for more of the ""lights"" but couldn't see any out the other side of the house.  What I did see is light in the air like a stop light colors, three total. I huddled in the corner for some of this night terrified the spot beam would point see me.  The presun rise was starting to light up the sky and the fog and the lights all disapeared and the scanner went back to normal.  There are other details about other strange things I saw that night like I could see in the distant the line of tail lights toward the highway all seemed to be parked or stopped.  I don't know what I experienced that night but this site I found tonight seems perfect to get this of my chest and see if I feel better about it.  If I try to tell someone like a friend about this they look at me like I am on drugs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2009-12-12T00:00:00,40.6536,-95.8784

My job in the Marines was TMO 3112. After the attacks on our nation I was detached from my unit and attached to PMO security forces.  I worked the graveyard shift from 1700-0600.  I was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar, San Diego, CA.   The evening of my sighting I was placed on duty, alone, to guard a gate on the flight-line.  I can’t remember the exact gate number, I believe it was 15, but I do know that it was at the north end where the c-130s were parked.  I had been on Security forces for awhile and I had a routine way of keeping myself alert and awake.  It is a severely punishable offence to fall asleep on post. I would take caffeine pills throughout the night and practice drill movements if I felt myself getting tired. On this particular evening I was very alert.  It was particularly cold that night, and being alone on post made me very aware of my surroundings.  The small shack that was my post was not heated, so I would frequently leave the shack and walk the small perimeter of the flight-line that was my post.   On the last of these walks I left my shack and began walking the flight-line.  Something above caught my eye.  As I reverted my gaze upward, I was astonished to see small, bright, circular, orb hovering about 200 yards above the flight-deck.  The object was no bigger than the circumference of my body. I am a female and I stand at about 65 inches.  In a flash, it shot down and hovered inches above the flight deck. It hovered there for a few moments, and then just as quickly as it came down, it shot back up into the night sky, and was gone. I was unsure of how to go about reporting it.  I logged the sighting in my log book and radioed it in to my command post.  I was almost immediately relieved of my duty at that post, by a Staff NCO.  I was told that I was tired and needed to go home and get some rest, and to report back for duty the following evening.  Now that I have fully performed my contract with the Marine Corps I feel that it is time to tell people other than close friends and family. I did not see little green men, or a flying saucer.  I saw what I believe was an unmanned recording device.  I have no reason to lie about what I saw and know that what I saw was real, and I hope that with this report maybe another Marine who was guarding another post on the flight-line that night will come forward.

So I looked up at the sky and I directly saw not the northern lights but this craft flying slowly above me. It was saucer or disk shape with the sides cut off blunt, if I hadn't looked right at it I wouldn't have seen it. It was dark in color almost like an eclipsed moon in color but darker. It was about 500 Ft. above me and moving very slowly from east to west, and down river towards the bay. I yelled at my wife to look, ""look"" and I pointed at what I saw and asked if she could see it. But she couldn't it was to dark in color and it was night and the craft made no sound. It was something you would have to look directly at to see. The craft was small about the size of a small bus. It took about 10-15! sec to pass over head and continued on its path west until I couldn't see it any longer which was't very long.

We had gone outside to look for falling stars as it was a very dark and clear night.  The moon wasn't very bright and I don't think it was anywhere near where we were looking. We were talking about UFOs and such, all of a sudden in a completely coincidental and serendipitous moment, a triangular object came into our field of vision.  We were standing close to the house, so it appeared to come from over the rooftop and then flew in a straight line from south-east to the north-west.   I was only able to see it for about 5 seconds as it flew over the tree line behind me.  There were tall pine trees all around me and the object was about 2 to 3 times the height of the tree top level. There were no visable lights and it was completely silent.  At first my brain thought I was seeing a falcon gliding or a hang-glider, because of the speed, height, and smoothness of the way the object was flying.  but we quickly realized it was a large object like a craft or something.  It was too slow to be plane, too fast to be a blimp.  It appeared to defy gravity.  It was so quiet i could hear everything around me. the slight hum of the street lights, etc.   You WOULD NOT have seen this thing unless you just happened to be looking at the exact spot that we were looking at at that exact moment.  It was a one in a trillion shot!   It was so dark, as was the sky that night, so it was very well camoflauged.   I say triangular, but i could only make out 2 sides of the triangle in the dark sky, so I don't know how the back of the object was shaped.  It could have been a triangle or a diamond.  The back was just too dark to see anything. I had the feeling it was a top secret military craft that was maybe on a test flight just to see if anyone would report seeing something that night.  I wouldn't be surprised if I was the only one in the city to see it that night.  I just happened to be looking for something at just the right time in the right patch of the sky.  But it had white or light-colored markings on the underside, they were on the left and the right side.  They were symetrical, about 4 or 5 white spots or streaks running down the left and right side.  They seemed to defeat the purpose of hiding the craft, but they were on there non-the-less.

We weren’t looking up but we noticed something.  We got really quiet.  There was literally no sound what-so-ever.  The dogs, horses, and all other stuff were utterly quiet.  What we saw were three lights.  (JUST LIKE THE ONE ON THE IMAGE YOU HAVE FLYING OVER THE OUTLINE OF MISSOURI)  It came in from the north and made no sound at all.  It flew directly south... STRAIGHT SOUTH!!!  It moved extremely slowly.  It made a hard right turn and it was at this time that it broke the speed it had moved at the whole time.  It moved faster, but not real fast.  We watched it go toward the horizon until we couldn’t tell the dif! ference between it and the stars.  When it passed overhead, it was low enough that the lights from the garage seemed to reflect off of it.  Literally, it seemed to be only a few hundred feet off the ground.  I have to say, it made NO SOUND AT ALL.  Until it turned, it never broke speed.  In turning, it didn't actually turn.  but just changed directions.  It was unmistakably a triangle.  CLEARLY TRIANGULAR.  See, in Wichita there is an Air Force Base (McConnell AFB) talked about it for a while.  We both thought when it flew overhead that it was a B2 Bomber, but IT MADE NO SOUND and when it turned, we knew it wasn't a bomber.  We know what we saw.

WHY is there a jet at 6500 feet traveling west here? (it's not on any flight path that I know of) It's too late to ""dive"" out of the way, I'm going to get hit by turbulence no matter what..... then, I didn't get physically hit? Hey, if it's a landing light, how can I could still see it as it winked out over the ocean?  This made no sense. On first impression, a jet and the bright light I saw was the landing light - then thinking about it, No - it couldn't be a landing light - I could see it as it went away from me. a meteor, A luminescent blue meteor? But, it didn't ""get dim"" over the ocean, it just ""winked out"". making me think: no smoke trail. How could it be a meteor?  I couldn't figure out exactly how close it was - but, it appeared at my 10 o'clock and went over the ocean at about my 2 o'clock - and it was only visible for 2-3 seconds. So - it had to be darned close. If I had to guess, less than 200 feet. Maybe 6 to 10 feet long, 4-5 feet wide and 1-2 feet thick. Or maybe 100 feet and it would be a bit smaller. No wind turbulence, no sound. Weirdest thing I've seen.

I stopped the truck just before I reached my destination because even though the light didn’t appear to be moving there was a 200 ft high ridgeline 1/4 of a mile to the south of me and the light was getting very low on that horizon. I grabbed my 12x50 binoculars off the seat of the truck and opened up the door and braced myself between the open door and the cab to steady my position while I viewed the light. There was one small tree on that open h! illside and the light was slightly above and to the left of the tree. It was stationary and didn't move in relationship from the tree. It did however during the next ten or 15 minutes get very bright then dim. Several times it totally disappeared only to reappear in the same location a few minutes latter.  Every time the light dimmed it would blink very rapidly. Through the glasses the light appeared to get larger and sort of pixilated as it got brighter. It also appeared to change colors but it did it so fast that I could not distinguish which color. I watched this for quite some time and was so fascinated by the event that I didn't remember that I had a video recorder in my hunting back pack. By this time the sky had brightened considerably and the light had disappeared. I got the camera out and was getting it ready when suddenly the light reappeared. I got a few seconds of video and managed to catch it getting brighter than dimming and the rapid blinking. I also zoomed i! n on the light for a few frames. It dimmed once again blinked ! and disa ppeared for good. It was bright enough by this time to see an object in the sky but nothing was there. I waited several minutes but saw nothing more of it so I decided to go hunting as planned. When I returned home and reviewed the video in slow motion I was quite surprised. It appears to me that instead of disappearing the light leaves upward at a 45 degree angle at a fast rate of speed. I've never seen anything like this and though I don't know what it was I do know that it wasn't a star, satellite, airplane, helicopter or balloon. I might add that I wasn’t planning to report this to anyone until several close friends who saw the video encouraged me to do so.

At around 10 to 11 PM myself and 5 others witnessed a UFO flying North from across the backyard of my home In Troy.  In total there were 7 of us all standing outside yet only 6 could see the object as it blended in almost perfectly with the night sky.  This large group of people included my own brother and another man who would later join the Air Force of which he is currently enlisted.  We were in the back yard of the home smoking cigarettes when an individual frantically pointed to the sky asking something like, ""What is that?!""  I remember the date because it was not only Cinco De Mayo but also 5/5/05.  Had there not been others to witness the event I likely would have never told anyone about it.  The object was flying extremely low.  It was traveling so slowly that If one of us had chased after it we would have been able to keep up.  It was around 10 feet long and maybe around 10-12 feet at its wing span.  It was a triangular object that gave off absolut! ly no sound or reflection of the lights below.  It almost completely blended into the night sky in a way that seemed like it was mimicking it.  It gave off no lights and had no lights on it that I remember seeing.  However this event did occur nearly 5 years ago.  The object travelled across the entire length of my yard and crossed over South Boulevard/ 20 mile Rd into Rochester Hills.  Because it was so difficult to see against the night sky everyone lost sight of it after it had only traveled a short distance.  Less than 100 yards.  The object flew directly above us and never changed speed.  When the object crossed South Boulevard I could see that it was flying only slightly higher than the telephone poles it was passing over.  It also released no vapors or any kind of trail that I could see behind the object.  Even though one of the people in the group was unable to see the object it is likely due to his poor vision or unwillingness to accept what was occurring around hi! m.  Other than shock there were no feelings I experienced duri! ng this incident.  I know what I saw and so do the others who witnessed this event.  There is no way this aircraft was earth technology.  It made no noise and seemed to cloak itself against the sky.  If the object was under intelligent control it would have easily been able to see us gawking at it.  It was literally flying so low as it was passing over us that I could have thrown a baseball at it and hit it.  This event deeply disturbed me for some time after.  It is only until recently that I discovered this website and thought it was necessary that I share my experience.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,42.56675797546012,-83.15395782208589

On that night I wasn't even attempting to signal anything but always studied the skies. Any ways that night I looked up and saw what appeared to be a flashlight type orb similar to someone flashing a light just beaming, so for about 10-12 seconds I looked at it and all I can say is to my eye view  it was about 10-15 yards wide. And after the few seconds elapsed it went from being on to off, and judging by the brightness of the sphere when it shut off so signal like I never forgot about when I was trying to signal them in a similar fashion.

My town was decimated by Hurricane Rita, and several of my closest friends evacuated to a small place called Noack, Texas, to a large house I had rented for us to all stay until our coastal Texas town regained it's footing. It was about 4 weeks after the Hurricane. As evacuees, had little to do, and even less money. I had just washed everyone's clothes by hand in the utility sink, and was hanging them out on a line to dry. Everybody was sitting outside on the patio, relaxing and enjoying the beautiful, crystal clear Fall day. I was facing South, hanging the laundry on the clothesline, when I turned around to go back for another wet load, and I saw something hovering over the house. I stopped in my tracks and tried to focus on whatever it was, because what I was seeing made no sense and it was very close to the house. There was a clean, white rectangular box hovering over the roof. It was hard to tell how big it was or how high it was, because the sky was a dark, pure blue, without any clouds to help determine the depth of field. It looked exactly like a shirt box you would put a dressing robe in to give your dad for Christmas, you know, before you wrapped it. It was a plain, white rectangle. It didn't seem very big, maybe only a couple of feet wide and about three feet long, but like I said, there was no referencing objects near it. It could have been 10 times that for all I could tell. It seemed to float only about 25 or 30 feet above the house, but I couldn't really say. At the most, though I would say it was maybe three or four telephone lengths above the house. It didn't seem very far, like I could yell at it and it would hear me. But I didn't yel! l. I was too confounded by the sight. I could have shot at it with a gun and likely hit it, if I was the kind of person who acts first and thinks later. I called my 4 friends out from under the patio cover to see it. I asked them what they were seeing (not to influence them as to my version of the sight). They all saw exactly what I was seeing, and they noticed it was actually moving very, very slowly.  We watched it for about 20-25 minutes as it crept over the house, across the yard, and over the pasture towards the South. Some of them got bored and went in the house, but I stayed and watched it glide away until I couldn't see it anymore. It never made a single sound. It never lost or gained altitude.  It never turned.  It had no= sound, openings, windows, wings, vapor trail, lights or markings. It just looked like a plain old white shirt box, cruisin' over the house and yard. It continued in a straight trajectory at a painfully slow, almost unobservable rate of speed South toward another unincorporated area a few miles away called Structure, TX. I've never seen anything that unexplainable, that close, or for that long. It defied all logic. I think about that box-thing in the sky all the time, and wonder what would have happened if I had shot at it. Or if we would have gotten in the car and followed it, or what the police would have done if we reported it to the authorities. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It appeared as if one of the larger objects was emitting the smaller objects, which also resembled the same shape.  The objects slowly rotated around each other in a clockwise motion. One of the objects moved farther away from the others into the West of the sky. The movement was not smooth, rather sporadic. Eventually it returned to its orbiting formation with the other crafts.  After roughly forty-five minutes I began to get tired and had smoked nearly a pack of cigarettes watching this scene. One or two of the crafts got too far away to view any longer and I went to sleep. At a family dinner with my aunts, uncles, and cousins I mentioned seeing the lights. They said they saw the same thing and were puzzled by it as well.

I was walking down the side of my land (approx. 5 acres) heading towards a main road. The land is mostly open in this area other than a medium sized white oak about a hundred feet from where I was. In front of me I noticed an object that I will do my best to describe. I would say this object was about four foot tall at the max, it was maybe three and a half wide. The shape best I can describe was something like an old arrowhead.  This object was motionless when I first noticed it however, it was not there when I looked up in that direction a few seconds before. It was black or dark grey in color but it wasn’t a solid object, it was almost like looking through dark window tint, transparent in a way if you will. It also looked like it was two dimensional.  Once I saw this object, I stopped and stared. There was no movement for a couple of seconds but the object seemed to wrinkle and take a textured look quickly. The object then lifted off the ground and projected in a straight vertical line upwards. It went straight up and was gone extremely fast, out of sight in maybe a second tops. Whatever this was kicked up dust from the area when it went up but showed no signs of damage to the grass. It also made no sound at all. There were no lights, disc shape objects or any of that foolishness. It was just there, changed its texture and then shot up out of sight. It was a normal sunny Florida afternoon about 3:30pm.  This was the first of two times I saw this object, the second account was as follows:  The second time I saw this object was a bit more dramatic. It was dusk, if I had to guess it would be about 6:30pm to 7pm. There was enough light outside to see but not like day time. I had walked out of the house onto the car port and towards the parking area where a family member was parked. They and my parents were coming right behind me. When I cleared the edge of the car port, I looked towards the right and saw this object once again. This time it was located under two very large oak trees that are about sixty feet from where we were. Once I realized what I was seeing, I turned to my family to get their attention so they could see it. When I started yelling to get them to look I turned back to point at it and the object seemed to wrinkle again like the first time. Maybe a second later it shot straight up through the oak tree breaking or shearing off up to two and a half inch diameter limbs as it went up and out of sight once again. The others never seen the object howev! er, they did see the aftermath of limbs falling from the event. Looking at the limbs, they were not clean cut but broke off from the object. This is on a very old well built white oak tree. Once again, no lights or sound, nothing that I have ever heard or seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

FOLLOW UP INTERVIEW  - Missouri UFO Sighting Investigation - Marge Padgitt and Bill Hamilton. On November 1, 2007 Mr. John (name on file) reported sighting a UFO over Blue Springs, Missouri on the Missouri Investigations Group website.  His sighting occurred that day at 8:37 am and lasted approximately 4 to 5 seconds.  His sighting took place while he was driving southbound on Adams Dairy Parkway just before crossing the bridge which leads to Duncan Road.  He had turned onto the Parkway at Jellison Road from his home on Pink Hill Road in Independence. Marge and I were contacted to investigate the sighting as we lived close to the witness.  We arranged to interview the witness on Sunday, November 18, 2007 at 1:00 pm.  I arrived first at the witness’s house and met him, his wife, and younger daughter who were watching a football game on television.  John led me to the kitchen to talk.  Before beginning the interview I waited for Marge to arrive which she did within minutes. We proceeded to ask questions of John concerning his sighting while his wife and daughter listened in.  John reported that the object he saw caught his eye because of a metallic-like reflection from the west-facing side of the object.  He thought this was odd as the sun was in the east and the sky was clear and blue.  He later described the object as looking like a derby hat with a flat bottom topped with a dome.  The object did not move, wobble or oscillate, but remained stock still in its position which John estimated to be at about 30 degrees elevation in the southern sky.  The sighting was of short duration so I asked how it finally moved out of view.  John said that it simply disappeared.  One moment there was an object and the next moment it was gone without any apparent movement. Marge asked whether he had a previous sighting of a UFO and John reported that he had only one near Colby, Kansas 17 years prior.   She asked if he had experienced any changes in himself after either sighting, but he said he did not notice any except for difficulty sleeping through the night since this last sighting. We then asked to go to the location of the sighting so we could see the features of the area.  We parked on a side road just before the bridge crossing and all of us (John, his wife, his daughter, Marge, and myself) stood on the corner while John pointed to the location in the southern sky where he had seen the object.  He pointed out the series of lamp posts on the left side of the bridge and said he had gauged the object to be about the apparent size of these lamps but a distance beyond the 4th lamppost so that his impression was that the object was large. We snapped a photo of the sighting area and proceeded to wrap up the investigation at this point. Though John asked us what the object was, I could not give him an answer nor tell him why he was seeing a reflection from the object on a side away from the sun.

I witnessed a bright stationary object next to passing jet travelling in a south west direction at cruise altitude. Clear blue skies were present. I was outside my office and I looked up at a passing commercial jet.  As the jet passed over, it flew by a stationary bright (white in color) object, I could not tell the actual size or altitude of the object. Based on my observation it appeared to be slightly larger than the jet with no wings. It did not have a well defined shape, but it was close to rectangular with lumps on each side. It was sort of blurry with no sharp edges.  I don't think it was the same altitude of the jet because the passing aircraft did not alter course. The object could have been above or below the aircraft. The distance between the jet and object was about the width of a pencil held at arms length. At first glance I thought maybe it was a clump of balloons; however when I took out my cell phone camera to snap a picture and looked back u! p, the object had vanished.  I knew where to look because the aircraft contrail was still present.  I searched for it for another 5 minutes, but could not locate. I wish I had kept my eyes on it.

After wards and upon checking my compass, I saw that the moon was lying West of me, and the asteroid came roughly from the south heading to the north. I observed this asteroid for approximately 25-30 seconds! Much to my amazement, I could see this asteroid quite clearly, and it was clear enough to see additional features on it. The only thing I am really not sure about is the size of this asteroid when it was going pass the moon and when comparing it with the space station that I once saw in my telescope. If I had to estimate the asteroid size, I would not hesitate to guess its size to be at least 4-5 times the size of space station in length but 1-2 times its size in width. This is clearly an endangerment to the world, and personally, a serious enough threat in my opinion to po! ssibly cause an worldwide extinction if it was to collide with earth. I will now explain and go through the sequence of events of what happened that night. I had just come down the road from my mums, and I was going to my own home. It was almost 9.00 pm when I arrived to my house. As I was arriving, I was thinking about getting the telescope prepared for a night's viewing. So I went into my back room on the second floor where the telescope was being stored. The room has a large window that faces towards my back yard of where I live which has very little light pollution in that direction. Anyways, the window is always fully opened ventilating the house and keeping the telescope cooled. I have a Sky watcher 4 inch telescope (a run of the mill) with two eyepieces: a 25mm and a 10mm. Well, the 25mm is the one I used for viewing the moon and the sky, and I centered the telescope on the moon. I took a quick glance at the moon, then exited the room to make a cup of tea to drink,  then I went back to the telescope and casually peeked into the eyepiece. The moon had moved and the telescope was out of alignment for viewing the moon. So I carefully moved the telescope back into position as I was looking through the eyepiece. Then I saw this huge shadows of light,and dark like fingers beginning to appear in the telescope. I was saying to myself, ""Oh! What's that as I raised the telescope higher?"" I quickly centered right onto this asteroid. ""Wow!"" That was my first and immediate reaction this asteroid was tumbling slowly. I don't know how fast this asteroid was going, but it was moving slow enough to allow me to zoom in even more closer to it for viewing. It was Grey in color,and almost like pumice stone in composition, with various pot holes about it while it was tumbling around in a anticlockwise direction. I was mesmerized and captivated by it, I was concentrated on seeing more of  features that was on it. If you allow me to explain in inches hypothetically speaking  could be miles, it was quite oblong in length  if i say inches it could be miles it was 6-7 inches long by 2-3 inches wide, and it was also  quite well rounded as it appeared in the telescope. Then this piece that kept catching my eye was probably about 2 inches down. It would sort of step down, (say half a inch), then along 2 inches (maybe 3 inches), then this piece step back up. in this step down piece. It was almost dusty, and it had some mounds, could be hills!   with a few look-like potholes placed about it. I am able to remember every details of it, so I drew a picture of it afterwards while it was still fresh in my memory. Oh, there is so much to say about this asteroid. Really. Anyways, I was so exited looking at this asteroid tumbling that I accidentally bumped the telescope into the side of my window frame with very much to my dismay. I pulled the telescope towards me to try get another sighting,  and I tried to align the asteroid back into my telescope view, but there was nothing. It was nowhere to be seen. ""Wow"", I said to myself. ""This asteroid was in my sight for about 25-30 seconds and I still cant believe I saw it"". I went through my kitchen to check on the time. The clock is a bit slow, or it could be a bit fast. Anyways, the clock said 25 minutes past 9 pm (gmt time) on the February 12, 2008. I swear this, it is a true event of that night, and I have no reason to lie. I told all the family, my brother's friend, I have told everyone i know  I didn't have a computer with internet access, but now I do.so i can research it , The asteroid is certainly a threat to our well being, and I believe its a cause for concern. ""It was anything else than an asteroid. And no way was it space junk or a satellite"",as my local observatory told me. I said it was definately a rock, and they said it could not have been an asteroid. I'm a stone mason by trade, and this was no boulder you might see in the back garden. No one seems to believe me. I'm telling you it was huge. Please help me. These astronomers  in chile pinged some asteroid on the 12th Feb. I don't know, but this one could have been it. Probably not, but what a coincidence...eh... the 12th here 13th there.maybe they pinged it farther on than the moon i don,t know  Anyways, please help me. I hope this info is of use to you. It was most certainly between our atmosphere and the moon and near earth's atmosphere. I would say it was traveling southerly to northerly on the time that I stated above. Oh, I live in Dalkieth, Scotland. I must have been in the right place at the right time to get it. These pictures I drew of it are going away because if the asteroid ever gets filmed and i have  drawings,  and if ever gets into the news, they may ask, ""How come you drew pictures of it?"" well i will say i warned everyone of it  That's my theory anyways. Although I have little in the way of proof, I know what I saw 100%. Also, I would like to say that I have now emailed a few people about it, and no one seems interested. These big telescopes look deep into space, and the observatory probably missed what is on there own back door. I trust you will give me some addresses, or at least point me in the right direction. I know it happened. There is no dou! bt about that. Are some people trying not to say anything about it because what is the use of putting the public in fear for a near miss? I trust this is not the case, because someone  somewhere must have saw it too. Some  web cam or some video of the night sky somewhere must have filmed it.if its been taped someone somewhere must have it on tape . If they have a tape of that night then it will be on it, if it isnt then it isnt a tape of that night because it should show up 100%.i fell so strongly against people telling me that i could not have saw it because how do they know  stranger thing have been believed  im unsure about the time because my clock is slow i never noticed it till one night when i took a pic of the clock and saw it was prob at least 11 mins slow  against camera time thanks for reading this and watch out if anyone can help you can request my email from the ufo centre.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

While typing an e-mail, I heard the 11 o'clock P.M. weather man remind us to go look at the stunning lunar eclipse.  I went out to the back porch to gaze at the moon, which was about half shadowed in its eclipse.  The night was clear and the moon was over the North/East section of my house.   I grabbed the binoculars off the workbench to get a better view.  As I raised them to my eyes and focused on the moon, I saw a shadow cross my view.  I pulled them away from my eyes thinking an owl must have flown by, since I heard no sound of a plane.  Nothing seen.  I put the binoculars back to my eyes and floating in front of the moon was a giant V shaped object.  Not as sharp as a V but not as curved as a boomerang.  It was slowly moving, more like floating toward the small Thun airfield to the north.  It was barely above the 75 foot evergreen trees on the west and north sides of my 1/4 acre and was directly over my house and barely moving.  The thing was giant.  I would guess 3 football field lengths per wing.  No body, no windows, no vapor trail, no noise at all.  Just a giant V with the faintest of white night lights all along the top of the V, in a straight line.  It was almost see through and nearly invisible to the naked eye.  I had to scan back and forth to see the whole thing until it got farther away. Transfixed I just stood there and watched. Several times I pulled the binoculars away and could only barely see it. I thought about getting the flashlight and flashing it at it but stood there and watched it float away towards the north.

At approximately 1:45 AM, I was desparately trying to get our dog to come back in the house after having just let her out 5 - 10 minutes or so prior to the event.  The reason for trying to get our dog back in the house so quickly - was that she had started to bark at something and I didn't want her barking to disturb our neighbors. So, I went out into our back yard and found our dog just sitting in the snow in the middle of our yard barking at something up in the air.   At first I thought it might be a squirrel, rabbit, or raccoon - which we have seen in our neighborhood on more than once occassion - so I scanned our one main tree in our backyard for sign of one of these animals but didn't see anything despite our dog still barking.  It was then that a huge football-sh! aped object appeared out of nowhere in the southwest sky.  The object was more rounded on the ends (as opposed to coming to a point like a football), and was completely on fire.. it was a large flaming object that suddenly appeared, remained motionless for 10 seconds or so, and then rocketed off in a southwest direction at a speed that was - I would say - impossible.

I go to bed very late do to insomnia.  It was 4:30am and I figured I'd try to get some sleep; upon going to the bedroom I went to the bathroom first.  Something told me to look out that window.  My eyes looked directly under the tree across the street, which I might add, I live in a development.  There I saw hovering about 3-4 feet above the ground which looked to me like sparkly bright orange atoms trying to cling together, shaped in a circular formation. Well, I thought ""hmm"" must me a UFO. I hurried to my window behind my bed to see if I could see it from a different prospective.  After running around like a crazy woman, I decided to go to the front door. This was the morning before the storm and it was quite windy, but some how I missed it getting daylight.  Seems I had missing time; anyway, I looked around and didn't see it, then my eyes were drawn upward, above my neighbors house across the street only this time it was white, and it seemed to be dancing in mid air. It definately knew that I was watching it and I knew it was watching me.  It moved left to right and right to left, upward and inward, then came to a dead stop.  It was about 2-3 houses high and hovered just by the brim of the tree tops.  Then, suddenly, it started to back upward slowly real high like a dot in the sky.  At that point I thought ""Oh, is a plane coming?"" yet there was no sound.  Then I heard a plane, and it passed over in front of it.  After it passed, guess what?  The ufo came slowly back down, right in the same exact spot in front of my house!   By this time it was a few minutes after 6am or 1800, as I ran to try to find my camera, I don't own a camcorder. Franticly, and unfortunately, I couldn't locate it.  (Later that day, I found it in the spot I was looking).   My husband was sleeping on the couch and I tried to wake him up twice, for some unknown reason I couldn't wake him.  Back down the stairs I go. It was glowing from behind it a bluish and amber color and there was a red dot to the right of it.  The neighbors were leaving for work and yet didn't see this!  Then I had the idea to see if I could play with it, because that’s how close it was and I felt a connection with it.  I started bending my body in different directions at the waist, and each time the ufo would move in that direction. The feeling that overwhelmed me was a feeling of love, understanding and peace and just an abundant amount of love to the point tears started rolling down my cheeks. Then I thought, ""Stop playing with my head and show me your craft.""  I heard a hummmmm and then it stopped, and the white ufo came even down closer below the tree line and between the roofs of my neighbors two houses and poooff, out of the white came a boomerang craft ""straight forward"" and ""flipped"" on its side (as if you were making a peace sign with your fingers).  Let me tell you, I remember it happened so quickly, that I gasped!  Then I said ""Thank you, you have a very nice craft now don't hurt yourself."" (lol). I know it sounds crazy, but it’s the gods honest truth. I used 'rule of thumb, to measure' at arms width. Then after standing on its side and me eyeballing it for a good minute or so, like it was showing me its metallic etched craft it flipped back down and went backwards and into a white light again. AMAZING. It backed up, going higher and higher in the SAME spot as it did when the plane passed over, and out of sight. Since that sighting I have seen numerous crafts and strange sightings that would knock your socks off. I'm so glad I finally found a website for Missouri sightings. Additional information: I forgot to mention something that may be of importance to document. After my sighting, my eyes were burning, inside and outside. I spoke of this to my family. That night I took my glasses off and my daughter and law let out a yell, ""Oh my God, your eyes are all pink"" I looked in the mirror and low and behold ALL around my eye lids and corners of eyes looked as if they were sun burned. My girlfriend said that the red light I saw on the craft must have been some sort of laser, and that they gave me a lasor treatment; for the next week after that I was seeing ""Colors"" HUGE blots of burgandy and black while sitting on my patio, everywhere I looked. So, I went to the eye doctor, told him of the incident. He gave me every test available and said that it was unbelievable that there was no change in my right eye which I am legally blind in, usually it disintegrates at a rapid pace. To be honest it felt like I could see better.

My 8-year-old son and I walked my niece back to their house. We were walking back home and talking about going to the back yard to lay down on the trampoline to watch the stars since it was over 61 degrees F...and the sky was clear. As we were walking, I looked towards my house, which is south of my parents house...and I pointed at a bright orange light and said, ""what is that?"". I thought it was a really bright planet or something, but I didn't remember hearing anything about  that...as soon as I had thought that, it disappeared. My son witnessed that as well. As soon as that one had disappeared, another one appeared in the east. Very bright orange-white light. I turned around and told my other niece to run in and tell my parents to come outside and look. I saw it happen in 3 different places about 5 times before I ran inside to grab my camera and drive my car to my parents house. As I got onto their front deck, I saw another one...an! d my brother, Luke, was able to see it just before it faded. He saw another one with me that was a lot dimmer and moved up. My dad, James, came outside and together we saw over 8 occurances in different locations. There were 3-4 times that we saw two lights grouped together. I tried to get a video of the lights, but all it captured was our voices...I will try to find a video editor and see if I can brighten the video. It was very interesting.

I heard the jets getting close to here, where they make there turn and return back to the base. When I first looked out the window in the door, I was looking up trying to see the jets and when I didn’t see the jets then I glanced down and I seen the >   V formation.  It is hard to explain but it just did not fit, it was like a insert, it looked identical to cd discs except no center hole  but the reflection was identical and a perfect V formation. I have heard that there are more sightings when there is a war, now there was no war here but there was unusual air activity. When I seen it over McMichell Rd. I think it was stationary for a while then it started moving slowly to the right and I seen it go behind the trees at my neighbors house across the street, I thought I would continue seeing them but it never came out from behind the trees. It was energy of some kind. I did not take my eyes off of it. It never entered my brain to get a camera, I was just locked on to it. If someone would have put 7 cd discs in a v formation on a long sheet of Plexiglas and was moving it to the right out side my door that is what it looked like. It stood out, it was on top of the view I was seeing but it went behind my neighbors trees across the street. It just did not belong there, do you know what I mean. it was memorizing, I could feel it, or I was like connected to it in a way. I did not count the discs but when I drew them on the computer 7 discs looker closer to what I seen compared to five discs.  One thing for sure it was a perfect even V, but in this direction >  .  It was so different from photos  and videos of UFO's I have seen. I don’t think it carried passengers. It just looked like energy. I always wondered why people took a sighting so serious and went to gatherings. I am hooked now. I will always be searching for what I seen. It only lasted maybe a minute.  There is no way it was of this earth. The object I seen makes all the others I have seen photos of look primitive.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 7 Discs in a V formation, like this.

I offhandedly thought that the lights were stadium lights from a nearby baseball field.   As I approached the lights, I realized not only that there wasn’t a field nearby, but I was encountering something out of a nightmare.  The cluster of three lights was in a triangle formation and belonged to an aircraft that hovered silently over the road.   I watched the aircraft for a few seconds and observed how it was motionless, like no other aircraft that I had ever seen.  I took a different road that didn’t require me to go underneath the aircraft and drove home.  About a month later, I saw the same style of aircraft, again, about two miles from my house.

(For the last 15 years we have seen these same bright orange lights, but only one at a time, and it may go months or years in between sightings.)   It appeared to be around 1000-1500 ft off the ground, and moving at a moderate speed.  We jumped up and ran to the front yard to get a better view.  As it passed by us and was traveling towards the west away from us, we could see the shape of this flying object silhouetted against the western horizon, and it appeared to be not quite round, but a some what, horizontal oval shape and dark gray in color. I am a former, licensed aviation maintenance technician, and understand what it takes to make an airplane or helicopter fly. There were no w! ings, no propellers, no form of propulsion, no sound and no additional lights, there was nothing I could see to show cause for this object to be flying. We had barely gotten over the shock of seeing this bright orange object, and sat down in our chairs again, when we looked and here came another one from the exact same direction traveling what appeared to be the exact same path. Once again we jumped from our chairs and ran to the front yard to see the same type of object silhouetted against the  western sky.

On July 12, 2008,me and two of my friends  from norman, Oklahoma were at lake Texhoma. We were on a deck boat driving to go to a club that was located on the other side of my friends dock. As we started getting closer to the club I realized I didn’t have my ID and we figured they wouldn’t let me in without identification, so we decided we would just drive around and look at the nice house boats that were close to the club. After we were done looking at the boats we decided to go back to my friend’s lake house.  To get to his lake house we had to go underneath a train bridge that went the width of the of the lake. There is a shore that is approximately 200 yards straight in front of us that has a hill that is about 30 feet high. On top of the hill on the shore we saw a white light that kind of looked like a spotlight or a lighthouse light. Our first thought was that the light was coming from the boat patrol, but as we continued to watch the light, the object somehow went from the top of the hill to the water. At this time we know that it wasn’t a spotlight or a lighthouse light, because not only did the object move from the hill to the water but it began to move on the water like it was a boat except it was moving too smoothly for a boat, and the object was making no sound. We couldn’t tell exactly what the light was connected to because the lake was completely dark. As we drifted across the lake in neutral, the object met us at an angle about 50 feet from the no wake zone. That’s when we realized that the object was to big to be a yacht or a boat house. The object was so large that we actually had to look up and down, left and right to see the full length and width of the object.  We started to getting closer to the object when we noticed that we going to wreck into the object if we didn’t turn, so we turned to our right where there was a smaller object approximately 15 feet next to us. The object emitted a green light and sat! stationary as we watched it trying to figure out if it was an! other de ck boat but we couldn’t see anything except the green light and silhouette of what the light was connected to. In the middle of us arguing about what the object was, the green light took off without any noise across the lake going along the train bridge within less than 0:01.5 second leaving a trail from the wake it created when it took off. After we saw the green light disappear we noticed that the larger object had disappeared as well. This event changed my belief in UFOs and other paranormal wonders of the world.  I believe that whatever me and my friends saw was not manmade, and if it was manmade then there is some kind of military weapon or vehicles that unknown to the rest of the world.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,36.5668,-101.9513

We were about halfway to Salem and My wife very calmly said hey look its a UFO.  At first I thought she was kidding because she does not belive in UFO's, but I looked to the left where she was motioning to and I saw a saucer shaped object just down and to the right of the Moon.  It was a big full moon that night, and at first I thought that maybe it was just a cloud that was being illuminated by the moon.  After my eyes focused clearly on it and I got a good look I could tell it was a perfect saucer shape.  It had no lights or anything it seemed to just be sitting there.  There wasn't any detail, just sort of a dark saucer shape with part of it being illuminated by the moon.  As we drove on the moon and the object became obscured from view by the treeline for a few seconds, and when it came back into view it was gone.

We drove around Big Lake, Elk River, and the Princeton areas and ended up coming back home through Orrock through the wildlife refuge on County 9 hooking up with Cty 5 to Big Lake.  When we turned south on Cty 5 a bright light caught my attention to the W moving very fast to the SE at about 40º up from the horizon. The thing peaked my interest in what I thought was a low flying jet was that there were no blinking lights on the outside of the wings or tail. There were also no steady lights on the wings, tail or body of the object, just one VERY bright light. This was also was moving at what I would estimate to be 2x the speed of a normal jet. As it reached true south of our vehicle it seemed to take a slight arching movement towards the ENE. Just as this started, I noticed the light growing dimmer. What was happening was that it was moving higher in the sky.  In about 3 seconds it went from 3-4x as bright as a jet to finally vanishing. Right before it finally vanished there was a bright flash and it was gone. I kept watching the sky for  a few more minutes when there was another flash and the object came back. At this point it was only the brightness of a normal satellite. When the object flew through a grouping of stars I had been watching for reference that were shaped in a triangle, one of the “stars” broke from this constant formation and started following it. During this time I had been trying to get my wife to pull over so we could watch it and possibly turn around and follow it. She had pretty much freaked out and had kept her eyes on the road the whole time and expressed she did not want to see it and was not going to be following it. I have had 2 other sightings before this and have not reported them. I heard Mr. Davenport on Binnall of America today and finally decided that this is the one I remember the most and made the most impact on me.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

It flew toward my car, approaching the passenger side hood.  When it got this close I could see that it was a small white ball.  It looked like a ping pong ball!

I did not see where it went. I went home and told my 14 year-old son about it.  I told him it reminded me of the Quidditch ball in the Harry Potter movies.

CITY: OSLO, NORWAY   Late October 2008  Me and my x girlfriend were sitting in the living room and it was  late. It was silent in the room and we intended to go to bed. Suddenly the Television turnes one by itself and it became ""sandstorm"" on the screen. The room was filled with strange electronic sounds and with others sounds. The reverb told me that it came from a huge hall, like hundred soccer fields! I could hear it was that big, because some strange sounds came from as it was on the ""floor"" and the sounds where like when spit is released in the mouth!! I have heard those electronic sounds once before, and it was on a radio program that clamed it was the way the stomach sound when it has got food and work with the food.!!  The sounds where extremely loud, but also extremely clear, with an amazing sound quality.. I can tell because I have been working with music and sound studios. The sounds came from everywhere and not the best surround system in the world could make a surround like that. And the stereo in the living room could NEVER have made such a sound. Beside it had grounding problems so I would have heard the humming. BUT: Somewhere higher up in this huge room we then heard a voice. (male I guess) It sounded very demanding, and it spoke very slowly. But who can tell how many bits it came from the sinking and rising voice pr. Second?! The voice were very deep, and I can not explain, BUT the voice could never come from a human being!!  If I would guess it was a large entity , more than 7 foot tall !!  I would have kept it for my self, if I had been alone. I would have sayd that it was something in my brain, and nothing real. But two persons heard the same, and two persons can`t have the same hallucination!!  These ten seconds is for me my second  ""meeting"" with UFOs and ETs.  In my childhood my mother and father and five children saw five UFOs. It became headlines in local news, because other people had seen them as well, and UFO Norway took reports.  When they disappeared the speed was outstanding, and that’s an understatement! This was around the mid 60s.  I now know that they were hanging over a certain mountain, because they were scrutinizing the NATO northern flanks radar facility in North Cape. I have heard that they are very interested in radars.

While I was lighting it I looked up and saw a dark area with an immensely large orange light towards its rear. I thought ""wow, that plane has HUGE lights"" and continued my smoking. While I watched it slowly move eastward (my porch faces south) something didn't seem quite right as the orange glow was Way too large and a plane would have not taken that long to travel such a short distance as it had. If I had to guess general location, I would say coming from the west, south of Bremerton but north of Tacoma in a straight path eastward. So I went inside, told my husband that something just isn't right with this thing I've been watching, it looks like its on fire, and pulled out the binoculars. As I focused in for a closer look, my husband came out to see what i was talking about. The plane/dark object indeed seemed to have the entire tail end of it encased in an orange flaming mass (round mass, mind you.. there were no tendrils or trails.. more like liquid fire contained in a glass ball). I handed the binoculars to my husband who took a long look as well. I thought maybe I should call the airport, then thought that they would probably have a dead-on view of it anyway. We sat and watched it continue eastward .. it seemed to slow and then just 'hang' in the sky for about 10 seconds before heading straight south.  It did not turn south, it ended its eastward movement and began its southward movement (the phrase 'turn on a dime' comes to mind). If I held my arms out in front of me with one finger at the point where I first notice this object and the other where the eastward movement terminated.. it measures a measly 15-16 inches between. Thus far it has been a good 20 minutes. The southward movement was faster than the eastward. It seemed it would pass directly over Tacoma, the bright ball getting somewhat smaller as it went. When it looked as though it was flying over the Centralia/Chehalis area, the fire went out but I could barely make out a dark grey/black dot which seemed to descend rapidly for a second before I couldn't see it anymore. I don't know if anyone else saw this... but I'm sure someone had to have seen it.

Time of Day: 1:30 AM to within about 30 minutes either way. Date: Don’t recall exactly. I will say mid-March 2009, but I could be off a month either way. It was mid to late winter or early spring of 2009. My location: Intersection of 108th AVE NE and NE 12th Place at the north edge of McCormick Park on the west side of 108th AVE NE in Bellevue, WA. NE 12th Place is a small dead end side street and not to be confused with NE 12th Street, which is immediately to the south. NE 12th Street is the boundary between urban downtown Bellevue to the south and the suburban/residential area to the north. McCormick Park is a very narrow park that runs on the north side of NE 12th Street between 106th Place NE and 112th Street NE. Weather: Very overcast. No wind. Dark, except for street lighting. Duration of observation: 40 to 45 seconds?   Circumstances/description:  I was walking my dog at about 1:30 in the morning. I had just crossed NE 12th Street on the west side of 108th AVE NE and had reached the north boundary of McCormick Park which abuts NE 12th Place.  I was about to turn west into the park when I looked north up 108th AVE NE and saw two steady (not flashing or strobing) bright white lights about 50 to 60 feet off the ground. These lights were about street width apart (I will say 20 feet -- 108th AVE NE is one lane in each direction there). They were apparently rigidly connected and moving right down the street in my direction. I will put their speed at 20 to 30 miles per hour, 35 tops. I sort of partially hid myself behind a tree next to the street and watched the lights come right down the street toward me (again about 50 to 60 feet up). There was absolutely no visible structure there of any kind, even though I was really squinting and trying to make something out. The lights were all I could see.  Furthermore, there was no sound of any kind. When the lights got to about 200 feet up the street, they started to turn to their left (my right). I figure they got within about 150 feet distance of me or less at closest approach – and I still could see nothing but the lights (although they did get dimmer as they started to turn and especially as they started to move away to the northeast). Only at the very closest approach did I hear any kind of sound at all, but I am not sure the sound was coming from what I was looking at. The location I was at is about a half a mile from I-405 and the traffic noise from that distance can be much louder than what I was hearing! at that point. It sounded possibly something like the engine of an ultralight, but exceedingly quiet. As the lights turned they briefly moved to the east perpendicular to 108th AVE NE and finally headed away to the northeast. At some point during this slow-speed maneuver, I did for a fraction of a second get the impression of a dim red light such as you might see in a dark room illuminating part of some possible structure, but it was much to fleeting to make out what I was seeing. Unusual features of object:   1)  Silent or virtually silent. 2)  Invisible, except for two bright white steady lights. 3)  Moved so slowly a conventional aircraft would have stalled.  It could have been a helicopter except for the first two items. I considered, an ultralight, but even an ultralight should have been much louder at closest approach, and even an ultralight would have stalled at that speed – and an invisible ultralight with bright lights 20 feet apart – not a chance. I even had a novel theory that I was seeing something tethered beneath a helicopter flying at a much higher altitude, which I did not see because I was preoccupied with what I was seeing in front of me.  My guess: my guess is that I was seeing (er – not seeing) some type of unmanned surveillance aircraft. I am thinking that if a craft did not have to take the weight of a pilot that it would be possible to construct something that would not stall at that speed. Also, there might not be much of a profile to see. There is still the issue that it was VERY quiet, whatever it was, and I still don’t understand why I couldn’t see any type of structure at all.  Note: there was one other person in the immediate vicinity who MIGHT also have seen this. Without going into details, he may have had even a much better view than I did, but I do not know who he is, and have no way of contacting him.

I was working as a police officer for the City of Portland, OR on March 30, 2009. PPB officers usually ride alone in patrol cars but it was the week of Spring Break and night-shift officers, like myself, were asked to pair up to enforce city curfew ordinances that night. At approximately 21:10 hours, my partner and I were dispatched to cover another officer who was responding to the report of a domestic disturbance. The problem address was located either three or four houses north from the intersection of N Moore Ave/N Jarrett St. Portland, OR 97217 (Latitude: 45.565156, Longitude: -122.667971). After we were done assisting the primary officer on that call (~23:30), we remained outside our cars to discuss the night’s events to that point. As we were talking, I glanced to the southwest and noticed two gleaming lights, flying in formation, moving in an east-southeasterly direction. I pointed out the lights to my partner and we walked south 15 or so yards to the NW corner of the intersection. We stood there and continued to watch the lights. The two lights were visible against thick, high clouds. It was not raining, there was no noticeable wind, and no stars were visible. The lights were a pale streetlight-amber, the lights shown steadily, and about were approximately three to four times the diameter of the brightest/largest star I have ever seen in the night sky. The height of the clouds helped me estimate the sources of the lights were no larger than a small shuttle bus. There were no aircraft navigation strobes or safety beacons visible on or near the two light sources. My partner and I both commented we could not hear any sound coming from the lights. The two objects were moving at a speed I judged to be slower than a typical propeller aircraft could travel. We assumed if the light sources were helicopters we were close enough to hear the blades of their rotors and see additional lights on the aircraft. Aircraft was audible in the distance to the northeast. Portland International Airport is only a few miles from that area. However, it struck me as odd that the lights were flying eastbound since almost all air traffic approaches the airport from the south or east. My partner is a captain in the Army National Guard and is familiar with military aircraft. He had no idea what we were watching. The two lights were flying in a loose formation, at the same altitude but one slightly ahead of the other. The northernmost light was leading. The lights’ relative proximity to one another was also out of the ordinary. I estimated the source of each light was approximately 25’ in diameter. With those dimensions, I would guess the distance between the two lights was 150-250 yards. It is very unusual to see aircraft flying that near to one another over the city. The lights began to turn toward the south in a lazy arc. The leading light took a wider turn than the other. As they did so, we were surprised to see another pair of lights following the first pair. The second pair of lights was at the same altitude, moving at the same speed, and flying in the same general formation as the first pair. The distance between the two pairs of lights was hard to estimate but I would guess there was a half-mile or so between the two pairs of lights. My partner had received orders he was deploying to Iraq in a few weeks and had bought a video camera in preparation for his departure. He had brought the camcorder to work that night, and he ran back to our patrol car to retrieve it. He returned and began filming the lights as the first two lights began to disappear out of view behind some tall trees. The second pair of lights followed the same course and began to make the same turn to the south when something odd began to happen. The southern light of the second pair slowed noticeably and began to flicker. The random tempo and change in luminosity of the flickering reminded me of a lit candle in a slight breeze. The flickering had been going on for about eight seconds or so when we both saw something begin to “drip,” multiple times, from the bottom of the object. The molten substance was the same color as the light and it dimmed then sputtered out as it fell from its source. The speed at which the incandescent substance fell from light indicated to me it had significant mass. For example, a drip fell at a greater rate than that of a fizzling firework ember. My eyes traveled downward in-line with some of the drips. I saw the material reignite briefly although it was significantly dimmer. Overall, I estimated it would have taken the material ten seconds to fall to the ground. That intuitive estimate of altitude helped me get a bearing on how far away the lights were from us. I suppose the nearest light passed within 15-25 blocks south of our location. My partner stated military aircraft are forbidden to drop flares over populated areas in order to prevent fires. No unexplainable fires were reported in that neighborhood that evening. The flickering light eventually stabilized and began glowing steadily again as it continued moving to the south-southeast. I estimate we watched the lights for the better part of two minutes. The non-flickering lights did not move toward or away from the flickering light.  That led me to think the flicking light was not in distress. I did not get the opportunity to view the footage my partner filmed. He promised me he would get me a copy of the raw video but failed to do so before being shipped out to the Middle East. I imagine it looks like all the other night UFO videos in that it depicts a strange light with a black background. I do not know if he caught the flickering and dripping on video. I have never seen anything else in my life that I would call a UFO.  My partner and I discussed what we had seen for the rest of the evening and were unable to come up with a plausible explanation for what we had witnessed.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

I believe at the time the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range was directly south of us. We saw one pulsating light, I think it was orange, for a few minuets. Then other lights popped out of nowhere. They were fairly far away.  They did unnatural formations around each other. They weren’t fixed in place. Occasionally they would disappear, and then the main one would come back and pulsate for a little while. One of their formations seemed to be the stair stepping formation. Sometimes they would pulsate while they where flying. It was obvious that they weren’t fixed in place as sometimes they would fly fully lit in formations. Their altitude varied in height constantly, which was what was so unnatural about it. They were probably no more than 30,000 feet. They would fly as if gravity didn’t matter. They were directly south of us almost the entire time, almost as if they were going along with us. As we got further west, we thought they were done but eventually the one pulsating light came back again. It stayed until we drove further west and finally seemed to not be going along with us.  I know I wasn't the only one to see this as there were many others driving that night. My biggest regret is not stopping to get my camera out of the trunk!",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

I noticed what I thought was one small cloud moving faster then the others, that is what first caught my eye.  Then I realize it was not a cloud but rather a dark triangular object moving silently through the clouds.  The object flew in a straight line and I did notice 4 large lights underneath, the lights did not flash or blink and they had a strange color to them.  The color was like an aluminum flashlight beam.  I yelled at my wife and her brother to look but the triangular object was too hard to see, they looked further on and saw an airplane in the distance.

On the night in question, I was hiking on the Gainesville-Hawthorne Trail, a greenway that runs south of Gainesville east towards Hawthorne. I don't remember the exact date or time unfortunately at this point, but I do remember the sighting occured at the tail end of dusk, when stars were beginning to pop into the sky. As I was climbing a hill on the trail, I looked up to see some of the stars and planets coming out. This was almost directly east, as the trail in that section runs that way. As I glanced at some directly in front of me and straight down the trail, I noticed what appeared to be an explosion in the sky, in my peripheral vision, about 10-20 degrees to my right. The moon was in the sky, I think about 3/4 full, and it was a further ten or so degrees to the right. The object I saw was about a quarter of the moons diameter, I would reckon. The object, or the explosion, seemed to grow, or shift, at first, but then held a circular shape for about 5-10! seconds. After this time, ""wings"" seemed to grow or appear out of the top and bottom, again seemingly on fire, with many colors and stange flashes continuing within the ""fire."" The wings formed with the original ball a crescent shape. If I had to guess its size, based on the distance I think it was from me, I would say 300-500 feet in length, from wing tip to wing tip. I don't quite remember exactly how the explosion/object/craft disappeared, just that it seemed to quite quickly. This particular object I saw in the sky for about twenty seconds in totality.  After the above object disappeared, I saw a second event about one or two seconds after, and about three degrees to the left in the sky. Two lights, which seemed to be obvious jets of human design, were flying quite fast in what I would consider to be combat manuevers. Working seemingly in concert they both were performing roll after roll, never stopping turning, and seemingly at full speed. The distance from me to them was great enough that I could not hear them, but despite the many turns, they were moving left across my vision, that is north, at a good clip. As I watched them in wonder, for as I said I noticed them first directly after and adjacent to the strange object above, I noticed a much smaller light, so small I didn't see it at first. This light appeared to be a tiny craft, and it was flying in between the two jets, seemingly dodging or fighting with them. For all intents and purposes, it appeared what I was watching was a battle. This battle continued and ran, as! I said above, left and north across my vision. I was only halfway up a hill while watching all this, and the craft, all three of them, slipped behind some trees. I ran the rest of the way up the hill to try to see the encounter, but I never saw anything strange again that night, or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

She pointed out a tiny light quite a distance off, and after watching it for a minute or two and seeing it was moving too slowly for a plane, I began taping it on my cell. The phone didn’t have a very good camera, and couldn’t zoom in enough to record the light, but it caught what was going on. Then another light appeared, and my mom cut the truck off and called my dad. Both lights were moving directly toward each other, and when they crossed paths, they seemed to twitch and spin around one another and then fade out. That was about when I couldn’t record anymore because my annoying little phone ran out of storage space. Before long, another light appeared, and then another, from different directions than the first two, (by now my dad was outside with us in his underwear muttering about how they were just planes) and they did the exact same thing as the first: meeting up, spinning around each other, and fading out not long after. By definition, they were UFOs. Past that I don’t know what they were. But planes fly over our house pretty frequently, and they don’t spin around each other or fade out. These lights were white at first, but would change briefly to red or orange, like a star. They were far away and high up, I can’t say how far though. Both my parents were skeptical- my dad’s not a big believer in UFO’s and such, and my mom basically doesn’t care.

I was sleeping in because it was dead day, Friday May 8, which is always study day the Friday before finals.  I was woken up by tornado sirens and a really terrible thunderstorm at 9am.  The power was also out.  We get really bad thunderstorms but this one took the cake.  From www.weather.com/newscenter/stormwatch/:  ""MCV becomes - Inland Hurricane:  May 8, 2009 brought a derecho, a widespread windstorm associated with a bow echo thunderstorm complex, along a 600-mile-long, 60-mile wide swath across southeast KS, south MO, and south IL. Many of the damaging winds were not with the leading line of severe thunderstorm, but rather behind it and beneath a mid-level rotation center called an MCV - mesoscale convective vortex. Winds gusted to 106 mph. At least 220,000 customers lost power in MO and IL. The system spawned more than 30 tornadoes, at 20 of them in southwest MO. EF3 tornadoes hit Howell County MO and Garrard County KY.""  This storm was crazy.  It was pounding my off campus apartment.  I could hear pieces of metal siding being ripped off the building.  It was the weirdest thing...the winds were blowing straight at the building, driving the rain around the edges of the sliding glass door and spraying my living room with water.  I was freaking out.  It was very intense, and I was frantically trying to figure out how to keep the water out.  The winds began to calm down a bit, and I was running around my apartment trying to find the memory card to my camera.  I'm a sort of an amateur meteorologist and love taking storm photos.  I'm a photography and graphic design major, and I have a Canon 40d with a number of lenses, including a solid zoom 100-400mm L.  However, I couldn't find my 16gb memory card and nearly ripped my apartment apart trying to find it.  I couldn't even find my backup 4gb card, which was odd, because its always in my bag.  After several minutes of frantic searching, I stopped for some reason, in my living room, turned to my right, and out the back sliding glass door window was the weirdest sight.  It was like an orb shaped thing, combined with a fireball, perhaps a few miles in the distance hovering beyond the middle school behind my apartment.  It was really weird because it seemed to be wiggly...like it had waves coming off of it that were vibrating.  It was bright white, and the edges seemed to be yellowish orange.  The first thing I thought was that something exploded in mid air, and this is where my memory is a little fuzzy because I'm reporting this many months later (which I'll explain soon).  I'm pretty sure that another one appeared on the sides of it, which made me think it was an aircraft.  Sometimes aircraft fly under thunderstorms to avoid the dangerous updrafts.  But the way the lights radiated was just too weird.  Then they each disappeared, one by one, quickly.  What ticked me ! off the most was that even though I had my camera around my neck, I couldn't take a photo!  Gaaahh!  Ridiculous.  So I grab my iPhone, text my fiance and roommate to tell them what happened, and then looked up Springfield's airport website to find arrival / departure times.  There were no planes landing near the time that I saw the lights, and Springfield, being a small town of 150k, it doesn't get many large aircraft landing during the day.  Also the lights didn't seem to be moving in any direction, and if they were coming head on, that wouldn't make any sense either, because the airport is on the NE fringe of town and I was right in the middle of town, and even though its a small town, its spread out over 88 square miles because they don't know how to build up in these small towns.  The other explanation would be ball lightning, which hasn't been scientifically proven to exist, but has been observed by many people in the past.  So here is some background info on why I'm posting this so far after the fact: tonight I was watching UFO Hunters on the History channel and they showed these orbs on there that have been occuring in the Ozarks around Springfield this year and some of the video and artist's renditions looked a lot like what I saw and it freaked me out.  I didn't get the same feeling of dread when I saw it that other people have reported, but I did feel like I was frozen and couldn't move.  It was pretty wild.  They also reported about a light on the north side of town, and I also believe I have seen this light before when driving back in forth to Bolivar, MO to see my friends at SBU.  It just seems too bright and out of place for that area of the sky and I only notice it sometimes.  I feel like I have a fairly solid grasp of astronomy, having taken a college course where we had to learn about heavenly objects and went out to Baker Observatory (which ironically is near Marshfield, where on UF! O hunters a highway patrolman reported an orb following him) on several occasions to observe the night sky.  My dad was also an amateur astronomer when I was younger and we would go outside and look at the stars frequently.  I'm also not a crazy UFO person, but a fairly rational college student.  However, I feel like I have some sort of odd connection with UFOs.  When I was in elementary school I would have horrible horrible night terrors of being abducted by aliens and when I was in 10th grade, I had another encounter I'd like to share.  Feel free to remove this for the reporting post but I want to submit it along with this for completeness:  My best friend and I were driving home late on a Thursday night from the movies near midnight, which was my curfew in 10th grade.  My best friend is very smart, an Eagle Scout and a member of the Stretch program at school for highly intelligent students.  We were both in advanced placement programs for math and literature.   Since it was so long ago (2001-2002?) I can't remember the date at all. We were waiting at a red light at 7hwy and 40hwy in Blue Springs, MO, a suburb of Kansas City.  We saw three orb lights, in a triangle formation, float over the HyVee grocery store, turn while crossing 40hwy, and then float over the WalMart.  Then they suddenly zoomed off at incredibly high speed in the direction of my house.  The way they moved made us feel like they were attached.  Both of us saw the lights and were a bit freaked out.  That's when things started to get really crazy.  As we continued down 40 hwy and the other two roads [road names REDACTED, since it's near my parent! s house], nearly every single street light we passed by suddenly went out.  It was making us very scared, especially since we were in a convertible.  My friend pulled into the circle drive I lived on, and dropped me off at the bottom of the driveway.  Before getting out, I noted that it was 11:55pm, before curfew, since I was worried about getting back in time.  When I got inside, my dad half-joked that I was late (it wasn't a serious violation) and I said ""What are you talking about?""  I looked at the time and it was 12:05am.  I was so confused.  How did it take me 10 minutes to walk inside?  I went straight inside.  So I talked to my friend the next day and he told me something pretty interesting (and scary).  Apparently when he was at the stop sign to leave my circle drive, he saw a bright flash in his rear view mirror.  He turns around, and he said he couldn't see me anywhere.  He then drove away quickly, which at the time ticked me off that he just left me like that.  ! That about freaked the hell out of me.  I've only told these stories to a few people, but figured that I might as well come forward now.  I bet there are a lot of normal people out there, like me, who would never google UFO reports and actually type up something like this and send it in because they would think that they must be crazy.  But I am starting to think that there is something to this whole UFO thing and that if I didn't share this, then I wouldn't be helping anyone figure out what's going on.  I also got my accurate times for the first report from the messaging app on my iPhone.  I sent the text to my fiance right after the event (and I also sent her one right after I awoke to tornado sirens, she lived in the Kansas City area at the time) and it was logged in the app.  Honestly, I have no idea what's going on, but its starting to freak me out a bit that stuff that I've seen is showing up on TV in the town I live in when I thought that there must be a rational explanation.  I just can't get my mind aroun! d the idea that there are aliens flying around the earth.  It just doesn't seem possible.  I just thought that was something to be scared of as a child, like monsters or the boogie man.  If it's proven that aliens are real, then it's going to be really hard for me to deal with that.  It just doesn't make sense!  Why would they even appear like this or take people?  What is the motive?  Are they bored?  Why not just come down and show themselves?  Are they just having fun with us?  It is so weird that other people have seen something similar to what I saw.  It is even more weird that there have been enough people seeing things that a UFO tv show came to this town to interview people.  I wish they would go away because now I'm fearful of their presence and my possible connection to them.  Also my mom told me a couple years ago that my grandpa used to see ufos, strage lights, and would awake in the middle of the night, at the window, sleepwalking, talking to them outside the w! indow.  My mom saw a ufo with them when she was younger, hover! ing over a car in a parking lot late one night.  That was probably sometime in the late 70s early 80s.  Is there something about my family that attracts them?  Or is it a coincidence?  Sorry for the rambling, I've got a huge project due in the morning and it's getting late!  Time to get back to work...feel free to edit this to make it more cohesive for online consumption.  Thanks for your time.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,37.19880653950953,-93.30922288828337

A perfectly round, red, orb. It looked to be the size of a volleyball or a basketball so I imagine it must have been slightly larger than that given optical illusion distance creates; it just sat PERFECTLY STILL hovering there, smack dab in the middle of the road, less than 50 feet off the ground. It didn’t move or bounce or rotate. It didn’t ascend or descend at all– as you would expect of a balloon. Just sat there. Couldn’t take my eyes off of it. It was just south of Lakewood on the parkway southbound– probably about 11 AM. Someone had pulled over to watch. Wish I could have done the same. I was dumbfounded. I remember thinking to myself, “What the hell is that” as I approached. I tried to rationalize it away– that it must have been one of the red cushions from an electrical wire– but then I don’t know if those float. I assume that, had one of those broken loose, it would fall to the ground. And even then, if it was filled with some lightweight gas to support the weight of electric lines, I would expect it to be blown about by the currents of wind created by passing traffic. It didn’t ascend or descend. It was not attached to an electrical line. It just sat there. It was a very strange experience: its existence was telling me two contradictory things: “Here I am, look at me,” but also “You’re not supposed to see me, I’m supposed to look like something you don’t notice.”  It was almost like I wasn’t supposed to notice it was there, but yet, there it was in BROAD DAYLIGHT, just sitting there seemingly watching traffic. Very strange. It was very wierd. Here were all these other people driving down the parkway, and only myself and one other person seemed to notice it at all. How? Why?  It’s not the first time.

I then saw three more in a formation behind these two.  I stopped the car on arriving home and saw  2 of them disappear behind the trees at which point I realised they were travelling quite fast.  The total length of the sighting was 30 seconds at least. I could not determine how close they were away, but judging from the speed, they appeared to be at a fairly low elevation.  What struck me was the dull glowing orange colour.  No sound was heard. The background sky was totally dark (no moonlight obvious) with no stars visible in the field of view.

I was watching my Television and I noticed something in the trees.  I looked through my big glass window that looks onto the back of the apartment building. I saw three aliens or some kind of beings in my trees.  At least I thought they were in the trees. The tree line is about 10 feet my window.  They were about 4  feet off the ground. I was scared to death, I could not move, I just froze with fear.  There were three of them. They were sitting side by side. At least I think they were sitting, hard to tell because they were translucent. I could see right through them, seeing the leaves move behind them.  Like in the movie “Predator” they were kind of see through but the outline of them was visible. They were on a platform.  They had very long arms and the width of their bodies were about 6.  Their height was maybe 1 foot, hard to tell since I was not sure if they were sitting or standing.  This was about 10.am around the first week of July, of 2009 in Milwaukee Wisconsin.  I am in an apartment complex that is two stories’ high and 10 apartments wide.  Mostly very nice Mexican people live here.  I am from Georgia.  I mention that in case this becomes significant since there are so many sightings of  UFO’s in Mexico. In no way were these Grays aliens that people talk about.  The face was cone shaped. I could not really make out eyes or any features.  Obviously they were cloaked or thought they were invisible, I do not know.  They stared at me the whole time, never looking around, just right at me for about 4 minutes.   Finally I got the nerve to stand up slowly and make my way to the front door. I knew the window was open; I wanted to close it because I was afraid they would come in and abduct me. Or do experiments as we hear about what happens to people.  As I had my back to them for only a second, I turned to look back but they had gone. I then went too quickly to my neighbor’s apartment. She asked me if I had seen a ghost. I said just something very weird. I would not tell her for being afraid of her thinking I was crazy. I was so afraid I told no body. Not even my boyfriend who was out of town for the next two weeks. I was there alone. I want to let you know. I am a 48 year old woman from Georgia. I do not do drugs, I do drink a beer here and there but I had not had any beer for about a week. I have never hallucinated or imagined anything in my whole life. I am not on any prescription drugs and have never been on them. I was really seeing this and wish I had never had. So when Mark came home from working in Canada I did not tell him even though I was still scared. A couple mornings after he was home he woke me to ask if I have ever seen anything weird out the back window.  I said yes, why are you asking me? He was scared, I could tell as he started to tell me that he saw three beings out the back window in the trees that he could see through. It was about 5:30 as we slept in the living room all night since it is cooler then than our bedroom. We have had placed our mattress on the floor near the front door. He said there were three of them side by side with cone faces, long arms and almost he could make out! eyes or holes where there would be eyes. He described them exactly as I had seen them and also they were on a platform. He said the platform was a milky color but still translucent. He could see the outline and see the leaves right through them. He said their heads were moving up and down, to the right to the left looking at the back of out apartment building. He was sure they did not see him since he was so far from the window near the front door on the mattress which is on the floor. When I am in my recliner I am only about 4 feet from the window. He said they were there for about 4 minutes also then they disappeared. When I asked him to point right where he saw them, it was interesting because they were on the right side of our window but when I saw them they were on the left side. Remember now both times were in the morning and same description. He said they were doing something with their hands, maybe working controls? I don’t know, I am just scared out of my mind the! y will come back again. I was happy I could share this bizarre! happeni ng in out lives. So about two days after Mark had seen them I was in my recliner watching Television. It was around 9 a.m in the morning. I saw movement in the trees again and this time there was only one of the beings. I saw him for about only about 1 minute or minute and a half or so. This time he was in the middle of the window about the same height in the trees. His cone shaped face and long hanging arms, looking right at me. I was very scared and had a look of fear on my face. Mark was in the room and when he saw my face he saw I was scared but when he turned his head to look it disappeared. Now I have been analyzing this highly unusual event. I am scared all time. I am in fear they will take mark or myself to where to do what? Why appear behind an old run down apartment building in virtually the same place area in the trees? This has reoccurred three times in the morning hours. From about a minute and a half to about 4 minutes they stay to study mark or I? To take readings of the Earth, say maybe they are measuring the Earths magnetic field, gasses in atmosphere? Are they planning an attack on mankind? Do they want to become our friends? Learn our language? Are they just as curious about us as we are of them? Do they want to reproduce with our species? Do they want to use us as food? So many things run through our heads, WHY WHY HERE? Why not appear at the White House, a museum, a school, a park or in a science laboratory? Why behind an old apartment building at OUR WINDOW? Are the other people in the apartments seeing them also? I am not ready to ask around. I want to move out of here as quickly as I can but for financial reasons I don’t see that happening anytime soon. Maybe they will never appear again and my nerves can calm down. 	My girlfriend Mary is vey excited about this. She wants to see them very badly so she can take photos or video tape them to show the world. She says this is very important for the world to see that beings are showing up here repeatedly. She says they probably are not from another world but from another dimension. That maybe their laboratory in their dimension is situated right there at all times but the veil from our dimensions are opening up. They are not really in the trees at all but in their time and a different dimension. They could be opening and closing them. They are showing up as almost invisible, is that because they are scared that we will shoot them? They know enough that this is a common reaction among humans, Shoot first ask questions later. Do they even know we see them at all? Mary says we can roll up a ball of yarn with a long string on the end. When they appear throw it at them, it might go into their place and we might see just a string hanging in mid air! when they closed the veil. The yarn will not show harmful intent because we could put a note on it saying :Become our friends, Talk to us, we know your there. We could put a little present inside the ball of yarn. She wants to bring in a high tech video camera, digital camera, regular camera, infrared camera, aura camera and a meter she has that can pick up very low frequencies that turns it into voice.

I was on vacation in Santa fe NM.  My friend has a house with a hilltop behind it.  Almost every night for a week we would go to the hill top to star watch.  On one of our first nights my friend, whom I traveled with and I witnessed two fast moving steady lights that seemed very very far up..much higher then any plane.  There was a local airport and planes went in and out of the area - but you could hear the engines and see their blinking lights - this was nothing like that - they were gliding silent and moving at a very fast rate very high up in the night sky. On a succession of nights we had a camera with us and started out just taking pictures of us and then up at the night sky to capture the stars.  The first few nights we took pictures with the flash and got some strange objects.  Orb like orange and blue oval shapes and some other glowing objects - which at first seemed like we had maybe caught some 'alien objects' and we were excited .. but then being the skeptic I dismissed as dust, beetles or dragon flies caught in the flash. Some if you zoom in clearly appear like they could be bugs..others ?? Not sure what they are. Any way, one of those nights when we where showing the pictures we had just taken to our friend who owns the home - we had gone back inside - and had our back to the window that faced the hill - but he was facing the window - He yelled and jumped up because he saw a bright beam of light come down behind the hill.  He's lived there for years and has seen plenty of shooting stars and meteor showers..this he said was nothing like that.  we were too scared to go out and look - though he wanted to.  We did searched around the next morning around the hill but saw nothing. On the final night of our visit it  - was a clear night with lots of visible stars,  my friend and I had gone up to the hill and I said 'ok let me prove my bugs in flash theory - look I'm going to take pictures with out the flash and show you that there really isn't anything out there..'  So I took a series of pictures pointing up into the sky with out the flash.  Then I decided to run some video clips from camera again with out flash. I held the camera to the sky and let it run. Even though my eyes could see the stars the camera's screen really wasn't strong enough to pick up the light of the distant stars except for one very faintly. As the first clip was about to end and I was getting ready to leave the hill a very bright light zigged zagged up from the far bottom corner of my view - seemingly from nowhere. (I almost felt like the object knew I was leaving and wanted to 'show itself'.) The clip ended so I started a second clip and held my camera on the bright object that ! was now very visible on my camera screen and seemed to just hang in the sky - it was a pulsating light.  I panned a little to the right because my eye caught other movement and a much brighter second light moving towards the first light and a third less bright and smaller light also came come into view. My friend had gone down the hill and was calling me to come down.  I was now up there alone and a little freaked - so when the clipped ended - I left the hill. Aside from lots of orb like shots and the video clips we also captured on camera a strange white triangle object in the sky when we were taking a sunset picture.  We didn't see it with our eyes.  But it appears on the shot.  Many of the friends we met who live there - say these lights in the sky are common events and I would have to believe it based on the week I spent there - you need only look up..",2009-12-12T00:00:00,35.661082683982684,-105.95390714285715

I purchased a bike in Reno on Monday 7/27/09, and was driving back to St. Louis on I-80 on Monday night.  I had just crossed over the Utah border and saw the Bonneville Salt Flats exit sign on I-80.  The wind was blowing about 30 knots, which caused my bike to lean as I drove at about 80 miles per hour.  It was dark, very few if any clouds, dry and the conditions were nominal except for the tremendous wind from the north blowing southward.   I was also wearing a helmet, full face. I was looking up at all the stars and the blinking lights of many airplanes traversing the sky as I drove towards Salt Lake City to find a hotel room for the night.  As I was driving, I was thinking, this is the area where there are many UFO sightings.  About then, a white light then appeared to my right (S-SE) at very high altitude at about my 40 degree position.  I estimate the altitude and distance to be 15,000 feet at 10 to 15 miles out.  Why?   Because it was about halfway from horizon to where the strobes of airplanes were flashing; therefore, 10 to 15 thousands feet. When it shown its single light, it appeared to be a plane with a running light, breaking through the clouds--in other words, it had a halo-like effect. I dismissed this as a plane, even though there were very few clouds directly above me; however, at that distance there could have been more clouds in its position, obviously. As I drove, the ultra bright white light descended and was moving towards me. About 1 to 2 minutes later, the light appeared again, altitude this time much lower and much closer than before, maybe 8 to 10 miles from my starboard, same position. This repeatedly happened about every 2 minutes, the light would power up, shine in my direction, then it slowly turn off, as if were a river barge light powering off. It didn't just switch off, it phased down. I kept looking in my rearview mirror thinking that the light should eventually cross the road behind me since it was on a 90 degree angle to me and heading in my same direction. At some point, I should have traveled east of it's trajectory towards Salt Lake City moving past it’s heading to the north since we were on a perpendicular intersect, but that never happened. The light lit up about 6 to 7 times, each time it was closer, brighter, lower and especially disturbing, it was always in the same 40 to 45 degree position to me as when I first viewed it. Logically that meant, I thought, that the light was somehow keeping pace with me, which became disturbing.  I was extremely compelled to continue to look on that same starboard heading of south, south-east to try and figure out what this aircraft could be. I couldn't decide which was more interesting, the fact that it was getting closer to me, or the fact that it was always in the same bearing to me. After about 6 sequential events of the light turning on and then off, duration each time as being about 3 to 5 seconds, it then was at its closest distance to me, about 1 mile or less. What happened next was absolutely exhilarating and I will never forget it, and this event then caused me to completely dismiss my original assumption of an airplane or helicopter and/or the characteristics of a man made craft that I had ever seen before. The second to the last time of this sighting the light shown at me, very close, one mile or less and at this time it continued to stay on. One to two seconds later, two other lights to its left came on along with it, same luminosity, same distance, moving with me but NOT horizontally symmetrical to each other. They were all three equidistant to each other, but the middle one was at a higher elevation than the other two making it appear to me as a very flat pyramidal grouping of three white, brilliant, lights about 1 mile away from me. Now I could actually see the craft moving with me, matching my speed, as the light(s) stayed on much longer. There was never any beam of any sort that I could see, and I looked to see if the white salt below the craft became illuminated because of these lights. It did not. Just brilliant white lights off to my 40 to 45 degree bearing each time. The lights didn’t appear to illuminate my bike either. At the closest point to me, I estimate the altitude to now be about 600 to 1,000 feet at a distance of no more than 1 mile from me, if even that. Then, the three lights all turned off at the same time, slowly vaporizing down, like a river   barge's lights. There was no sound.  My bike didn’t loose power or suffer any electrical failures. At this time, I now assumed these lights to be directly pointing at me for some reason. This craft was intentionally pointing these lights at me.  I somehow felt that this sighting was now more of a personal experience and not just some random lights. There was too much evidence of this now for me to dismiss.  I always saw stars in the background as if these lights were not a part of any solid craft or solid sphere. They appeared independent of each other but always uniformly symmetrical in their formation and distance, except, as I reported, for the slightly flattened pyramidal characteristic described above. The last time it shown on me was amazing! That same single light appeared one last time, same heading to me, same distance and same altitude as before. From a distance of about half a mile away, I saw what looked like brilliant LCD lights, orange-ish/red-ish in color, lights SCROLLING from behind the light/object, arcing up and to the left in a huge semi circle, and as it came around the circle towards the front of the craft, I could see even more of the colored lights scrolling around the circumference of a huge, circular disk.  But it was only a half disk and it was tilted left side up and right side down. About 6 to 10 of these very fast pulsations of brilliantly colored lights came from the exact same spot behind the light, circled around a huge disk shaped object and then came in to full view to me, larger and brighter and then abruptly ended at the white light that was still showing at me. This was one giant pulse of about 6 to 8 individual scrolling lights which made the outline of a circular half disk. But the disk was on a tilt slightly, about 15 degrees, so the lights went slightly up, over and downward and then abruptly ended at the white light that had stayed on the entire time, about 10 to 12 seconds. I was so shocked by this......I pulled the bike over on the shoulder of the highway. The wind was so fast, it nearly blew it over. I was speechless at what I had just seen and was hoping for it to appear to me again so I could video tape it with my blackberry phone, but it never did. Some time went by as I had resumed riding and the light never appeared close to me again. However, I saw the light one more time off in the distance.  It had flown back towards the Bonneville salt flats again in the distance and I last saw it just above the horizon, very far from me, south, where it illuminated one more time looking very much like a helicopter showing its lights on the desert floor. It didn't seem hostile in any way.....moreover, it seemed to want to show me that it was not a plane or helicopter that I kept insisting it was in my mind. It revealed its disk shape, 180 degrees of a half circle, in the most brilliant orange and red pulsations of light I have ever seen.  It was the same color as a cutting torch, maybe. I could always see stars behind it, but the pulses did reveal a huge semi-circle. I had not been drinking, I wasn’t tired nor was I on any kind of medication or drugs of any kind. I was just enjoying my ride home.  There’s definitely something weird at the Bonneville Salt Flats, in Utah?",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

There were lights around the edge of the circular shape.  I tried to wake up my husband but he wouldn’t wake up.  I wanted to tell him what I saw.  I had nothing to drink.  I was sober and awake.

In the morning I told my relatives who were visiting that I saw a UFO.  Later my husband came out and told us his dream about having to fix something underneath the craft and that a being was threatening him to fix it NOW!  He was frightened because he had messed up the threads on the item he was screwing back into the craft.  He hadn’t heard my story yet about seeing the UFO. After seeing it I wrote down a summary of what I saw and some of the thoughts that I had during the time after seeing it.  I was thinking that maybe our eyes couldn’t always see them.

Once in a great while I check this sight because on two occasions in the past I have seen grey, airplane-like objects with no lights or markings or sound, gliding over Chicago. I never bothered to submit a sighting until now, noticing that what I saw recently matches the descriptions of other entries with coinciding dates. I was driving Eastward down Irving Park Road in Chicago and I looked out the window and saw a Triangular shaped object (with rounded corners) with approximately 6 orange lights around the perimeter on the bottom of the object. No other or flashing lights at all. It appeared to be the size of a commercial aircraft but definitely lower than one should be flying. It also appeared to be just hovering. Now that area is common for aircraft coming into O’Hare airport from the east at lower altitudes so I took that in consideration. I also took into consideration the speed I was driving. It also occurred to me at that time that the Chicago Air and Water show was in a couple days. I've never been to the Air and Water show but I do not believe anything like that is part of it. I pulled over and watched it just sit there, hovering. I had the window down and could not hear any noise other than the traffic. Then it started to slowly move to the South West. I looked over at the bus stop and saw a man in his 20s staring up at the sky with his jaw open (giving me validation). When I looked back up it was gone.

At first i couldn't really be sure what it was, but than it came down from the clouds and i could see it better (the trees and ground cover of the other side of the valley gave good contrast, we were about 3/4s of the way up on our side of the valley).  it was oval, white metallic, and at one point i thought it changed shape but couldn't be sure.  I'd guess it to be about as large in width as 5-6 feet, but couldn't judge the distance well enough.  after flying through the valley, it flew up into the clouds again and got smaller and vanished. What was weird was that my friend complained that she was feeling weird and threw up a little under a minute before it passed by... does nuclear stuff/magnetic fields do that to people who are sensitiv! e?

It was sometimes more triangle shaped than cone but the light on bottom remained what looked like a sphere of fire. After about 30 seconds I got off phone and told my sister to call my mom and tell her to look outside. I then called up my neighbor and talked to him for the duration of event. Unfortunatly he was not home at the time but wanted to listen to my descriptions. I was honestly so amazed and scarred at what I was seeing I was glad to have his presense over the phone. I watched the 1st object for 2-3mins move slowly eastwards and hover before it slowly moved upwards and northeast gradually going over horizon. I rememeber telling my neighbor it was ! gone but I couldn't stop watching sky. My skygazing was rewarded about 30-45 seconds later when another similiar object appeared. This one hovered in sky near the location where 1st one did for about 1 minute before moving north and upwards thru the clouds. My feelings during this event were that I was seeing something I wasn't supposed to be seeing. A ufo here? How come theres not hundreds of other people able to see this. I left event deluding myself into writing it off as a flare and maybe it was. I'm no expert in non commercial aircraft. Lately I'm feeling that I was lucky to see it.

I had the good sense (even as a 10-year-old) to punch a nearby playmate and point upward.  He saw them too.  After school the two of us went to my house and called Richards-Gebauer AFB to report on what we had seen.  About two or three weeks later, two Air Force officers came to my school and I was called out of class and interrogated by them.   First, they asked me how many objects there were and I said about a hundred.  They were obviously shocked and, intimidated, I said maybe there were fifty.  I have always believed the number to be closer to a hundred.  I explained that the discs flew in perfect formation, in what I would today call a chevron formation.  I also explained that they did not fly in an uninterrupted, straight-ahead motion, but displayed a yo-yo motion, almost as if they were intaking air to propel themselves, then resting momentarily before the next intake and move forward, and so on.  This they did in perfect unison.  The two officers were skeptical and asked me if I knew what ducks look like in formation.  I made a V with my fingers and refused to go along with the duck hypothesis.  Then they told me that ""these things are usually reported in two's and three's, not in large formations.""  They asked if anyone else saw the event, and I told them the name of my playmate, who was sitting in his classroom, not 100 feet from where we were sitting.  They then said they had all the information they needed and left without interviewing the other boy. Over the years, I have read much of the published UFO literature and have found only one sighting that somewhat resembled my own--that of a U.S. soldier in the South Pacific in 1942.  He also saw a large formation of disc-like objects, which at one point made a loud rumbling sound.  In my case, there was no detectible sound.  The amazing thing is that there were at least 100 children playing on that playground, and as far as I was able to determine at the time, no one else noticed this obvious intrusion into the skies above our school.  Had I not thought to signal my playmate, even I might have concluded that I saw an optical illusion.  But it was no illusion. On a couple of other occasions, years ago, I attempted to contact other UFO organizations, but no one got back to me.   Now I am 66 years old and feel strongly that I want some permanent record of what I saw to exist after I am gone.  I would also like to explore whether the record of my Air Force interrogation still exists, though I doubt it.  I have always felt very privileged to have had this unusual sighting, at the same time frustrated by the official disinformation campaign that obviously is still going on.

What occurred was by far the strangest thing that I have ever experienced. Its very simple to describe. My son, my daughter and myself were on out lanai behind our house. We began to hear a “rumble” type of sound that was very steady yet faint in the distance. I guess you could describe it as the sound of a distant jet taking off. However, the sound became louder and more clear over the course of about 45 seconds. We walked outside the lanai door to see what it was. The sound was moving above us through the air but we could see nothing but stars. As the sound approached us, it was less like a rumble and more like the sound of ""feedback"" from a speaker turned way up. Very steady and deliberate and definitely not the sound of any combustion type engine. It sounded very “bassy” and it felt as though you could look straight up to see exactly where the sound was coming from but there was nothing there at all. My son said “the air smells like a penny…like metal”. I smelled it too but I would describe it more as an electrical smell.  At one point, the sound then became more general a! nd it was very difficult to tell which direction it was coming from. It was disorienting almost making me feel dizzy. You could still tell it was coming from above and now moving away from us from the West to East. It eventually just faded away.  It was definitely something in the sky. We never seen a thing but it was without question coming from an object up there none of us could see. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Our campsite is nestled in a stand of trees in the southwest corner of a huge rock bar in the Owyhee Canyon area, south of Vale, Oregon.  The rock bar is approximately two football fields in length and I would say close to three hundred feet wide.  Next to the river’s eastern edge sit’s a small hill about 100 feet tall.  Due west of our location is the ridge line near the Owyhee Breaks, approximately 1 to 1 ½ miles away.  South of our campsite, around five miles away is an area called Birch Creek. This is a wide open desert area, where we can see for long distances in most directions. As we were sitting near the river’s edge that evening, we noticed two red lights above and beyond Red Butte.  This is a volcanic mesa with an elevation of 4584 feet and is around 7 miles northeast of our location.  The two red lights were huge; in relation to the stars behind them, they were at least twice the size.  The lights were perfectly parallel and were heading our direction. We had a campfire burning that night and our curiosity was piqued as the two lights continued their approach.  As we continued watching the red lights, we began to hear a “soft” jet noise.  Jeff made a comment that he believed they were two military jets headed our  way to check out the campfire.   As the lights began to drop lower into the canyon and slow down, I disagreed with Jeff’s assessment of these lights being military jets, as the lights were going far too slow.  From Red Butte to our location,  had they been jets, they would have arrived at the rock bar in a very short time. While the two lights continued their advance toward our location, their steady drop in elevation and deceleration became more noticeably evident.  It was becoming quite clear there was something not right about these lights.  The noise did not fit the bill of military jets either, they weren’t loud enough. Here is what bothered me about the noise.  The jet noise of the two advancing lights was similar to that of conventional aircraft, but what I can relate as only “soft” jet sound, nothing near the decibels you would expect for a low flying military craft. Another thing that wasn’t quite right was that we have seen numerous commercial and military jets fly through this area, but NEVER have we seen military aircraft out at night at this location; an area we have been visiting for almost a decade. The commercial planes flying at night and at day are what you would expect to hear given the planes respective altitudes.  However, the military jets we have witnessed doing maneuvers in this area, are ALWAYS during the daytime and generally flying much higher  and are remarkably louder. As the lights reached a distance between one and two miles away, they had descended to an elevation of maybe 1000 to 1500 feet and the closer they approached the lower the elevation and slower the speed. Somewhere around 1000 feet away, the altitude of these mysterious lights dropped to what I believe is 500 to 700 feet in elevation and began to literally float like a blimp towards us.  I was unnerved to say the least and completely fixated on what I was seeing.  “Military jets can’t fly this slow,”  I said to Jeff. It was at this time that I got out of my chair and approached my four wheeler, which was approximately 15 feet away.  Prior to this, I had been sitting about 10 feet from the river and 8 or so feet from the campfire…I wanted a better look. When the two lights began entering the north area of  the rock bar, I became transfixed.  My heart was racing as these lights were slowly making their way towards us, all the while emitting the “soft” jet noise.  The altitude had dropped even more, to somewhere around 100 feet above us. What in the world is going on, I thought.  As it continued getting nearer, my mind was trying to make sense of what my eyes were seeing.  The sound, the speed, the color of the lights, the fact it was floating…nothing seemed logical…and it was big whatever it was.  Jeff and I were flinging  commentaries to each other, but I haven’t a clue what he said until…  The lights were almost directly overhead when Jeff began yelling something about two red lights.  I was mesmerized and began moving further up the rock bar, my head craned directly up.  As the lights were just barely past me, it was here that the realization hit me.  I could see a solid structure between the two red lights.  I began yelling at him that, “It’s not two red lights, it’s a solid object!!!”   “It’s solid, the lights are connected!!!”  I stared in utter amazement.  I could not see underneath, it was as black as the sky, I could only make out the structure between the lights.  (My estimate as to the width of the craft is 100 feet, based on how much of the rock bar it appeared to cover at it’s apparent altitude). Jeff yelled again and said, “No, no…look up higher and to the left, there’s two more lights!”  Not wanting to take my eyes off the object, I quickly glanced up and left and there they were, two more red lights, another object identical  to what I was seeing directly above me.  This one however, was at a much higher altitude…possibly one to two thousand feet.  I quickly diverted my attention back to the one above me. I was stunned!  What I had just seen didn’t make any sense.  With the realization that these lights were one solid object, a craft, I was left bewildered.  There was no transition between the approach of the two lights and the departure of the two lights.  I never saw two coming and two leaving. But I didn’t have time for this passing thought.  I was truly in awe of the events transpiring at the time.  Thoughts and emotions were whipping through my mind and body at that moment.  I didn‘t want to take my eyes off it for anything.  “Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, do you believe this?”  “No one is going to believe this,”  I yelled to Jeff.  I was overwhelmed, astonished and excited.  My body began shaking and my knees literally went weak. Grab the camera!!!”  Jeff yelled.  I ran back to the four wheeler and could not remember what side I had put it in.  I was fumbling around in the dark, trying to watch the object and feeling through the myriad of items I had in my atv. The craft was nearing the far south end of the rock bar, while I was still searching feverishly for the camera.  On the back of my atv, is an added seat that has two storage units on either side.  I am an avid rock hound and both sides were full of rocks, water bottles, towels, clothes and snacks.  I ran from one side of my atv to the other trying to locate the camera.  Minutes were passing by and the craft was disappearing down the canyon when I finally found the camera case. I was shaking so bad, I could barely unzip it.  Trying to watch the craft and operate a camera with my mind racing and trying to function normally was an impossible mission at this point.  I finally did open the lens of the camera and thought I was hitting the shutter button when I had actually hit the off button.  I was exasperated. I turned the camera on again.  By this time the craft had picked up speed and altitude and was now nearing the Birch Creek area.  Pointing the camera towards the craft, nothing was registering on the viewfinder…the screen was black.  I yelled at Jeff , “…nothing is registering.”  I hit the zoom, but still could not find the lights in the viewfinder.  I realized it was a fruitless attempt, so I turned the camera off and put the handle over my wrist as I continued to watch the craft depart down the canyon.  (I had just purchased this camera in May and was unfamiliar with all it’s settings). It was at this juncture that we were to witness an amazing exhibition  that left me completely awestruck. As the craft went beyond Birch Creek, it had gained considerable altitude and had met up with the other craft.  We could no longer hear them.  While the  initial craft always appeared to be much larger, I am unsure whether this was due to the fact that it was always higher and farther away.  While I know this is the logical train of thought, the second sighting has me in doubt of this presumed fact. All of a sudden both crafts apparently turned and when they did, we now saw three red lights each on both crafts…both vessels were now triangle shaped!  An isosceles triangle to be precise. The crafts stood still for a moment and in almost slow motion pointed their noses relatively straight up, sat momentarily and then shot off into the night sky like a rocket, the smaller craft first and then the larger one.  They moved so swiftly that within seconds we lost sight of them. Again, and with much fervor I exclaimed, “Oh my God, do you believe what we just saw…this is the stuff you see on TV,” such was the discourse upon witnessing this spectacle. Jeff and I were conversing loudly and excitedly to one another for the next few minutes.  After ten or fifteen minutes of our impassioned discussion, we heard jet noise again.  It couldn’t be…but it was.  Slightly southeast over the small hill across the river, came two red lights.  Not three in a triangle shape, only two like we had seen to begin with.  This time however, it was flying at a few thousand feet in altitude.  I would hazard a guess at roughly three to possibly five thousand feet. Camera still in hand, I turned it on and began clicking.  I made the same faux paux I made before and accidentally turned the camera off.  Regaining my composure, I made sure this time my finger stayed on the shutter button and I began clicking away.  Still…nothing was registering on the viewfinder.  I quickly realized I needed to change the camera settings and began flipping the dial as I tried to get the lights in the viewfinder. I found the “night” setting, but still nothing in the viewfinder, so I just pointed and shot.  The craft was crossing the canyon at a much faster speed this time and I was having a hard time keeping watch of it and trying to shoot photos. After snapping several shots I lowered the camera.  Since I could see nothing at all through the lens, I at least wanted to see with my eyes.  It was then we noticed the second craft.  It was once more flying at a much higher altitude, escorting the first and larger craft.  They  crossed almost due west over the rock bar in very short time. As they reached the west side of the canyon, the speed slowed to a near halt and again they turned.  Once more we could now see two triangular shaped craft, each possessing three lights.  Again, one craft appearing much larger, at least two to three times larger than the other. The larger craft slowly lowered itself to just above the mountain top, hovered momentarily and then began a series of maneuvers.  The second craft turned to horizontal and remained stationary, as if watching or waiting for the larger craft.  While viewing the objects at this location, which is barely a mile or so from the rock bar, we did not hear any noise coming from the crafts. The larger craft tilted what would seem to be it’s left wing or side up and then came back to horizontal.  It then slowly maneuvered it’s nose up and again back to horizontal.  In it’s final movement, it tilted the nose down…and back again to horizontal…hovered briefly and then sank slowly behind the mountain as if it were landing.  The second craft did no maneuvers of any kind, it slowly descended down, almost in sync with the large craft as if it too were landing. (While the craft was just passing over me when we were on the rock bar, I did get a spectacular view of the rear end of the craft.  I have since drawn diagrams and images.  Please see attached). The story doesn’t end here.  A couple of odd things happened the very next day.  While we didn’t see any craft the following day, what occurred on Thursday has definitely made me wonder. It was 9:05 a.m. when I was taking a stroll through the stand of tree that surround our camping area.  I heard an extremely loud jet sound and looked up.  There above me, flying at only a couple of thousand feet was a Stealth Bomber and it was heading directly towards the location the two craft had appeared to land the previous night. How odd, I thought…is this just a coincidence?  For as long as we’ve been coming here…never have we seen Stealth in this area.  I came back to camp and asked Jeff if he had seen the Stealth…his reply was no…although he did hear the jet noise. Approximately 10:00 a.m., Thursday, August 20, 2009.  We’re cleaning up the breakfast dishes when we hear noise on the mountains behind our camp.  Behind us are two roads that traverse this recreation area.  A lower road, which is directly 20 feet behind our tent and then the upper road which is maybe a hundred yards further up toward the base of the hills.  Both roads run north and south. Inspecting the noise, Jeff had walked out of camp to the access road that leads to the road behind us and stated there were two rigs coming down the hill.  “You’re kidding,”  I said, surprised at this development. As far as I knew, this road was nothing more than an atv trail, a fairly steep one at that.  I made my way to Jeff’s location and for a brief time watched in amazement as these two vehicles slowly made their way down. Here again was another anomaly.  In all our years at this area, a place that we come to at least twice a year, only once have I seen anything on this hill, and that was a four wheeler - an all terrain vehicle.  Although I was surprised that two vehicles were on this road, I didn’t give it much more thought…I returned to camp and began to prepare our atv’s for our morning ride.  My thoughts were due to change promptly. While loading the atv’s with the necessary items, it struck me.  I grabbed our Oregon Road and Recreation Atlas to see where this road leads.  This steep desert road takes you to an area in the general vicinity where the crafts seemed to land the previous night. Shortly thereafter, with both Jeff and I in camp, we heard the vehicles getting nearer…very near.  Within a few seconds, the vehicles were coming down the road directly behind our camp.  Jeff and I quickly walked out the short driveway that leads to the road behind our camp to see what was up. The first vehicle we observed was an older model jeep, white in color I believe, and the second rig was also an older model blue pickup with an atv in the bed.  Both men were middle aged, I would say early 50’s or so. What was so peculiar about this encounter was that as the two men drove slowly by, within 30 feet, they did nothing but stare.  There were no hello’s, no waves…nothing but a stoic gaze.  We have ran across or met a few people in our visits here and with one exception everyone either waves or stops to chat, but not these two.  Another odd thing was, it seemed pretty obvious to me that the two vehicles made a bee line to our location.  But why?  If you’re hunters (antelope season had recently opened) and you’re checking to see if this camping area is available, you would have noticed this location was occupied when you were directly behind our tent.  There would be no need to slow your vehicles down to a crawl and stare as they did.  Granted these thoughts are mere speculation as to the motives of these two individuals, it was nonetheless strange behavior.  The two vehicles proceeded to the upper road, headed north and we never saw them again.  Now had they been hunters interested in bagging game in this canyon, there are only a few other camping areas available and we would have either seen them, heard their vehicles or atv and in all likelihood heard gunshots.  Neither occurred that day.  For within an hour, Jeff and I rode our atv’s a few miles past Red Butte, passing all the camping locations along the way.  There were no sign of the men or their vehicles and no indication they had taken the road we were on as there weren’t any  fresh tracks on the road that goes due east past Red Butte.  Now whether these two men are witnesses to the previous night’s events, I can only conjecture.  Their sudden appearance and quick disappearance seemed odd.  The next occurrence was at 4:00 p.m. that afternoon.  After returning to camp from our ride beyond Red Butte, we headed for the rock bar.  The day was hot and we wanted to be near the river the remainder of the day.  Within a very short time, we began to hear jet sounds again.  I was in the midst of my hunt for rocks and Jeff was in the river on the float tube.  Every time we have visited this locale, the military jets do their maneuvers directly south of us about two to three miles above a place called Griffith Ranch…but not today. Today the sound was very loud and close.  Looking up, I spied only one jet.  It’s not at the usual altitude either, this one is flying lower than normal and is crisscrossing the rock bar at an east and west trajectory.  Here again is a peculiar thing.  In all our years camping here, we have always observed two jets executing maneuvers.  I watched the jet momentarily and returned to my rock hunting.  As the jet proceeded to traverse the canyon, I went to the river to cool off.  What happened next is another unusual event.  If you recall the small hill I mentioned earlier in this report; this hill is no higher than 100 to 150 feet.  I was standing in the river, a mere stone’s throw from the base of this hill cooling off, when the noise of the jet became extremely loud.  Looking up, the jet had changed his flight path and was suddenly approaching from the south at an extremely low altitude.  As he neared, he flew directly over the small hill around 20 to maybe 50 feet above it’s peak.  His air speed had slowed to the point that when he flew past, I could see his headgear, oxygen mask and upper body.  He turned his head and looked directly at me.  Needless to say, I was bewildered by this action.  I yelled to Jeff, who was about 50 yards downstream saying, “Did you see that?”  I met up with Jeff within a couple of minutes and we discussed how unusual this incident was.  We both pondered the pilots odd behavior and speculated on the possibility of being photographed, as nothing of this nature had ever taken place before.  This was the end of the remarkable events we witnessed during our time here.  I have given much thought to the depth and length of the craft I witnessed over the rock bar and have been unable to determine the measurements.  Possibly with those who possess knowledge of geometry this issue could be resolved.  As a side note, a possible witness to be contacted would be the caretaker(s) who man a residence at Birch Creek.  While we haven’t been to this residence in four or five years, there used to be an elderly couple who manned a small ranch at this locale.  The following information is stated to give the reader(s) more information regarding the area where the sighting occurred.  Near where the craft initially appeared, which as I stated is above and beyond Red Butte, is a very big reservoir called Lake Owyhee.  (Pronounced o-y-hee).  According to Trails.com, Lake Owyhee is “53 miles long and 139,00 acres, with an average depth of 80 feet and a maximum depth of 117 feet”.  Different internet sources state contrary information regarding Lake Owyhee.  (A report from the Argus Observer, June 27, 1991 cites, “In some places the lake is nearly 500 feet deep and even in the worst of the drought Owyhee had 250 feet of water for 40 miles”).  According to the Oregon Bureau of Reclamation, “Owyhee Dam is a concrete, thick-arch structure which was designed to carry about three-fourths of the water load by arch action and the remainder by gravity action. The dam rises 417 feet above foundation in the river section, and 530 feet above the low point of the excavated fault zone. At the time of its construction, Owyhee ranked as the world's highest dam. The arch section is 623 feet long, and a gravity tangent extends 210 feet to the right abutment. The total capacity of Lake Owyhee is 1,120,000 acre-feet (active 715,200 acre-feet).  This site further states that, “…Hydraulic height (the normal operating depth at the dam) is 325 feet”.  See link:  http://www.usbr.gov/projects/PrintFacilityAttributes.jsp?fac_Name=Owyhee%20Dam  Another observation I noted while perusing our Oregon Road and Recreation Atlas, is a location called Ben Odell Reservoir which is not too far from where the crafts appeared  to have landed.  I have researched this small reservoir and can only find latitude and longitude information of 42.27922 and 117.60444 respectively.  I did find one small map that leads me to believe this reservoir is approximately ¾ of a mile long.  I have yet to find any more information.  This, as I stated previously, is in  the same general area the two unknown men came from.  As for the photos I took.  Having downloaded the images from the night of the sighting, I did manage to click the shutter 14 times and only captured one image of what appears to be a single point of light…possibly Mars.  In the accompanying images, drawn by the reporting witness, please note that only the 3 red lights (per craft) were visible that gave the crafts their triangular shape.  The first image is what I witnessed upon seeing the craft pass by while on the rock bar.  The outer ring on the lights were a bright red/orange.  The inner ring was a lighter orange/red.  The bottom four sketches are the maneuvers the first and larger craft accomplished over the western ridge line before seeming to land.  All the maneuvers were done at a relatively slow pace.  #1.  Shows the craft’s first maneuver, in which it appeared to lift it’s left side up.  #2.  Second maneuver was to lift the nose of the craft.  #3.  The craft lowered the nose.  #4.  In it’s last move, the craft went back to horizontal, remained stationary for a moment, and then accompanied by the second craft sank behind the ridge line.

The object appeared to be over the Gulf of Mexico.  I live in a small town just north of Tampa called Weeki Wachee  I was by myself and at first I thought that I was seeing a very bright sparkly star throwing off a lot of light, mainly blue, red and white.  I looked at other stars in the sky to see if it was just me and I looked back at this one bright star.  I was definitely different.  With my naked eye, I could clearly make out a red, blue and white light, flashing like night aircraft lights.  I questioned myself and thought, this has to be a plane but it did not move. I was outside at the time, so I came in and looked through a strong pair of binoculars.  How I would describe the object is as follows; the object was quite some distance away from my home over the Gulf of Mexico.  It appears to have a shape similar to a box kite.  Two rectangles, one at the top and bottom and some kind of connecting piece, thin, between the rectangles, just like a box kite.  The red and blue color flashes switched between the top and bottom rectangles while the connecting piece remained a bright shining white. I was able to witness this for at lease 10 minutes before the object went behind the clouds and never reappeared.  I did not see the object again until last night, 8/31/2009 at 10:30 pm EST.

We were shown many interesting photos, but the most stunning experience came from a radar recording.  A radar record showed a number of white dots moving in formation high in the sky over Washington, D.C. Then two fighter airplanes were ordered up to investigate. We watched as they approached closer and closer to the cluster of about 5 or 6 white lights.  Suddenly, the radar dots of the planes disappeared. Then, in just a few seconds, the white-lights cluster suddenly moved upward at great speed, and quickly disappeared off of radar altogether.  We sat there in stunned silence--and then the questions and unhappy answers.  No, the planes and the pilots were never found. No wreckage. Only conclusion possible: they had been captured by the UFO's, pilots and planes, in toto.  No, the relatives were not told the truth. They had been told that the fighers had disappeared way out in the Atlantic Ocean.  And No--you cannot tell the truth, either.  You have been sworn to silence, and you must stick to that. Otherwise, you might stir up a hellish wave of panic.  That's it.

In a large clear patch of blue sky approx 30 degrees to the South of due East I noticed a shiny white metallic object that I assumed was an airplane.  The object was clear against the blue sky, as an airplane would appear on a clear day.  The object appeared silver-white and shiny as it was clearly was lit up by the sun.  I estimate the size of the object as equal to a passenger jet, maybe 150’, and estimate location above Lake Erie, 1-2 miles North of Sandusky, OH at approx elevation 25,000-30,000 feet.  Estimated distance of object from observer: 5 miles. I would have assumed the object was a plane had I not noticed that the object was not moving as an airplane would.  It appeared stationary in the sky.  After watching it for approx 5 seconds I could see it was “drifting” slowly from right to left (South to North).  There was no vapor trail associated with the object, as I had noticed on airplanes the day before.  There were no airplanes in the area that morning while I was observing the object to compare the object to. The object had clear sharp edges, and appeared to be metallic.  It had no wings or tail fins like an airplane.  The object emitted no noise.  It was not unlike the fuselage of an airplane but slightly thinner at the left (North) end than the right (South) end. As I was staring at the object, that was still clearly visible against the blue sky, it disintegrated (became invisible) before my eyes.  It disintegrated from top to center and from bottom to center.  It took only about ½ second to go from a completely solid object to completely gone.  This disintegration is what convinced me beyond a shadow of a doubt this was not a plane, but an unexplained sighting of a solid object that was visible one second and gone the next.

I have never forgotten it. I was a small child living with my great grandmother in a small town in Oklahoma, very small town. I guess it had a population then of less than 2,000. Lindsay, Oklahoma is where I was born and raised and where the following events occurred. I stayed with her a lot. My mother lived nearby and had 4 other children younger than me. I was very close with my great grandmother and was her favorite. Because I had no way of describing what happened at the time I recounted the events to my great grandmother the next morning over breakfast as that I had been lifted in the air last night by a white light to what my mind at the time thought was a giant silver tube of toothpaste. (the shape was the only thing I could come up with that my little mind could describe). I tried to describe how scary it was. I don’t remember any discussion about it again. It wasn’t until I was an adult and something caused me to think of it again that I realized what had happened was an UFO abduction. I will describe exactly what I remember. I was in bed with my great grandmother which is where I always slept. I awoke to find myself floating up in the air inside a white beam of light. I was outside because I looked down to see my great grandmother’s house below me. I recall being terrified to the nth degree. I can’t even begin to explain how scared I was. I looked up to see that I was being drawn through the air to a very large, cylindrical shiny silver object with a dark opening in it…to which I was being lifted towards. It seemed that a being was standing near the opening and watching me floating up to it. I have absolutely no recollection of what occurred inside the UFO. I woke up again back inside my great grandmother’s house. A disturbing thing to me now which at the time I didn’t relate properly and couldn’t explain properly is that the day of my return I complained to my mother and great grandmother that my genital area was very sore. I complained enough that they examined the area to see if something was wrong. I was questioned as to what made me so sore and I know this sounds weird but because I was a small child and had no remembrance of being inside the UFO and anything that could have happened all that my mind could come up with was that a blade of grass had been inserted into me. They were perplexed and asked me repeatedly what had happened and I gave the same explanation again. It’s all that I knew to say….for some reason I believed that something had been inserted and knew that it was something similar to a blade of grass. I had no idea how the blade of grass came to enter me. It’s all I knew to say. I am 50 years old now and still remember these events vividly. I believe that it was an UFO abduction. When I became an adult and began to read and learn of other abductions I realized that I had experienced this too. As a child I couldn’t explain it because I had never heard of UFOs  and had no vocabulary or knowledge to explain it. I have related the experience a couple of times to family members but they think I must have dreamed it. I can understand that because it sounds so weird that I don’t want to believe it either. I just wanted to tell my story to someone and have it documented. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",,34.8536,-97.6029

It did not emit any sound at any time during the event.

She looked up and said, ""Yes, it's a light doing figure eights zipping around real fast.""  She says it was 1 light but I thought it was 2 because it looked that way to me since the light was zipping so fast.  My sight is much poorer than hers, so I only put 1 as the number of craft seen. The airplane flew normally and the light stayed as it was when I first saw it, making zig zag patterns in what seemed like a small span of space until it just disappeared.

We quickly realised the triangle was too large to be a microlight (60-70 foot wide wingspan) and moved too quickly (perhaps 150 mph). A faint whistling sound accompanied the triangle.  The triangle appeared to fly diagonally east and with the back end pointing down. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

On this fourth night I shared the binoculars with several people who tried to come up with some explanation.

A few minutes in, I saw a chevron formation of lights streak across the sky directly overhead.  The lights were orange in color and were not round but rather looked like stunted bowling pins.  There were about 4 or five on each side for a total of 9 to 11.  They appeared to be low enough above the tree tops that at first I thought, ""cool bats flying in formation!"" after which I quickly thought, ""no, bats don't fly in formation, maybe they're ducks.""   Then of course almost instantly I realized that neither bats nor ducks glow orange and that it must have in fact been a vessel of some sort which blocked out the stars behind it.  Then, while it was still in a visible spot, unimpeded by treetops, the lights went out and that was it.  I did not notice if the stars continued to be blotted out in the same trajectory, as it all happened so fast.  What was mos! t noticeable was the speed at which it moved across the sky-- 2-3 seconds heading from north to south and the fact that there was absolutely no sound associated with the movement.

On Saturday night/Sunday morning - Aug 23d 2009, I awoke around 3 AM and saw strange bright lights out the window.  There was a light to medium steady rain that night. I awoke my wife and we went outside on the deck where we both observed 2 very bright orbs of light (or fireballs as they are called on this site) that were visible over both the water and beach in the area near and around Briggs March and Warren point. The balls of light did not seem to be attached to any craft or structure, they were large and bright whitish-blue colored (almost halogen-like), they made no noise and emitted no beams. At first I thought they were car headlights on Warren point because they moved together in parallel and they were very close to the ground (if not on the ground), but then they rose into the air and separated.  They were also too large to be headlights.  They made figure eights in the air and moved in many directions, they stayed generally close together as they moved but did not keep any constant distance. We saw them rise vertically and go horizontally faster than any machine could have done for the distance we saw them at, and they were in the air but stayed fairly close to the ground (my guess is that they did not go higher than a 100 yards off the ground.  They rose and fell as they moved, and in my best way of describing it: they appeared to ""dance"" or ""act playfully"" together.  They were clearly in some kind of intelligent control. We watched them move together until they disappeared toward the water behind some trees that blocked our view.  The whole thing lasted about 2-3 minutes. Both my wife and I witnessed this, we are both 25 and were not under any kind of influence of alcohol or anything else.  We are physically and mentally healthy and only she has eye problems, but while witnessing this she did had her glasses on. It was early morning and we were both sleepy, but seeing this strange sight instantly made me quite alert - this was no sleepy induced imaginary figment. We have ruled out every natural or man made thing we could think of.  The lights were about a mile away, and due to their size, brightness, location, and movement we have ruled out: people with flashlights, car/motorcycle headlights, planes, helicopters, spotlights.. etc  I have absolutely no explanation for what I saw, I hope someone else saw this too and will report it.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,41.5094,-71.1645

I say the looked like satellites because they looked just like one at night only these objects we close to each other one behind the other and ive never observed two satellites travelling the same direction, same speed, so close to ach other.  I know these were not aircraft because the light that was given off was not of a strobe or landing light nature.  More of when light reflects off of metal and this makes since because the sun had set only an hour before so you only have to go so high before you reflect the suns light.  What makes this case interesting is after a minute of observing these two objects travelling north the began to change direction and over the course of about 30 secs went from travelling due north to due south.  About 15 secs before we lost sight my father and I both saw one of the objects split SE while the other object continued south.  Dont really care if this is credible or not i know what we saw.  No way it was a satellite because of the course change that was made by both objects and I know they were not aircraft because there was no strobe light and without that you cant see an aircraft at night with no moon:) 3rd sighting in 3 yrs for me here in SC KS and the 2nd for my father in 2 yrs.

The whitish light was continuously emanating from it, but in different intensities and from different parts of the craft.  So, the craft continued along and passed us, continuing South and a little East,! when it suddenly just stopped. I then knew definitely that it wasn't a plane.

The two balls of red/orange light appeared then disappeared. I could see as one elevated very high in the sky then resembled a star that began streaking West.

After the lights disappeared a variety of terrestrial craft small planes, jets, helicopters began to move into the area above NW Chicago where the lights had been. After about a half hour a large red and green triangle solid object began to make schedule circles around the NW side of the City in the sky possibly over Lake Michigan.

They were not Chinese lanterns because they came down from the atmosphere then projected back up.

We lived in Monmouth County, NJ, not far from the Raritan Bay. Our house faced nearly due West. The night was average temperature, not hot, cold or uncomfortable. I am not sure if it was Spring or Autumn, but something tells me it was around September.  I remember my Father parking the Dodge Dart in the street because the driveway had a steep upward slope and the walkway was a more comfortable grade. It was late and we were tired.  As we made our way up the walk one of my sisters told us to look above the neighbor's house on the corner of our street, to the southwest of our house.  Above the corner lot was a large craft with white lights, apparently spinning and hovering about 100 feet above a neighbor's house, diagonally across the street. For reference, if you were to hold your hands out at arms length at the width of a Frisbee, that would be an accurate reference of the craft's size. It was very large and low to the rooftop.  We stood silently watching the saucer for what seemed to be about 5 minutes, then the craft moved directly above us, hovered for a minute, and shot due east over the house amazingly fast, - almost instantaneously. I remember not being able to see the sky while I leaned my head all the way back looking up, not hearing a sound. After the craft flew away, my Father commented “It must be some kind of advertisement”. We walked inside and nobody said a word about the event for 18 years.  Eighteen years later in October, I was with my girlfriend, now my wife, in Long Beach Island, NJ. I remember that we had been dating for 5 years at that time, as we met in November of 1984. A good friend and his parents were loaned a house on the beach for the weekend and we stayed with them. I remember the day very well, the weather was cloudy and warm – and the water was still a perfect temperature for swimming. The water in NJ doesn't start turning cold until late October, so I estimate that date as being early October in 1989.  That night we went out to dinner near LBI. The conversation turned to UFO's, and I mentioned for the first time that I had a couple of encounters when I was young. My now-wife and friend didn't believe me at first because I had never mentioned it to either of them before. In fact, the saucer event was common knowledge at home, but my family never told anyone outside the house about it. It wasn't because we were shy or embarrassed, it was just that the topic never surfaced. Even writing this is difficult for me since something in the back of my mind is telling me to forget about it - but I can't. Nor can I forget several other encounters, some of which I still can't explain. This is the third time I wrote about this encounter in the past year with the intention of sending it to you, but previously deleted it. Anyway, I told everyone my story that night and all were amazed that nobody said a word about it. To this day I can't explain why we didn't tell anyone.  There were other encounters too, one in which my eldest sister shared with my Father and me. I can detail that story in another form and submit it if this one interests you. The second sighting deals with hieroglyphics circling around a small, gold saucer hovering over the Shrewsbury / Navesink River in Red Bank, NJ. For years it registered as a dream to me, but both my Father and Sister remembered it clearly. My sister still talks about how we tried to understand the letters moving around the craft, but they were different than anything we had ever seen. I know that I have the characters etched in my  memory, somewhere. One looked like lambda, as I recall it now.  My stories are truthful accounts that I can't explain. I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by sharing them. I have live witnesses who remember it clearly. Dad passed away last year, but Mom and my two sisters were there. Dad wouldn't discuss it anyway since he worked in the Avionics industry, and he had a security clearance. He would definitely lose his job if he talked about the topic. Now that he's gone there is no risk to him, so I decided to tell the story. There is also a neighbor who still lives at the end of my prior street, and she saw the craft as well. She was terrified when she heard our story.  Please keep in mind that I have bosses, co-workers and clients who will drop me like a bad habit if they were to find out who I am. I have no problem sharing my experiences, but I can't reveal my identity; or for now anyway, I don't feel very comfortable in doing so. I am licensed Professional Land Surveyor in 2 states.  Along with several other creepy encounters there is also an amazing experience, with documented survey data relating to my profession that I can share with you. For now, I only have time to tell about the first encounter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-10-31T00:00:00,40.4242,-74.1746

All of a sudden, the girls started screaming and pointing at the sky.  Looking up, I observed a disk shaped UFO with two rows of blinking light panels located on the bottom and around the perimeter of the disk.  I distinctly remember that as an inner panel glowed an outer panel was illuminated and vice versa.  The panels turned on and off in a checkerboard pattern continuously and almost appeared flourescent.  I say ""almost"" because no ""bulb"" was observed, either directly or as if hidden behind an opaque or transparent cover--the entire panel glowed evenly with no observable concentration of light.  The craft traveled from south to north no more than 50-60 feet above our heads.  It moved very slowly, in complete silence, and then disappeared behind dense trees (what is now the area immediately south of North Lane in Pine Hills).  The Orlando International Airport was a SAC strategic bomber base at the time and, as an adult, I now believe that the craft was somehow connected with the base.  I have no evidence to back that supposition.  I find it interesting to note that a 1966 report and a 1976 report on this site also note glowing light panels.

This occurred during our night training on the firing range using Starlight Scopes.  This night was a clear night but without a moon.  The background in the distance was the mountain range on Camp Pendleton.  During the firing practice everyone who was firing using a Starlight Scope became exited by a bright light they could see through the scope.  The light was flying/hovering fairly low to the ground in the distance.  The weird part was that you could only see this light using the Starlight Scope.  With the naked eye you saw nothing; no light whatsoever.  Through the scope the light was obvious and moving over the horizon.  My recollection of this event would have been over a 30-90 second time period.  I looked at least 3 times through the scope to observe the UFO then with my naked eye and could see nothing.  I was watching through the scope when the bright object went around one of the mountains and came into view again from a valley.  The object began to rise into the air higher and then disappeared into the sky in a streak of light similar to a falling star but away from the earth.

Hearsay (my granddad now dead) saw greenish light travelling above road (good visibility to road) for 2-3 minutes.

No sound. This is one old and ""hearsay"" report so ditch it if you wish. Anyhow I've never told anyone but... Here's the thing:  My grandfather (now died) told me in early '80's when I was very young, 10+ years of age, that he saw a green ball of light moving (following a road) towards ""south"" (see GPS/map I give later). I thougtht he was referring to late 70's or early 80's-it doesn't matter since no local paper gave confirmation.  My grandmother did say (at the time granddad told me) ""don't tell him odd things"" and still my grandfather (known never to take any alcohol and/being totally sober from drugs also-I just mention this since drugs are common in some countries now-a-days) insisted on the sighting. He said it was nothing spectacular/odd, just a cigar-shaped 30/200cm ball of green light never seen by anything he had seen/read about. (He had nice library I quite liked it) and he was not least ashamed nor quiet about it if anyone asked. He even called local newspaper ""Etelä-Suomen Sanomat"" about it (next morning), but nobody else had seen it. So he really did not go to any trouble telling about it, just stated me the facts.  My first time hearing about it was when I read and told him (in dinner table, later) about advanced flight (I told stuff about ""planned aeroplanes 2 mach"" I'd read in a book in his bookshelf-there were so many books... At my age I did not think he had had time to read them all-now I'm sure he did not because I can say he never read/understood the german/russian/hungarian books in the shelves).  I didn't make much of it at the time (nor anytime later since now), but you might be able to find out on our local newspaper ? (if You're interested, I still think it was marsh-gas, plasma, or equivalent natural though unknown phenomena). And poorly described. But it was obviously larger than a ""torch"" worn by persons/car/bike, nor did it ""sparkle"".  Location of the sighting was from north to south via road (above road, not touching it). Speed was nothing spectacular, just 50km/h or so. Like a fast moving car but there was nothing below it, and it just took the road(looked like it) since there were pines all around. Viewer lost sight when the road ended (up+south there's a T-intersection-both sides left&right and up(even steeper hill) had lots of pines and some leafy trees) and not a clue which way the thing took off. If it'd taken up it'd have been seen against Salpausselkä, so obviously it took of right/left or disappeared.  Terrain: There is very old granite hills East (spelling?) but some very deep ditches of marsh (North) and there a never-drying lake with no river out. I can draw if google doesn't provide/if you insist, the landscape is'nt too different today I could take a picture if I thought it made any difference... It should be obvious in google maps ?  All the area around is max 100mx100m private properties, each one with one house. Odd nobody else reported seeing it.  He especially stated there was no sound.  ---Below here is for personal/documentation usage only, please--- The location will tell my/grandfater/etc personality to people in town so anything below is not for public review: http://www.02.fi/kartta/m%C3%A4yr%C3%A4nkatu+5/lahti  My granddad was watching the item move from north Purokatu (viewed from Mäyränkatu) to south purokatu, lost the item view close/before purokatu-kiveriönkatu intersection. View to the first end (looking right-hand) of the sighting is blocked by lots of birches, so he propably saw it from the intersection of mäyränkatu/purokatu towards south (near road). There's an opening, a small pond, so it is not sure the light followed road, but behind that opening there's a very tall hill so it was between the hill and the viewer. The hill curves back towards road rising so the thing was seen either back on the road or going all the way the road. Finally it went up the hill&road towards the T-intersection near/where he lost view of it.  Sorry I did not proofread this report with any program, but I'm not too interested in spelling mistakes. Also I do repeat things my granddad said with emphasis. This is the only ""odd"" story I heard from him (or I heard anyone else about him telling).  After all I think this is just another swamp-gas/plasma thing-I just thought I'd submit another unverifiable ""heard from someone of"" sighting... (oh, you can call the ""rather big"" newspaper about things near mäyränkatu/purokatu but you better send the email about the names while in phone-or have someone talking Finnish:). http://www.ess.fi/ <- not even sure anyone recorded...  Toni K. Suchros_trashmail at hotmail.com Feel free to ask specific questions though I am not sure I can answer... Or want to.  Please do not contact my grandmother she's very old (oh yes, I do say THIS because otherwise you would bother her:she will confirm anything I say). If you prefer just dismiss this report rather than contact her. Other persons do not know (maybe my 2 uncles but I've never asked-and anyhow they don't have 1st hand experience and one is a drunk).  I clicked ""aura"" around the object since it was floating and he said there was nothing below it-I figured out it's green glow reflected from the road and nearby objects... But this was only my thoughts, didn't think to ask about it.  ps: I have never seen UFO myself, not even sure where they come from, and my grandfather was in the war and did not tell stories about it at all, just stated it was horrible->do anything to avoid, even ""give some leeway to russians until country's in danger again""... Still he did tell me this in a matter-of-fact stuff, he didn't believe in aliens or anything like that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

As I came out of the main terminal lobby about 12:40 am I was with another gentleman to have a smoke. We looked north and saw about a dozen moving objects that looked liked stars in size, but were a distance off toward the north over what we knew was a military base, but as we watched these objects simply did what no flying object we have could do. They would fly at great speeds; stop on a dime and at great speeds would make right angle turns that should smash any inhabitants like a bug from the inertia of such a turn.  The man I was with was some flight specialist and was able to determine speeds roughly and distance etc, because he was simply trained in such things - I thought maybe he was a pilot himself. But he told me quite frankly that the objects have to be traveling several thousand miles per hour in the “bursts” of speed. They would all suddenly fly into one place as to meet, then fly apart in different direction and stop on a dime - staying there for a short time. Some would fly then other directions and take those right turns without slowing or stopping. You just can’t watch that kind of thing and think that we have any aircraft whatsoever that has that kind of ability. They did seem to glimmer from a bright whitish to other colors, but our distance from them it was hard to distinguish it and then - after near 10 - 12 minutes of watching this “dance in the sky” - they all flew off it different directions like a 4th of July exploding flare shot. And, no - it was no firework show either. Even if it were fireworks - even that is NOT allowed over the military base that we were watching this happen over. I had never known anyone to have ever reported this before now. The thing is - that the very next night on another grave yard shift at about closer to 2 am I saw the very same thing. This time about 5 people were standing outside watching it and I had told them I had seen it the night before as well - just didn’t know what it was, but said - nothing can fly like those things that we have - so it’s something else.  Having had a friend who used to work with NASA I had discussed with him my theory that these are not inter planetary, but rather inter-dimensional and the discussion turned into the color changing issue as they change and right when they disappear from site is at the ultra-violet or infra-red spectrum so the idea of inter-dimensional seemed to fit with that scenario and the idea of the speeds and right turns they could make without getting hurt would indicate this same idea - that, inter dimensionally they could pull this off. So, that’s my story.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,47.68357629392971,-117.38633105431309

I then started going outside every nite, with my stepfathers binocoluars and a large lantern flashlite. I would lay down on thegrass my eyes strayning upwards for any sign of movement. when one night it finally paid offwhen 3 crafts that were shaped like the shape of wings of a c-141 sloped wings came together as one east the other south and the last one west they just stopped in mid air. I was so excited that i began to aim the lantern flashlite at them turning it on and off. trying to communicate to them.  But after a short 5 minuets thy began to depart the area. two of the crafts began moving south.  the other one became interested in me that I was trying to signal it.  it then hoverd above my house,while not making any engine noises. it just stayed there. the underneath side was very visible. it looked like a bicycle wheel however it had walk ways underneath the craft with a lower dome shape in the middle of the underside of the craft. I was waving to it when the dome shape opend up like a small window appeared, and a man was waving back to me. after seeing a very bright lite came on I then became very scared. I ran inside the house and I threw the door closed As I was doing this I was screaming Mom there here. Mom was at her sewing machine looked out our big bay window from where she was sitting and said. Hurry lock the door. I started to run back to the door and just before I could reach the door the handle turned, and the door began to open. Iwas crying Mom hide therfe coming inside. but as i turn to run past the living room. I saw my Mom and she was levatating toward the door that had just opend. so I ran faster to my room. thinking that this my safe place. I hurridly looked for a place to hide then I hid in my closet and closed the door.  I was sure that they wouldn't find me.  It seemed that i was there for hours. I threw alot of clothes on top of me to cover me up. so that! they wo uld not find me.  But just then I felt the door open up and then they found me.  there were two of them a small little guy like me. And a much scarrier guy all dressed in black robe.  I was very frightend just looking at him.  then the small one put his hand to my arm.  And i was walking with him out of my room past the front door to where a lite beamed down from the middle of the dome where earlier i had seen the man in the window of the dome.  we went to the lite and went up ofer my house to the ship.  The room was pitch black I was sitting with this little guy on sompthing like a bench against the wall, he was holding a cylindrical object in his hand and motioning me to use it I didnt understand what to do with it. But i refused. I then turned to the middle of the room and there was there a bed with some guys that looked like doctors, but they wernt doctors.  They had my lying on the bed naked. they were doing things to her and she was incoherent.  I then saw a being come from an opening in the black wall.  After he left through the same place I went over there and I could not find any door so I stepped through the same place.  only that when I looked down,to my left and to my right all I saw were stars in space.  I kept walking,and came through to a room. where it looked like the place that ran the ship. there were about four gray beings I think these were workers and a being dressed in black robe.  He realy frightend me to look at him.  I started to walk around when I noticed these writtings on a couple of places they looked like heiroglyphics of a kind that I have never seen.  Just then i saw my little friend come over to where I was standing he was holding my arm and we began a tour of the ship I told him then that I wasnt afraid of him and I felt at peace with him.  He took me to a room where there was three other beings around a circular table. Where there was a handle and a few other objects that looked like control knobs.  I asked him how does this craft fly?  he showed me and that it was cont! rolled b y electro Magnatism.  I didnt understand what that ment but o""well I guess it was o.k.  Then we walked to three other rooms where there more of the beings.  And then we went to a room where there were three boys and two girls like me butg different. they showed no signs of feelings or talking.  I guess that these kids were about my age.  When another being came to me and said that they brought me there to teach the children how to play.  I said my toys are where we keep our garbage cans earloier in the day I had been playing with my army jeep and a tonka truck and horse trailer.  After a few minuets the being returned,with my toys.  And was angry and asked me if I,was a soldier.  I laughed and replied that I was only a child. then hew gave me my toys and i started to play with them on the floor of that room. Infront of the other children making noises like car motors reving up. then I gave these to othe other children and they smiled at me with pointed jagged teeth that scared me just to look at them.  Then it was my turn. we were in the black room again and it was my turn I was lying on the table naked. they the two doctors were grasping my stomach then the other one grabbed a long stem object and inserted it into my stomach.  I creid out it hurt so bad what they were doing to me. as i was screaming and crying one being came with another long stem object around to my head just abouve my neck and the back of my head he was inserting this object in to the back of my head.  It hurt so bad that I was yelling but like they dont understand what pain is. they just ignored my cries.  after such pain that i was experiencing i passed out.  I was weaking up when my small gray friend was there with me. we were in a room about 6x6 feet my Mom was there too sitting on a bench like I was I then asked my friend if I could go with them. He said that i could.  Then i asked my Mom if I could go and she said it was up to me and that I could go.  I then asked my friend how long it would be before we came back to my house. H! e said a bout 35 years.  And after that I said no. Iwant to go with my Mom.  I also asked him if I could have sompthing so I colud call him, when i wanted.  He gave me somepthing like a button.  And he said that the others would take it from me. if they found it on me when they let us go.  Well when I woke up I remberd everything that had happend to me and my Mom. I awoke underneath my bed in my room.  I then got up ran to my Moms room woke her up and she never to this day rememberd anything that had happend to us in our ordeal.

While driving to work, a cylindrical object passed across the road in front of my car at an altitude of approx 200 feet and about 300 feet ahead.  The object was cylindrical with a height to length ratio resembling 3 steel barrels end to end but twice the size.  Object was totally quiet, moving too slow to actually be capable of flight, and had no aerodynamics to support flight at all such as wings or other control surfaces.  I even checked overhead for a helicopter or anything else that could be transporting the item.  Both ends of the item were blunt.  I believe some sparking was evident at the rear with a trace of smoke, but not like a jet or rocket as we know it.  Color was gray to metalic with a few blinking lights. I stopped my car so I could follow the item until it disappeared behind a hill on the Northwest side of Tehran's city limit.  The interesting thing is that the item passed 90 degrees over the Eastern end of Tehran's Mehrabad Airport main runway traveling due North. Arriving at work at the airport I checked with military and commercial personnel to see what was going on thinking someone else had to see it considering the location.  Apparently no one else had seen it and no reports were filed.  I never spent too much time thinking about it after that until 3 years ago when I saw the 1976 reports and thought someone had the dates wrong.  The smaller object in that report was similar to what I had seen a year earlier. For info, at that time I was a USAF Master Sergeant working at the MAC terminal located on the Eastern aircraft parking ramp at Mehrabad.  I was the ranking NCO and was a jet aircraft mechanic.

I’m guessing at the date, even the exact year, since this happened so long ago but it was either 1976 or 77, in the summer and the time was around 2AM.  My wife and I had been visiting friends in Sunrise and were heading south on University Drive toward our apartment on 70th Ave, just south of NW 5th St. in Plantation, Fl. About a mile or so after we turned south onto University Drive from Oakland Park Blvd, I noticed a single red light off to the east. I didn’t think anything of it as I thought that there was a radio tower in that direction. We continued south on University and after we left the light at Sunrise Drive I noticed that the red light was still off to the east. I remember thinking, “That’s weird, that light should be behind us by now.” As we dove further south, maybe around Cleary Blvd, both my wife and I noticed that the light was moving SW and furthermore it looked like it was on an intersect path with University Drive. As we approached the traffic light at NW 5th St. and University Drive we both commented that the “light” was coming directly in our direction and was very close, within a few hundred yards. I stopped the car at the traffic light and we both looked out our windows and watched this ‘thing’ fly directly over us at a very slow speed...maybe 25 MPH, if that fast. The craft was also at a very low altitude, maybe 500-750 feet. The strange thing was that neither of us heard any engine sound at all. Not a prop engine, jet engine or chopper engine was to be heard. There was no sound at all that either of us could make out.  After sitting there for what seemed several minutes, probably in shock, I made the turn east onto NW 5th St. heading toward 70th Ave where I had to go south one block to the entrance to our apartment building. As I made the turn I asked my wife something to the effect of “You saw that right?”  Yes was the answer and started to talk about what we had just seen. Although neither of us could clearly make out a distinct shape, we knew that we had seen “something” and whatever it was it was strange to say the least. This discussion continued for another minute or so when we both went quiet. There, dead ahead of us, out in the eastern sky, was another red light. This was probably around the 73rd Ave block of NW 5th St., just west of the new city hall. As we approached the intersection of NW 70 Ave this red light suddenly erupted into a display of different colored lights. There were red, green and yellow lights flashing on and off in no distinct pattern for maybe 10 seconds and, again it returned to just the single red light. I pulled over onto a swale area where there was a mailbox on the right side of the road. I told my wife to get out of the car as I wanted us both to make sure that we were seeing the same thing. The red light seemed to be stationary for a minute or two as we stood there watching. Again I asked my wife if she had just seen the light display that I had seen. She answered yes and then we both observed that the light seemed to be moving toward our position. We stood there on the side of the road watching as this craft passed almost directly overhead. It was, like the first craft, about 500-700 feet altitude. The night was still, not a car in sight and I had cut the engine of the car. This time we both could make out a distinct, but faint, low toned hum as the ‘thing’ passed over. We both could also make out, against the night sky, that the red light was on the bottom of the craft and that it was circular in shape, almost a perfect circle it seemed. The craft again was moving very slowly, 20 M! PH or so , and heading south by southwest. When we noticed this we both said, almost simultaneously, that it looked like it was heading to meet up with the first craft that we had seen just a few minutes earlier at University and NW 5th St. We watched as long as we could see the light, got into the car and drove the block south on 70th Ave to our apartment. I immediately went to the kitchen phone and called the Plantation police department to ask if anyone had reported a unidentified craft at either of the intersections where we had witnessed these things. The officer kind of laughed and said no. I then called the Ft. Lauderdale airport and asked if they had anything on radar out in our area. Again the answer was no.  Neither my wife or I ever made an official report of any kind during our time together. We separated in 1989 and divorced in 1992 and lost contact so I don’t know if she has ever reported it. I have only told a handful of people about this until now and am only reporting it now because my current wife found this web page. After reading a few of the hundreds of reports I felt compelled to add my own story. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

As the light hit me I was paralyzed. It was quite obvious that the source of the light began on the ground and was lifting upward outside my window.  It stopped as suddenly as it began and left my ears ringing.  I was about 16 at the time, was home alone, and was terrified.   I have researched thousands of reports over the years, but none similar to my experience.  I want to know what the hell happened to me that night!!!

Description of Sighting:  At roughly 0100 on the morning of August 28, 2009, five people were star gazing on a U.S. Forest Service road on the east border of the Indian Heaven Wilderness.  We had a fairly good view of the sky towards the East.  A person sighted a blinking white light.  This person alerted the rest of the group and all five people began to observe this light.  It would blink on, then blink off.  It seemed as if every time it blinked off, it would blink on again at a different point in the sky.  At first it seemed to have a general direction of South to North.  However, after 4 or 5 blinks it moved in the opposite direction.  Every blink had the same intensity of white light, however altitude and direction seemed to vary.  It made one final blink, turned off and then an even brighter white light came on and accelerated at a downward trajectory towards us.  It seemed that it was going to hit us when it angled up into the sky at thousands of miles per hour leaving a reddish white trail that arced across the entire visible sky.  The composition of the trail the craft left behind seemed to have a reddish white, very bright dusty appearance. P.S. Upon returning from our trip, I was looking at my digital camera pictures.  I have found numerous photographic anomalies in 5 or so pictures of dark objects in the general direction of our sighting over and in front of the Western side of Mt. Adams.  I would be willing to send these photos via email upon request.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,45.9798,-121.5312

I do not know the exact day. I am positive that it was the summer of 1978. I was 11 years old. My father was stationed in Baton Rouge for one year working with the National Guard. He was in Engineering. I had the luxury of flying all over Europe with him since the age of 5. I had been exposed to aircraft of all types. Years later, I joined the Air Force and compared all of the aircraft that I saw daily with what I saw back in 1978. I know that I saw a UFO. My mother, father and I had gone to a carnival. We were on our way back home. The entrance to our neighborhood was a long wide tree lined street. There were no tall buildings. We lived in a quiet suburban middle class neighborhood. My father drove a golden 1978 Cutlass Supreme. I sat on the back right passenger side behind my mother. There was absolutely no noise. No radio on. No one was talking. I was an only child. To this day I do not know why I looked out of the rectangular window. The one thing that I clearly remember was that,although it was dark,there was a large moon and the sky was absolutely clear with no clouds. I looked out and up. I watched the biggest craft I have ever seen in my life hovering just above the tree tops. The craft was following our car! I remember bein astounded by the fact that there was NO SOUND! I had ridden on airplanes. I had watched hot air balloons take off. I had been on the ground when airplanes fly low over a parade. The sound should have been deafening. All I could hear was myself breathing. The craft was oval. The top was rounded. For approximately 4 minutes there were no lights. Just before the craft flew away a row of lights came on along the outermost edge of the widest part of the oval. I remember red and cream colored lights. They were not blinking like a turn signal. They slowly faded in an out. And they did not all come on at the same time. It seemed systematic from front to back. I watched the craft follow our car for about 1 minute. It took me that long to find my voice. I said ""Look!"" My dad was driving and could not look. I said ""Somebody! Look!"" Instead of looking out the side window my mom said ""What do you want us to look at?"" I was so frustrated because I could not formulate the descriptive words necesary. My mother was being stubborn and did not look in any direction on purpose. I said ""Dad! Please look!"" He tried to look. To this day, this memory brings tears to my eyes because he tried to look. He could not see from where he sat. During the entire conversation I never took my eyes off of the UFO. What happened next confirmed my belief that this was a UFO. By now, we have travelled at least a mile down the road. The craft had followed our car the entire time. Once the lights came on, the craft simply did a right angle and flew away in an straight line so fast it was unbelievable. The craft did NOT BANK right. I followed it with my eyes as long as I could. This whole event took between 5-7 minutes. I remember thinking that the craft had to be as tall as a 6 story building. Maybe taller. I think that it was as long as a couple of football stadiums. The bottom of the craft was flat. I did not see any windows. I felt that the color of the object was greyish. It was definitely a matte finish. Not metallic.

Myself and a friend named Jimmy were hiking in the mountains around Big Sur all day and were tired and wanting a place to stay for the night. We stopped at one of the only motels along the road called Lucia in an area which was otherwise quite wild, and asked for a room but for various reasons were not able to stay there so began hiking south on highway 1 to the nearest campground. It was dark and we were very tired but there were no cars and we were walking so we had no choice but to continue. We left the motel (there was a gas station there too) and when we got far enough away from there that there were no more lights visible from the road we had the ocean to our right and the mountains coming right off the road to the left. We noted that any plane or ship passing the area could be heard more clearly as it echoed off the mountains. As we walked we looked out over the ocean and noted a silent triangular amber glowing craft hoovering above the ocean and casting a very large circle of light that appeared like a search light of some sort. We immediately realized that it was not from Earth. As we watched it began a lateral ascent, parallel with the shore and it dropped something amber glowing into the ocean. At that point it began leaving a phosphorescent trail of light resembling a jet stream behind it and then a few seconds later it dropped another glowing object into the ocean and continued to move slowly upward in a linear rise while still trailing the phosphorescent light. It was moving slowly and appeared to be about 1/2-1 mile out on the ocean.  Abruptly, it turned left and shot into space. My friend through up his arms and yelled “Wait! Take me with you!” at which point from a tiny yellow star in the night sky it sent back two phosphorescent beams of light that started out as superimposed triangles which came straight at us where we were standing and eventually stop! ped as a formation hoovering over the water near shore and reflecting in the ocean below us. We both agreed that the formation resembled a vertebrae if you were looking down a spinal cord. It had a black hole in the middle of it and 3 spines coming off of it like a vertebrae. That light stayed in the air for about 10 min. before disappating. The jetstreams were there even longer. We were entirely energized by the experience which has forever changed my view of the world. I had reported the incident to the local paper in Santa Cruz, California the day after it happened to see if anyone else had reported such a siting and it was published in the paper which I didn't realize until I was sitting several days later on the beach covered with poison oak from the hike we did there and I was approached by a guy on the beach who asked me where I got the  poison oak. I told him Big Sur and he told me about the article. He said he had lived at he campground where we slept that night and that there were all sorts of strange lights coming from behind the mountains there but when they would try to approach them, they would meet with force fields that would make it impossible for them to get closer. He felt certain also that there were very strange things going on there and wasn't surprised to hear our story.  I have this incident documented in a journal which is why the dates are so clear but the memory is as clear as though I saw it a minute ago. I have never heard of another encounter like this one. It definitely felt as though they knew we were there and that the light show at the end was for us. It was utterly spectacular. With all recent crop circles coming around the world, I have become very interested in becoming a part of the movement to understand and/or communicate with whatever is doing this. I feel that they are studying us like we study animal life on our own planet. We are primitive to them and they are being careful not to come on too strong, just giving us beautiful crop art and occasional sitings of their otherwise invisible craft. I heard recently that we have learned how to make things invisible and that this was learned through alien technology. I want to know more about this. How involved are you with the crop circle phenomena as it relates to the UFO sitings? Is there any way I can help with this? Please contact me.

I have written several times . Many of my reports do not have accurate dates. I have had several things happen.  Anyway.. I have a question that I am hoping someone will have an answer to.   When I was in 6th grade , approx 11 years old, my family and I witnessed an exstreamly large craft go from the west to the east side of town and directly over our home. It started out looking like a brilliant , bright  white light traveling very slowly from the west phoenix area. We were alerted to it by my brother who was on his way home with his father who lived in Scottsdale. He noticed it while on the freeway and was very concerned to see it still in the sky when he arrived to our home which was at Gaudalupe and Dobson rd. My whole family- Mother ,grandparents , step father and one of my brothers friends- all went outside to see what he was so upset about. We observed this  object coming closer to us . It was , no joke, about the size of a football field. It didn't have lights on it like it looked from far away. As it got closer we could see it was illuminating from within. It made no noise, just a low kind of warm humming sound. Not like a blimp. It was flying  low and it was  exstreamly large. I would say if you were to hold your hand out you would have to put two fingers together to cover it. My step father worked at air research at the time and even he was puzzled as to what it was. It was not a blimp, plan, or helicopter. It looked like it had windows completely around it, or possibly metal  panels and if I remember right it almost (im not trying to make a joke) but it kinda looked like the starship enterprise. Only in the sense that It seemed to have two sections to it. It was moving super slow .When it reached the end of our block it swayed a bit and you could see it was wider that our street. It then sped up and took of ,very fast north east and was gone. Absolutely gone. The next day I said something to my teacher.. He got very excited and made me go to the principles office and draw a picture for the principle. They both questioned me.. My teacher had seen it also and was using me to try to help prove his story.. It was very outrageous and I am sure very unbelievable if you hadent seen this for yourself.. I am getting to my question.. please be patient.  .. Now when I was sixteen, living in the same home, I had a very unexplainable event. I was coming home from my best friend house .. She lived 2 miles from me. I left at exactly 8:50PM .. I know because we use to watch the Waltanns religiously- of all shows!! anyway,  the show ended at 9pm. I was also due in at 9 , if I was late I would be grounded.. At sixteen that is the worst thing in the world to have happen.. My parents were strict and I was never late. So I pulled in front of the house , shut off my VW bug and then I was surrounded by the most intense blue-white light. My car kinda rumbled .. Its very hard to explain. I at the time thought I had been hit by lightning,I could feel the energy. Thats what I attributed it to at that second,  without realizing it was a totally clear night. The color of the light was  not a color I can explain.  It was blueish white. It consumed me and the whole car. Then it was over and I jumped out of the car and ran in. I was greeted with two VERY upset parents. I was an hour late. I had completely forgot what had just happened.. Even when trying to defend myself. I had no excuse and was very confused.. All I know is I left at 8:50 and walked in at 10pm.  I called my friend sobbing, screaming at her for making me late.. She defended the fact of when I left and said I was crazy. I was traumatized because I was not allowed to see my boyfriend for a week, or talk on the phone.. I didnt recall the light thing for about 3 to four years later. To this day my friend remembers the event.. We are still very good friends.. We still cant explain why i was late or what happened.. I am writing wondering if anyone has had a similar event.. If anyone has seen something then while at the same location they have a loss of time or some other unusual event.. Is it possible that the first time we saw the craft it was the first of several visits? I am not making much sense.. I guess I am wondering -if it is possible that abductions occur, do you think they make a planned route that they trav! el?.. Do they scope out , or survey areas and people  first?  I am confused and still want to understand what happened.. I have had 2 other events in my life where I have had the same light consume me. It is an unforgettable color I have never seen duplicated, even in the movies.  Only one of the other  times  I have  a witness to my time loss. Again, at the time you forget what has just happened, and are left just completely confused. .  All the times I remember seeing the light , but never seem to be able to comprehend it or associate with what is or has happened. I am not a very good writer, I hope this makes sense to someone.. I really hope I can get some kind of understanding of this.. Is there any other people in Az that something like this has happened to them? One thing I did not mention.. The friend of my  brothers who witnessed the ship with my family the first time, he still to this day will not talk about it.. He will admit he saw it, but CAN  not elaborate. I tried to talk with him about 6 years ago and he gets all sweaty and freaked out.. He actually almost crys.. He cant talk about it for some reason.. Im wondering if  possibly something happened to him and he remembers it too much.. Or is it possible he had bad things done to him, or ma bey his mind cant comprehend something that happened to him that night? I am hoping someone can give me some kind of answer or insight... ..

I was driving to pick up my step daughter from a girl scout meeting at the Farmington town hall. I was traveling along back country roads to the town hall some 10 miles away. I was on Collette Rd when I noticed the car in front of me pull to the side, get out and stare across the road. I looked to the left and saw a very large silhouette shape directly above a small lumber yard. I stopped about 100 feet behind the other car and got out as well. It was dark and the craft had no lights on it but with ambient light the silhouette was clearly visible. It was about 50 ft above the lumber yard building. Id guess it was at least 100 yards long and 30 yards high. It clearly was larger then the building and was about 250 ft. from where we stood. I watched it for about 4 to 5 minutes and it slowly started drifting silently at an angle away from us. There were a lot of stars that night and its shape clearly covered stars as it moved. We both got in our cars and drove off. The lead car went straight and I was turning left just about  300 ft ahead. I kept the thing in sight as I drove until I made the turn when I lost sight of it in the dark. I drove the 7 miles or so to get my step daughter and her friend who were the last kids at the town hall waiting at the front door to be picked up. They both ran up , got in the car excited and told me about the same craft  I had seen , that had passed directly above them.  I then realized it was drifting off in that general direction across farm lands while I ran parallel east bound. We compared stories as I had seen it from the side and she saw it from below. She described it as two large separate fuselages connected by  a wing type assembly. It made no sound  at all and had no lights. I always wondered if anyone else in the area had seen this that night.

It was late and I was supposed to be asleep but I was kind of playing around in the dark. My little sister was in the bed with me but she was sleep. Well, I heard a sound outside that sounded like humming machinery. Even thought it was like a gentle hum it was very loud. This is why I noticed it. At first I thought it was a car waiting for someone outside. Especially because it seemed to sound pull a little like a running engine. But it suddenly occured to me that a car doesn't sound like that because its too loud. But what was wierd was that it was quiet but loud at the same time. QUIET AND LOUD. Get it?????  I looked out the window and it was a flying saucer floating in the air outside and to the right of my grandmothers house, over the street and partially the sidewalk, but lower than my second floor window. It may have been the same height or a little higher but because it was a lil maybe abiout twenty feet away and I was seven years old, my proportion of height is slightly distorted. Here's the Gods Honest truth: This thing was a silver, disc shaped, center was slightly raised and rounded, red, blue and yellow lights around it that seemed to throb with the throbbing hum. I immediately ran into my aunt who was on the phone in the room next to me with the light on. She told me to get outta here and go to bed. I went back to the window and the thing was crazy because it looked just like first encounters of the third kind, but it was very small to fit on my street. Something telepathically asked me if I was alone, and I telepathically answered NO, I began to look around because I was really astounded that no one was looking out of their windows. Remember the saucer was making an extremely loud throbbing hum sound that sort of radiated from it......BUT THE SOUND WAS QUIET! Does that make sense? I know it doesn't, but I have no way else to describe it. I remember trying to telepathically ask it why it was little and if there was others around,and why couldn't any one here it? I was only seven, and I had no idea about telepathy- When I say I was telepathically asking it - I mean these were the questions that came into my head at once but I knew somehow that it could hear me- Especially since IT ACTUALLY ASKED ME IF I WAS ALONE... I will never forget that as long as I live. I maybe told one or two people in my life . I know how ridiculous it sounds but it was very real. So much so that it is what it is.

Since there was no electricity, there was no light pollution and we got a good look.  It was about the size of a tablet of aspirin held at arms length.

At which time I climbed to the highest area I could climb to.   Upon my observation platform (rock) I was able to watch the ball of fire approach me.  As it grew near I could see that it was a structure that was a saucer shaped.  Fire was shooting from the portholes outside of the rim of the craft.  It looked like a wheel spinning around the outside of the craft.  I got the feeling that the craft was in trouble it made no noise and I felt no heat.  It was moving approx. 20-30-MPH  Just putting.  It traveled over the top of my head just putting going very slow.  I was able to see the portholes where fire was emerging.  I watched the vehicle travel 20-30MPH creeping along the mountains.  After I lost sight of the vehicle I returned to my truck and continued my journey.  When I reached Barstow, CA, the next morning, I listened to a local radio station.  The radio said people from California- New Mexico had seen the object.  The US Air Force said it was a Russian booster rocket had re-entered the atmosphere and burnt up.  I witnessed this object in controlled flight.  It slowly made its way NE along the mountains.  I was able to make out details of the bottom and sides of the vehicle because it was only 100-150 feet above me.  I heard no sound and there was no heat.  The next morning the Barstow radio station announced that it was a Russian booster rocket that had blown up.  I know that it was not a Russian booster rocket.  I had a feeing that it was in trouble.

I know there were other people that saw it but I was so awe struck that I didn't know if anyone  else was around.  I have never seen this kind of technology since.

The area where I lived was 2 miles north of town. Pop. 12,000 in the town, 40,000 in whole the county. As I approached the window to see what they were, I observed over 10 small lights which alternately flashed blue, green, and reddish orange. They all seemed to be moving in a hap-hazard manner. I then noticed further up in the sky a much larger elongated craft, this object had the same color lights around it with the exclution of of the reddish-orange. I noticed a steady white light on the bottom of craft off to one end. This white light was not flashing but appeared to be from an internal light source. The distance from my location seemed to be at least a half mile at other end of a valley. The larger object was stationary throughout the sighting till the very end. I aproximate the size to be at least 200 to 300 feet long and 75-100 feet accross. The smaller lights may have been 10-15 feet across. Upon seeing this i called my mother who was in her room adjancet to mine. She looked out her window and observed the same scene. The smaller objects began to move up to the larger craft and back down below the horizon. After 20-30 seconds i spotted the objects rising back to larger craft. After 8 to 9 minutes of this action, I heard a loud roaring sound. We noticed 2 objects heading toward the larger craft but they were different from the others. As soon as i noticed them the smaller objects started to disappear inside the larger craft. The larger craft began to move away from the approaching objects, slowly at first, then at a great speed till it disappeared from view. The approaching objects gave off a loud roaring sound that gave me to believe they were some type of jets. The pursuing objects suddenly had 2 large bright orangish white lights at rear, (I assumed afterburners). The large craft well out ! accelera ted the pursuing objects as they approached the area it occupied. After this sighting, my mother was quite un-nerved and had to sit down for 45 minutes to calm down. Side note: in the area it is very rural and only a few families lived in the area below the where the craft were spotted. Also the closest airbase is at least 80 miles to the west in Columbus, Ohio.

As I passed the City of Adelanto, on Hwy 395, I accelerated to approximately 120 mph because I was running late and this speed would get me to work on time.  Shortly after leaving the city limits I saw a brilliant flashing light (Strobe) below the horizon off in the distance where I was heading.  At this point the sun had not risen but was just minutes away from rising.  I was fixated on the flashing trying to figure out what it was.  It continued to flash with irregularly timed  pulses until I was about 2  miles or so away.  (Close enough so I was able to see it when it wasn’t flashing).   I slowed down to about 70 mph to try to figure out what it could be.  I stared intensely at the object as I was passing it.  It was now between me and the Eastern horizon.

I am an amateur astronomer so I looked up all the time and I didn't ever remember seeing a star formation like this one over the woods across the way.  I lived on a dead end street that only had three houses on it.  The woods were the 4 acre wild backyard of a catholic high school.  The objects looked like stars but were brighter than polaris, they were colored white. I thought it was strange but didn't really notice anything odd until I looked out again an hour later and they had moved.  At that time the triangle was rotated to point left.  Originally the triangle pointed down, then an hour later it pointed left then an hour after that it pointed up. At first I thought they might be helicopters, but they were bright enough that I should have been able to make out the other lights on the aircraft if they were aircraft, and they had been flying too long in the same place.  The star-like objects were each at least a degree apart, I'm an amatuer astonomer so I can judge distance in a night sky.  After two hours I noticed that the objects began to rotate faster and faster then after 15-20 seconds of fast rotation they shot off in different directions so fast that I could not follow them.

I am writing this so I don't forget the event years from now.   It was Saturday August 29, 2009.  On my way out of Boulder City, Nevada, at approximately 12 noon PST I saw a motionless object in the sky.  It was located over the Mountains as you drive on Veteran's Memorial Parkway heady out of town.  The object was darker than the hazy afternoon sky and appeared to be square in shape.  It had definite lines and was not a cloud.  When I first saw it I thought it was a kite or something caught in a power line as I tried to judge my depth perception.   As I continued driving I watched it sitting motionless.  It became more apparent that this was actually something in the sky above the mountains and not some sort of optical illusion. I watched the object as I was parked at the stoplight at Boulder Highway and Veteran's Memorial Parkway.  I was anxious to get a better look at it by getting on the highway.   Before the light changed to green the object start to move.  It moved away very smoothly and disappeared into the hazy cloud cover.  It gradually disappeared almost like fading away.  It was moving towards the Las Vegas valley when I lost site of it.   As I drove into Henderson I looked to the sky but there was no site of it.

My wife and I had driven to Wellfleet’s Duck Harbor beach on the bay (western) side of the Cape Cod peninsula. From there one can see the sun set over Cape Cod Bay, making it one of the few spots on the east coast where one can see the sun set over water, though in actuality it may be setting over the Massachusetts mainland about 30 miles distant. It was a clear evening, as a high pressure area had just arrived within 24 hours. There were no large clouds to speak of but the normal atmospheric haze of pollutants made for a beautiful sunset. The sun set about 7:10 pm EDT, and about 10 minutes after that I began scanning the western horizon with binoculars to glory in the subtle shadings of red and orange in the vicinity of the sunset. On one particular scan, I was panning left (south) and came across what to me initially looked like a passenger plane descending in the direction of Boston’s Logan Airport. It was about the right size for a large jet in the distance.  It was about one binocular field over the water. By the way the binoculars are 8 x 40's. I made the mental note of “plane” and continued panning south looking at the subtle atmospheric shadings as well as at boats and sea birds. I then began panning back to the right (north) and came across the ‘plane’ in what seemed to be the exact same location as before. I looked more closely at it and could detect no wings, it looked like a very dark rectangle set against the lighter orange-red haze. It was above the lowest darkest haze lines, the rectangle shape was distinctive, outlined against the lighter orange colored haze – definitely an object over the water – but closer to me than the coast of Plymouth, MA, visible in the far distance. I asked myself if this could be a plane after all, but I looked even harder to discern any movement against the background and saw none. In order to test this, I took my binoculars off the object and scanned straight down towards the water line and beach to get a fix of where the object was. When I came back, the object was still there. I said to myself “too bad you don’t have your birding scope”, for in that I would have had a very good view. I again tried my experiment of fixing the object against the water and beach, but when I came back a second time the object was no longer there. I scanned to both the right and left to see if it had moved but there was no object in sight. Now I can’t say I saw a UFO, because I saw no odd movement, but I am quite sure there was an object out there, apparently over the water and not moving. It was definitely not a structure in Plymouth or elsewhere on the Massachusetts coast.  It was just an odd sighting, perhaps explainable.

It was Friday before hunting season- so it was either September 25 or October 2, 1987- since Oregon’s hunting season is always the last weekend of September or first weekend of October (I checked online to see if I could figure out what date is correct using Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife with no success.)  My friend and I were seven miles northwest of Roseburg, Oregon, in a sparsely populated area (no houses for at least a mile away) checking out a hunting location that I was very familiar with and it was just before twilight.  We sat down to rest next to a creek-we were in a fairly deep, narrow valley between two hills-  when my friend noticed two yellowish lights at a distance about two thousand yards up the valley.   At first, I did not think much about it since I knew of a gravel road at the end of the valley and thought it was probably just headlights of a car, and told him of such.  We were about to get up since it was now almost dark-and had about a quarter mile to hike back to the truck-when I again notice the two yellow lights were now closer and heading directly down the canyon towards us. I still did not yet think they were UFO’s or anything out of the ordinary when all of sudden we could hear animal(s) moving  in our direction away from the direction of the yellow lights- I couldn’t see the animals since it was almost dark now and the area had enough brush and trees to hide them as well.   At the same time we were listening to the animals, I also started to see small (about 1 inch) red glowing “sparkling” spheres appearing at the base of a tree twenty feet away from us, towards the direction of the yellow “lights.”   These red spheres, suddenly appeared at the base, then started to swirled around the tree, all the time rotating upward, and then just as suddenly disappear once they reach the top of the tree.  More and more red spheres appeared around the trees in front of us when I started to asked my friend if he was seeing what I was seeing (I was worried that I was losing my mind) when he shakily replied, “Yes.”  I once again looked at the yellow “lights,” which were now close enough to see that they were not yellow lights at all, but two glowing, yellowish/orange, oblong spheres or “crafts,”- about six feet long and 3 feet high.  The crafts were about ten or fifteen feet above the oak trees and twenty feet apart- still fixed on the same course, now about eighty yards away, and still heading down the valley towards us.   These oblong crafts did not make any sound and did not rotate that I could see whatsoever but maintained a slow, methodical speed and spatial distance between themselves and the trees, all the while moving in our direction.  There was no propeller, wing, rudder or prop whatsoever on these “crafts” that I could see or detect.  They did not appear to be flimsy like a balloon nor rigid metallic either, but almost smooth, round-cornered plastic looking objects.  In addition, they did not glow from within nor from without, but within the skin of the craft itself.  Also, underneath the two spheres the ground was brightly lit up. The light that they emitted was strange in that you could not see the source of the light emitting from the spheres itself, like you would from a headlamp, instead the it was “magically” lit up underneath the spheres and the edges of the light did not slowly diffuse but stopped very abrupt… almost like it the light was contained!?!  This was becoming too much for my senses… (I will admit I was starting to get freaked out, feeling quite alone even with my friend there in the woods and even though I hunted in this area alone all my life) we both stood up and I said let’s get the heck out of here.   As soon as we moved, the spheres moved in an instance directly overhead and both of us were now bathed in the light.  I stood, in awe, frozen, looking at these THINGS, when one of the spheres shot out a red glowing disk (the same color of the smaller red spheres) straight upwards and then the red disk exploded in a brilliant flash of red light.   I felt frozen as if I was knocked unconscious and the next thing I know I am running.  My friend is also running beside me and we are both running towards my truck not saying a word when I reach the top of a hill I see another object or craft that is triangular in shape that appears high and quite far in the distance further past where my truck is located. This triangular craft is hard to describe how big it is because I cannot reference how far away it is, but it is definitely triangular and of decent size, as well as, far away.  The craft appears to be more metallic looking, in that it is straight lines and appears to be rotating or spinning and has three sides like a pyramid.  It either has three lights or sides or corners of red, silver, and blue, that either interchange or spins giving it an appearance of blinking or spinning motion.  It also appears that the bottom side arches or wobbles back and forth, giving it the “blinking” or jittering effect?!?.    I cannot describe this craft any further as to the fact that I was moving rather fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Around 8:40 pm, a light was visible out the front window of my car, but toward the right side.  I’d estimate it was approximately 30 degrees right of straight ahead.  This means it was probably approximately straight west of my location.   The sky was dark.  I saw a white fireball descending diagonally as it moved from right to left.  It looked to me like what I would expect a meteor to look like, and initially it moved in a straight line.  It produced a white light and had a tail of “sparks” behind it as it moved, like a comet.  It looked something like certain kinds of fireworks I have seen that carry a flare and trail sparks behind.  From time to time, it appeared that a burning chunk would break off and fall behind into the tail because the main light would flare up a! little bit and a brighter portion would then be visible moving into the tail portion.   So far, it appeared to me to be a meteor.  However, after it descended traveling from right to left, it leveled off and proceeded to the left while climbing again.  Once it had climbed again, it appeared to stop in the air for a while before moving down and to the right.  It moved around several times, remaining visible for what was probably 2-3 minutes.   Finally it rose up, stopped trailing its tail, and became small and indistinguishable from a star in both size and color.  It was then obscured by some trees I drove past and I wasn’t able to determine if it was still there after that.   I didn’t see it move again.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,37.8215,-97.0068

The full description is posted here: http://www.whatiwanttoknow.org/wordpress/2008/10/01/my-ufo-story/   I am contributing this because I would like to know if anyone in that area observed similar phenomena or craft. The fact that people can determine my identity is of no concern. Note that 8 of 9 of observed craft were ""ordinary UFOs"" but the 9th one was not.  ==  Contact with an investigator: that is up to you. I'll be glad to talk to someone, primarily as I said my reason for posting this information is to find if anyone in that area in that general time frame (or later, I suppose) had seen similar things. It is easiest to reach me by email. ((COPY OF TEXT FOUND ON WEBSITE INDICATED ABOVE)) My UFO story Before I myself saw UFOs, I had no strong opinion whether they existed - I assumed they could exist, but then we’re used to hard and incontrovertible evidence, and the lack of that - as experience available to other people, people who hadn’t already seen such evidence - makes it “hard to swallow” in many cases. So, if some group of people in some metropolitan area reported the same phenomenon and the “reason for the illusion” was not convincing, those people have seen UFOs, but that’s about as far as it goes. There’s nothing to do with the information but spread it to people willing to believe it. You wish you, the original observer, could replay the event for an audience and then they would agree. I don’t remember any specific events I’ve seen on TV, but I remember the number of them and their variation. It struck me that what seemed likely was that we do have ET visitors, and not just a few. What rules they follow to stay so relatively unobserved, I have no idea. Perhaps they have a Visitor’s Association, some compact as to how to deal with Terra of Sol. Ground rules. I’m sorry, I’m teasing. But maybe they do have a Prime Directive of non-interference. Perhaps our over-steroided secret military is playing gags on us and having fun inventing variations on the “craft” theme for chuckles. In what I observed, I don’t think the human race, in any secret laboratory, has yet produced any technology that could make an object move as I observed a particular UFO move. I only saw actual UFOs once (a total of nine craft), but may have had an earlier sighting at Crane Beach, which I’ll describe. I tell you flatly that what I saw was no illusion and no trick of nature. It was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at roughly 3:30 AM, 12 January 1988*. I lived at the end of Dudley Street at the time, near the Arlington border and an eight-block hike from the end of the Red Line. It was the dead of night in Winter, absolutely, perfectly still and silent, with a thick covering of snow over everything. The sky was clear and dark as it could be being near Boston, the streetlights did little to interfere. The stars were out. I was unemployed at the time so being up at 3:30 AM was usual. Even by January 12th I had not shut the storm windows and didn’t want the extra cold draft anymore, so I opened the inner window - I have to guess and am probably wrong but I think the window faced away from Boston, so a map should show the direction of my view. I couldn’t get the storm window to close from the inside, so I leaned out of the (third floor) window so that I could rotate to face the window to start closing it from the outside. I managed to face the window, but not at the angle I wanted to so I tried to “unrotate” and try again, and in that moment something caught my attention, and I turned my head to see what it was. I saw “phosphorescent orange” things for a moment but had some impression of sparks to one side of my view, so I quickly looked for them to my left (remember I am looking upward at about a 45-degree angle - looking left was looking up at about 60-degrees.) By the time my gaze had shifted, the sky there was black, so I looked back for the orange impression and now I saw eight craft. It took me about 150 milliseconds to quit worrying that I was seeing UFOs and just look at them, because of course I had never seen them before and I wanted to see everything I could. The eight craft were in a perfect formation, a sort of octagonal oval. Imagine a square, the four points of the square are four craft, and then at equal distances fore and aft the lead and tail pairs of craft are inset somewhat, making an “oval”. They were, I’m guessing, roughly 150 feet off the ground and at first sight about one or two city blocks away. They were gliding absolutely smoothly and noiselessly - no sound reached me. I would estimate their air speed as about 20 mph - not fast. At first sight I was able to see them in some relief (their sides as well as their bottoms.) I’m sorry to disappoint you, but they in fact looked like a classical Hollywood flying saucer**, more or less. I recall a dome shape atop; I don’t recall whether there were or weren’t seams between the dome portion and the rest. Dome-to-side came down curving, and it seemed there was the classical “skirt” flange along the bottom edge of the craft, that “foil” at the bottom edge familiar from movies. The craft themselves (their undersides) were of a similar oval shape (the phrase “horseshoe crab” wishes I would use it.) They appeared to have flat bottoms with a particular lighting; the spectacular thing about these craft was their color and light; they ‘glowed’ softly, as if luminescent/phosphorescent, a particular color which I describe as “salmon orange”. The light came from every part of the craft, but there was no apparent “reason” they should seem bathed in the light that I could see. The bottom sides of the craft had a thick annulus of a darker orange color meeting the outer edge, and spaced at intervals within the annulus all around were dark squares. For some reason I assumed those had to do with levitation and propulsion. In the center of the bottom, enclosed by the annulus, the color was again as bright as on the outside. In the time it took to observe these details, the craft had closed the distance to my house by half and I could only observe the undersides of the craft. Then something again caught my attention “out of the corner of my eye” to my left, and I turned quickly to see what it was. This time it took a moment to see what was happening, and my jaw dropped. An object - smaller than the other craft, more spherically symmetrical, almost cubic but impossible to tell, lit more strongly than the others with the same color light, was making short excursions in free space that appeared to violate the laws of conservation of momentum. It zipped. I could follow its movements but it was exceedingly fast. It appeared to be even closer to me at one point, perhaps 80 feet above, but it zipped off - always in straight lines - at crazy and acute angles from its previous direction - instantaneously. And it did this at a rate of two to three times per second. I’ll estimate that the straight-line paths were 50 to 100 feet in length. This thing moved as if it were a bullet ricocheting inside a steel-walled chamber, but it was doing this in free space, in three dimensions. I had the chance to observe about 7-10 such cycles before it passed out of view over my house, and still astonished I wheeled back to catch the others but they passed overhead and out of view in a few more seconds. I wasted several seconds fussing with the window to get it closed, and then I raced to the front of the house to the veranda but there was no sign of them on what I thought might be their path. Chickenshit that I was (how many people get to see UFOs?), and living on the third floor with no shoes or socks on in the dead of Winter, I regret that I did not just run downstairs and outdoors, snow be damned and look for them. I think I rationalized at the time that I had seen them in any case, so not seeing more of them was not going to erase that I had now seen them. I think the “sparks” I first thought I saw was this ninth craft, that when I tried to see the “sparks” the craft had simply been blocked from view by the house. I remember the sense of confusion in my visual cortex as to what to look at, and I think this craft was what actually drew my attention to begin with, even though it initially passed out of view almost immediately. I got the impression that this ninth craft was some sort of scout for the other craft, a lookout. I wondered that they came at all, coming when they did means everyone’s asleep - and not a soul was stirring that night (in that neighborhood) but me. I wondered if they detected my presence or observation - if it mattered to them, whether they had taken notice and made any changes to escape observation. It seemed to me they deviated their course because they did not emerge on the other side of the house where I thought they should (see Figure 1.) They would have to have changed course 15 or more degrees, based on where I didn’t see them. Oh well, that one time. Except for Crane Beach. A few weeks before this sighting, in my Noir mood being depressed and unemployed, I went to Crane Beach - I’d gone once before. I always took binoculars, I had a spectacular 7×50 that I could see the moons of Jupiter with (try that! It’ll rock your world.) Again it was the dead, dead of night (probably in the same time frame, between 0315 and 0400), nobody around, nice and spooky, at the water’s edge, the Atlantic. I was there for a while looking at stars. The sky was very clear. Finally I got a little restless to get going, watched a few jets, and then saw another “jet” - but this one was interesting. It was brighter than the other planes but it was colored, whereas the other jets all used white lights, this one was - slightly reddish orange. The same color as the later UFOs. I thought that was curious and I followed it, and then another thing struck me: this thing appeared to be miles and miles out to sea, yet it was traveling really fast across the horizon proceeding South, which meant that its objective speed had to be even faster. It was much faster than the lazy jets nearing Boston. There is a spit of land (Rockport) ’south’ of Crane Beach (Figure 2.) Against the 2D backdrop of the coastline with the spit in the “upper right” (Figure 3), the object seemed to near the spit and then made a change of path - which astonished me because it was almost exactly orthogonal to its original path. It didn’t bat an eyelash or change its speed in any way but it executed a 90-degree turn instantaneously (like the cars hitting corners in “Tron”) and proceeded in a direction that now took it away from the spit and out to sea. I remember thinking about it at the time, if I had really seen that object do what it had seemed to do. I gave up, and chalked it to memory. That memory was awakened shortly after the direct UFO sighting; if these UFOs could do it, so could that thing, whatever it was. Whatever it was at Crane Beach was much larger than what I saw in Cambridge. I would like to see them again. * I made certain to memorize the date. The time may be off a bit. ** There are “two kinds” of hollywood flying saucer. One has a hemispherical dome atop in the center of a wide circular disk, whose surface is mostly parallel to the ground - a plate. This is probably the more “modern” idea once designers got into it. The other kind has more superstructure or “cabin” above, whose sides are more upright. My kind was the second kind. I am reminded of the CSS Virginia (aka the Merrimack), with the beveled sides. Figure 1: location of direct sighting. I walked home from Alewife station. The red line shows their path, however once they crossed the black dot representing my house, I lost sight of them. You can see why I thought I should be able to see them from the front side of the house. The number “one” or what looks like an exclamation point on the red line is where the craft were when I first saw them. Figure 2. Crane Beach, the location of the first sighting. Figure 3. My attempt to depict the view from Crane Beach as seen by an observer on the shore. Bad job, but you see the “spit” at the “upper right”. The orange line shows the path of the craft, including the 90-degree turn, but I’m too poor with The Gimp to give a correct impression how far out to sea the “orange path” is or how much distance on the horizon the craft covered.

Recently, I was watching an episode of UFO Hunters titled, ""Dark Presence,"" which described orb-like lights in the sky.  I wasn’t going to report my sighting, mainly because I was unsure of what I saw, but after viewing this television program, I instantly changed my mind because the orbs that were shown in the show were the same type of orbs that my boyfriend and I saw in the sky. My boyfriend was driving me home one evening, I’m not too positive on the date, but I’m sure it was between August 28th and September 10th, and I’m almost positive that it was on a Saturday or Sunday.  The time was around 9:00pm central, when we came to an intersection and saw these orbs in the sky.  There had to have been at least 15 of them, but no more than 30.  Due to the fact that we were on the road, we were unable to stop, but I was able to turn my head to keep my eye on these objects. I pointed them out to my boyfriend who saw these orbs as well.  The orbs didn’t appear to move, but just sit there in the sky.  Some were a bright, bright bluish color, others were white with a reddish-orange tint to it, the rest were simply white.  All of these orbs were illuminated. The area of the sky where the orbs were seen was lit up with almost a reddish-pink glow.  I could tell for a matter of fact that it could not have been aircraft from one of the neighboring airports due to the la! ck of mobility in the orbs and the simple matter that there were far too many in the sky to be aircraft. We continued driving down the road, and I had these objects in sight for at least 7 minutes until we turned down my street and went down a hill.  As we neared the bottom of the hill, I got a clear view of these orbs again, trying to get my boyfriend to pull over so I could take a picture, the only problem being I had to be home at a particular time, and time was running terribly short, so short that he couldn’t stop. I returned to my house and went inside due to my curfew, fearing that I would be grounded if I was late.  My boyfriend and I never went back outside to look for these orbs, frankly, because we were both too scared of what we saw. I am a 17 year old female and a senior in high school.  I have no occupation of any sort, nor do I participate in any extra curricular activities.  My boyfriend is a 20 year old male who dropped out of high school and is searching for a job.

We both saw an orange ball travel fast from east to west for just a few seconds and then disappear in the middle of the sky.

It was very dark area with only a couple of city light poles that were on. There were a couple of stores in that area but they were all closed. There are a lot of hills in this area so it further darkens the area. I was about eighteen years old at the time. My friend and I were working at a Burger King until about 10 pm. We went outside to wait for a ride and we were talking. We went across the street where there was a pay phone that I was going to use to call to see where our ride was and I noticed that where we just walked from was a seeming to be round object just hovering in the air about 30 feet not very high no real noise except for humming. I felt and heard a humming just like an electrical sub station, there’s ones in every town. I felt my hairs standing up. The object was about the size of the Burger King, just a little wider. There were about eight, two foot wide bulbs around the round object. My friend and I walked under it at an angle and tried to make out the shape with the stars since it was the only light above, there was no moon and the stars were almost not visible. We first thought it was a hot air balloon with lights on the bottom but with the little stars that were out, we couldn’t see how high it exactly was, but we knew it wasn’t high like a balloon. I need to say this, over the years I’ve read a lot about of what other people have written about what they saw, and what’s different about mine, is that I think my friend and I are the only dumb asses that threw rocks and tar from the road at it for about a good half an hour. And we didn’t even hear the rocks fall back on the ground and we didn’t hear it hit the object. After about half an hour of throwing rocks at it we watched it slowly rise up then whoosh, it went up fast, in like a couple of seconds it shot up, we saw the lights get closer together, get smaller, and dim, in a matter of two to three seconds. My take on why it left so abruptly, is that I think they were going to abduct us until they found out they’d have serious problems with the two dumb asses that were throwing rocks at them. Just kidding. One more thing, there is one more witness, this was a little strange, it was my ride which happened to be my mom. She didn’t see it there, but at her job which happens to be on the other side of the hill / small mountain, at the Davis and Geck parking lot. We talked about it a few days after it happened, because we ended up walking home. She said she was afraid of it and went back inside to get someone to walk her back to he car. It happened at night, and that is all I know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-10-31T00:00:00,41.39098647450111,-73.47073769401331

My first thoughts were that the object must be a type of weather balloon as it was so high and bright and apparently very large (although I had never observed a weather balloon before).  However, a bit later, when the highway goes through a low mountain range with many turns, I noticed that this object maintained its position practically from whichever angle I was looking from, meaning that it must have been very high, many miles high, and therefore be enormous.

I dont want to be exposed to the public or exploited. It was terrifying because we didnt know how to protect our family and keep them out if they wanted into our home. I hope you dont think I am crazy when I tell you what happened but I swear to you, its all true. Occasionally our kids still talk about it but none of us shared it because people would never believe it and we would be made to look like fools. Being a skeptic before the incident I know exactly how that would go. Here is what happened.  We lived in a new developement in Lexington near Kelso washington. Our home sat in a field alone, and it was very dark.  One night around 10:30pm or so we were watching tv in the family room and I noticed my husband kept looking out the sliding glass door into the sky. I asked what was he looking at. He pointed to a light in the sky over the top of the hills in a distance. It did appear to be holding still. Then all at once a smaller light dropped out from the bottom of it and headed downward and to the left. We watched and I made fun of my husband saying ""oooh its a UFO!"" and I flashed our porch light off and on for probably 10 seconds in the SOS pattern. The light instantly shot over from a tiny dot in the sky to right over us- something so damned bright it blinded us.  Our daughter started to cry and hid under a blanket on the couch yelling no, make it stop! It was giant and looked like a big cross of light. I held my hand over my eyes squinting trying to look at it for just a second and started to cry and slammed the sliding glass door shut and locked it and turned off all the lights in our house trying to hide from ""it"". but my husband and one son ran outside and stood underneath this thing. I was begging them to come in and not do that. It was so big. It covered our yard and home. It was so bright like no other light I have ever seen. Just writing about it for the first time makes me feel like crying. I have never been so scared. I didnt know what it wanted or what it would do. I was afraid it would hurt my sons and husband. It made no noise. It didnt move. It just hovered over us. We couldnt see anything else. No sky, no trees nothing just the light.  After what seemed like hours but was maybe one minute it retracted back up to the sky. It moved so fast that it was there and then it zoomed away in just a flash it was a tiny light again in the distance. We were all shook up. I held our daughter and comforted her. The boys wanted me to hold them close too. Our little girl and the two boys wanted to sleep in our bedroom with us. We put a sleeping bag on our floor for our daughter and told the boys to sleep with the doors open from their room to ours. I feel so bad now looking back. I should have piled them all into my bedroom. We fell asleep and woke to hear our boys screaming and banging on our door. I ran to their room and they were both shouting at the same time. I couldnt understand at first. Soon my husband came in to see what was going on. They described a bright light like a flame coming to their bedroom window and then a person type thing with long arms, but it was short, was just there in their bedroom. The dog ""bumper"" barked at it. It just stood there looking at them. The boys said they were screaming as loud as they could but neither our daughter or either of us woke. They said it was almost the second we had gone to bed. It makes no sence. why didnt we hear them screaming? The boys realized we were not coming to help them and One of our sons told the other on the count of three they were going to run past it to our room and get us. They said the ""thing"" just moved from the closet area to the end of the bed without moving its limbs. Like flash, it was here then flash it ws there. The boys were screaming for us and we couldnt hear it! Our bedrooms across the hall from theirs. It doesnt make any sence that we could not hear them. Im a light sleeper and had just crawled into bed. We never could make sence of it. They woke us up by banging on our bedroom door which we had left open, but somehow it was closed!! Even then we had a really hard time waking up to get to the door. It sounds crazy , but its true. So I got up and went to their room. I thought maybe they were making a joke or something. I felt really confused and dazed, and I didnt even believe them. I calmed them down and they slept on my floor beside our daughter for the remainder of the night. Later I felt just horrible about it because the next morning they were still all excited and upset and showed me their bedroom window. ( our home was two story and their bedroom faced the hills where the ufo came from.) their window had a burned hole in the screen and the siding of the house had a burn on it. there was ash inside their windowsill.  I brushed the ash into a baggy and was going to submit it to someone. We talked about it and I was afaid of ending up in some National Inquirer magazine or something horrible. We kept our mouth shut but the trama of it has never left any of us! . It too k about a week for the kids to sleep in their room. I felt so vulnerable. We called someplace and talked on the phone to someone who investigates ufo sighting because we wanted to know how to keep the beings out of our home.

We were traveling west on a heavily traveled, two lane highway when about four cars in front of us began to brake like and accident had occured.  When we approached the scene and slowed we noticed to the left of the highway only about 200 feet above a vacant field we saw a very long, possibly 300ft long craft, with a width of 80+ft and a height of 40-50ft. The botom of the craft had no super bright lights, however, it was illuminated.  Having lights that resembled looking at a city scape from above.  You could literlly see all of the botoom side of the craft as it maintained a staionary posistion above the field.  I could not beleive what we were seeing. There are two strange things about this sighting that I still struggle to understand today and I feel almost tormented from not knowing and the need to know.  #1 Everyone could see that this was not ordinary, yet the traffic only slowed to a crawl while people looked out their respective windows... no one stopped to investigate more intensly. #2 Although I wanted to talk about this with my mother, who was driving the vehicle, I couldn't.  Not because I didn't want to, but because I would think to myself ""I need to see what she thinks about this""  and then when I would get near her to talk it was like it just was'nt in my mind to ask.  Hard to explain how that feels.  We didn't talk openly about what we saw for almost 7yrs.  Then one day we watched a program about UFO's with my father around 2000 and my mother says, ""Do you remember when we saw that ufo years ago?""  I did and have always.  I just don't understand why we couldn't talk about it, like a block, for years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-10-31T00:00:00,35.8556,-83.7449

I was in Manhattan, NYC, but the UFO(Light) flew over NJ and NY.  It was winter and around late February. I don’t have the exact date, although I called Newark Airport and also left a message at a UFO Reporting 1-800 number, when it happened, and I don’t know if this was NUFORC, but I haven’t seen a similar event on your site. I’ve decided to send my account just for the record although it’s 15.5 years later. I witnessed this from my then 31st story window on West42nd at 10th Ave. Manhattan looking SSW down the Hudson River past what was the World Trade Center.  It was in the early morning hours at about 5AM. I was awake early studying for an exam. The morning light was just beginning to break (pre-sunrise) and the sky was overcast with a very high, thin layer of clouds. Visibility was good as I could see a few planes taking off and landing in the distance (11 miles) at Newark airport as per usual. Although the planes were like dots in the distance I could see their flashing lights and was very used to observing the speed and altitude, at which they flew, which by the way, appears to be very slow and very low from the 42nd St. vantage point. As I was gazing out of the window I noticed a very bright white dash of light moving above the higher thin layer of clouds. It was shining through from above the clouds and came from the West near the area of the NJ/NY Statue of Liberty Harbor. It may have been further south at Newark airport, but was difficult to gauge at that high altitude.  Based on the distance and how quickly it traversed the sky from WEST to EAST (in about 1.5-2 seconds), I estimate it was traveling at the speed of about 10+ miles per second, as it shot EAST across the sky from Jersey, over Staten Island towards the Verrazano Bridge/Atlantic Ocean (an air distance of about 15+ miles) and disappeared out of my range of view. It’s also difficult to accurately estimate the length of this light sliver, because I was far away and I only saw a light and not an object. I’ve taken into account the possibility of window reflections, but since I saw the slight fluctuations in the shape of the light from behind the clouds, as it traveled above and across the thin cloud cover, I’ve eliminated that possibility. I am an artist and do pay close attention to these details. Also there were no light beams or spotlights visible from the ground below either, and as it was still somewhat dark, I think I would have noticed. I saw something out of the ordinary and unidentifiable, at least to my knowledge.  This was definitely not a commercial aircraft above the clouds as it was going way too fast and the light it emitted was so much brighter than anything I’ve ever seen from that distance. Anyway this is my report, given in as much detail as I can recall.  Thanks for the opportunity to share my experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

A day later someone reported in the local newspaper that they saw an orange flame in the sky. She was directly south-southeast of us by a few blocks. I imagine what she was seeing was the craft when it sped up and it became a blur before it disppeared. Is there a military craft with lights like this that makes no noise?

It's a clear night here in the Northeast of UK with some light cloud cover. At first I thought that these could be hot air balloons as they had a flickering orange glow as if they had burners on, but the glow was continuous and they were all uniformed in shape and size. Most disturbing, and what has made me discount them being hot air balloons was the speed at which they were travelling. I have a clear view to the West horizon and through to my farthest line of sight in the East it took the UFO's less than 2 minutes 30 seconds to complete the journey and clear out of my line of sight. There was no sound and they travelled the distance significantly quicker than any aircraft I have ever seen in the same 'proximity', which leads me to believe that they were not hot air ballons. Strangely though, after the first wave they then came acrss the same trajectory at intervals of 3-5 minutes and not in formation but in clusters of 3-5 with some solitary craft.

On 30 August, we pulled the memory chip on our wildlife camera which is located on our property in Central Virginia near Dawn, Va.  We were very surprised to find that the last three photos show two deer being ""spot-lighted"". by a bluish-white beam from above.  The beam first shines on both deer together, then on just one after it moves to the left, then on the other back to the right.  The beam definitely moved and encompassed only on the deer themselves, and never lighted the ground beneath the deer.  In two of the pictures it appears that the camera flash reflects off the beam.  We have no explanation for the beam of ""light"" that appears in these images.  What is shown in the images is exactly as they came off the camera. The images were taken with a Moultrie digital game camera.  The camera is mounted on a tree 6 feet above the ground and about 20-25 feet from where the deer were standing at the time the images were taken (an exact measurement to the inch can be taken if needed).   We pulled the chip about 4 hours after the time on the photos and noticed nothing odd at that time.  I have since gone back and taken a digital photo of the tree canopy from the location the deer were standing and looking up at about the same angle the beam was coming down.  As close as I can tell the beam came from an angle about 20 degrees south-west of nadir.  The canopy at that location is almost solid as shown in the additional image taken a few days later.  In our opinion, there is no way a helicopter spotlight could possibly have generated the beams caught in our digital photos.  Also, we considered the possibility of an insect on the camera lens, but since the lens is separated from the flash, an insect on ! the lens should have just made the image blurry and would not appear as a bright light following the deer.

HOWEVER, after watching the ABC special last night about UFO's, I decided to find a website where I could report something that has always mystified me so that I could at least get it on record.  I'll be perfectly honest and say that I'm not sure if it was in the summer of 1992 or 1993, it's been so long ago, but I'm pretty sure it was 1993. What I do remember was that it was an August night in the middle of the week, perfectly clear skies, about 8:30-9:00pm, and I was driving home to my in-laws house in Bellevue. I had just turned off the 405 freeway and turned west (right) on SE 8th street. As you drive west on SE 8th, there is a large hill--perhaps 500 feet in elevation--that is about one square mile in diameter with many homes, etc, and on the top of the hill, which you cannot see from the road, is a high school.  As I was driving, I noticed a huge, luminescent orb--a glowing sphere--that seemed to be floating just above the crest of the hill. I would venture a guess that it was the easily the size of two football fields, and its glow wasn't like the glow of the moon but seemed, rather, to be illuminated from within. It was perfectly symmetrical, perfectly silent, with a smooth surface. It was so large, in fact, that I am almost certain it must have been seen by others. But again, there is a track and, I think, high school football stadium on top of the hill, so perhaps many people dismissed it as the lights from that. All I can tell you is, as a verified skeptic of these sorts of things, I was truly amazed at the sight: a completely silent (at least I didn't hear anything from my car with the windows down), glowing sphere that just appeared to be floating just above the horizon of the hill.  I was so mystified by the sighting that I drove up the hill (I can't recall the name of that particular neighborhood in Bellevue) to see if I could get a better look. As I neared the base of the hill, of course, it fell out of my line of vision, and I had to drive around the base of the hill in order to go up it--there is no access to the hill from SE 8th. It probably took me 3-4 minutes to get to where I determined the sphere/orb was, and it was gone (naturally).  I must have driven around for ten minutes, to no avail. I told my wife about it as soon as I arrived home, and we both agreed that it sounded very strange. But, like many of these sorts of things (and perhaps like many of the reports on here), eventually the incredulity of it all made me simply let it go, and I've just always chalked it up to an inexplicable phenomenon. But, in all fairness, I thought it only right to report it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-10-31T00:00:00,47.604556307692306,-122.16441774358974

I reached up and opened the blinds and saw 2 red/orange lights attached to a huge object floating very slowly over the tree tops. I immediately got up and ran outside, trying to wake up everyone in the house as I ran. It came over the top of the house as I ran out the front door. It had bracket looking symbols on the bottom *[   ]* with the lights on either side of it. the top and bottom of the brackets were bent at about 45 degrees as opposed to the 90 degree brackets. This craft was about the size of the house and didn't make a sound I never saw the ""top"" of it only the bottom. I ran underneath it and it was very close as I got to the street I picked up a stone and threw it at the craft. I never heard the stone hit the craft nor did I hear the stone land. The craft flew North until it went over the hill and outran me. Even when I was viewing it from behind as it flew away I did not see a top on it. I went back inside and no one woke up. No one heard me yelling for them to wake up either. I spoke with my girlfriend and asked her why she didn't come outside. She said she was scared. I thought about the stone and the fact that no one heard me yelling and thought that the craft had some kind of noise canceling technology on it.

It was after dark on apartly cloudy night with the moon out there was no other aircaft around and the weather was good. Every Friday evening my Mom and I would walk around the school I was going to for fun Etc. on the way back about half a block from my house I was looking down and was about 7 feet behind my mom  Out of nowhere a very bright dark blue light flashes on the ground right in front of me. the best way to describe this light is it looks like the light you would see at the bottom of a pool with the water moving kinda like bubbles but not kinda like electricity, but not very weird but pretty I guess you could say the light had no noise to it. Once is saw the light i looked up to the sky and there happened to be a opening in the clouds that was a good 2 to 3 miles wide. there was a very large cloud behind me, but I saw nothing. I began to think it was so funny lightining or something like that. At this point I ask my mom did you see that she said no. At about the same time we both lookedagain to see anything one more time and out of the cloud comes a very very very large rectangle object at a very fast speed going west tored Luke Air Force Base about 7 miles west of where I am at. I lost track of it in the clouds about ten seconds after I saw it, but in those ten seconds it was proable 7 miles away already. The Clouds that night where about normal alttuide and like I said earlier the opening was about 2 to 3 miles long and about a mile wide this object was bigger then the opening in the clouds I want to say it was 12 to 15 aircarft carries long and 6 to 8 wide it was HUGH. The object had a ton of lights on it all over the place they could have been in a pattern , but it went by so fast and unexpectedly was unable to see that. The one thing I did notice was the back end of the object, the back end was all white/blue lights kinda like a rocket area or where the engines are at. The object looked to have a blueish silver metal on it. The object made no noise at all and did not displace a cloud that was the weirdest part of all for something that big, that fast, and with what looked simalur to rockets on back that was just not right. I have been a beleaver ever since. I have never seen or heard of anyhting like this ever again. also to note for the next hour after seening this my eyes were burning. if you have any questions please contact me thanks  P.S. I also saw the Phoenix lights and those in any way where not flares, even if they were there not going to do any military trainning where they were at becasue it was over a Indain resrevion and that test area they were talking about its near yuma Arizona 95 miles south west of Phoenix ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I'm not quite sure if I have to tell my personal experience in this forum...considering the majority of skeptics on UFOs. But I feel that there is a need to discuss this subject, because knowledge of what really happens in our universe could be essential in determining where we should be heading.  First of all, I would like to introduce myself. I am a lawyer in the Philippines. I currently holds a public office as the City Legal Officer of ______________, you can check this out in our website. I am the head of the City's Legal Department and had been a practicing lawyer for more than 11 years now. I had been a lawyer for many nongovernmental organizations. I am an experienced trial lawyer. As such, I know what ""facts"" means and what ""evidence"" can play as a way to convince people of the existence of a fact. When I was 16 years old (around March of 1987), about to graduate from high school, i was walking my dog around 8:00 PM. It was a bright night because it was almost full moon, with clear skies with some relatively fast moving cumulo-cirrus clouds (it was a bit windy). Our house was just 15 meters away from the seashore in ___________. I was used to stargazing, so I was looking intently at the stars as i walk my dog. I noticed some movement near the moon, i thought it was the cloud, but when i looked more intently, i noticed that it wasnt the cloud but a ""star"" moving very slowly. I first thought that it must be a night plane, but then the light wasnt blinking like most planes, so it suddenly occurred to me, ""could this be something else""?  Immediately upon blurting that out in my mind, the moving light suddenly moved so fast in at least three circular paths, counter-clockwise.  Since I studied in a special science and math class since my elementary, I knew what the speed of light is, and i knew that that object was travelling at close to the speed of light (around 186,000 miles per sec).  I was shocked, because even at my age then, i knew there's no human aircraft that can travel at close to the speed of light. And after going in circles, it streaked the entire length of the sky in a semi-circle path. Two years after, I was again in the same place (we havent left yet our residence near the seashore). I was simply strolling and letting time pass by. It was past 8:00 PM, again, with the moon (more than half moon). The sky was again clear, with visible stars and clouds. As i continue to watch out for falling stars, as it has been my habit, I saw some movement of one ""star"" in the location of my first sighting two years before. I got so excited that it suddenly occurred to me this wasnt coincidence. This time, upon my noticing of its movement, the bright object with yellow star-like light moved in circular paths, this time clockwise, with the same speed as before, and crossed the sky with blinding speed. Four years later, i was already in my second year of law school in ___________, I returned home for a semestral vacation. We left already our old house near the sea and transferred to another rented house about a hundred meters away from our first hourse. Around 9 PM, i decided to walk at the boulevard near the shore. I feel some kind of anticipation that my experiences before would be repeated, and i was constantly excited of the thought that, ""is it an alien spacecraft""? So every semestral break, I would go to the same spot hoping for another sighting. For a time, I got frustrated. But on that particular sem break of 1993 (around late October), it happened again. I saw that bright object moving, no longer in the same spot but still near, and as in noticed it, it again sped off in circles counterclockwise like the first time, with the same blinding speed. I thought, my God, can it read my mind, because everytime i see it and think if its a UFO, it kind of ""reacts"" to my thought and moves suddenly as if it was jolted by my thought. I told these experiences to my family, but they just looked at me, perplexed. But since they knew me to be very objective and reasonable since i was a kid, they never actually disbelieved me. The same was true with my my friends. I was a student leader at that time (president of various school organizations and had been the editor-in-chief of our college paper), so they saw no reason for me to tell something untrue. Since then, I would wait on the same spot whenever i had the opportunity, but i was never that lucky again. Until now, whenever i would visit my parents in _______________, I always try if i could still see it. i just keep telling my kid and my wife that someday, people, especially our political leaders, might be reasonable enough to take a serious look at these events as part of the circumstantial evidence of the existence of perhaps another life-form that has a much more advanced civilization. i dont know the answers, but Im testifying based on facts and my perso! nal know ledge of certain events where one can draw up some preliminary assumptions.

There was no distinct tail like on a comet and it was much slower than a falling meteor. As it traveled westerly towards us from the east it grew slightly bigger.  Closer to the middle was extremely bright orange.  It continued to move westerly, than started turning in a southerly direction across the sky and began to slowly get smaller. At this time, a satellite traveling in a northerly direction passed near the unknown object.  There was a distinct difference between the size of the tiny satellite and the large object.  At the same time, a plane was traveling easterly, toward the unknown object.  The plane was blinking in the night sky and was distinctly different and smaller than the unknown object. The unknown object continued in a southerly direction as its large glow dimmed  and eventually the object was out of sight.

As it came closer to our position, it was moving west to east, I realized that the lights were all part of one craft which was triangular in shape and a fourth light underneath became visible as well. When it was nearly overhead I pulled my van over and got out, much to the dismay of my children and a friend who was following behind, she kept screaming to get back in my car but I couldn’t I just could not believe my eyes.  The craft seemed to then hover directly over my position and I was looking directly up at the middle light which glowed a yellow reddish tone while the outer lights where more a blue white tone.  They didn’t flash or blink, nor was there any detectable noise though the huge craft was maybe 100 feet above me. The craft measured approximately 60 to 70 foot across (front being decided by the direction of motion) and was dark in color.  It was just after dusk so to be able to distinguish whether it was dark blue, grey or what, I only know it was a dark color with three lights around the perimeter at its triangular points and one underneath. The whole incident took nearly 4 minutes and I got the feeling we were also being scrutinized by the craft’s occupants as we were doing the same to them.  Then the head lights of a third vehicle flashed behind me my gaze went to the oncoming car then quickly back to the craft.  Then without any sound which was audible the craft rapidly accelerated until it was a mere flash, in a split second it was gone moving eastbound at a rate of acceleration impossible for any known craft to do going from a stopped hover to a speed at which the lights began to blur as the craft raced off to the east.

Myself and my friend were sneaking out when we were teenagers I'm now 29.  We were meeting 2 girls in my neighborhood and were going to walk up to the local Circle K convenient store.  Well, we met up with the girls halfway, and started walking up to the store.  The neighborhood was a very large suburban neighborhood outside of Greensboro, N.C. close to the Piedmont International airport.  I can remember the night there so vividly, the cars had frost on them that would glisten under the street lights. It was such a cold night, but we were having fun sneeking out walking up to the store, we were about 14 yrs of age.  On our way to the store we were all cutting up having a good time when my buddy who was a jokster to say the least, all of a sudden said ya'll theres a U.F.O..  My initial thought was he is such an idiot, until I looked up and couldn't believe my eyes, their in the dark sky a little above the trees was a huge Bright yellowish oval object slowly careening above the trees.  We all in utter disbelief stood there and gazed at it.  Like I said, it was oval in shape sort of like a football stretched a little.  It Was completely glowing a very illuminated yellowish color, with a little blinking light at the front of the U.F.O. according to the direction of movement. Itwas approximately a quarter mile above the ground about a half of mile from wher we were at.

So, with exubilation walked to the store and met w/ a friend who had a driver license and car and he picked us up to go riding.  We began to tell him of what we witnessed, and he sort of just laughed it off until he turned on his radio and radio DJ announced that a bunch of drunks on a Saturday night were calling in reported U.F.O. sightings, but we knew better because we were not drunk and definetaly not crazy. Our friend believed us after he heard the ra! dio DJ. Oh yea, forgot the object was also moving extremely slow and made no noise.  That is what I remember like it was yesterday.  Thank you for reading my story and keeping an open mind.  I could't tell you what we saw that winter night many years ago, but I would sure like to know.  I bet the Government knows.

It is now 10:45 pm on Sunday, August 30th, 2009.  My wife and I were returning home from my sister’s house about 20 minutes ago with our children asleep in the back seat when we saw 3 circular lights in the sky that were moving relatively quickly. We stopped the car, put on our flashers and exited the vehicle to get a better look.  There was a procession of approximately 20 to 25 of these lights that seemed to be travelling from the southwest and moving northeast across the night sky in clusters of two and three at a time with short intervals in between. They were definitely not airplanes or helicopters. They were clearly visible, yet there were no distinctive markings. The color seemed strangely ambiguous. They seemed both white and red at the same time, yet not flickering. That was my personal perception, although my wife seemed to perceive a faint flicker. They each disappeared off into the clouds one by one in the sky northeast of us. There was absolutely! no sound at all.  We both witnessed this event.  Neither one of us could come up with a logical explanation of what we were viewing.  Although several cars passed us, no one else stopped or slowed to take notice of what we were looking at. I doubt highly that there is any connection of significance to the fact that we heard consistent gunfire in the area, but I will state it here as a point of fact.  We are in an area where there seems to be frequent recreational gunfire.  We called my sister to describe what we were seeing, but she did not see any activity over her house roughly 30 miles away.  We live in the town of Greenville, NY 12771. We share a zip code with Port Jervis, NY and obviously are very close to that town.  We did not feel threatened or scared by what we saw. It was a spectacularly uncommon site. If there is a logical explanation for it, we’d be curious to know what it is. If not, we feel very fortunate to have viewed such a unique event.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,42.431,-74.0383

In 1995 I was returning from a wake with two friends. I was in the back seat. When we dropped off the front passenger at her house I got out to get in the front seat. I waved goodbye as she entered her house and noticed three dim amber lights, close together in a straight, horizontal line. I was facing south at the time from the curb. The lights were far away to the south above the horizon.  The area is frequented by aircraft as it is only 20-25 miles from JFK and Laguardia airports. The approach of airplanes is usually east-west. When I was a kid the Concorde was a frequent sight and sound.  This was different. First it was flying from south to north, heading in a direction overhead. The lights were dim, amber and didn't blink. So I watched as it approached rapidly. As the lights got closer I could see the formation wasn't a line but a triangle with one light in the lead. The lights were also round and not pin points. The diameter of each light being roughly 1/4 the length of one edge of the formation. As it flew more overhead, and it being a clear starry night, I could see it was moving quickly. I didn't notice any sound. It looked as though it was very high up.  I called to my friend in the car and said he should see this. I heard him say something like ""see what?"". While keeping my eyes on the lights I walked around the back of the car and glanced down at my friend with is head sticking out the car window, quickly looked back up. The lights were still there except they were now almost directly over our heads. I pointed up at them but he still said he couldn't see them. At this point the silence, speed and odd lighting really had my attention.  If it ended here I could have dismissed it as an airplane, or whatever and not have given it another thought.  As I watched it fly rapidly, relative to the stars in the background, almost directly overhead, it rotated. Rotated quickly so the two previously trailing lights were now leading. That sent chills through my spine. No airplane does that. I started yelling to my friend something like ""holy #%#%#, look at it!"", his head still looking out the window, in an awkward way, facing up. I glanced down and slapped him on the forehead to get him to look in the right spot. When I looked back up I could not find the lights again.

I continued watching it trying to figure out what it was because it was only one light, which I knew wasn't a plane, and it was also moving faster than a satellite would be plus it was much brighter. While I was watching this object I noticed that it had stopped moving almost as if it realized I was watching it. While this object was motionless I decided to get one of the others to look at the sky to see if they saw it as well. When I finally got them to look at the sky the object then did a zig-zag pattern kind of in up and outward way like what would happen  in a generated image, but as it was doing this pattern it was leaving behind a trail of light behind it.

I have tried to find a means of reporting, but always came up blank. I am a ranch supervisor and between Christmas and the New Year I was on a ranch in the state of , Cojedes. This afternoon in particular, I with two brothers in law plus two people from the ranch drove to the main entrance to the ranch to lock the main gate. The light was changing, going to dusk, driving back to the ranch centre, coming up alongside the air strip, we suddenly saw what first looked like a small plane coming out from behind hills to the left of the strip, with brilliant lights on. It was about 100 feet up in the air, at first I thought it was one of the owners coming to spend a few days on the ranch. I very clearly remember seeing what appeared to be round windows within blazing lights. It was about the size of a Cessna two engine plane. I braked to a halt and we leaped out of the truck. As it passed within about 150-200 feet in front of us, I realized that there was no sound coming from it, not even the sound that one would assume that moving through the air would produce. As it passed in front of us, the light around it was intense, and I also noticed that it was moving on a steady path, keeping level. Coming through the hills it had managed to pass between two small hills that were definitely taller that the object in the air. Passing in front of us, it seemed to explode in flames, again there was no sound. As it moved through the air, still keeping on a level plane, the flames were being pushed back around it by the force of air. It looked very similar to when one see’s a shuttle taking off to space. It continued at its level as it drew away from us into the darkening night sky. We continued watching it and as it was approaching the far hills, it seperated into three pieces which were clearly on fire. At this stage the three separate pieces fell into heavy jungle that is in that area. This area at this time of the year is exceptionally full and very green; also because we are then coming out of the rainy season, the ground still had water and would have been quite soft. To confirm what we actually saw, the following day, on the news, appeared a report of a pilot with a small plane that was passed by an object full of light, to which this pilot did an emergency landing as it frightened him. The object was travelling roughly north where it was spotted by several people at a village where the object then changed course to fly east, and then manoeuvred between the two hills to pass in front of us.

This event occurred 11 years ago and at the time I was only in 8th grade. I only put in a small amount of effort to find out more about the sighting. Even though I only put in little effort in finding out facts at the time, this was a significant event for me in my life. It was about 9 or ten o’clock; I am not sure the exact date, the big news was the hale bob comet. A few friends and I decide to go out and take another look at the comet since you could see it perfectly and clearly in the sky. We walked out on my front porch and into to my front yard facing southward to look at the comet. After being outside for a few minutes we noticed a light southwest above a hill. Next thing you know right beside it in consecutive order 3 or four lights appear right beside the first light, from left to right. Next, two lights disappeared from right to left and then reappeared. Then two more lights appeared in consecutive order with the others and one more after that. These things were staying perfectly still in the air not moving at all and making no noise. After a series of lights disappearing and appearing again a second row of consecutive lights started appearing directly in order and below the lights above. These things were hovering in the air whatever they were. I have seen pictures of the flares that people used to try to duplicate the phoenix lights (which wasn’t even close), and I have military experience in which I have seen flares with my own eyes so I know for 100% fact they were not flares. All theses lights appeared, disappeared and reappeared again in the exact same spot in the sky. They all also stayed perfectly still. Nothing man made could stay as perfectly still and in order as these did. The only thing I have ever seen in my life that I could use to compare this experience with is the phoenix lights. The way the phoenix lights appear and disappear was exactly what I seen. All I can tell you is, I seen exactly what was seen in phoenix. Directly after the event my friends and I called our science teacher and told him about what was going on and he said maybe some debris was falling off the comet and my friends and I knew that was not the case. A few weeks later my teacher told me he heard the military was doing something with flares. I do not remember his sources; actually I am pretty sure he never told me exactly how he found that out. I knew, once again 100% for a fact, they were not flares. At this time in my 8th grade life I knew no other way to find anything out about this. Then after even more time started going by I never really even thought to pursue this. Then after having kids and settling down a bit I started watching more TV and about two years ago learned of the phoenix lights. The incident had already been bothering me for years but now it has been tearing me up. I am becoming more obsessed with finding more about this interesting subject and what happened that night Also I have seen other strange things in the sky but nothing that was as definitive as this. I would really like to know if there were any other sightings around this time, or ever around here. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

REPORT for UFO CENTER:  written on May 21, 2008. On the door step of my San Diego hotel room the morning of March 26, 1997 the newspaper headline showed a grim photo:  Heaven’s Gate members lying neatly dead with black plastic bags over their heads.  They believed they were going to meet the spaceship behind Hale Bopp to go to a UFO. That was the joking talk among my group at breakfast.  I knew the day would end much more pleasantly. That late afternoon, back home in Palm Springs, I welcomed several friends, armed with binoculars and telescopes, all come to comet-watch from my front lawn, which faces West, the direction the Comet would be visibly arcing over shortly. Wine was served and each staked out a spot.  I chose a spot on my outdoor-living room wall, facing the foothills of the mountains directly in front of my house.  Soon, just before twilight, the first lights of the comet, coming from the north west were visible.   Everyone made trips inside for snacks and drinks and chatter  until darkness began to fall.  The night was very still and clear and dark, and the lights from the arcing comet were spectacular.  Several of the group,  once they saw the comet,  had enough of that and were gathered in the living room enjoying each other’s company and the wine.  I stayed at my post as, from my point of view,  it was too wonderful to miss a moment of. Leaning my elbows on the wall, I was very comfortably watching the show with my binoculars.  I did notice that directly in front of me there were two very bright  unblinking “stars”, just over the top of the foothills, it seemed: (it was by now quite dark, so I surmised they were right over the top of the foothills.)  Suddenly about 45 minutes  into watching the comet arc ever closer to the front of my house, (probably about 7 or 7:30 PM) , just as Hale-Bopp was almost directly overhead. The two “stars”  shot forward, like blazing headlights, straight toward me. Startled, I almost dropped my binoculars.  But I no longer needed them as these objects were so bright as to be blinding.  They looked like the headlights of the largest vehicle ever and they zoomed toward me.  Just as I knew they would crash into me and my house, they just as swiftly in concert zoomed to my right,( north)  toward Hale-Bopp.  When I say zoomed, these lights moved with  swiftness and with a smoothness of flight I had never imagined possible.  Obviously what I had thought to be “stars” was one object.  The two lights sailed in perfect concert  directly toward the comet, and seemed to disappear behind it, in moments going so fast and so far they became invisible in the light of the comet. I ran inside to see who else had seen it , but everyone else had been inside. I was later told  that some of my neighbors down the street saw it, and that there was something in the next day’s Palm Springs newspapers.  I did not see the articles. Perhaps the members of Heaven’s Gate were in that “spaceship” behind the comet, and just maybe they got to the anticipated UFO they sought?  I do hope so for them. But that was not the only experience with strange phenomenon here in these mountains and foothills.  About a year ago, in the fall of 2007, Palm Springs experienced a night of thunderstorms.  The foothills and mountains were covered in clouds and thunder rumbled all night.  About 3 AM the noise woke me, and going into my all-glass living room, I looked up at the mountains in front of me.  I was astonished to see four huge squares of bright lights.  I would estimate that given the distance from me the largest one was about 50’ square, and the smaller two were about 30 ‘ square.  Each had a spectacular whiteness but while they were extraordinarily bright they were not shining the light anywhere.  They were like beacons.  And they were moving.  They were not stationary.  I could not imagine how people could possibly be way up there in those rocky  foothill-mountains, and moving those huge lights about. It just would not be possible to stand up there in the darkness and move those lights about.  I stared at this phenomenon for about fifteen minutes, mesmerized.  I hesitated to call the police.   I kept thinking perhaps the police were doing this!  (Now that’s crazy sounding , I know, but that is what I was thinking.)  Just as I had decided to call someone, the  lights just went out.  One minute they were there.  Then they were out.  Nothing sped away.  They just went out.  The next day I searched with binoculars that area and knew that it would have been impossible for people to be walking and standing in those areas, way at the top of those mountains.  And no way they could have in the dark held and moved those lights. But where did they go?  What were they? And a third occurrence  in these mountains. One day I was driving home from the Palm Springs airport, traveling west on Tahquitz.  At one point I happened to look up, and there over the top of the mountains at the end of that street, was an enormous blimp-like object, just hovering there.  It did not move while I was looking.  At the next stop light I noticed it had moved slightly forward but not much.   I could not see any windows or anything distinguishing about it, as it was very far from me at that point.  But I could see that it was gigantic in size, nothing like the blimps we see advertising things from time to time.  This thing would have fit five or six of such blimps into it.  Again I notice the huge thing move slightly backward.  I called Le Vallauris restaurant, as it seemed to be directly over the area where they are located.  But lunch service was on and the secretary in the office was out to lunch.  I drove as fast as I could trying to get to the end of the road to have a good look at it.  When suddenly it just disappeared.  Gone.  No sign of it anywhere. Obviously these three occurrences are connected in that they all happened in the same location.  Yet they all appear to be totally different one from the other.  What can any of them have been?  Not one ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

So we went to a a big rock across from Hanson's Park ( you can see the old ricketty rollercoaster ) around a quarter mile across.  There is a patch of hill than a stone patio next to a dock we have permission to fish from.  We decided to setup on the patio.  As we fished you could see the street light across the way by the park.  So we fished and some time later around a hour or two I noticed that the light didn't go out and seemed a little closer.  I thought nothing of it and fished some more.  Then I noticed it closer than BAM.......... I looked up in the sky and saw a Black object hoovering oh so slow above us moving toward our backside and were only 100 yards above the 60 foot treetops.  It looked like no UFOs I saw in books and other source before.  The shape was like a small triangle in front with another bigger triangle combined together. I have a attachment drawing it was all black.  As I ran to the road that circumferences the lake the craft went slowly out of sight, moving along the mountains behind the lake.  When I ran back tomy friend and  he looked bewildered ,  I said;  hey man did you see that and he just keep fishing with a sort of nod. At this I asked my friend  what time it was he said 10:30 am.. A hour or two disappeared !!  It sort of freaked me out and excited me at the same time.  Again my friend would not talked about the incident and that was that.

It was a very clear night with a new moon. Every star in the sky was visible. I was on my garage roof stargazing as I often did on nights like this. I was looking north towards Polaris when suddenly everything went dead quite. Every frog, every bird, every creature in the bush simply stopped. The silence was deafening and incredibly noticeable. I felt a terrible feeling. Just then, to my left, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a flattish, rectangular object break out over the tree line. (I was in a fairly rural location about 3 miles outside Fort Frances) This object was metallic with a red glow emanating from the underside. It was fairly low flying, maybe 100 feet in the air although it was difficult to tell because I don't know how big it was. It cleared the trees, but not by much and some of those poplars are 60 or 70 feet tall. I could see definition in the object, a kind of hood and a grill on the underside. It seemed fairly flat although it was pitching to its left so I couldn't see much of its side. The object made absolutely no sound whatsoever. I instinctively crouched down on the roof the second I saw it but I go the terrible feeling that it saw me and knew that I saw it. It flew quickly across the sky at that altitude and disappeared behind the peak of the house. As soon as it was gone, I ran down the length of my garage roof and dove through my open window. I slid of my bed and onto the floor, turning to look back out my window. I guess I expected it to come back but it didn't. I was only inside for less than a minute in a panic, but somehow i got the nerve to get up and go back outside. I just had to see it again to know that I really saw it. I went back out my window onto my garage roof and climbed up onto the highest peak of my roof. I surveyed the entire sky, 360 degrees. It was completely gone. No plane or helicopter or anything I know of could have disappeared like that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I followed it visually until it passed out of sight behind the tall hedges at the rear of my property.  I doubt it was a meteorite since I have seen plenty in my time.  The trajectory was all wrong for this altitude since it was travelling across the horizon rather than downwards.

About 50 ft long and 150 ft off the ground As someone who has spent a life time staring at the sky I have seen some unexplainable things.  But in the last two years I have lived in Mineral Wells Tx  I have seen four unexplainable things in the sky.  In the first case about two years ago I saw something that I can only to explain as the aurora borealis.  Two color changing orbs moving at phenomenal speeds and erratic directions moved from the east to west horizon in seconds.  They were in the same place about three hours apart about march 2007.  I wonder what I missed. But my newest sighting has me on edge.  On 8-27-2009 at about 3:30am I saw what appeared to be a flock of birds come out of a light cloud covering to the east moving to the west at about 100 feet in altitude.  I stepped under a tree to pick up a puppy when I realized that the dots I believed to be birds were stationary to each other.   At this point the completely silent object turned to the north directly above me and then back to the east in almost a u turn.  At this point I stepped out from under the oak tree as it continued to travel in a circle back to the west.  This is when it hit me that I was looking up at a tablet shaped craft about fifty feet in length about a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet above me.  It was difficult to see because the bottom was covered in about thirty to fifty very dimly lit light blue lights less then an inch in diameter.  The lights made it very hard to see because it looked like I was looking through the clouds into a  dense cluster of s! tars.  I think the body was black because I could see a definite outline.  Coming out of its second u turn it was pointing west as it continued to circle. Yes I think this thing was looking back; that is when fear over came my curiosity and I hauled ass inside.  Only to have my fear replaced by intense anxiety as I thought about the fact I just saw a UFO looking back at me from about a hundred feet.  As a habit I second guess myself, it’s the scientific process, and I have seen a lot of strange things in the sky.  But this is the first time I have seen anything  that was more then a strange light moving erratically in the sky.  This is the first time I have ever seen something so close to that really spooked me. Here is where it get really spooky; I saw it again last night at about 4:45am on 9-1-2009.  I stepped outside to smoke a cigarettes which is one of a dozen or so ten minute brakes I take a night outside to stargaze.  This time it was moving north to south in a perfectly straight line.  Again it was as silent as ever  and moved in a straight line at about 25mph between one and one hundred and fifty feet above the ground. I just spent the day reading a hundred other experiences with  only occasional vague similarities to mine.  Did I just experience the rarest two minutes of my life or am I loosing my mind?  Why so many different types of sightings; is it the many different ways we can describe the same thing, are we an extraterg,restrial highway, or are we all just nuts and haven’t realized it yet?  How could I have been the only one to look up at the rite time?",2009-12-12T00:00:00,32.7923,-98.1388

The weather was clear with calm seas. The night was very black.  At the time of the sighting, we were patrolling the Bearing Sea north of the Alaskan Peninsula, bearing north at about 20 knots. I was on watch at the starboard 20mm gun, second deck (galley deck).  It was around 2300. My gun turret was above the deck house and there were no obstructions hindering my field of vision, allowing me to have a clear 360 degree view of the sea around the ship.  There were four of us together at the starboard gun (I can get crew names and captain’s name). The attention of both port and starboard gun crews was drawn to a row of red lights off the port side, traveling parallel to and slightly forward of the bow. I did not see the lights when they first approached so do not know the direction from which they came, or if they came out of the sea. There were at least eight lights in a row, evenly spaced, canted at about 15 degrees to horizontal. I would estimate the lights were no more than 100 yards from the ship. The lights held their relative position to one another throughout the sighting, and appeared to be about 10 feet apart. I would say that the light closest to the water (the lights were canted diagonal to horizontal at approximately 15 degrees) appeared to be about 30 feet above the water. I estimate that it would require a cantaloupe held at arms length to cover a single light. I could not see a structure associated with the lights as there was nothing but blackness between the lights. The lights were a very deep red and did not cast a beam.  The lights moved parallel to our ship, holding their position relative to the ship throughout the entire sighting. The lights continued to pace the ship as I watched. This continued for at least one hour. I was relieved from watch at 2400. When I went below the lights were still visible. I was too tired to stay on deck and went below to sleep. The next day, the midnight gun crew said that the captain turned the ship and ""tried"" to chase the lights. I don’t know the outcome of this maneuver. I don’t know what the circumstances were when the lights disappeared. But I do know that I have not seen anything like this before or since.

The lead car was my mom and dad.  The second car was my dad’s childhood friend to whom I refer to as my uncle, but he is just a family friend. My mother said they were traveling at night, the time was about 3 am. This sighting occurred between midnight and 3 am. She kept waking up and noticed a bright reddish orange light at a distance. It seemed to be tracking the cars. The road was a two lane road somewhere between Pecos, Texas and Carlsbad, NM. She finally woke up at 3 am and told my dad that that light has stayed right along with them for at least two hours and many miles. She said no way it could be a water tower beacon after so much time had elapsed. He would speed up, it would speed up. He would slow down, it would seemingly slow down. Finally, they stopped in the middle of the dark desolate road. My uncle in the car behind stopped and they all stood in the middle of the road wondering what in the heck the thing could be. So, my uncle set his spotlight on the object, and it took off and away from them at breakneck speed. They were all horrified and amazed, but continued their trip to California. When they arrived at Long Beach, California, my mother said she bought a newspaper and read an article that the day before something flew over several sunbathers on the back that same day. My dad never wanted to discuss it. Years later, I asked my uncle about it and he said it was indeed a true experience and it happened the way my mother told me.

I was about 14 or 15 years old had been on a date with a young man I met at a church retreat. It was my first car date.  I was hugging the door knob I was so shy.   On the way back near Ann Arbor we saw a disc shaped object at about tree line maybe 100 yards away.  It was probably 40 - 50 feet across.  It was shiny light grey and had lights around it. Maybe even windows.   We sat in the car and wondered what the heck it was.  We were listening to the news on the radio, probably an Ann Arbor station... and they said a UFO had been sighted in the Ann Arbor area.  We peeled out of there so fast.  Because it was before I was driving, I wasn't paying attention to roads and have no idea exactly where we were.  I remember scooting to the middle of the car. The odd thing is that it took me years to remember it again. I thought people would make fun of me.  I can't even remember telling my Mom about it when I came home.  Now I think about it a lot.  I hear about people sighting ""lights in the sky"" and calling it a UFO sighting and think mine was huge compared to that.  There were lots of UFO sightings in the Ann Arbor area and they were always ""swamp gas"".  This was no swamp gas.  But I can't find a record of a sighting in the 1961, 1962 or 1963 timeframe in this area.  Lots in 1965. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

That’s when the government began looking for another stratigic area to continue working and developing these top secret and UFO related projects, a place where the media and ufoligist couldn't get close to or wouldn't be able to find or have any access to any information. After looking and searching very hard for an area in the US, the government finally decided on the small island of Vieques ( a sister Island of Puerto rico) This island is located on the east side of Puerto rico and it was part of the Roosevelt Rhodes military base in PR. Part of the island was used for fighter jet target practice, a firing range for aircrafts. Roosevelt base in the town of Ceiba was one of the largest navy installations of the US. This was the place where the government decided to continue their most important and top secret projects from area 51. Here at Ceiba is where the largest and most secretive aircraft carriers and submarines were based.  Know in order for the government, to continue working these projects and kept secret. These would be conducted from one of the aircraft carriers, at about 10 to 15 miles out to sea. This is how they would keep all the information from top secret UFO and other highly secret projects away from the press and anyone interested on the government activities.  This lasted for about 10 years before the citizens of Puerto Rico and Vieques realized that something was really going on, other than the actual military training that the government was allowed to conduct according to the agreement for using the island of Vieques for training.  A large number of fishermen began reporting sighting out at sea and around an aircraft carrier.  When more of the press began to look into the matter, the government also began to cover most of what was going on, specially the sightings or anything that was related to the UFO phenomenon. Many reports where made at the base in Ceiba but nothing was ever mention or little was done to investigate.  After a while a conflict between the local residents of Vieques and the military began to escalate.  No one really understand how this all began.  Some say the government posing as local residents started instigating in order to create a situation where the public would be held responsible for misinforming the press about what ever the government was actually doing on the island of Vieques and out at sea. Many sightings were reported and many civilians came forward with information and actual data on the activities that were being conducted from these aircraft carriers out at sea.  No one seems to know where or who has the information and the reports made.  I've tried to locate anything related to this but; all I find is that there was a political conflict and that most of the military base personnel had to move from Vieques.   Well if anyone has information please set it free. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

It was late (around 10pm) and Tom saw something in the distance down the road or at a low altitude. The lights were dim because the object was very far away. Allen told Tom to flash his lights at the other driver/object. Tom flashed his lights 3 times. The object flashed the lights back at him 3 times, but when this happened all of the lights inside the truck (radio lights, console lights, floor board lights) started to flicker. ""Less than 10 seconds later"" according to Tom the object starting to move towards them very rapidly (much faster than a regular vehicle can move). The object stopped in front of them and seemed to follow them (from the front). The object was a cube shape.  Tom flashed his lights 3 times again and the object flashed it's lights 3 times back and again all the lights/electronics began to flicker uncontrollably. this object followed them down the road for a few miles.  Tom said that he was scared to death and his brother, Allen was hiding in the back of the truck crying saying ""I don't want to die"".

I was 18 at the time, and a senior in high school.  I was working at a mall in Tulsa, OK.  I had just left work around 10pm to go over to my girlfriend’s house for a few hours.  It was October 12, 1999, and Halloween was fast approaching.  She had decided to go as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. When I arrived at her house, she was outside gluing glitter to a pair of red heels for her costume.  I sat on her front steps with her while she did this.  When she was done, I suggested that we lie in the driveway and look at the stars.  It was relatively warm for that time of year, and the sky was as clear as can be. We got up and moved to the driveway.  As we lay there, looking at the stars and talking, I noticed something disturbing the night sky.  It was moving VERY slowly, maybe 100MPH or less.  The object was very low to the ground.  My guess is between 500ft and 750ft, but no more than that.  There were no lights, and no sound.  I could make out the silhouette of the object against the distant light pollution and the stars in the background.  It had a long fuselage with bulges to the side, kind of in the shape of lobes, where the cockpit might be, and at the back of the object.  The bulges to the side were smaller in the front than in the rear.  It had a slight glow behind it, though not like a jet.  I asked her if she was seeing what I was seeing.  She saw it as well.  We watched as the object slowly and silently moved through the night sky until it was out of sight. The fact that stood out to me was the complete lack of sound.  As a child I frequented air shows.  I was quite aware of the immense noise produced by a conventional engine, be it propeller or jet.  I had seen an F-14 perform a fly by at 100MPH once.  It was greatly pitched with a tremendous amount of thrust, and was loud enough to wake the dead.  What we saw that night was lower, slower, and not pitched at all. I don’t think it was alien spacecraft, but the technology was nothing known to exist to this day.  A few weeks later I saw a show on TV about the “Aurora”, the top secret space plane.  The supposed shape of the Aurora, according to the show, was nearly identical to what we had seen.  My guess is that we may have witnessed a test flight of this plane.  The only thing that keeps me from being sure of that is that there were no lights on it.  I know the US puts lights on all aircraft, even test planes.  We’ve seen this with the F-117.  This Unidentified Flying Object is wholly worthy of the title.  Not a flying saucer.  Not cigar shaped.  Not a light that moves at break-neck speed.  It was just an unidentified, slow flying, silent object.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,36.109455879967555,-95.93524541768045

Kind of off white color, maybe slightly yellowish.  Shape of both lights was mostly circular, but slightly oval.  They flew in an absolutely straight line, very fast for their size, no sound, and maintained an exact distance from each other.  I couldn't tell if it was two aircraft or one aircraft with two lights, but in either case, it had to be absolutely HUGE.  Each light was about the size of a dime if I put my arm out straight and held a dime in my fingers.  They came from the south and were heading in a north or slightly northwest direction.  Took less than 10 seconds for them to streak across the sky and out of sight. The date is approximate but definitely during the week of November 6.  I remember the time exactly because I was sitting in my car drinking coffee, parked just outside the flightline at Davis-Monthan AFB waiting for my shift to start.  I was participating in an exercise and normally wasn't there that early.  When I saw the lights go by, I froze, didn't want to blink or even breath.  The lights flew either right above the runway or were slightly outside the perimeter of the base, but they were going in the same direction as the runway.  I had been in the Air Force for over 11 years at that point, worked the flightline day and night, seen all kinds of aircraft come and go and I NEVER saw anything like this.  After the lights went by, I looked around the parking lot to see if anyone else saw it, but no one was around.  That in itself was odd.  There should have been several people in the parking lot by that time. When lunchtime came, I went back to my unit to report it to the SOC desk.  I asked them to call the tower or base ops to see if they saw it or got any similar reports.  The guy at the SOC desk just laughed and made a joke of it, like ""ha ha, Sgt E saw a UFO, what were you drinking, what were you smoking, can I have some of that too?""  I kind of expected that since he was an assclown so I let him joke around for a minute and then I asked him, ok can we get serious now?  Just call the tower and ask them if they saw it.  Next he just ignored me so I pressed him a little harder.  Then one of the ADOs came out of his office and told me to just drop it, asked me if I have somewhere I need to be and told me to get going. I've never seen anything like it since but if I ever do, I'll certainly never report it through Air Force channels since no one wants to hear about it anyway.  There's simply no one who takes such reports.  Report it through your chain of command and they won't give a crap.  Report it to any other Air Force agency and it will never make it past the nearest shredder or trash can.  The ""that's not my job"" philosophy definitely applies here. Since I just found this site and a couple others like it, I figured I'd check to see if anyone else ever saw what I saw, but I don't see any that match this particular sighting.

The object was round and either white or silver in color.  It was quite far away, and very small, but definitely visible as the sun was positioned in the northeast sky and so was reflecting very well off the object.  The sky was filled with lots of clouds, but with much blue sky in between.  The day was bright and quite windy. I first noticed the orb moving in a straight horizontal line across the sky from northwest to southeast.  Given the proximity to Charlotte Douglas International Airport we see airplanes in the sky all the time, and initially I assumed that was the case here.  But the object did not look like a plane, even from a distance.  It was definitely round.   Within one minute of my first noticing the object, it slowed, then came to a complete stop. It hovered for a moment, then slowly descended.  I can only guess at the distance of the descent, but it must have been at least a couple hundred feet.  It was a smooth, seemingly controlled, descent that took less than one minute. The object hovered again for a couple of minutes.  It was not entirely stationary, rather it moved around a little bit, perhaps just moving with the wind.  It was very windy on the ground, so it was probably even more so up in the sky where the object was.  Even so, all of the movement I saw seemed very controlled and stable, not as though it were just a balloon being blown around. After this, the object started rising.  It rose back to its original height, in a mostly straight line, but now it was also moving south - away from me.  The object continued to rise while moving south for about 2 more minutes until I lost sight of it. The obvious conclusion is that this was just a balloon being driven by strong winds. And it may have been.  But the object was very visible even though it was very small and far away.   Perhaps a mylar balloon would have this effect, especially with the sun being opposite in the sky.  But given the distance it was from me, I really think the object was much larger than a balloon otherwise I would never have been able to see it. Also, the movements seemed very controlled; it was not being whipped about.  It's path may have been affected by the wind, but given that it initially was going in a straight line, slowed, stopped, descended, stopped then ascended in a uniform manner it just did not at all appear to be a balloon.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,35.20580084001527,-80.82639156166476

An apparent star in the night sky which exhibited anomalous behavior,Fresno,CA,,other,30 minutes,"Occurred : 8/10/1963 22:00  (Entered as : 08/10/1963 22:00) Reported: 3/17/2009 8:40:03 PM 20:40 Posted: 3/19/2009 Location: Fresno, CA Shape: Other Duration:30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69247.html,"An apparent star in the night sky which exhibited anomalous behavior I had this experience as an 11 or 12 year old child, but I have always remembered it precisely.  I have long thought that I should submit a record of this to someone who would add it to the data on this topic, and I am finally doing it. Let me preface by saying that through the years, I have observed several objects that people who were with me at the time thought were UFO’s, but I knew they weren’t because I knew what they were.  One was a weather balloon, one a jetliner near the airport (when they have their landing light on at sunset, it is a striking sight), one a meteor close enough to hear the roar and light up the night sky and one a military missile in an inexplicable location.  However, the one sighting I can’t explain was the least visually striking.  I say all this to demonstrate that I have a decent amount of knowledge in explaining explainable sightings. One soft summer night which I believe was 1963, but may possibly have been 1962, my father, my three sisters and I went out on the patio to watch the Perseid meteor shower.  It was sometime in August.  We had a rollaway bed out there, and we all lay down on it sideways and side by side with each other.  We scanned the sky for shooting stars, which appeared at the rate of about one per minute. One of my sisters said, “look, two stars are colliding!”  We all looked where she indicated, and indeed, you could see two stars moving toward each other.  As we watched, they did, in fact, meet and merge into one, only to separate again after a few seconds.  After that, everyone else went back to looking for shooting stars, but I kept observing this phenomenon.  After a couple of minutes, I realized that only one of the two stars was in motion.  It kept moving on its steady path, and I kept watching. My first thought was that it was a satellite.  Some months earlier, forewarned by a news broadcast, we had gone out to watch one of the early manmade satellites pass overhead.  It looked just like a moving star.  I suppose it reflected light from the sun, which enabled us to see it.  It had a steady progression across the sky and kept a fairly steady level of brightness.  After ten minutes or so, I realized it couldn’t be an orbiting satellite.  I noticed its apparent path across the sky was noticeably slowing.  I kept watching, and the next thing I noticed was that it was dimming.  I kept watching for perhaps half an hour, and it gradually slowed until it was essentially motionless in the sky, and it gradually dimmed until finally, it slowly became impossible to make out.  At first sight, it had the appearance of a medium to medium bright star. It was clearly not a satellite or a meteor.  The only scenario I’ve ever been able to think of that matches my observation is that of a space ship in the process of leaving Earth’s orbit.  In 1963, we had no space ships which left Earth’s orbit.  What I saw was truly an unexplained flying object. I would be glad to answer any questions concerning this.

It was route 3 and we were heading toward West Chester. There used to be what was called 'the Nikie sight.' It was some sort of military installation with radars. (I wish I could remember more details about his facility and even how to spell it. (I moved out of the area in 74) Within a couple of years that facility was no longer there.) I was between 10 and 12 years old (my brother was 3 years older). It was starting to get dark. We saw one huge triangular shape on the ground. We saw many other cars parked along the road looking at this. So we pulled over as well. People had gotten out of their cars watching in amazement. ""what is this thing?"" It was just sitting there. Within minutes of watching it it suddenly lifted straight up in the air, very low humming sound, at which point we could clearly see the triangular shape with a white light on each of the three corners. It looked like a triangular shaped donut, because as i vaguely recall we could see a triangular shape hole in the center that we could see the sky through it. I can remember the people around us saying, ""What is this thing?"" As soon as it was a couple hundred feet up in the air it took off so fast and was out of sight. We heard a sound of wind, like a wooosh and it was instantly gone out sight. One UFO special on TV showed actual home video of a triangular shaped craft, through the trees showed a craft with 3 lights on each corner. The second I saw it, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. That was exactly what I had seen back in the mid 60's. Approximate date, hard to say I know I was between the age of 10 and 12.

It was reported on the radio that there were several military planes in the vicinity, and they attempted to chase it, but it disappeared so quickly over the mountains that they realized there was no way they could follow it at the speed it was going.

Moving approx. 120 mph south to north. maybe 5000 feet. seen by six people Hello Mr. Davenport,  I would like to let you know of an event that happened approximately 40 years ago in Reading, Pa. From what I can recall of the people present, there were probably five or six of us playing baseball in a large lot between two buildings. Don’t remember who said look at that up in the sky but we all froze when we saw the object. I recently checked out on google-earth the direction the object was traveling and it seems that it was going exactly south to north. The object was a large ball, but not fire. It had molten liquid flowing over its entire surface. The colors were blending and constantly moving. I can still picture it after all this time. The colors were green, purple and red and with other colors. It was moving horizontally with the earth. It also was an overcast day but not raining. The sky gave a good backdrop of the object. It was the size of a hardball if it was at ceiling height. There was no wind that could be felt at the time. As it went past overhead you could hear it make a slight whooshing sound. Its speed was probably about that of a single engine plane, not fast at all. I remember saying to my brother how can it stay up in the air going so slow. I also thought it odd that the liquid stayed on the object and did not drop off of it. I just can’t remember what year it was exactly, probably 1966 or 1967. At the time I was fourteen or fifteen. It has just bothered me all these years as to what it was. I wonder if you have heard of anything like this from other people? It’s just something you can’t forget.

I’d like to first say that I’m 62 years old, and not at all prone to either lying, or confabulation. I’ve not embellished this account in any way.  This event took place at approximately 1:30 pm in the afternoon.  Approximately 4 years ago I was driving  west along El Camino in Burlingame, CA. when I happened to glance off to my left, and noticed what appeared to be a large water tower perched on top of the bluff line. There’s a long row of hills that parallels El Camino…where all the rich folks live.  My curiosity was peaked. It seemed odd to me that I’d never seen it before, and also odd that it was even there. I hadn’t seen such a water tower since leaving the Midwest many years ago.  Since I was driving, while trying to explain this to myself, I couldn’t see it clearly. I was on my way to Albertson’s to cash in a bunch of loose change in their coin machine. I pulled into the lot, and maneuvered myself so I could see the object/tower more closely.  It was then that I realized that this ‘thing’ was NOT a water tower. It was hovering just above the trees, and appeared to have just come out of a very dark, stormy, cloud front that was hanging along the ridge crest. These cloud banks are very common here as this was the last storm of the season.  I was able to get a very good idea of its size/shape because it was so close to the top of the trees, and only a few blocks away. I’d say it was anywhere between 50 feet to 75 feet in diameter. It had a dull, but reflective surface. It sort of looked like old metal. There were absolutely NO protrusions, windows, lights, or any other markings on it that I could see. It was perfectly smooth and shaped like a giant, somewhat flattened football, but with the ends distinctly rounded off.  As I watched, it began moving…VERY slowly. It hugged the tree tops as it came forward, and down. It moved closer until it was only about two blocks away. It was extremely clear! There was absolutely NO fuzziness about it. There was no noise that I could hear.  It continued to move down the hillside towards me, and then stopped briefly…still only a few feet above the houses. Then, it began to move to my left. Again, it was moving ever so slowly. I watched it until it went across a well traveled main road, and then disappeared behind a large business building.  Now, all that being said, the most interesting thing about my sighting was that NO ONE else seem to be seeing it! NO ONE stopped to look, and it appeared that no one was even seeing it except for me!?!?  I watched the papers for days afterward to see if it had been reported by anyone else. It never showed up in the papers.  Another odd aspect to my sighting is this: I’m an avid UFO inquirer, and have been since I was a teenager, and some friends of mine once had an experience that freaked them out. This was  in McPherson, Kansas, circa 1961. So…  …why didn’t I jump in my truck and pursue it? Here’s what I was subjectively thinking/feeling…  That it was trying to lure me, and I felt quite apprehensive/vulnerable. I felt as though maybe this was some kind of test. I felt that I was the only one that was supposed to see it. Yes, I know this sounds odd, but it’s the truth. Instead of chasing it, I went into the store to do my business.  For the record, I’ve only had one other close-up, interactive sighting in my life. That’s another story!",2008-10-31T00:00:00,37.567250442477885,-122.37095663716813

I was coming home from Yuma , driving North on HWY 85. I had been watching a large light that was above the Palo Verde Nuclear plant. It was very large and very bright white.  A color white that is hard to describe.  It was over a no fly zone for at least two hours.  (I had seen this object before when I was 10 years old in Mesa Az.) I was very excited and started calling everyone I knew to ask them to take a look. Then as I got closer to town  I pulled off the road to take some pictures,not long after a semi truck had also pulled off. I was stopped  right in front of Lewis prison and started to take photos.  Just then the object started moving towards my car.  The light actually turned off, I could still see the image and my camera caught it on film.  It was a bar bell shaped ship. Then about 12-16 f-16s came from all different directions  and went straight for it. I caught this on film to. Then I saw a bright , I wanna say explosion, it was like the ship sucked in one of the planes or  crashed into it or something.  The ship got extreamly bright, and in my photos you can see what looks like smoke. Then all of the planes went off in different directions and the ship got dim then  very bright once again. Then it swayed back and forth about three times , as if to get momentum, and took off very fast directly over my car.  It made only very quite , warm sounding vibration - if that makes sense? I was on the phone with my dad at the time and my cell phone went dead. After a few seconds I got service back and just then a cop pulled up and ordered me to leave. I asked him if hed seen what happened , he replied ""A lot of strange things happen out here , now get lost!!"". The next day on the news they reported an f-16 had crashed while doing test maneuvers  and the pilot had died. The crash  was in the same area where I had witnessed the bazaar  event.  I sent the pictures and story to a gentleman at Shadow Research . They had the pictures analyzed and declared it a ufo and declared them as authentic. I have been trying for years to get some response from the air force, police, anyone to get some answers. Of course no one had any comments and or said I was crazy. I had photos to prove what I had seen. Since then all the pictures I had have been erased or lost. My lap top was stolen shortly after this and it had all the images stored  on it. I am now going to contact the guy at Shadow Research to see if he has them saved and ask for copies. I am sure he would have saved them, I know he did a lot of research on the story.

Now I feel lucky that I'm a small percentage of people to witness something like this.  I remember the date and time as I had started a new job that day.  I took our two dogs out to go to the bathroom around 8:30pm.  We had no fence around the yard at the house we had just moved into, so I had to stand outside with them.  The sky was clear that night and the weather in eastern Oregon in March at night is usually not to cold.  I was facing west, watching the dogs when something caught my attention.  I don't remember a sound, so I don't know why I turned to look.  I looked to the SE over my left shoulder and saw 4 or 5 white lights moving towards me on a NW path, a little more west than north.  The lights seemed to trail the one in front of it, but had its own flight path.  They appeared like one side of a triangle with the other side gone and no back side.  I would guess the lights to be no more than 2000 feet above the ground and traveled at a slow speed, between 50 and 100mph.  My first thought was that it was the wing of a very large plain with lights on it.  But the lights were only a block or so away and I didn't hear any noise.  This also ruled out helicopters.   I watched the lights fly over the neighbors house directly to the south of my house and where I was standing with no sound at all!  At this point I was not worried, my brain was just trying to figure out what these lights were.  As I watched the lights move in the WNW path something happened that put fear into me.  Once the lights were 2 or 3 blocks past my house, the lights started moving into a circle pattern.  The first light started into the circle pattern with the others following, keeping the distance between them.  The did one or two circles, continued NW and moved out of range of my vision.  I wasn't sure if the forward momentum stopped when they started to circle, or if they continued to move forward.  I called my wife outside in the event they might come back.  She said she could tell by the tone of my voice that something was wrong.  I spent 4 years in the Air Force and have watched countless plains fly.  What these lights did (with no sound) is not something I believe our technologies are capable of.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,44.0861,-117.0188

The lights were out and I was using 2 candles to light the pages:  It’s a long story.  My window is on the 9th floor facing East ward, overlooking downtown Toronto from the West.  	I took a cigarette out of the package beside me on the window sill, pickup up the lighter and looked up and directly out of the window.  At that moment I was struck with the fact that there were 2 objects in the sky which I had never seen before (and trust me, I look out this window several times per day and night).  The only words I could use to describe the situation at the time were of a questionable nature.  	The 2 objects were holding position in formation.  One was slightly higher than the other and only a nudge off to the left.  They were bright amber in color and luminescent.  At first they looked like gigantic stars.  It soon became clear when, after sitting still for approximately 4 seconds, both of them darted off to the right with incredible speed and acceleration.  Without slowing down or accelerating, they immediately stopped and went in the opposite direction as they were joined by a 3rd from across the lake.  All 3 objects maintained a delta formation that was rotating slightly as they flew at the speed of mach 30 off to the North and out of sight.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 12-15 seconds, in which time they covered a distance of no less than 85km.  	The objects were luminescent spheres, travelling at mach 30 or beyond, in perfect delta and parallel formations.  They were within the atmosphere, not higher than 1km above ground level.  They switched directions and appeared to have the ability to accelerate and decelerate almost instantaneously.  	I’ve run through the list of all possible explanations and this incident seems to defy every explanation.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

I was fourteen, I live in Washington D.C, but I was up at our cabin in Montana with my whole family. My grandma, uncle, and I were outside looking at the stars. My uncle told us he saw a glowing light about fifteen feet in front of us. We all looked where he was pointing. For about 10 seconds ever 5 or so minutes, an extremely bright light about the shape and size of a softball would glow. It was white and extremely bright. Our cabin is pretty isolated so it is pitch dark except for the stars. After watching the glowing orb for about half an hour, I noticed there was another one in the trees to our left. We began to get a little freaked out and tried to come up with explanations, because we were all hardly ones to believe in UFOs. After watching the orb in the tree and the one in the tall grass 15 feet in front of us, we noticed one far in the distance on the top of Black Butte (the mountain in front of our cabin). At first we thought it was a star, because it was on the edge. But it was so bright and too big to be a star. At that point, it began to inch extremely slow in a straight line across the mountain. I really have no idea how to explain the next part of our sighting to you. We had been watching the orbs for give or take an hour and a half. We were frozen there, mesmerized by what was going on. All of the sudden, out of the pitch black, a bright white light swept across the side of the mountain, and across the field beneath the mountain next to our cabin. We could see everything in the light. Everything else was pitch black except for were the light was hitting, it was illuminating every tree, every blade of grass, everything in its path. I ran inside to get my dad and my grandpa, but by the time I got them to come out, everything was gone. We tried to explain what had just happened but it just sounded crazy.

What I saw changed my life, and i will take a lie detector to prove it.  It was about 9 to 10 at night and it just got done storming... I worked with my mother and brother in a self ran janitoring company...  We left our house.. about 6 blocks from our house is a gas station to gas up before work..  Taking our normal path ((which i can go more in to the route if needed.)) another person a friend of mine was along to help us at work that nigh. We were driving a geo metro, a small car I was in the left side of the car..  My friend next to me in the back seat..  My mother driving and my younger brother was in the front seat. the distance between our home and the gas station is grid like city blocks, and right next to the towns broadway... this was not a low populated are..we live on third so.. once we hit 6th street i was looking up in the sky and saw the cloudes where glowing..not enough to make me thing it was something in the sky i thought it was a effect from the storm.. as we drove between street 6 and 7th I was watching this cloud when something starts to lower out of it... It was one of them traingle looking ufo's.. what was crazy was how close it was... for a mila second i couldn't believe what i was looking at cuz ... it was so close if i had a crappy hand gun or a really good sling shot i could hit it. it had a spot light like thing on each point of the traingle and the lights moved indepent from the others.. like they were searching from something... i yelled to the car.. LOOOOOOOOOOOKKK.. (( hehe. what else are you supposed to do when something like that happens)) anyhow.. my mother and brother turned quickly and looked right out.. we slowed the car down we had to be only going 10 at the time anyhow putting my head out the window I trying to get a bet look. the spooky part was... this thing was almost a block long.. hovered in the air pointing the direction we just drove from... and made no freaking sound a! t all..I can't explain to you when you see something almost a block long with no sound, just floating in the air.. its hard to even fathom..my brother and mother were looking at it... but the funny part was my buddy was text messaging and still to this day didn't see it ... but he will say that we were freaking out. Now as my head is hanging out the back window for sight the light in the front points right at me.... I never been scared.. like really scared in my life.... but when that light hit me I was waiting for something bad to happen.. but it was more like they saw us.. and kinda released they were being watch.... the traingle dropped down about 2 feet in the air.. and silently took off.. toward broadway.. bout 7 blocks the direction we came... and moved so damned fast i say it covered... 7 blocks in 2 seconds.. and went back up in to the clouds... mind you when they shot off like that... no force or sound was felt. I am a gamer by nature, and a ufo skeptic.. my brother is a lot the same.. and my mother is the type that she is so damned fightful of something like that she never make it up.  Im not the type of man who makes stuff up.. actually if you ask my friends the thought of this stuff wigs me out but i saw it.. and the truth matters.. im sure i could never tell anyone anything and some day if there are ufo's or miltary planes.. or what ever they are out there we will know.. but what i saw was the truth.. take this account do with it as you please.. i just hope it helps ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I actually heard something loud that sounded like a jet that was flying very low. Actually that's what made me perk up because it was so loud it made me look up because I thought I would see it. That's when I noticed the sky. It was covered in white clouds. Not one white cloud but seemingly the whole area of sky seemed covered in one white cloud, perhaps with some slight spaces in it but it was like one big cloud. It was so big that although it blocked the moon out it kind of created its own light. What made it kind of surreal is that I lived in a small building directly and diagonally across the street from a school football field. So it looked surreal looking up and seeing it over such a wide space. Well- that's what I saw once I looked up to see what sounded like a low flying jet. It seemed like it had to be some kind of military jet because it sounded loud and very fast. Well- guess what.......after looking up and noticing the wierd clouds everywhere- that is all I heard. Was the sound of the jet. But here's the kicker- the sound did not go away for a few minutes. Let me let that sink in for a sec so that you can understand me......We all know how loud a low flying, fast flying military jet must sound. Not that I have ever seen a low flying, fast flying military jet- but that is what I expected from hearing the sound. NOW.........IT DID NOT GO AWAY FOR A FEW MINUTES. I stood at my window kind of scared as I realized what I was hearing seemed to come from over the clouds and I got the distinct impression that it was that HUGE that it encompassed that whole area I was lived in, including the football field across the street. I got a VERY STRONG impression that I had heard it approaching, heard it travelling over me, and heard it travelling away. NOW- this was all TOO LOUD and TOO LONG a time for it to have been a jet. I KNEW exactly what it was and had a very strong idea of how big it was. My reaction at that experience, was WOW- That thing has a cloud under it to hide it and that thing is TOO BIG to not be a familiar object to the government.

It was september 28th 2005 a buddy (buddy1) had a house on bradys beach its a beach on the end of vancuver island that looks acrose to 3 other islands and toward japan  over the herivon.  The 3 of use were walking down the beach to the rock stacks when we noticed a tug boat was heading for the beach. We new it was a tug boat all three of us were raised in the area and we have studied the boats, lights and signals, this tug had its all around white light on aswell as its tow light so we thought. We were just making a comment on how the tug was heading for the beach when we saw its load start floating backwards. Naturly we all got excited and started sceeming on how to go salvige its load when it shot up in the air. The tug boat stratend out and took off, we dint even watch to see were the tug boat went we were all to captivated by this object sowrring throug the sky heading over the 3 islands ( from rite to left when looking at the islands from the beach Helby, Diana, Edward King). The it focused on diana island moving unaxplainabuly and making a wushing nosie like the sound you here when u put your ere agenst a fan. The object was like an L.D light from christmas trees white with a blueish tinge, at first the object looked huge, then seconds later we were watching move so fast through the island we could see it moving through out the trees an obgect like this had to have been really smalland abile to navagiat on a dime. As we watched we tryd are hardest to convince eachother what this object could be, we playd with the idea that it was a rescue helicopter looking for someone, or drug smoglers with some new technolagy but as we watched it move darting and dashing through out the trees it proved us wrong. It apeard to be looking for somthing or taking pictures of the island. We dint know what to think we even tryd telling are selves we were having a mass halusination, so as it kept circuling the island, moving through the trees we all sat there watching it saying out lowd witch way it was moving. All together at the same time we were sayin ""left, right, down, then WOW "" , we figure that the object must have re-botted because as it was heading up its tail that it would leave as it moved got thincker and hit the grownd and a ball of light whent exploding from each direction. After that we dint speek for a good 40 mins just watching this light endlessly going through out diana island, then buddy2 says ""if anything happends, if it ubducts me im going to bit off my tung"", and that was the first moment i belived that this was an alian a ufo, somthing non human. Just as i was excepting this, the white bluish lite shawn over the water, over the beach acrose the rocks and hit us we sat motionless i observide the shadows that this light left and they wernt really shadows i could see the sand i could see the opisit side of the rocks witch the light hit, they had a shade like a shadow but they werent shadows i dont know how to explain it.Then the light kept focusing on the island, it kept moving through the trees,we had been watching the light for about 3hourse when buddy1 desided to go get the bonculars so we all walk towards his house yet never took are eyes off the light, buddy2 and I sat down at the edge of the water as close to the object we could wile buddy1 came back with the bonuculas we observed the light through the bonuclas trying to keep up with its movmens, i could kind of make out a roundish figure,but the light it was preducing was more intresting it almost seemed like it was doing tight circuls underneath the object going into it, like the light was coming out of thin air going up into it, then it whent back into the trees and was moving even more rapidly then before. By now it was about 5 am and buddy1 had to go to work within houres so he went back to his cabin. But as buddy 2 and i watched the light seemed to have dragged somthing to the tide line and continued to dart through the trees within another houre the tide hade came all the way up and then the light hoverd over the object , witch seemd dark and round  and just a little bit bigger then the light. The light then started moving almost floating from the island on top of the object it had dragged from the forest, first it had to come toward us, and wile it was heading in are direction the faint nosies it made got lowder and it was woshing through my head i dont know if i was just focusing on the nosie and only the nosie but it was like it was the only thing i could hear, not waves crashing on the beach , or the thought going through my head just this woshing sound sounding like it was going ! in circu les lowder and quite lowder then quite as it started turning for the hurisine, and within minuites it seemed we could no longer see the light, as the sun came out it vanished off into the open ocaen with what ever it recoverd from Diana Island. We watched this for 6 houres, I was the only one who wasnt aftaid of what people might think if i told them but no one belived me, i told every one i thought would listen but the boys dint speek of it. We had plans to go over to Diana Island to see if there was any burnings on the trees or plants, or if there was growth abonormiltys to any of the plants, but the next week was stormy, gale force winds and i dont think any of us were ready to find anything that could convince the ones we respect and love. But still to this day we look up to the sky and anything moving we watch it to see what it might be , any time we here a nosie that is simular we listen, just maby we could see somthing again and not be astrange to it. Buddy1 and I were talking the other day and he made a coment ""You think after seing somthng like that it would change your life, your belifes, but 3 years latter im just like oh yah iv seen the unxplaind and i liked it"". We still live are day to day life we know theres somthing out there and thats alrite because were never alone, who wants to be?.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,48.93015,-124.99805

It was around 9:30 pm, a little later than our usual time.  The moon was almost full and very bright, the skies were perfectly clear and very low humidity for us here in Louisiana. Jupiter was bright and almost parallel at the time we were looking up. We were about to give up and go inside when I caught a glimpse of something that I first thought was a shooting star. I quickly pointed at it and told the wife to look before it faded away. But, it did not fade away.  I then though it was one of the plentiful White Cranes we have here in Louisiana, but I quickly realized it was not flapping any wings. My wife and I started asking each other what is that?  The object appeared to be a large wing shape and white, and had sort of a faint glow as if light was reflecting off of it. It was moving at a very fast speed, coming from the east headed directly west. It did not very the speed, or waiver off of its direct course. We were able to view it until it just faded in the west sky. We were both stunned at what we just saw. We love to star gaze and watch for meteors and satellites, and I'm an avid NASA site watcher and I always know when the ISS or Shuttle are in viewing range, and we watch it every chance we have. But this was so different. As we stood there reflecting on what just happened, we started re-playing it out loud to each other, trying to make a logical explanation of what it could have been, either a plan, a bird, whatever, but we were completely puzzled and amazed.. Here are some details that we recalled and discussed that really made this sighting even more mysterious to us. When it first appeared over the house it was already visible. The moon was very bright so if it was a low flying object it would not have been reflecting the moon light from the bottom, which made it appear to be glowing from within itself. It was not a bird because the wings never moved, it was moving very fast (faster moving than the ISS sightings) and it never fluttered or altered from its direct line of flight. It made absolutely no sound. There were no white, red, green, or blinking lights on it. We live in the flight pattern to the airport just 10 miles away, so we are very familiar with what aircraft looks like on its approach. When it faded from view, it was some where around 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon in the west sky, and I know from my many years of keeping up with the ISS, it would never be moving from east to west.

I looked above me in the direction of NW and witnessed a brilliant flash of light in the sky.  The thing that struck me odd about it was that there was nothing overhead in that area (no hill, building, lights, ect), and the flash seemed somewhat concentrated in that it didn't seem to spread out far across the sky to my sides or behind to my knowledge.  I will note that no alcohol had been consumed that night, and I do not ever partake of any drugs.  There was some rattling of metal type noises in the distance directly after this flash, but I think that would more likely be attributed to nearby apts or college students out late at night in my opinion.  I didn't think too much of this until I got a text from my girlfriend who was in bed and was worried when her window facing NW got bright and she thought someone might be out! side or something.  Her apartment was a good 100 meters to the East of where I was standing when I saw the flash from the NW. I figured I should at least look into it by filling out a report.  I will note that I didn't see anything I would describe as a ""craft"" or ""object"".  All I witnessed was a brilliant flash of light in the sky that reason couldn't explain.

I say ""strange"" because neither of us had ever seen anything like it before.  It was significantly bigger than a typical airplane or helicopter light; it was amber orange in color; it was very bright in the cloudless sky, even with the full moon; it did not have a well-defined outline &#8211; more like a flaring ball of plasma than a solid circle; it was a steady light, with no flashing or strobing.  The speed seemed to be about the speed of an airplane. When we first looked up, we were afraid because we thought a plane was on fire.  But it was traveling in a deliberate, straight line, going in a SW direction, approximately 45 degrees up from the ground.  We could not discern how high up it was but the size made us think it must not have been at a high altitude.  We heard no noise from the object.  It never veered from its course but c! ontinued on in the same direction the whole time.  At some point, our vision was obscured by trees in the distance, but the object did not reappear from out of the line of distant trees.  It seemed to have disappeared.  We looked for it for a long time afterward but saw nothing.  At the point where it had been obscured by the trees, it was still visibly large to us, so we doubt that it simply got too small to see in that short a time.  The entire sighting took several minutes as it went from the NE sky (where we first spotted it) to the SW where it seemed to have disappeared after our vision was blocked by the tall, distant trees.  We saw airplanes flying over the same general area both before and after we saw the amber light.  Seeing them right after the amber light confirmed to us how different they were.

It came to rest Se of the logging town of Alberta.  It disappeared 1 1/2 hours later. Completely. First of all, at the time of this sighting I was not under the effects of drugs or alcohol.    At 9:07 PM (21:07) at the Ford Forestry Center in Alberta (L'Anse), MI, I was standing outside talking on a cell phone when I looked up to see what I suspected was a satellite.  Seeing satellites was extremely common place in Alberta, as the light pollution is very low.   As I watched the satellite, it drifted across the sky at what seemed like a much slower pace then any satellite I'd ever see had.  The object traveled roughly 1/4 of the visible sky.  As I watched, it came to a dead stop at a heading of southeast (I had a suunto compass readily available).  It then split into two separate white lights, much like stars and then re-merged together.   Not believing what I was seeing, I ran to one of my friends dorm room window and knocked on the window of one of my dorm mates.  I told her and every one else to come out and look at the star.  Her and 5 other of our class men came out and begin looking at the object, which swayed slowly back and forth, much like a pendulum.   We watched for a while until the object settled on a southeast heading and remained perfectly stationary.  We all wrote it off to our mind playing tricks on us, and it must be a normal star just flickering or giving the appearance of moving.   We all went back inside, but at this point I'd become suspicious.   Roughly an hour and a half after we first saw the object, I went back looking for it in the sky.  It had completely disappeared.   I got my friend out of her room again and she too confirmed the object where we'd been looking earlier was gone.  I did not get any pictures or videos of this happening since it was so slow in happening and I couldn't decide if I was seeing something noteworthy or average.

We were stopped at a red light on an overpass, and we both watched it as it moved from a northerly direction to a southerly.   I took a closer look at it and realized that my initial impression of the craft was wrong, there were no wings, windows or tail like a small plane.  It was bright silver and it gleamed in the sunlight.  It was a very clear day with a bright blue sky, and the craft was shaped like a cigar.  From my perspective, it moved over Route 22, and! it seemed to be very maneuverable.   My son was excited, and when traffic began to move again, he gave me updates as to what the craft was doing.

A friend had come to visit me, and we had been to the 4th of July celebrations nearby.  She was staying in one of the cabins down by the ocean, so we decided to sit on the shore and visit a while.  It was very late – perhaps 11:00 or midnight.  We noticed that across the bay, just above the tree line, there was a big green glowing ball, and it was moving slowly to the right.  We continued watching it until it went out of sight behind us and to our right. This may have taken a half hour.  A few minutes later I sensed something, and I turned to see the green ball hovering above the trees just behind and above us.  Then we heard a splash, and turned to see a white raccoon emerging from the water in the little cove we were sitting by.  It was a big raccoon and instead of being afraid of us, it was coming straight to us. I could see the phosphorescence dripping off his body.  My friend said, ""Hi, little raccoon!""  I instantly felt scared and I grabbed her wrist and yanked her up and we ran to the cabin.  We stayed in the cabin for a while, but eventually went back outside.  There was no sign of a raccoon or a light or anything.  The next day we asked people if they had seen the green light, but no one we asked said they had.

As we admired the clear cool October sky, stars clear, moon bright and vivid, one of my family members pointed north just above the trees and said,""look at that plane, its flying just above the trees"".  Everyone's attention focused on the flickering lights as they appoached, no one spoke another word as we were all trying to bring into focus an airplane. That never happened and so no one spoke because no one knew what it was, even after it passed over.  The craft took a long time to arrive. I would estimate about 1 minute passed from the time we first saw it until the time it arrived over my Gradfathers' house because it was moving so slow.  It was shaped like a plate, 3 times the size of my Grandfathers house, with strobe lights that went all the way around the craft changing from white around most of the craft to red, white, then red again before starting back to white.  As if 2 lights in the rear were red seperated by one pulse of white, then back to white all the way around the rest of the craft very rapidly.   The craft was solid and the moonlight made the top of the craft appear a blue/white color and moved slowly and rose a bit to clear the higher ground and trees to the south of us over my aunt's house.  The craft was completely silent and was flying so slow I thought it would fall out of the sky on top of us at any moment.  That was my biggest fear at the time.  That it might just fall on us.  It was so big and slow.  I have the benefit of having my parents and relatives there.  We discuss it occassionally and re-confirm what we all saw for our own edification and satisfaction.  If anyone else saw the craft, I woud love to hear about it.   My cousin said it was Easter 1966, she might be right as she is a little older than me.  I think it was before Holloween in 1966, she disagrees.  I think my time is correct because I remember giving my book report to my class before the holidays and that spring of 1967  I was silent about UFOs because of the reaction I received. As a boy I had followed the US space program and knew I had seen nothing like this in my life up to that point or since. In 2004, while serving as a Police Advisor for the Department of State in Iraq, I met a gentleman who was a retired Air Force Officer and told him my childhood experience and he laughed and said I know exactly what you saw.  He called it the Lenticular Re-entry Device.  He told me it was a round craft, powered by electricity generated by a nuclear power plant with a crew of 5.  He said it remains classified to this day because of the power plant.  He told me the craft was an experimental craft that carried a crew of 5 and was capable of carrying 2 nulear ordinance weapons and could acheive low earth orbit up to 200,000 feet.  He drew mw a picture of it and it was similar but no way to say for sure it was the same thing I saw. I remember vividly the experience and the experience there after as I did my next book report at school on the subject of UFOs and what I learned was ridicule comes fast for having seen something extrodinary that no one else had seen.  I haven't spoke with many about it since then but those that were there with me at the time and the exception of others who have shared similar experiences as I had.

During my 2nd year of college at UT Martin, a friend and I were scouting the area south of Martin Tennessee for sites to take girls in the car.  We had just turned off of highway 45 going east onto a road that made a hard left turn shortly after turning onto it.  In front of us, before the left turn there was a huge (presumably) oak tree, and hovering over and behind it was a very large saucer shaped disc.  The diameter of the disk was approximately the same as the tree in front of it from our perspective, and I would estimate to be about the same as a saucer for a coffee cup held at arms length. We could see what appeared to be a row of windows around the perimeter.  One of us, I don't remember which, said ""wow, look at that"" and pointed to it. We watched it descend, and presumably land in the field behind the tree. Then I, who was driving, said ""lets go check it out"".  It was afternoon, but still broad daylight at that point. The next thing I remember us is being on the other side of highway 45, back on a farm next to a creek.  My friend and I were looking around a small meadow on our side of the creek, and there were woods on the other side, and it was dark, although there was a full or near full moon, so we could still see pretty well.  We were both very apprehensive, but did not know why.  Then we suddenly saw a white figure standing beside one of the trees on the other side of the creek.  We looked at it, and it darted behind a tree. Curious, but also anxious, we crossed the creek to see what it was, but could never find it.  When we discussed what it might be we finally decided it was an albino bear cub, standing on its back legs in an upright position.  That sounds stupid today, but we could think of nothing else it could be.  Many many years later when I was walking through a bookstore I saw it on the cover of a book, and almost fainted. The book, which I bought, was named Communion. The odd thing was that at that point I did not remember the craft we saw earlier at all.  And we never mentioned the sighting of the craft or the ""being"" to each other after that time to each other.  Only after years did the memory of the entire event come back to me, and by then I had lost contact with the other fellow.  Also it was years before I realized that the two events were really the same event with a time between them that I still do not recall.  I have considered having a hypnotic regression done to try to find out what may have happened during the time I can't remember, but have not done so. I did take several people to that area in the following months because I was completely unnerved to be in that area and thought they would feel it as well, but no one I took there later had any strange feelings like I had when I went there. Decades later I dreamed of the event, and in the dream saw a huge flying saucer ascend from the field near the creek.  I however have no conscious memory of this, but still remember the dream quite vividly. Also neither of us had been drinking as we were both under 21 at the time.

This sighting was from approximately the summer of 1967 or 1968. My fiancée and I were driving south on Waukegan Road in Glenview, Illinois and saw a large, (about the size of the moon when it is midway up in the sky), round glowing object hovering high over the road about ½ mile in front of us. There was no noise from this object.   Everyone was out of their cars, including the police. All traffic was stopped. This object was so bright, all that could be seen was light. It hovered there for such a long time, that we finally had to leave. I’m going say it was there for at least ten to fifteen minutes before we left. I remember saying to my fiancée that we would find out about what happened the next morning, because it would definitely be in the newspaper or on TV.  There was no way that this could go unreported, because the police and 25 - 30 people were standing in the middle of Waukegan Road watching the incident. There was no report in the paper, or on the news the following days. FYI, the Glenview Naval Air Station was about four or five miles from this spot. Many years later, I tried contacting J. Alan Hynek, but he had died. I believe I contacted his office and they said they had no report of this, but that was probably 15 - 20 years after the occurrence.  It was so extraordinary, I can’t believe there wasn’t a report to someone. I’ll never forget the sight of this, and will always wonder what it was. Someone suggested a flare, but it was so large, hovering in one spot for so long, and didn’t move the entire time, so another person in the crowd said a flare wasn’t possible.

Washington, NH Shape: Circle Duration:2 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68866.html,"Three incidents that happened to me in the White Mountains. My friend and I were hiking to Tuckerman's Ravine on Mt. Washington late at night in 1967. We were both 17 and still in High School.   I decided to rest on a very large rock and drink some wine. We were laying on our backs looking up at the stars when my friend said, ""look at that star moving across the sky"".  I  said, ""That must be the satellite echo, the one covered with a reflective surface.""  Then my friend started stuttering which was a complete surprise to me.  He said ""Tha tha that's no satellite, it's reading my mind.  Then I connected also and it flashed a great big ""Hello"" like in lights in my brain, and then it shot off toward the moon and disappeared into a speck and then gone.  It's possible that we were abducted because I can't remember anything about the trip after that except driving home.   There are two more incidents connected to this.  One happened 7 years earlier in 1960 when I was 10 years old.  This time my family was with me, my father, brother and mother. Hiking from the top of Mt. Washington to Mt. Adams, I became very ill and had a 104 degree temperature. When we finally made it to the Mt. Adams hut, I was burning up. My mother asked everyone at the hut if they were a doctor. One couple told her, ""We are not doctors, but we can heal your son"". She said ""OK"" and brought them to me in the mens dorm. They explained to her what they were going to do. ""We are going to put our hands on your son's chest and remove the fever."" The woman put her hands on my chest and the man put his hands on her elbows. Immediately they started to withdraw from the burning heat that drained out of my chest. The man said to the women, ""Did you burn your fingers?"" She said ""yes"" and I could see her fingers were bright red. I felt completely better immediately. My mother took my temperature and it was back to 98.6. My mother will vouch that all this happened. My brother and father didn't see it and didn't believe it. We learned later that this couple belonged to the Atherious Society. The next incide! nt happe ned seven years after the second incident, which was listed first. , when I was 24. Again, I was hiking to the Mt. Adams hut, this time with my 17 year old cousin. We wanted to go to the top of Mt. Adams first, but there was a large man completely covered in rain gear and all you could see were his eyeballs. He was standing at the base of the trail to the top and he roughly told us we couldn't hike up there because of the bad weather. It was windy, but it wasn't very cold and it was a bright sunny day. I could see a lot of people coming down from the top. We were a little annoyed but decided to take his advice and take the short cut to the Mt. Adams hut. When we were about 50 feet away, something lifted us up in the air about 4 feet and layed us on the ground gently on our backs. I looked back, but the man was gone. I was sure he had done this to us.  Again, I don't remember discussing this at the time and ever again with my cousin. A few years later, I wrote to Betty Hill after Barney had died. I told her about these incidents and I got a wonderful letter back from her. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",,,

There were few lights in the canyon, and we could see every star. Suddenly, 6 lights or ""Orbs"" of light , extremely bright, megenta, or reddish purple, cant really describe the color, suddenly appeared, over the mountian across from us about 2 miles away I'd guess, and the lights just sat there stationary in a row, 6 lights,for about a minete or less, then they split up into 3, each flying away in 2 directions so fast, that I knew in my soul, that nothing moves that fast in the sky on this earth! 3 lights on one side, 3 lights on the other side of the sky several miles apart dancing, zip zip up and back, then just as fast as the parted they came back together in a row, and 6 lights sat in a row, and turned from the megenta color to white.  There was no glow around the lights and there was absolutely no sound.  Remeber, we are on the edge of the Los Angeles forest, in 1967, no sound at night, you could always hear a pin drop, and those lights made no sound. At first I thought it was some new airplane coming from the army base just around the mountian from us.  The school bus picked up the kids from the base every morning so it made sence for a minete, but when the orbs of light moved so fast I knew there was something strange about them.  Then after about 3 or 4 seconds, the lights changed back to megenta and off they went, gone so fast that I hardly saw them go at all, and they were all in a row of megenta lights when they went. none of us four kids ever talked about it and none of us told our perents, because we knew no one would beleive us, and actually we didnt beleive it!  We just thought that there was some explination, and we'd never know because we were just high school kids in a mountian town, full of hicks,who'd care?  It's 42 years later and I know what I saw, and now I beleive that the 6 lights were probably atatched to one object, from hearing other peaples experiences.  And by the way, that army base didnt test planes.  Remember, I was 17 years old, what did I know about army or airforce?  But I know what I saw!

While serving on board the USS Zellars DD777, while on NATO task force operations, a number of lights that looked like flares rose out of the water off of our port beam.  These lights appeared comming up from the sea, (distance indeterminate), rising up and disappearing into the sky. There were five of these objects.  A few seconds later they dropped back into the sea.  We thought perhaps they were distress flares from a ship. A few minuetes later they rose out of the sea and performed synchronized  manuevers moving up and laterally in perfect formation.   They then rose up into the sky and disapeared.  I think the whole episode lasted perhaps two to three minuetes.   The USS Gearing one of our sister ships was initially dispatched when the objects were first sighted to see if they were flares from a ship in distress.  However they were no reports of may day calls or missing ships and our combat information center, (CIC), could not get a radar fix on the objects. The whole incident, (as was par for the course), was never recorded as a UFO sighting but rather as an unsubstantiated ship distress signal. With regards to the USS Scorpion who were a part of our manuevers, she was most likely sunk by accident by one of the two Soviet subs that followed her out through the Straights of Gibralter into the Atlantic - they were playing ""cat and mouse games"" and I personally think the incident was an accident. ((NUFORC RESPONSE TO SOURCE OF REPORT)) Dear ((name deleted)),  Thank you very much for the excellent, and interesting, report!  Are you still in touch with members of the crew of the USS Zellars?  If so, I would like to invite you to have them submit reports of the incident, as well.  We know from experience that different witnesses to the same event often see, remember, and report different aspects of it.  Have you considered the possibility that the Scorpion might have been sunk by the Israelis, or a force in sympathy with their interests?  The Israeli submarine, ""Dakar,"" was lost on January 29, 1968, in a fashion which suggests to me that the U. S. might have had a hand in that sinking, given the Israeli attack on the USS Libery on June 08, 1967, an act of war against the U. S..  We might have sunk the Dakar as an act of quiet ""quid pro quo.""  Thanks, again, for the fine report!  Cordially,  Peter Davenport, Director NUFORC ((END))",,,

I was coming back from mountainburg and was already in chester. I was heading ""west"" on old crossroads when I noticed a flash in the sky. My first thought was ""wow, that plane is flying low"".  Then when I looked back up I seen it was making a sharp curve just above the trees. I realized then that no plane can fly that way. So I did a u-turn and went to a spot close by where I knew I could pull off the road. I got out of the car and stood in the road watching this object. It was flying and making curves that a plane could never make. It would then straighten up and fly normal. Then it would slow down and wiggle from side to side. It did both the curving maneuvers and wiggling a few times. It seemed to move more of my way so I was able to get a good look. There is really nothing to explain cause it was very plain looking. It was oval shaped. Toward the edges of this object it got thin. Meaning it was alot thicker in the middle then the edges. There was no markings or windows. It didnt make a sound. But what I consider the most fascinating was the color. It was the most shiny silver color I have ever seen. It was amazing how the sun reflected from this object. I want to say it looked like a piece of polished sterling silver, but it was more shiny then silver. I can honestly say I have never seen such a brilliant piece of metal before. I literally had to shield my eyes from the glare. After it did its funny flying and wiggling a few times it slowed down again. I figured it was going to wiggle like it already had several times. But instead it took off like a bullet. It was so fast I cant even explain how fast it was! It took off in a northwest direction over the top of a mountain. It was still just above the tree line when it took off. It wasnt a large object. As a matter of fact it was rather small. I'm making a guess here, but would say it wasnt over 30 feet long.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

Then another red light came towards it in the same path it had just gone. When they came within what looked like inches apart with the naked eye, they both moved along slowly together.

Preamble: I have not reported this sighting, as really I do not fully understand what ""reporting it"" is really achieving in a global sense. It seems there are few people willing to take things seriously in an ""official"" (Govt.) capacity. The only people cataloguing these events, seems to be a dedicated, yet to some extent uncoordinated global group of researchers. I am compelled to write as the event was so significant for both my wife and myself, that it is still a real topic of conversation today. The Event: I was driving the family car down Lake Road Westfield at about 1 am, when I noticed a HUGE Orange object in the sky. I stopped the car and both my wife and I got out to look... Three other cars also stopped during the sighting, their occupants also got out to observe. The object was huge perhaps 50 or so metres wide, with no clearly discernible shape. It was ""burnt orange"" in colour, towards the yellow end of the spectrum. It hovered above some houses about 200-300 metres above them.... We were watching them in a southerly direction (facing south) and a second (similar) object was some considerable distance further south... I recall another witness saying to us, ""What the hell can it possibly be?""  Of course we do not know!  The object closest to us remained there for about 5 minutes.  After which it sped off rather rapidly in a southerly direction, towards the second object.  There was no sound and no ""fancy"" manoeuvres.... I must confess I am completely bewildered as to what it (they) could be and how an object can remain stationary, given its enormous size, at such a low altitude. I guess I will never find out. I considered sending this to WA Researcher, Brian Edwards: http://tinyurl.com/4r2bvu  However his site was last updated in 2000, hence I think it has probably been abandoned... I will send this to the email address supplied on the site... It could well be he has another site somewhere, that I am unable to find.

I was so freaked out, this thing at one point slows up and looked at me from behind the house, this is not the best quality and I didn't have a lot of memory left and I was really in shock, so I tried to get everything but there was a moment where it actually peeped around the corner of the neighbors house looking at me after I got out of my car, thats when I got scared, all things combined I started to panic so I went inside but this is what I caught on tape. For what it's worth. And no it wasn't a airplane, it was in my neighbors back yard and had lights like a airplane but different u can see the one hovering and lighting up the street light pole and ground, it was not visable but the lights ARE, these things were small and WIERD looking, almost like it was trying to be disguised like a airplane but it looked like a footbal or something with bright colorful lights. Too many colors for a airplane though, I was scared, but at first I thought I was seeing things. Please just watch the video. I want to say one thing, this thing gave me the CREEPS! Thats all I gotta say the creepers man, like it was going to get me if it found me. Part 1 of 3 Sorry it took me so long to redo this so everything appeared in proper sequence.

After discussing local history (his family goes back to the 1700s here in RI) he related a story his father (now 83 years old) told him a while back when the father was in his early 20s during WWII.  The father at the time worked for the family junkyard where cars were cut up and the metal sold to the U.S. for scrap for the war.   This summer night the father was in his workshop cellar in early evening when he saw a basketball sized ball of light come in through the open cellar door, slowly traverse along each wall, stopping at the workbench where tools were hung and then sending out 'electric sparks' to the tools while the father backed away in amazement.  The ball of light was silent and gave off no noticeable heat.   The ball then slowly exited through the same open door and disappeared outside.  This was approximately 60 years ago!   The carpenter himself has had several close sightings of UFO in this same area over the years.  And, my ex-girlfriend, two years ago, saw this same soccerball shaped ball of light cross in front of her stopped car one night, about 3 feet off the ground, cross the street to a church, then go up and over the steeple of the church and disappear.   I have called in this particular event to NUFORC as this particular UFO was seen by various other witnesses that night.   The area I live in, Perryville, in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, is a kind of 'hot spot' for UFOs as I myself had a close sighting as had another carpenter who works with me now at my house.   The carpenter related to me that a family in the nearby beach community (Matunuck) had to move away because of a constant visitation by this same UFO or similar UFO at their home over a period of time.

He was pretty comfortable and we walked in this place often. All of a sudden he and my dog went on alert. I thought it probably a black bear (we have them around). However, I saw something very strange. The best way I can discribe what I saw sounds silly. It looked like two long, really skinny, frogs standing on two straightened out legs - upright. I tried to make sense of what I was seeing telling myself it was two snakes standing up straight or something. When the two frog things bent over and picked up something (and I saw they had arms) that seemed like it was like a bucket. They both lifted it - looked at me and turned and walked into the woods. Despite the fact the dog was barking and my horse was acting up and rearing and pulling and naying - I walked a little forward trying to figure out what I was REALLY seeing. I saw the grass moving as they walked through it. The one turned and looked at me again - and at that point I was literally dragged back by my horse who broke free and ran all the way back to the barn followed by our border collie.  My phone book is Kecksburg, but I have never been a UFO person. When I was very young I lived in Montgomery, NY and saw a craft of some sort with my Mother, but we always thought it was an airforce craft. Occasionally we have a odd thing go on with sound here, it becomes VERY, quiet and sound carries in a very odd way and we hear some sort of odd noises. It is quite rural. I think I believe in other types of phenomena, but not UFO's. I would like to know what it is I saw. I have not seen it again and both the dog and the horse get worked up in that spot.

Also,included are contrast shots including stationary buildings and the moon for a point of reference. WHAT ARE YALL'S THOUGHTS ON THIS? The bright star, near the moon, ... it's moving! (though mostly stationary) but absolutely moving unlike anything of OUR technology!!!  And no, it is not a satellite, or space probe.

After finishing hunting for the day we had returned to camp and were starting dinner just after dark, around 10pm or so.  One of the persons in the party asked me if a light in the sky was a meteor; I looked up and saw a bright light and said no, because a meteor would have been streaking across the sky and this was stationary.  I then went back to digging out my MRE. A few minutes later someone else in the part said it might be a satellite because it was moving.  I looked again and verified that it was moving and likely was a satellite. About 5 minutes later the second person pointed out the same light again at which point I looked up and it was still in the same area of the sky but was no longer moving, and could not be a satellite as far as I could tell.  I then began watching the light, which remained stationary for several seconds and then started moving in a corkscrew fashion.  To be sure that I wasn't seeing things, I asked the rest of the party to look at it at which point the person who originally observed the light said it has been moving on and off since he asked about it the first time and validated that it was currently moving in the corkscrew fashion that I was observing. At this point we all laid down on the hillside and watched the light, which was moving in alternate corkscrew and fishook patterns, and also randomly moved quickly across the sky in straight lines, while making 90-degree direction changes as well as reversing instantly.  All four of us observed identical behavior, and we soon found a second light to the west performing similar behavior.  As it was still just past dusk and there was a full moon, the only other objects visible in the sky were the moon and Jupiter(?). We continued to watch these lights as other stars appeared in the sky for the next hour or so, and validated that they were moving in relation to each other and the stars.  Given that we could not determine how high or how big these objects were, it was not possible to tell how fast they were moving, but the instantaneous changes in direction were strong indicators that they were not satellites or the ISS.  To the naked eye they appeared to move at about the same speed as a satellite for 3-5 seconds before changing direction.  Both objects never left the general areas of the sky (almost straight above us and East of us towards the rising moon respectively) and eventually we got cold and hungry and went on about getting dinner and going to sleep. On Sept. 6th from my home in Wasilla I again looked the general area of the sky at around 10:00pm just after dusk and did not see either object present, nor any other objects moving around in odd patterns although I did see several meteors and satellites over the next hour, again confirming what we saw did not resemble either in the least.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

The sky was very clear, no clouds and no fog.  My friend and I were talking face to face and a bright light lit up in the sky behind him.  I glanced over to see what it was and I saw an object in the sky about 2-3 inches wide from where I was standing... not too sure how far it actually was though.  If I had to guess I would say possibly 20 miles north and lower then an airplane flying in the sky.  It had a few VERY intense lights underneath it that I seemed to have felt the heat from... it was very faint, not enough for my friend to feel it, but I completely felt it get slightly warmer.  The same warm feeling as if someone were to turn an intense spotlight on you.  The UFO was traveling extremely smoothly at a very slight angle (maybe 15 degrees or so) up toward the sky for about 3 or 4 seconds, then all of the lights turned off, my eyes adjusted from the intense lights going off, and the ob! ject was completely gone. My friend saw my expression change in my face and turned around to see what I was looking at, but when he turned around he only turned enough to see into the apartment next to us.  He thought I was looking at something in the apartment so he didn't turn around all the way enough to see the craft.  He told me that the expression I made was so genuinely fearful that it freaked him out... although after it passed I thought it was awesome!  - Dan",2009-12-12T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

I'm a 60 year old engineer who has had Nuclear Regulatory Commission clearances to work on, and operate, nuclear reactors in the U.S. In August of 1970 my friend Tom & I spent a few weeks vacationing at the New Jersey shore.  Days surfing and nights at a camp ground 12 miles due West of Ocean City, N.J. Slightly after midnight, with a very clear sky, we sat outside our tent looking at the stars. A line of large, prop-driven, military cargo planes were passing directly overhead, going North.  A yard stick held at arms length would have been the length of their wings tip to tip. They flew so low their engine's noise prevented any conversation.   With the Vietnam war at its height, these flights were common along the coast. We heard the 1st plane coming minutes before it was directly overhead and the noise was intense until it moved on.  The 2nd plane, which appeared to be a mile behind the 1st was no different.  As it passed over,and onward, there was a flying disc shaped craft directly behind it by about 1/2 mile. The disc was as wide as the plane's wings, tip to tip. It didn't wobble, made no sound, and flew in the formation at what appeared to be the same speed as the cargo planes.  It had a few solid red lights on each edge as if marking the four points of a compass. As it glided off, following the 2nd plane, we saw that its middle was as thick as the cargo plane and tapered toward the edges.  No leading edge could be seen nor could we see any markings or windows. In disbelief we were questioning each other as to what we were seeing when our speech was soon overwhelmed by the noise of the 3rd cargo plane now passing overhead. Adding to our shock was the sight of another identical disc shaped craft tailing 1/2 mile behind it.  It was so silent we could here the crickets chirping as it went directly over our heads. No more disc were seen as the remaining planes, perhaps six in all, continued out of site. I haven't seen any U.F.O.'s since nor has Tom.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,39.2548,-74.6029

Do you know if it would be too late in my life (age 51) to be hypnotized in hopes of revealing more information about my UFO encounter when I was 13?   My encounter took place in the back woods of Georgia in 1971.  I was visiting with some friends that were my age.  We were living in an isolated area that was home to 2 mobile homes.  There was myself, another boy and 2 girls.  There were no adults around at the time.  It was about 3PM and the 4 of us were sitting outside in lawn chairs removing peas from their pods.  We were just talking then out of no where a very large silver disk object appeared just above the treetops (Georgia pines) and approximately 50 yards away.  The object did not have any lights or make any sound it did have a large shadow.  The four of us saw the object at the same time and without saying a word to each other the 4 of us bolted to the inside of the mobile homes.  One boy and girl bolted into one mobile home and the other girl and I bolted into the other mobile home.  We still have not said anything to each other we were petrified.   When I got in the mobile home I grabbed a large knife out of one of the kitchen drawer and hid in a small closet in the kitchen that the garbage was kept in.  After what seemed a long period of time I finally got the courage and started yelling for the other girl that was in the mobile home with me.  She yelled back at me and we slowly left our hiding spots.  She was hiding under the bed in the first bedroom.  We eventually went back out and the disk was gone.  We then went into the other mobile home and got the boy and girl out of there.  When I returned home to Warner Robins AFB, GA the following weekend I shared my experience with my sister and she had told me that during the time I was gone there was a high level of UFO activity in the Georgia area. Why I would like to be hypnotized is to get a better idea of how long we were actually hiding in the mobile homes.  I have no memory of the actual time span that this took place.  I also believe I would be able to better describe the UFO under hypnosis.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

It was in the summer, august probably as I was home on leave from tech school in Rantoul, Illinois.  Just after basic training in the Air Force.  I lived in a small town in Ohio, Mt.Sterling, about twenty five miles south of Columbus. There is a small creek running through it called Deer Creek, now made larger by a dam project built there in the mid 70’s. While on leave from the Air Force my uncle, and two of my friends, and I  decided to go fishing near the bridge on the north end of town. There were stands of trees on either side of the creek bank and open farm fields beyond there. We had been there about 4 hrs camped out with the usual fishing gear and such when around midnight, one o’clock a large shape rose out from behind the trees. The object was approximately 200 feet or more long or I should say around with an indescribably blue light emitting from the bottom. It was the color of a welder arc but not painful to look at, it was more of intense glow than a light. The light or glow was probably 80%as large as the craft was. The craft made on sound and emitted no heat, nor air movement. It rose approximately 100 feet into the air, and stopped!  It did not wobble or move it just stopped. The craft stayed there for at least 10 minutes and then began to slowly rise increasing in speed the farther away it got.  Its assent was precisely vertical and continued until it was a pinpoint of light. And then it was gone. Needles to say we were all stunned at what had just happened and decided to make haste out of there. The next day the newspaper came out and a couple driving on the highway had placed an ad inquiring if anyone had seen anything strange in the sky that night. I was just in the air force, and project Blue book and UFO’s were being officially call swamp gas, so I did not report the sighting. Soon after that I returned to my Duty station in Fla. I have never spoken with the people I was with again, and do not know of there where abouts. So if you would like to track them down you would be welcome to. We were less than a hundred yards from this craft, I know of no other report that has been that close, I can understand folks seeing light and other such things at a distance.

I minute later he knocked on my door and told me to come outside he wanted to show me something.  We want out and he pointed to the sky.  I looked up and there were 5 or 6 objects moving across the sky very slowly. There was no way to calculate the distance but they looked like stars except they were moving slowly in single file across the sky.  We didn't really think UFO at the time, we just kind of wondered what they were. We said goodnight and went home. The next day at work (we both worked at the same company) I picked up the NY Daily News the read about the game.  There on the back page taking up half the page was an article with numerous reports of UFO's, from the US to Russia. I believe the Russians were reported as sending up jets to intercept. Another was the Governor of I think Ohio reporting a UFO flying over the roof of his car as he and his wife were driving down a highway.  If I was to see the same thing today I would probably think they were satellites and maybe they were.  But I found it very unusual that a major publication would have a story so prominently displayed on it's back cover the day after we witnessed this event. I don't really believe in people from other worlds visiting us, only in the possibility.    My friend still feels that they came to watch the game.

Around 1975 while living in Southern California I encountered a very strange occurrence.  Like the Northbrook, Illinois incident I witnessed a vehicle hit an invisible object.  I was sitting at a stop light with one other car that was directly across from me, also waiting for the light to change.  I heard a crash and looked up to see a car that was traveling from right to left had come to a complete stop just short of the intersection.   Steam was spewing from the radiator and it had a large dent in the grill.  It was like the car hit a pole but there was no pole.  I saw nothing that could have caused this. The next thing I knew the light had changed and I proceeded through the intersection slowly.  It felt like a dream and I was just along for the ride.  I remember starring at that car and even looking over at the other car that was proceeding through the intersection across from me.  Very strange was the thought in my head that said ""keep going.""  Not an audible sound but more like a thought.  What makes it so weird is that I was a Vietnam vet and knew how to react to all kinds of stressful incidents but found myself just as an observer and unable to react.  I never reported that accident to anyone and that was also strange because I was a Security Policeman in the Air Force and worked with the Arizona State Troopers and the California Highway Patrol with accidents involving military personnel.  I was no stranger to accidents and accident reports but never reported this one. Over the years I’ve felt badly that I didn’t help that poor person explain the weird accident to the police but who’d believe such a thing?  I have told very few people about this but who would?   I saw a car hit an “invisible” object!!  Reading about the poor lady from Illinois brought back this memory and I truly sympathize with her.

It was a weekend and we were in High School.  There were four of us, Abe, Javier, Spencer, Pat and Jason (myself).  It must have been back in 1996 when this occurred.  I remember because I had a summer job working at a ranch with my step father. We were driving back from Alice, TX which is a town ten miles from San Diego, TX.  We would go there to look for girls and like the rest of times we came up short that night.  Well, we were about 3 miles from San Diego when a big white bird flew across the rode.  It flew from right to left, then up.  This is what caused us to look in that direction.  Abe was driving his small Ford Escort, (he was the first to see it) I was seating in the passenger seat.  Pat was right behind me.  Then next to him was Javier then Spencer.  Unfortunately Pat wasn’t able to see this thing from where he was sitting and now we always giving him crap about not seeing it.  So, Abe shouts, ""What the hell is that!""  I look to see and there it was. High up in the air was this Green Rectangle.  Looking at a full moon it would be twice the size.  The shape and color was awe looking.  I hear people say it’s like being in a movie but it’s not like that at all.  It’s real; it’s out of this world.  I’m feeling funny just writing and thinking of the magnitude of what we were all a witness to.  It’s scary.  The color of it was green for sure, but the clarity of it was what gets to me.  It was like a green you’ve never seen before. The green was almost smoke like but solid at the same time. The smoke may have been the light reflecting off the clouds. The interior of it was black or we couldn’t see it. The size of it!!! I believe with all of my heart, that as far as it was and how big… it must have been 3 football fields wide.  That’s the one thing I’m mostly sure of out of this whole thing.  It was moving up slowly, straight up, and then it was gone.  The interior of the car which was silent is now loud with gibberish and yelling with, ""What was it!"" and ""What do we do?"" it was chaotic for bit but we gathered ourselves and went our separate ways that night.

I am a 35 year old male and have the need to share with you this sighting, for it has troubled my mind for the last few years. I have finally been given the strength and courage through much prayer, as to have a record be given of this experience and the significance of this event. On the night of this sighting, I felt compelled to go outside for reasons only God knows the answer to. On or around the the 28th of July, 2006 at 7:00pm....I was witness to a craft which was traversing the sky, at around or above 18,000 feet. I observed it from on our balcony facing due south, in the direction of its flight path. If you know where the I-5 and 14 freeways intersect, this is the general area it was heading from my vantage point. The location was over the Santa Clarita Valley,(Canyon Country is where I lived specifically) and was headed in a southwest direction toward the San Fernando Valley...(both are in the Los Angeles County area respectively). This craft was a boomerang or chevron configuration. It closely resembled a letter V. It emitted no sound and had red strobing lights running laterally down the trailing edges of the body. These lights did not blink, but rather faded one after another before cycling again down the craft's wing structure. I would with near 100% confidence estimate this V shaped vehicle to be in excess of 1,000 feet...or nearly a 1/4 mile in width wing tip to wing tip! The speed of this vehicle defied aerodynamic law for a vehicle that would have been under conventional propulsion with regard to aircraft such as fixed wing prop, or jets. It moved very slow. The length of time of our sighting was roughly 5-7 minutes, before disappearing beyond mountains that obscured further observation. I can estimate the altitude of flight because it was higher than the Cirrus clouds. Enough light was present from the still fading sun to observe cloud cover and the black coloration of the craft, and was coming back into view from behind (or above) clouds at times. The clouds were sparse and not very many were present. I think you will love to know, that 2 others were able to observe this UFO with me. My mother and father. When I initially saw this thing, I ran into the house and alerted my parents to the presence of this craft. They followed me to the balcony and stood in utter shock as we observed it together. My mother noticed something that gave her a point of reference to the scale of this thing. She pointed out that a passenger aircraft was flying literally UNDER it! Yes we saw it pass under the V shaped craft because the jet was visible with the craft behind or above it in the background. This was possibly a 747 jet aircraft (we saw the jet had 4 wing mounted engines). I made the comment,"" Holy crap...that jet could land on it Mom""! The size of the jet was like that of a tic tac in the sky, the V shaped craft was bigger than her fist when she held her hand in front of her and tried to cover it. One more key element that is quite possibly VERY significant. After our sighting of the V shaped craft, for many days afterward, we saw numerous times F-16 aircraft making a highly unusual amount of flights over the area we saw this thing. These F-16's were seemingly ""looking"" for it. They traversed the same direction (south western), then east to west and north to south, between the hours of 7pm to 9pm for the next 3 days. They would also fly quite low and then would be at higher altitudes when making grid like flights.They flew in formations of 2 and 3 at a time. What is also unusual is they were flying in airspace that is used by commercial aircraft, let alone the UFO itself had done this also. In and outbound flights use that same airspace from Van Nuys A.P., Burbank A.P. and Whitman A.P. It is interesting to note that Edwards Air Force Base (about 90 miles) and the Naval Air Weapons Station (about 97miles) in China Lake are closest to the location of our sighting and possibly where these jets were based out of. My father later made the comment, ""I was in the navy, and that thing was bigger than an aircraft carrier, and it was in the damned sky""! They are now true believers that there are things in this world that are not of this world. Whether or not this vehicle was of our own design, that of extra-terrestrials or a combination thereof or somewhere in between does not matter, it was there and they exist...PERIOD!",2008-10-31T00:00:00,34.411422844827584,-118.41426293103449

The sky was a beautiful deep purple and was very clear. What happened played out very quickly. So quickly, that I did not blink. A bright blue light appeared in the sky. It just appeared, but then quickly got a slight bit larger, as if it was heading towards me. It had to be extremely far away. It was small, but at the same time it was huge compared to what a passing plane would be, or a helicopter. By the way it was not a helicopter light. I have never ever seen a light that strong or in that bright blue color in the sky before. It stopped and then went up and backwards like in the shape of a slight arch until I could no longer see it. It moved so fast that there is no other technology I can compare it to. You could tell it moved a vast distance when it left.

I was driving through Norfolk, NY, around 11 o'clock and was in an area of farm fields.  It was really dark out.  All of a sudden something big and even blacker than the night sky came across the road in front of me from my right.  My headlights didn't light it up or anything.  There were no lights around it so it was just this huge, black thing.  I was so startled I said, ""Whoa!"" and momentarily crossed the dividing line in the road while looking at it.  Believe me, I have never done that in my life!  As I kept looking out my side window I could make out two huge lights at the back of the black thing.  I couldn't get a sense of the shape of this object against the night sky, but it was huge, low, moving steadily, and only had these two huge, round lights on the back end.  They had to be the size of plate glass windows.  I was really confused because I didn't understand why, if this was a plane, it didn't have the usual lights on it, and why it was flying so darned low.  No lights but those two huge lights at the back.  I've thought and thought about that night so many times and the thing that really stays with me is the fact that there was no glare from those lights.  Even a street light has a glow around it and lights on houses have a kind of glow around them from the distance.  These lights didn't have a glow like they were an exhaust.  You couldn't see anything but bright white, and the way they were lit made no sense.  Why didn't they glow, you know?  If it was a plane and those were the tail ends where engine heat should be coming out of, why didn't it appear to be doing that?  And why was there no sound?  A plane that low would have been noisy.  I didn't even notice the thing until it was right overhead in front of me.  I've looked online at lots of airplanes since I saw that and I haven't seen the back end of one plane that looks like that thing did.  I would have pulled over that night to look at it, but there were two cars a ways behind me and there was not enough space for me ! to get s afely off the road.

I've seen formations of big orange lights before, flying stars and recently 3 orbs flying in triangle formation; but this one last year was special to me.  Sighting occurred on May 14 2007 between 01:00 AM and 01:50 AM local time  Me and a buddy saw a boomerang shaped flying object in the clear night sky; which was flying very low over my yard. My buddy saw it first. It first appeared to be a very fast moving cloud. It kinda uncloaked itself and first appeared to be transparent. Then he was able to see the small lights on the bottom (which by that time were turned on) and then was able to see whole ship, it appeared to be of a silverish color with a strong reflecting effect...like a mirror...like it was heavily polished. For a blink of an eye it recloaked and turned into a ""cloud"" again, but then instantly reappeared. By that time my buddy informed me what was going on; since I was looking in a different direction. The ship then reappeared near the Great Dipper. There was not a single cloud that night; so this thing caught our attention. There was a church tower near by so we figured that the object flew quite low (approx. 82 feet/25 meters). The boomerang kinda uncloaked in front of our eyes, and as soon as it had passed the Great Dipper it cloaked again and disappeared. It had a orange glow at the front, some sort of dome at the rear and some sort of lights (which were turned off) and the bottom. We were able to see it in full detail. The ship's color was silverish and the dome as well as the big lights at the bottom were appeared to be tinted (the small lights described above, where not visible any longer [turned off] ). I'd estimate the craft's wingspan was the size of at least 3 or 4 Airbus A380 Airplanes put together. The sighting didn't last long, maybe 2 minutes and a few seconds.

I came back downstairs and as I got back into bed I saw a flashing light in the corner of the guestroom window. At first I thought it was lightning but I knew I hadn't heard any thunder and that a storm was not expected. I went to the window and pulled back the shade and stood in front of it and in the rear pasture (about 500 feet away) I saw very large flashing white lights and it seemed there were smaller lights that were trajected out from the larger lights that were flashing at a faster rate.  (From looking at photos on the internet of UFO sitings, it may been not flashing lights but a craft turning fast -- though they appeared to be flashing.)There was no sound at all. It seemed to be a craft but I couldn't see a craft -- only lights --if the lights were attached to something, it seems that the craft should have been round. I guess my first thought was that it was a helicopter but I soon knew this couldn't be the case as it was much too large and didn't make any sound at all. It moved across the pasture and closer to the house and at the end of the pasture (about 300 feet away) it appeared to come down and to try to land. It was only at this point I became frightened.  But then it quickly raised up into the air again and went off behind the house where I couldn't see it any longer. The smaller flashing faster lights continued to be on the side of the house where my window was for another 5 to 8 seconds. I went to the back of the house but by the time I arrived there, I could see no more lights and was too scared to go outside. The next day I went out to the pasture but saw no evidence of anything that was visible from a landing or an attempted landing. My impression was that it wanted to land, somehow detected me, and then decided not to! land. P erhaps an electrical or energy field that it created by being so close is what made me hear my husband's voice wake me up. It was clearly not my husband who was fast asleep upstairs and I still don't know why I woke up.  I didn't contact authorities in the area as it is rural and no one wants the local authorities to think they might be crazy.

I was 10.   My mother ran outside and waved her arms hoping they would see her signal.  They did.   We lived on Clough Rd, a cul-de-sac of town houses inhabited by several FBI families, a priest who lived next door to us, Gov. Volpe’s brother and the rest mostly made up of professional type families.  At the end of the road was the Clough’s big white farm house with stately trees dotting the land.   On the first evening, the UFO hovered above one of these trees approximately 100-500 feet above us. It shot straight up about 1:00 am.  It was a brightly illuminated oval with colored lights circling beneath. We think we saw what appeared to be windows, as well.   The second evening scenario was a repeat.  My mother called the Blue Hills Observatory in Canton, MA.  About 11:30 pm on the second evening, two Navy jets flew one above and one below the UFO (it had shot up a little upon their approach).  They flew off and repeated the maneuver flying by in the opposite direction.   On their third approach back, the UFO shot straight up and we watched until it disappeared from sight. The Navy would not respond to my mother’s follow-up calls and asked her to stop calling.  The event was witnessed by over 30 people the first night and many more the second night.  There were a few, including my mother’s best friend who became hysterical.  Everyone else was in awe.  This event has shaped my beliefs through out my life.

I called from the shop to the house and asked my wife to bring her fathers old 300 power telescope to the shop. She brought the scope and I laid it over a 55 gallon drum and we three watched the thing for about 15 - 20 minutes.

My wife called some neighbors and her brother who lived in Potter, Nebraska 11 miles south. Don climbed his shortwave radio tower and looked with his binoculars stating he saw the light in the north. After eight to ten minutes one of the lights appeared to the west side of the craft and moments later the other one appeared.  One and then the other entered the bottom of the craft, then the craft, shot off to the southeast and disappered in a flash. Never was there a sound we could hear and the craft only moved slightly to the west from which it came before it  zipped off to the southeast in a flash.

We heard no sound at all. =====================================================================================  See below in YELLOW the report from F. E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming 90 miles west of our sighting just west of Souix Army Depot, ===================================================================================== ** Begin Excerpt **  The popular impression through the years was that Blue Book was a full-fledged, serious operation. The public perhaps envisioned a spacious, well-staffed office with rows of file cabinets, a computer terminal for querying the UFO data bank, and groups of scientists quietly studying reports, attended by a staff of assistants.  The actual situation was unfortunately the opposite. The operation was generally headed by an officer of lesser rank. In the military the importance attached to a mission is usually in direct proportion to the rank of the commanding officer. The relatively low-ranking officers in charge of Blue Book were usually assisted by a lieutenant and sometimes only by a sergeant. For one long period of time a sergeant with little technical training was given the chore of evaluating most of the incoming reports.  This was not exactly a first-line, high priority operation. Blue Book had much too small a staff to do justice to a phenomenon that so often greatly concerned the public. Compounding the problem, the staff was able to devote only part of its time to the technical problem at hand. During my regular visits to Blue Book across the years I observed that much of the work in the office was devoted to peripheral matters all done at a leisurely pace.  Further, Blue Book's low-ranking officers had no leverage to initiate the type of investigations that were needed and for which I frequently asked. The military is entirely hierarchical; a captain cannot command a colonel or a major at another base to obtain information for him. He can only request. As long as Blue Book did not have at least a full colonel in command, it was impossible to execute its assigned task properly. In reviewing cases that had come in during the previous month, I often asked that additional, often crucial information on a case be obtained. The results were at best minimal; officers at other bases were generally too busy to bother to investigate further. Why should they? They all knew it was a finger exercise anyway.  Blue Book was a ""cover-up"" to the extent that the assigned problem was glossed over for one reason or another. In my many years association with Blue Book, I do not recall ever one serious discussion of methodology, of improving the process of data gathering or of techniques of comprehensive interrogation of witnesses.  The reader may well ask at this point why I did not either lay siege to the Pentagon, demanding action, or simply resign in disgust. Temperamentally, I am one who can easily bide his time. I also dislike a fight, especially with the military. But most importantly, Blue Book had the store of data (as poor as they were), and my association with it gave me access to those data. In a sense I played Kepler to Blue Book's Tycho Brahe.  As far as demanding action from the Pentagon, I knew only too well the prevailing climate and recognized that had I been too outspoken, I would have quickly been discredited, labeled a UFO nut, lost access to data, and certainly would have lost all further effectiveness. I have always been of the turn of mind that ""truth will out"" if given time; if there was indeed scientific ""paydirt"" in the UFO phenomenon, as time went on and the gathering of data improved, even the most hostile skeptics would be powerless to sweep it under the carpet. The astronomer traditionally adopts a very long time scale.  By and large, however, Blue Book data were poor in content, and even worse, they were maintained in virtually unusable form. With access to modern electronic data processing techniques, Blue Book maintained its data entirely unprocessed. Cases were filed by date alone, and not even a rudimentary cross-indexing was attempted. Had the data been put in line readable form, the computer could have been used to seek patterns in the reports, to compare the elements of one report with those of another, and to delineate, for instance the six basic categories of sightings used in this book. Since all the thousands of cases were recorded only chronologically, even so simple a matter as tabulating sightings from different geographical locations, from different types of witnesses etc. was impossible except by going through, manually, each and every report. A proposal for elementary computerization of the data in the Blue Book files, devised by Jacques Vallee and myself and submitted by me directly to Major Quintanilla at Blue Book, was summarily turned down.    In view of the above and of the frequently contradictory and inane public relations statements concerning UFO reports, which even the man on the street found unconvincing, it is hardly a wonder that the charge was frequently made that the publicly visible air force ""investigation"" of UFOs was merely a front for a real investigation being carried on somewhere ""higher up.""  Were I the captain of a debating team whose job it is, of course, to marshall the facts favorable to his side and studiously to avoid the other's, I could defend either side of the argument. At no time, however did I encounter any evidence that could be presented as valid proof that Blue Book was indeed a cover-up operation. However, many indications, bits of information, and scraps of conversation could be force-fitted into a yes for the cover-up thesis. Thus, for instance, one time when I inquired into the specifics of a certain case, I was told by the Pentagon's chief scientist that he had been advised by those at a much higher level to tell me ""not to pursue the matter further."" One can make of that what one will.  In a country as security conscious as is ours where central intelligence is a fine art, it frequently seemed to me that very provocative UFO reports were dismissed without any seeming follow-up - certainly an illogical if not dangerous procedure unless one knew a priori that the report really was of no potential information value to the security of the country (or that it was but was being taken care of elsewhere). As an example, the report of five rapidly moving discs, made by a member in good standing of the 524th Intelligence Squadron stationed in Saigon and observed by him from the roof of the squadron's headquarters, went untouched by Major Quintanilla and Blue Book on the grounds that ""the sighting was not within the continental limits of the United States."" It would seem almost inconceivable that the intelligence officer in question would not have been further interrogated by some agency; certainly in an active battle area his sighting might have presaged a new military device of the enemy.  Another example, one of many, was this, on the first day of August, 1965, and on the following two days there occurred the ""Midwest flap."" From several states strange Nocturnal Lights were reported by ostensibly reliable police officers on patrol at various places over an area of several hundred square miles. Blue Book dismissed this event as ""stars seen through inversion layers,"" although I know of no astronomer who has ever witnessed inversion effects that produced these reported effects. Both past experience and calculations show that such illusory effects, in which stars move over at a considerable arc of the sky, simply cannot be produced by thermal inversions.  However, police officers weren't the only ones to report. The following is a direct transcript of a Blue Book memo: In the early morning hours of August 1, 1965, the following calls were received at the Blue Book oifices by Lieutenant Anspaugh, who was on duty that night:  1:30 A.M. - Captain Snelling, of the U.S. Air Force command post near Cheyenne, Wyoming, called to say that 15 to 20 phone calls had been received at the local radio station about a large circular object emitting several colors but no sound, sighted over the city. Two officers and one airman controller at the base reported that after being sighted directly over base operations, the object had begun to move rapidly to the northeast.  2:20 A.M. - Colonel Johnson, base commander of Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, near Cheyenne, Wyoming, called Dayton to say that the commanding officer of the Sioux Army Depot saw five objects at 1:45 A.M. and reported an alleged configuration of two UFOs previously reported over E Site. At 1:49 A.M. members of E flight reportedly saw what appeared to be the same uniform reported at 1:48 A.M. by G flight. Two security teams were dispatched from E flight to investigate.    2:50 A.M. - Nine more UFOs were sighted, and at 3:35 A.M. Colonel Williams,commanding officer of the Sioux Army Depot, at Sidney, Nebraska, reported five UFOs going east.   4:05 A.M. - Colonel Johnson made another phone call to Dayton to say that at 4:00 A.M., Q flight reported nine UFOs in sight; four to the northwest, three to the northeast, and two over Cheyenne.    4:40 A.M.. - Captain Howell, Air Force Command Post, called Dayton and Defense Intelligence Agency to report that a Strategic Air Command Team at Site H-2 at 3:00 A.M. reported a white oval UFO directly overhead. Later Strategic Air Command Post passed the following: Francis E. Warren Air Force Base reports (Site B-4 3:17 A.M.) - A UFO 90 miles east of Cheyenne at a high rate of speed and descending - oval and white with white lines on its sides and a flashing red light in its center moving east; reported to have landed 10 miles east of the site.   3:20 A.M. - Seven UFOs reported east of the site.  3:25 A.M. - E Site reported six UFOs stacked vertically.  3:27 A.M. - G-1 reported one ascending and at the same time, E-2 reported two additional UFOs had joined the seven for a total of nine.  3:28 A.M. - G-1 reported a UFO descending further, going east.  3:32 A.M. - The same site has a UFO climbing and leveling off.  3:40 A.M. - G Site reported one UFO at 70' azimuth and one at 120' . Three now came from the east, stacked vertically, passed through the other two, with all five heading west.  When I asked Major Quintanilla what was being done about investigating these reports, he said that the sightings were nothing but stars! This is certainly tantamount to saying that our Strategic Air Command responsible for the defense of the country against major attacks from the air, was staffed by a notable set of incompetents who mistook twinkling stars for strange craft. These are the people who someday might have the responsibility for waging a nuclear war.  For some, incidents such as the above would be prima facie and conclusive evidence that the cover-up hypothesis was the correct one, on the grounds that no group charged with serious defense responsibilities for the country could have been so stupid.  On the other hand, our hypothetical debating team captain could amass an even more impressive cache of evidence to conclude quite the opposite: that the entire Blue Book operation was a foul-up based on the categorical premise that the incredible things reported could not possibly have any basis in fact. After all, science pretty well understands the physical world and knows what's possible and what is not. Since the reported actions of UFOs clearly didn't fit this world picture, they simply _had to be_ figments of the imagination produced in one way or another.  All my association with Blue Book showed clearly that the project rarely exhibited any scientific interest in the UFO problem. They certainly did not address themselves to what should have been considered the central problem of the UFO phenomenon: is there an as yet unknown physical or psychological or even paranormal process that gives rise to those UFO reports that survive severe screening and still remain truly puzzling?  Such lack of interest belies any charge of ""cover-up""; they just didn't care. There is another argument for the ""noncover- up"" viewpoint: the underlings in the military hierarchy (and all Blue Book officers were such - generally captains or majors, two of which finally made lieutenant colonel but never full colonel) looked mainly toward two things, promotion and early retirement. Therefore, in controversial issues it was always considered far wiser not to ""rock the boat,"" to please the superior officer rather than to make waves. Thus, when the superior officers, who did not know the facts but were wedded to a rigid framework of military thinking handed down from above, let it be known in any controversial issue (whether UFOs or not) what the ""right way"" of thinking is, no underling officer was going to oppose or even question it unless, of course he was 99 percent certain that he could prove himself correct in the controversy - and quickly.  Since the Pentagon had spoken in no uncertain terms about UFOs, no Blue Book officer in his right promotion-conscious military mind was going to buck that, even if he had private opinions on the matter.  Another factor added to the noncover-up theory. Turnover in the Blue Book office was rather high. Sooner or later the officer in charge would be out of it, just that much closer to promotion and retirement, if he just sat tight. >From 1952 to 1969 the office was headed in turn by Captain Ruppelt (who did not make his own views known until he was out of the air force), Captain Hardin (who had ambitions to be a stock broker), Captain Gregory (to whom promotion was the be-all and end-all of existence), Major Friend, and finally Major Quintanilla, who had the longest term of office. Of all the officers I served with in Blue Book, Colonel Friend earned my respect. Whatever private views he might have held he was a total and practical realist, and sitting where he could see the scoreboard, he recognized the limitations of his office but conducted himself with dignity and a total lack of the bombast that characterized several of the other Blue Book heads.  Thus one can have one's choice of whether Blue Book was a front or merely a foul-up. But that there was certainly foul-up and complete divorce from the scientific community within Blue Book was apparent. The members of the scientific fraternity were, of course, wedded to the misperception-delusion hypothesis (there was no need for interchange of ideas with Blue Book, which held the same views), and some members rose to heights of vitriolic verbiage in denouncing reporters of UFOs. This phase of the total phenomenon had many of the aspects of a modern witchhunt.  ** End excerpt **",,,

Cigar shaped craft shines spotlight for me to walk towards it,Billerica,MA,,cigar,20 minutes,"Occurred : 11/1/1965 19:00  (Entered as : Nov 1965 19:00) Reported: 12/7/2008 10:48:45 PM 22:48 Posted: 1/10/2009 Location: Billerica, MA Shape: Cigar Duration:20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67369.html,"Cigar shaped craft shines spotlight for me to walk towards it My experience happened in the fall of 1965 or the spring of 1966.  I believe it was the fall.  I know it was that time frame because I had just bought my first car a new 65’ VW.  There was no snow on the ground and it was not real cold, so I believe this was maybe November of 1965.  I know the dates are important to you but this is the closest I can come. I was living with my grandparents in Concord so that is where this story ends. It begins however on Rt 3 (the highway) in Billerica.  I was coming from Lowell and approaching the River Road exit.  I think that is what it is called, the jail is/was there.  Not sure if it still is.  It was 7 to 8 PM I would say and the traffic was not heavy, thank goodness because I would have caused an accident. To my right, hovering above the trees was an object, cigar shaped. It had 3 lights as I can remember, one blue, one red and I believe one white.  The light part is the vaguest of my memory, but there were lights on the bottom area. The object was dark, but there was enough light out to see the shape.  I watched it as I was approaching it and it did not appear to be moving so the closer I got the slower I went.  I almost stopped beside the spot but just drove slow.  I was very excited to see this. My father and I had a few discussions about UFO’s and he said if I ever saw one that I should mentally talk to them because they would be advanced and could be telepathic. So that is why I was excited!!!  I was 21 and eager to explore.  I asked them to pick me up and take me with them, mentally.  I kept watching to see if it would move as I passed it and as I took the exit I turned to watch but saw nothing.  I drove over the highway and took a right onto the River Road going towards Billerica and to my surprise on my right hovering over a house set way back off the road (now a church) was this object or craft. No traffic, so I pulled over fast.  As I opened my car door a spot light went on from this plane/craft hovering the house, it shown a path for me.  I started walking around the car towards it and saw another car coming down the road so I rushed back into my car and just sat there. The spot light from the plane/craft also went off. This happened 3 times, each time a car coming to interrupt me going towards the spotlight.  It was dark but I could see the space over the house between this plane/crat thing.  I sat in my car, not afraid at all and then the plane/craft just swioohed up and over me as though it were tired of waiting.  It was silent!!! Complete silence, jaw breaking silence. I opened my window and watched.  I heard nothing.  I also think I yelled ""wait""!!!  I was so excited I could hardly breath.  I took off in my car towards Billerica Center, took Rt. 3a South towards my parents house.  Driving down that road I look up to my right and there it was again following my path, or just ahead of me, so I went fast trying to chase it.  It disappeared though.  I began thinking maybe it was following the river for some reason.  This all started near the river. I don’t know why the water idea came to me but somehow I felt they liked water. I felt angry afterwards that I was so slow getting out and back in my car and caring if any other cars saw me, because they finally flew off.  I think though that I did not want to share my experience and I think I felt that other people being there would interrupt them taking me.  That is why I kept getting back into my car and pretending nothing was going on.  But the plane/craft did the same thing with the spotlight. After visiting with my parents and telling them the story I had wanted to drive around with my father.  I believe we did drive around, but also went to visit my brother on the other side of the town.  I was so distracted though, just looking up unable to pay attention to anything else.  We had a nice visit, which is important in my story. Later about 11 PM I arrived at my grandparents house in Concord, went upstairs and got into bed.  As I lay there I heard a plane.  Not uncommon for that area either because the Bedford Air Force base is close and they fly by. Not over, but close by.  But this plane I heard stopped right over the house and hovered, the house shook. The motor was very loud this time, it was not like a plane flying by, it stayed there. I knew it was them.  I spoke to it mentally and told it I had changed my mind.  I felt that if I went with them I would be lonely for my family which I had not considered earlier being young and impulsive.  I was also a little scared by then since it seemed to have FOUND me. Then it flew off. This was one of the first of many unusual   experiences I have had in my life.  I have had other encounters.

A short time passed, probably 20 or 30 seconds then all of a sudden this object came directly down towards us, silently and quickly. There were no lights on the exterior of this craft and the craft silently came to rest to what appeared to be about 500 or 600 feet above us and was not moving. The craft was close enough for us to see inside. Windows were visible and there appeared to be two or three long windows with a divider between the windows, a frame that I thought to be part of the outer skin of the aircraft. Inside one of the windows there appeared to be some kind of console. It appeared to be square and tall and the closest thing I can relate to it would be something the size of a file cabinet type shape. There were no beings seen inside these windows that we could see and the craft simply hovered above us silently for about another 20 seconds.  All of a sudden this craft lifted and continued on what appeared to be the same course it was traveling before descending. At the time of this sighting our father had a private pilots license and owned a plane in which we all flew on a regular basis. This is important as we would know what the elevation,(or come pretty close) of this craft. Also, our government had nothing, to our knowledge, that would maneuver like this did.

I am not one to claim UFO sightings at every turn.  My dad, brother and I did see a meteor fly over the west side of Los Angeles back in 1962 and thought that it landed in our neighborhood but in fact it landed in Canada, according to the news report.  I concluded that things in the sky are illusive, after seeing that. The sighting: In late August of 1967 I was enjoying the warm evening with my girlfriend under a blanket on the west facing Dockweiler State Beach at Playa del Rey in Los Angeles.  It was about 11:30 pm and the beach was closed to the public by this time.  The beach is directly under the take off path of the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) but this night the planes were diverted to take off to the east.  This is a practice reserved for windy conditions but there was no wind that night.  The number of flights at the airport was down to a minimum by late night back in those days. I had noticed a light due west from us at the horizon when we walked up to the area where we set the blanket on the sand.  I figured that it might be a usually seen tanker on the way to the docks in San Pedro.  We started smooching and an eerie feeling came over me, like someone was watching us but when I looked around I noticed the light on the horizon had begun to move closer to the shore at a swifter than natural speed.  It was at sea level, I figured, but some things were missing.  No reflective light and no sound.  This made me stop and pay attention.  As the object closed in toward the beach it’s size and altitude became more apparent.  I sat up when the light seamed to be about a mile off the shore and could clearly see that the object was actually about 2,000 feet in the air.  (I often frequented the Hawthorne airport and became accustomed to object altitude.)  I ‘guestimate’ that the size and shape was oval and the volume of a five-story building. The light emitted from the object was not painfully bright but it had a glow or halo around it as though I were looking through a frosted glass.  It came directly toward me and slowed to a halt at maybe 100 feet from the shore.  I slowly moved to the right over the coast line to about the area of Venice Beach (about 12 miles from our location.)  This took less than a minute and then it returned in a flash.  It hovered over the are where it began to browse for about two minutes. The object then rose straight up to about 4,000 feet and quick as a click it shot off toward the southeast.  I could not see it after it passed out of view beyond the sandy hill at Pacific Coast Hwy.  Perhaps it traveled as far as Disneyland in Anaheim.  I was not terrified but disturbed and uneasy about what I had seen. I was trying to convince myself what had just happened when as quietly and quickly as it left it had returned to the position where it began it browsing just off the beach.  It sat there for about 15 seconds and began making its way back to the horizon.  At some point near the horizon it began to ascend at break-neck speed.  In an instant it rose what appeared to be in an outward arch and disappeared into the night sky.  The entire episode lasted less than 5 minutes but left a lifetime of excitement. ((woman's name deleted)), my girlfriend, did not experience what I saw but was equally uneasy by what she did see.  I believe she saw the light as it left the area the final time.  She was lying down with her face up during the episode and for some reason I felt that I had to protect her from whatever I was looking at.   We left the beach, tout suite, and never spoke of the incident to each other for fear, maybe, that we would know for sure that something was there.  ((deleted))  We soon broke up (not related to that episode.) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",,33.9454,-118.4398

I just remember asking a man who was passing by, “Excuse me, what is that?” I recall him saying the strangest thing…something so strange that I repeated it over and over again until I could go home and ask a grown-up what it meant…he replied, “I don’t know! It looks like a U.F.O.”  He looked at it some more, then continued on his way. All the way home I kept repeating to my brother and myself, “UFO. UFO,” so I wouldn’t forget those letters.  I came home and asked my eldest brother what those letters meant. He explained, and then of course nobody believed us so we let it drop.

((witness recognizes grammatical error in telepathic message.  PD))  The three words were clear and precise but without sound. The powerful engine sounds did nothing to dampen the order.  My mind heard the words, not my ears. I backed off the accelerator and slowed slightly while the creature completed its brisk upright walk across the road from right to left (south to north) and up the cut bank on my left. At no time did the creature break stride or exhibit any difficulty managing the steep terrain, especially going up the man-made and much steeper cut.  It was as it stepped onto the pavement that it regarded my presence and sent its order not to hurt it. Had I so desired, I could have run it down.  I estimate my speed before slowing to be around 45 MPH but was not conscious of my speed at the time, nor did I look at the speedometer either during or after the event.  Higher speeds are dangerous at that spot in the road. What struck me was the creature appeared to me a bright blue—sky blue and intense. It was clothed in a neat double-breasted tight fitting or tailored suit with matching pants and a flat-brimmed hat. Exposed skin was exactly the same color as the clothing (sky blue). I could see no wrinkles or folds as the creature progressed across my path. The creature had almond-shaped eyes and a tiny mouth but otherwise was basically human size and human shaped. During my next trip through that stretch of road, two days later, I parked and examined the spot where the creature had emerged.  The terrain is steep with native trees and Chaparral, which makes a difficult hike for anyone, yet this creature had no difficulty climbing it. I also tried to climb up the 5-6 foot cut bank but could not scramble up without clawing and grabbing handholds and footholds, yet the creature easily strode up the angled hillside upright without straining. I felt no fear at the time and I wish I had taken the time to try to communicate with it but driving at that location takes concentration.

There must have been aproximately 6 orange lights in the top series and at least 10 orange lights in the bottom series. The lights either merged or one got behind the other and the lights began moving eastward and appeared to rise and disappeared in the eastern sky. I can best describe the orange lights as if one was observing a cruise ship out at sea and could just see the port holes on the side of the ship in the darkness. I noted in a web search that similar lights were observed - among other locations - in Rockford, Illinois - about 65 miles east of Apple River, Illinos.

The light did this movement for several minutes then began moving from side to side. There was no noise but we believe it was too far to hear.  At first we thought it to be a helicopter until it stopped, became brighter, appearing larger then split into two equal size lights approximately an inch apart from our viewpoint which would have made it several yard apart.

We decided to drive all night because we have a disabled son that has a late schedule. Twenty miles out from Spokane on HWY 90 east around 4:30am we encountered several sparklers like things hovering over our car just off the right side of the windshield. I noticed that they were pacing our car as we drove. I felt like I was being hypnotized by the sparklers like objects. I noticed my wife and son staring at it and not saying a word about what was happening. I thought this was some kind of warning and felt very scared that something was going to happen to us. I was afraid to stop so I lowered my speed and shielded my eyes so I could not see them. By doing so I felt like I was not being affected by the attempt by them to hypnotized me. I was scared at this point and yelled out to my wife, ""Is it trying to hypnotiz! ed you, is it a warning of some kind."" Cathy finally said something like ""I don't know what do they want?"" I kept looking down at the time and it didn't seem like it was changing even after a very long time and miles had past. I was thinking they wanted to hurt us or do something to the road ahead to hurt us. Each time I took my hand down from shielding my eyes I felt again they were trying to hypnotize me, like I was blacking out and not in control. I remember cars and trucks passing in the other direction and honking there horns at us as if they were seeing these things over our car. We begin praying and saying the lords prayer, it seem as if I could not think as if my mind went blank and I could not remember even what was happening to us and even what these things looked like. I had to put a memory into my head what they looked like or I think I wouldn't remember what they looked like. I remember saying to Cathy they look like giant sparklers at the same time she said it! . I thought they had gone away but they must have just moved a! way for a short time because I noticed they were back and I remember saying to Cathy no they are still here, don't look at them. She noticed my speed had dropped to 40 miles an hour in a 70 miles an hour zone and she told me to speed up or we were going to be hit from behind. Soon after that they left. I think that they tried to abduct us but were not able to because of the medication I take for depression.

The white ""object"" seemed to twinkle like a star but zooming in with a 20x camera I could see it had multiple parts so this was not a star. There was a large part with 2 smaller parts separated but close to it, these smaller parts seemed to move away from the large part, then return (I think that is the reason for the twinkle effect).  The orange looking ""array"" kept moving to the North but slowly, and always kept it's same configuration. These were visible from 4:30am to 5:15 am.  Video was taken at high zoom and some clear images were obtained for a few seconds. These objects seemed to be just moving North very slowly and made no sudden moves or speed changes.  I would estimate people from northern MD to NY could have seen this, but I have seen no reports on the news as of today (9/6/09). There were some clouds in the sky and a full moon was behind me as I traveled north.  I wish I had thought to get my camera out sooner as the orange object(s) were huge when first seen.  When I did manage to snap pics distance became a factor. I the orange array was the Goodyear Blimp, I'd say it was 2 miles in front of me when first seen, maybe 10 miles out when filmed. The white array, which I thought at first was Venus or a star, always ""seemed"" to be 20 miles or maybe thousands of miles away, and never seemed to get closer or farther away. With the naked eye, I would have to conclude the white thingy was a star, but after looking at the video I have to rule that out.

It was undergoing some changes in function. It was generating brownish-gray smoke back and forth among chambers/holes on its surface. The holes were about 12 inches in diameter each and formed a matrix (grid) pattern spaced 2 feet apart. In the first instance viewing the holes, there were about 25 holes (secont time: 20 holes, third time 9 holes). The craft was semi-egg-shaped, but perfectly oval, not irregular shaped not smallish on one end as with an actual egg). It was about 250 feet long and 150 feet in diameter, about the size of eight houses. It was at first about one-half mile high distant from me, and later moved on about a mile. It seemed very close and very plainly visible to me. It was travelling at the speed of about 20 mile per hour. The smoke was being transferred from each chamber hole to each other chamber hole (as if trying to hide the whole craft maybe, or to generate the propelling system function). A fine cloud or mist of semi-frozen gas, like frozen carbon monoxide or frozen oxygen, nitrogen, helium, amonia, hazy neon, or other gas covered most of the craft, but would be partly covering at an area of one percent of its total surface for one minute while the rest was covered. The uncovered surface measured about 50 feet in diameter on the first uncovering and 40 feet in diameter on the second uncovering. The third uncovering (each uncovering was actually a clearing and diminishing of the misty gas which hid that particular area)was much smaller around 15 feet in diameter. While the partly covered area was visible, I could clearly see the functionality of the craft and watch it while it underwent changes in the skin covering (part of the function of the propelling or the disguise, possibly both a propelling and a disguise). I was aware that I should stare and focus because I knew that it was an important event I was watching. If I had had a picture camera or video camera I would have had an opportunity to capture very intensly important images of the craft and its peculiarities. As I watched for about 4 minutes the craft moved over the intersection at Broad Rock Road and continued travelling but got very fast and left a white cirrus cloud as it went very quickly away. This was a very clear warm day, sunny, with some cirrus clouds around the area of the sky. The sky was blue. The temperature of the air was about 90 degrees fahrenheit. The object left a trail but not necessarily a trail that it had generated, but a cirrus cloud which might have existed with or without the craft. The clouds of smoke of which I have alluded to seemed to be generated for the purpose of causing the craft to be visible or invisible at will as if the craft could manifest itself at will. Or, possibly the craft was absorbing the earth-born water clouds for fuel of some other purpose. I include my personal opinions because I think that my observations are inter-related with the experience, but not in the sense that I creat! ed the e vent in my own mind.

I personally believe that ""whatever"" or ""whoever"" is controlling these ""objects"", ""lights"" I have seen most of these at night and two shiny objects in the day time, that glimmered for a few seconds and disappeared. That they can operate in relative anonymity because of the back drop of the mountains coupled with no population towards the west and into the rocky mountains until you reach the very western portion of WY and encounter sparse populations again. 	I have never written or reported what I am about to describe as my experiences, I have only talked about this with close friends or family members, some of them have seen what I have seen. I am compelled to write about these experiences, for some of them I have never heard or read about anywhere, but may have been reported to this site. In the mid 1970's, when I was around 13 yrs old, I was walking home from a friends house at night after sunset, getting dark. I was startled to see about a mile away a bright white light, that did not light up the surrounding area and had the luminosity of that of a star, rise and fall behind a hill in a circular motion, this happened in a couple of seconds. I was in shock when I got home and wondered about what I had seen for days (it was at this point I became open minded about reading of UFO sightings and all the strange stories that came with UFO sightings, abductions, contacts. etc...). When I was around 17, I was coming home from work, traveling in westerly direction towards home about a mile away (my home is at 6,200 ft, foothills, traveling up the switch backs for another ½  mile you can be at 12,000 ft ), it was getting dark, something was just not right for a few seconds in the sky when I noticed that a star was bigger than any star should be was in the sky, if it was not for its size I probably would not have noticed. This star slowly fell from the sky and into a canyon, the walls on the canyon were turning different colors red, green, blue as this light fell into the canyon. For weeks and months I scanned the skies to see if I could see anything similar I became aware of the stars, planets, planes and satellites and always kept glancing at the night sky to see anything out of the ordinary I seen none. In my late 30's I was at my parents home, in the living room watching TV, the TV was in the corner and next to the TV was a large picture window that faced in an easterly direction. I seen what appeared to be a shooting star that fell from a north to south direction. It streaked across the sky, burned out. But then reappeared and was bobbing up and down in the air and slowly stopped, it then moved slowly across the hills in a southerly direction and was turning different colors of red, green and blue, until it disappeared from sight about 15 to 20 seconds and about 100 to 200 feet above the ground. Also around this same time (months) I was walking my infant son back and forth in my trailer and when passing a small window I seen a bright white light (star) that was traveling horizontally in a westerly direction towards the mountains, before it reached the mountains it went out. The next day and this was in the middle of July the face of the mountain in a circular pattern looked like it was covered in light snow in the area of where I seen the light. My mother had seen this as she was washing dishes, we planned to go to the side of the mountain to see what this was, but it rained within a couple of hours and this light white snow looking stuff was gone, this was about 10 am in the morning. My wife, older son, brother in law and nephews all seen this and could only wonder what it was. Another strange deal is what I have thought to be satellites. In the early 90's I, my wife, nephew and cousin were lighting fire works I had a flashlight to see the fuses when they were lit. I noticed what appeared to be a satellite that was moving through the sky and told everyone look there is a satellite moving in the sky. My wife said where, I pointed with the flashlight ""on"", at the satellite. My wife seen it moving along with my nephew right as I pointed the light at it and we all seen it stop and remain motionless and became a fixture as part of the stars. Needless to say I have had the same experiences on a couple of other occasions with these so called satellites that stop in the sky once they are noticed (weird).

I told my partner to stop so we could observe this object.  He didn't want to, so I (as passanger) removed the car keys from ignition which made the car stop in a turn out with a clear view on both sides of the range.

Our Landcruiser had a spotlight on top of roof, so I signaled directly to this object ""SOS"" and this object would respond moving slowly up, down, sideways, diaganal, the return to it spot.  I repeated this signal many, many times and this large amber ball of light would respond the same way each time for about 15-30minutes.

A 2.5 foot diameter disc shaped ufo disguised as the full moon suddenly moves to within inches of my face.,Lompoc,CA,1976-07-01T20:00:00,circle,2 MINUTES,"Occurred : 7/1/1976 20:00  (Entered as : 07/01/1976 20:00) Reported: 1/10/2009 8:58:40 PM 20:58 Posted: 3/19/2009 Location: Lompoc, CA Shape: Circle Duration:2 MINUTES",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67960.html,"A 2.5 foot diameter disc shaped ufo disguised as the full moon suddenly moves to within inches of my face. When I was a young pre-teen, I lived on the edge of Vandenberg Village, adjacent to the Los Padres National Forest, a few miles from Vandenberg Air Force Base.  My house was in the last row of the development, and there were plans for extending the housing development to include hundreds of new homes in what was the wooded area over the fence of my back yard.  The construction companies had finished the main asphalt road, and the street lights had been installed and were operational.  Other than the road itself, there were only woods on all sides for miles. One clear summer night, I was watching bats catch moths underneath one of the new street lights.  The moths would be attracted to the lights, and the bats would be attracted to the moths.  My friends and I would pick up pebbles and throw them into the air, and watch as bats swooped down and approached them before breaking off the pursuit after realizing they weren't prey insects. I was kind of lost in the pleasure of just finding pebbles and throwing them up in the air to watch the bats chase.  There was a large full moon overhead.  That's what I was doing when I had a life-changing encounter with a small UFO. It was too small for a person to occupy, approximately 2.5 feet in diameter, and it moved so quickly that it could not be seen except when hovering motionless at different points. One moment it was in the night sky directly between me and the full moon, lit so that it was perfectly camouflaged against the moon behind it, perfectly still and silent. But as my binocular vision adjusted and it came into sharp focus, I felt a sudden shock as it appeared that the moon was very much closer than it was supposed to be. At the moment it registered in my mind as out of place, I became slightly disoriented and it instantaneously moved to within inches of my face. It was so close that I could see a mirror image of my own face displayed on its convex bottom surface. If I hadn't seen it so illuminated before, I would have guessed that its coating was a perfectly reflective polished metal. There was a soft humming electrical arcing sound coming from inside it, like statically charged particles being sucked through a very quiet vacuum hose into some other place entirely. It surprised me so completely that I was literally frozen in the deepest visceral fear that I've ever felt. It was as though I had been in the jungle blithely examining an innocuous plant, and out of nowhere a 9-foot-long man-eating tiger had pounced on me. The part of the brain that registers fear is the amygdala. When it is active there's normally an urge to fight or flee. In this case, it was so directly stimulated that I felt only a primal, overwhelming, paralyzing fear. I remember thinking, ""Oh my God! This is really happening to me."" The next thing I remember was ""waking up"" walking on my way home about 50 yards from where I was before. This level of propulsion and active material technology might be representative of advanced nanotech. While there is a slim possibility that some elite and secretive humans had that in the 1970's, it seems much more likely that it was of a non-human or post-human origin. Given the probable scenarios that are described by futurists such as the inventor Ray Kurzweil, it seems inevitable that we will eventually modify our own biology and become vastly different than the species we are now, with many orders of magnitude greater intelligence and computing power. When we reach that level of advancement, it is quite likely that we will no longer need the large, cumbersome, inefficient bodies that we have now. So different will be our physical structure that it's not unreasonable to predict that our minds and machines will be structured on a scale too small for modern humans to sense, even with our most sensitive instruments. This must be the case for the advanced civilizations that came before us. Just as we may find it desirable in the future to return the Earth to its pristine natural state, free from human structures and pollution, so too may those who came before us. We have no evidence of their existence precisely because they were so thorough at cleaning up the mess that they made on their way up the evolutionary and technological chain. They were simply very efficient at disposing of the evidence of their earlier civilizations. So that UFO I came into contact with must have been a machine of their design. Perhaps they monitor and manage us, in the same manner that we manage wildlife in nature preserves and zoos. Perhaps they prefer to remain undetected as they intervene in our affairs only in the most subtle ways, such as steering our ideas or dreams from within our brains. Perhaps we are their grand experiment, or maybe even their toys or their pets. Rather than communicate with us through left-brained verbal symbol sequences such as speech, they prefer to communicate in a much more efficient way, which is to choreograph our behavior, interactions and culture. Perhaps they are responsible for our more complex dreams. For example, my dreams often include higher beings that demonstrate nearly unfathomable powers within the simulated reality of the dream, and complete telepathy in terms of understanding my thoughts and intentions immediately as they occur or even slightly prior to my awareness of their occurrence. Perhaps we belong to them, and they own us, while most of us remain ignorant of that reality. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

On one of the recent shows they had a guest and were talking about unidentified flying craft using stealth or camouflaging technology to imitate star patterns and such. I think what I witnessed may be similar to this. I wish I could be more specific in the date but it was some time ago and only hearing the show caused this recollection.  It was during the summer months in central Connecticut between 1975 and 1978 as best as I can remember between 10:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. I was with a bunch of friends at local gathering place, away from city lights out in the country. We were just hanging out as we did on many summer nights. For some reason I looked up at the night sky at the stars, which were exceptionally bright, as there was no moon and no clouds. I was just gazing at the different constellations when I noticed something out of the ordinary. A sizeable section of the sky was blacked out. Then I realized this section of black out was moving if I remember right in an east to west direction. I don’t recall if there was a noticeable shape to it, but you could see the stars disappearing behind it the reappearing as it passed. This did not have a false star pattern as some that were mentioned on the show just darkness. The only reason I saw it was due to the motion. If it were sitting still you would not have seen anything. I’m not sure of the altitude with nothing to reference it to, but my gut feeling is that it was quite high not quite Airliner high but much higher than small Airplanes fly. It did not do any sudden or erratic moves just cruised across the sky. With out being sure of the altitude it would be hard to say how fast. Again my gut feeling was that this thing was big  if it was as high as an Airliner it was really big and moving faster than an Airliner. And I did not hear any noise no jet sounds, no helicopter sounds, or visible contrail. I am very familiar with what Airplanes, Helicopters and Blimps look like and sound like this was not any of those things. I do not know what it was. I don’t know if this information is helpful or not, maybe it will correlate with something else that happened during that time. All I know is what I saw or didn’t see in this case.

We often camped in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, usually hitch hiking from Boston and back again. After camping over the weekend we started out heading for home it was late in the day/early evening so we decided we would hang out one more night. Not wanting to set up a tent or light a fire, we decided to crawl into our down sleeping bags to keep warm and just go to sleep. We used the porch of the old ranger’s station in Franconia Notch at the base of where “The Old Man of The Mountain” used to be. (Above profile lake)  There was already snow in the mountains and the wind was whipping and freezing so we turned the log benches on their sides and slept behind them. We got up real early because the moon was just coming up and reflecting off the lake (approximately 3:00 AM), It was so beautiful out so we walked around a bit on the side of the highway (next to the lake) so we could get a clear view of the sky. The sky was so clear you could almost reach out and touch the stars. We always liked to look for and track satellites across the sky (which was easy to do in the mountains away from the city lights) especially this morning since the sky was so clear. Spotting a couple of satellites over a period of a half hour we started to walk back to the rangers cabin, “lets see if we can spot one more” before loosing the view under the cabins porch roof. Looking up we both spotted a satellite, I remember saying; “Cool, huh”? Then it just stopped and we said at the same time: “where did it go”?  In one split second four additional (whatever’s’?) shot out across the sky in four opposite directions from where we were looking. These four objects traveled across the sky in four directions beyond and out of our site, then just as fast they all came back to the same spot where we last saw the satellite stop. It then continued across the sky as any normal satellite would. In my opinion unless we have the technology to create a spacecraft that can travel at the speeds we witnessed that morning, (Satellite speed) then shoot out four additional objects at approximately six to ten times faster than the original track of what we thought was a satellite and at the distances all four objects traveled and back again is beyond our comprehension. It almost seemed like it was creating a grid and mapping the area. Like taking a picture of the mountains or something?  Who knows how many stops it was making and how many times it was projecting out these four objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The object was closer than an airplane height and was moving at a fast speed. It was heading in a straight line and just disappeared. There were no clouds in the sky. I think that it was moving so fast that my eyes could not keep up with it. I have never seen something just disappear.  My son was in the vehicle with me and he witnessed the same thing. I have oftened looked into the night sky hoping to see a UFO. I was not prepared at all this morning for what I saw.

As funny as it may seem and to the best of my memory it was during band camp.  As the band was standing in form at attention, something caught my peripheral vision above my head. I lifted my head and very distant in the sky I saw a series of stars. At the time I was taking a physics class and I knew which were stars and what was not. Any way I saw a swirling blue and yellow light between 2 stars in the sky. I was able to study the movement because the marching band was receiving a lecture and we were not permitted to move. I gazed at the blue-yellow light and recognized the pattern, it had seemed to be forming the same shapes as the marching band below it. At that time I grabbed the closest person and pointed in the direction of the light. Without describing what I saw, I had asked them if they see anything. The person had responded, ""Is that star moving?"" another person noticed and looked up as well. I was able to get the whole band to look without saying a word and they all saw what I saw. The band is multi-racial, and they all noticed. Apparently it spooked the directors, because I heard the tremble in their voices. Of course some of them were in denial and said it was a satellite, but those move in straight lines, and there much more distant and dim. Others said it might have been an airplane, as they said that, an airplane flew under it. I said, ""No, my friend, that right there is an airplane, whatever that is, is not""  The light that I have described from where I was standing appeared to be 2 centimeters in diameter. It was much brighter and closer than any star in the sky that night. It was close enough to see that it was moving. It didn't leave until the band practice was over. It appeared as though it was seeking entertainment from the marching band. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The incident actually occurred over a year ago but the memory of what happened has remained in my mind as if it took place yesterday. I was driving to pick up my children at their day care providers home after getting out of a late night class at OU-Chillicothe.  It was around 9:30 p.m. September 13-19, 2007, (unfortunately, I’m not quite sure of the actual day anymore.)  I was on County Road 550, after going through Pleasant Valley.    Shortly after going past a school, the area opens up to a large corn field on the left.  It was at this area that I first noticed muted “lights” at the very top of my driver side door window. The day care provider lives in the country, and at that time of year, it was completely dark-- so I am unable to determine the shape of the “craft”.  However, these lights were amber in color and were clustered in, what seemed to me, two different V-shaped formations; one set of three lights were slightly lower than the other set and angled somewhat differently.  It’s rather difficult to express in writing the pattern in which I saw the lights but after watching it for about 10 seconds, the lights started, to the best of my guess, splitting off and the two sets of lights became three.  I don’t recall any movement other than the lights transforming, (in other words, I don’t believe the craft(s) was traveling as much as it/they was just hovering and changing shape.)  I eventually lost sight of the lights in the trees as I went around a curve.  I actually slowed the car down and contemplated pulling over into the drive way of a little camp ground but thought better of it.  The whole thing, while it seemed to carry on longer, really only lasted about 30 seconds. Now, I’m not going to assume that I know what these lights are but I will state this… my mental health is sound and what I witnessed was NOTHING I have ever seen before.  No one will convince me that this was an air plane, (there were no blinking lights as you would see on a plane and while it appeared to be flying low to the ground, there was no noise.  Additionally, at this altitude, had it been a plane it would have flown over the car and out of sight quickly.)   Furthermore, I don’t believe it to be any sort of “government experiment” as I’ve actually seen similar lights, in the same formation, on an amateur video taken outside of the U.S. I realize that this has been some time ago, but I think about it almost daily.  (The experience was just too commanding not to.)   I know that there are real risks to admitting seeing something like this, (most people would call me “crazy” if they knew,) but it is my hope that someone else may be able to write a comment if they saw the same thing that night in the same area.  I know that there were other witnesses-- I recall looking into the rear view mirror at one point to see a motorcycle directly behind me and another car or truck behind the motorcycle.  I contemplated calling the city police or local radio but was concerned that they would not take me seriously, (and living in a small town, everyone knows everyone else, I just couldn’t take the risk.… my father is a doctor in the area… I plan to open my own business here shortly… etc., etc., etc.)  Anyway, any information or witnesses would be greatly appreciated.

He no sooner left than I spotted this perfectly spherical (with just a hint of wings, like the rings of Saturn) object.  It was fuzzy looking like a tennis ball, medium dark grey in color.  There were no lights of any kind, and no noise at all.  It came from the West, just passing over the Oquirrh Mountains, and headed straight east over the Wasatch Mountains. It travelled the 25-35 miles from the tops of one mountain range to the other in about 30 seconds, in a perfectly straight line, like it was on rails.  It was about 1000 feet in the air by my best estimate.  At that altitude it would probably be 50 to a hundred feet across. There were no contrails.  There was no wind and it did not behave like a balloon.  The air was calm and warm, no storms around.  It travelled at the same constant, fast speed.  30 miles in 30 seconds is a mile a second or 600 miles per hour.  I watched it until it started to disappear behind trees, then I ran to the street out front and continued to watch it disappear over the Wasatch Mountains.  I called the local newspaper the next day to see if anyone else had reported this UFO.  No one had.  The significant thing was that it crossed perpendicular to the airlines landing pattern, which was very near to my location, and at the same general altitude, making it very dangerous to air traffic. To me that indicates something very strange.  I am a retired Marine Corps Officer, 69 years old, physically fit and have 20/20 and 20/10 eyesight, and a Masters of Business degree.

It occurred while my friend and I were traveling from our school in North Dakota to California where he was to be married.  To the best of our recollection, on or about June 20th, 1970, we were passing through Wyomming driving through to Colorado late at night in his Volkswaggen Beetle.  To the best of our estimates, we were proceding south on I-87 about 100 miles north of Cheyenne.  It was very dark and there was little or not traffic on the road and no houses, buildings etc as we drove, very desolate. It was my shift driving and I noticed a lighted craft immediately in front keeping pace with the car and passing from my right to the left.  It caught my attention because it appeared to be traveling with the car.  Approximately 10 minutes after that I again noticed what appeared to be a similar lighted craft again passing from left to right the same distance from the car at the same hightg and again appearing to keep pace with the car.  My friend was sleeping at this time and I did not wake him until about 10 minutes later when I again saw what appeared to be the identical lighted craft in the same position. I told my friend what I had been observing and that I thought that this craft appeared to be following the car.  We decided to stop the car and got out to better observe.  The craft then passed directly above us and hovered maybe 500 feet above us.  We heard no noise whatsoever. It was a very clear night with no clouds etc.  As we watched the craft turned out its lights and we then became quite scared feeling that it was watching us and might mean us some harm.  We jumped into the car and started down the road and at that point the entire car lit up.  That was the end of the event as we remember it and did not see the craft again. I have thought about this incident many times and after hearing of similar stories have wondered if there was any connection to some unusual objects that have worked there was from my body including a ¼ inch piece of crystal that came out of my right index finger many years ago.  About three years later an identical piece of crystal came out of my gum. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I don’t remember the exact date, however I do remember the details. It was fall in small town Iowa, Onawa. My best friend’s mother sent us to get cigarettes for her (if that doesn’t tell you how long ago nothing will). The railroad tracks ran through their back yard. On the other side of the tracks was a large grassy area owned by the railroad. My best friend, her younger brother and I were just crossing this empty area headed for downtown Onawa when we saw a slow moving object in the sky. I was between 8-10 years old as was my best friend, and very smart—later I found I have a genius IQ. I stood staring at the object and knew immediately that it wasn’t an airplane. My father was a jet mechanic for the Air Force during Korea and then the Air National Guard and had taken me to many air shows. Before and after seeing the object I have never seen an aircraft with square red lights, and believe me, I have looked. The object was saucer shaped, moving not far above the town. It had square red lights that lit sequentially from right to left with a gap that made it seem like the lights were running around the object. There was no sound as it moved along, moving south to north. As we watched a building blocked our view. We ran to see if we could catch a further glimpse of it, but it had vanished. My friend’s younger brother told me later that he had seen the same object one night hovering above the grain elevators two blocks from his house. He saw a beam of light coming from the object trained on the elevator for a few moments, then it took off. Because we were children no one believed us, but I went home and drew a picture of it so I could remember it and look for a logical explaination as I got older. So far I have found no aircraft with square red lights on it, but I'm still looking. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This sighting happened in the summer of 1974 a few miles south of Minot ND.  I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  It was a very clear night and I walked down the driveway from the house  so I could get a full view of the night sky. When I came to the end of the driveway I noticed a white translucent arch over the dirt road  that ran in front of the house north and south.  I was puzzled by this and wondered if it was some kind of fog.  I walked  about 30 feet down the road to get a better look.  I could see that the arch went from one side of the road to the other side right down to the ditch.  I walked under it and looked up and could faintly see the stars through the arch while looking strait up into the sky.  I then would walk about three feet from under it and the stars where all bright and all the sky clear.  It reminded me of the milky way.  I moved under it then  next to it a couple more times  then excited I ran to the house to get someone else to come see this. It was about 10 pm as my parents where watching the news so I went to my brothers room who is 15 years old.  He thought I was crazy but I persuaded him to come out and look about 10 minutes later as he was in bed  watching TV and had to dress.  When we got to the area where I had seen the arch it was gone.  Down the road north about 60 Ft., we both witnessed a cloud above the road about 20 feet in diameter.  We started to follow it as it was moving away from us.  It was no longer a translucent white. It would turn red to blue, green and had like sparkling little lights shimmering in it. We both started to follow it till the road ended 200 ft. then it veered to the NW and we crossed over the barbwire fence climbing over a couple hills to follow it.  We stayed down when we came to the top of a hill as it almost seamed to be trying to lose us.  It stopped over the top of a large watering hole about 30 feet..  We could not follow it anymore but as we watched it for about one minute it was still changing colors and sparkling.  It then started to fade quickly.  We walked home amazed as we lived in the country, hunt, hike at night to a neighbors.  We never seen anything like it.  To this day we recalled this sighting and both seen this.  We had seen the same thing other than him not seeing the arch. I was not a drug user or drinker.  I am now 48 years old and still can picture this dense cloud type object that changed colors along with the arch over the road. We have never seen anything like this again, nor have met anyone else that seen anything like this before.  We figured it could have been something from the Minot Air Base.  We have seen fog over water and such.  The arch did not loose its shape fade.  I was thinking of walking down into the ditch to one side of the arch touching to the ground to see if I could walk through it or put my hand in it.  I decided that may be dangerous so ran back to get a witness. I would like to be contacted about sightings in the Fargo area.  When I googled to see if anyone else seen thease sightings your sight popped up with reports on the same date and same thing that still hangs around at times.  I would like to know how to report the observation properly or hear a explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.

I noticed there was a car in front of me and behind me.  We all slowed down as we approached the light.  It appeared to be a circular cluster of lights (similar to a hosptial operating room light) that was as wide as the two-lane road.  All three of our cars slowed to almost a stop as we drove under the light.  I estimate that the light was probably 100' from the ground perhaps.  I rolled my window down thinking that perhaps it was a helicopter but there was no sound except for the cars.  I continued under it and turned right on St. Rt. 140.  I became quite a bit frightened as I drove down 140 because I began to think that it wasn't something normal, that perhaps it was a UFO?

He noticed other people looking up in the sky so it caught his attention.  The object was in the south eastern sky. It was not a plane or helicopter. The people I talked to who saw the object all agreed to that.  It was red in color and appeared to be bright, almost glowing on and off. It looked like it was fairly far up in the sky because a visible star or planet was just to the north of the object, so I kind of used that as a reference.  Another friend of mine who has his own local cable TV show was at my stand and he had his video camera with him because he tapes all of the street fairs in the area and shows the footage on his show.  He filmed about 30-60 seconds of the object and he zoomed in and out on the object and after watching the video replay on his camera, when he zoomed in on the object, it appeared to be white in color.  He has promised to give me a DVD copy of the footage which I will gladly mail you if you’d like. I should be getting the DVD over the weekend. Please let me know if you would like a mailed copy.  Maybe it was a weather balloon or flare or prank by someone but I’ve been an advent sky watcher for UFO’s and this is the first time I can actually say that I saw a UFO. I’m not saying that it was a space ship, but no way was it a plane. The object eventually seemed to fade away and get smaller and then a cloud moved in front of it and it was gone.  The reason why I say it could have been a flare is because about six months ago, reports were all over the Star Ledger (Major New jersey newspaper) about red lights in the Morris County sky (I live in Morris County) and the sightings occurred on multiple nights and were compared to flares. If you Google “red lights over Morris County NJ”, you may see the articles.  I am a grown man and would never waste my time with a bull shit story and as previously mentioned, I’ve always been fascinated with UFO’s ever since I bought a book in the 1970’s titled “Is something up there”  I would very much like to hear what you have to say about my sighting.  Right after the event, I called a New York radio station to see if they had any reports of flying saucers in the area and they said no.  Since the object was over the south east sky, it probably could be seen over New York City.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,40.8783,-74.0813

Notes and graphic representation by Mark XXXXXXX  Observed by Mark XXXXXXX and Sam XXXXXXX, as we were standing outside on the third floor balconies of our adjacent apartments.  Later confirmed by Terri XXXXXXX and Terry XXXXXXX after they had walked home up the adjacent street to our apartment. Location: 36000 Jefferson, Harrison Township, MI   Weather conditions: Mostly clear sky with very lightly scattered clouds, not yet completely dark, full moon, about a 5 mph breeze, temperature about 65 F. Flight path: Based on the Google Earth grid line overlay, the object most like ly was moving in a East – Northeast direction. Approximate sighting start and end points are N42.5565/W82.840 and N42.5560/W82.8510, respectively. Observation point was N42.5610/W82.8470. The objects height was about 1500 ft., plus or minus 500 ft.  See the Google map below. The object first appeared low on the horizon, over Lake St. Clair, coming towards me. It appeared to be a helicopter based on its speed and height. I could not see an aircraft, only a bright light which attracted my attention. The light emitted from the object was not bright enough to be a search light, such as those frequently seen in this area due the boaters on the lake and the nearby international border. Yet, the light was much brighter than an aircraft’s navigation lights, and not red or green, but orange-white, similar to a flare. See graphic representation no. 1. As the object became closer, I expected to hear the sound of an aircraft, but there was none. The light became more orange, larger, and less bright. Sam, standing about 20 ft apart from me on his balcony said this was the second such object he had seen this night, the first going in the same direction, but much higher. I stepped just inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars that I use daily to observe happenings on the lake. Looking through these at the object, I could see the center of the object was bright orange, surrounded by a dark ring, which in turn was surrounded by a dimmer orange haze. These binoculars were in good condition and fairly clean, they never before produced a haze around a light source. The binoculars may not have been properly focused, which could have made the object appear to have a haze around it, but that would not explain the clearly defined dark ring around the bright center of the object. See graphic representation no. 2. I watched this object with these binoculars as it moved over us for about 30 seconds. It began to slowly fade out. The object did not appear to ascend, nor change size. The objects speed did not change. The object did not approach any cloud, as I checked for this condition as I was losing sight of it. It just grew dimmer until it could not be seen, first by Sam, who didn’t have binoculars, then about 10 seconds later, by me. The total observation time was about 90 seconds",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

There was no wind. The stars were out and what I saw was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life.  It was round, but had a magnificent display of lights that seems to rotate around the circumference of the disk like object.  There appeared to be a dark hole in the center and the disk was probably only about 300 ft. in diameter.   I thought I saw windows at the top, as it made its way around the old cotton mill.  That part of the building was only about 25 ft. high.  But, the UFO was near the top of the building's outer edge.  I was looking at it from an angle.  I was standing on a walk way that led to the street that was between me and a parking lot.  The UFO passed over the street lights of the parking lot very slowly.

I ran after the orange glowing object for about one city block, as it would pass behind trees and houses.  Eventually it passed out of sight. After I had returned to my house and sat back down for about five to seven minutes, I saw a second, identical object moving along the same course.  I ran after this one as well, anticipating its course to get a better view.  As it moved into view I thought that it looked almost like it could have been a balloon that was somehow on fire. When I reached the top of the hill, the highest elevation in town, my view could only be obstructed by trees and the nearby church steeple.  Two local acquaintances happened to be passing by on the sidewalk.  I told them to look at the object.  They could not identify it.  The three of us watched the object as it flew away toward the west.  Eventually, without altering course, the light of the object vanished and we could see nothing but stars in the western sky. The weather was calm.  There was absolutely no wind.  The sky was completely clear.  The moon was low in the eastern sky.

It moved through the sky in a pretty straight path though it did deviate from it's path slight at times. Twice, it quickly skipped forward at 45 degree angles. I will say that I saw the light three separate times so I have no way of knowing if it was the same light three times or individual lights. There were a two separate airplanes in the sky during my sighting which gave a good point of reference. The planes had flashing lights and were much closer as the lights were much larger than the tiny points of moving lights that I saw. While the planes were clearly much closer, the light moved across the sky several times faster than the planes. The first time I saw the light it was flying to the North through the sky and as it flew over my house, it slowed gradually as the light grew smaller until I could no longer see it. It gave the impression that it quickly angled upwards to an altitude at which the light could no longer be seen but I can't be sure. I stayed, watching the sky, and 10 minutes later it reappeared in much the same way that it had disappeared, horizontally, further to the right going the opposite direction it had been going initially. It traveled across the sky going to the South in the same way as before and disappeared again exactly as it had the first time. 5 minutes later, it reappeared the same way a third time further to the North, having changed directions to the North yet again. It traveled and disappeared in the same way again. I waited for 10 more minutes to see if it would return and I did not see it again. Each of the three sightings lasted approximately 15-25 seconds.

From the late summer of 1977 to the early spring of 1978 I was stationed at Kessler AFB in Biloxi, Mississippi. The sighting occurred one evening at approximately 9:00 PM during that interval; the exact date or time was not recorded. My wife and I had an off-base apartment just off the beach on highway 90 which runs through Biloxi. We had been for a walk on the beach and were returning to our apartment, looking up at the night sky. Simultaneously we both saw a black, triangular object go across the sky from south to north. The flight path was from the Mississippi Sound and over the western side of Kessler AFB, which was approximately 1/2 mile from our apartment. The object had no lights and made no sound. The object appeared to be black, and it was mainly seen because it blocked out the stars as it flew overhead. The object appeared to be flying at an altitude of between 500 and a thousand feet, with an airspeed of 100 to 150 mph. It was shaped like a equilateral triangle with sides of approximately 100 feet. However, since the object made no sound, and it flew directly overhead without any distant landmarks to compare for size, it is difficult to estimate the size, speed or altitude of the object with any certainty. I could have been an even larger object, at a much higher altitude flying at a very fast airspeed. The size, speed and altitude are simply my best guess based on my recollection of an event that occurred over 30 years ago. The strangest aspect of the sighting was the absolute silence of the object. It made no sound whatsoever. It was also strange that it was running without lights, and the shape was like no aircraft that I know of from that era. It could have been a test version of the B2 stealth bomber, but that doesn't explain the silence. There was no engine noise that either my wife or I could hear.

I have reported this incident to Dr Haines and Dr. Friedman, no one else. I was flying an Aero Commander 680, on a the last leg of the day on a freight run from Klamath Falls, OR to Medford, OR at about 4am.  I had climbed to an altitude of 15,000 feet on this night in order to top icing conditions resulting from a fast moving cold front that was at that time about half way between the two cities.  I had a passenger with me sitting in the copilots seat. About 15 miles from the Medford VOR, I broke out the side of clouds into a perfectly clear rain washed sky, with full moon setting on the horizon ahead.  This of course, left me very high for landing at Medford...so I canceled my IFR flight plan and headed directly to the airport, arriving there at an altitude above 8,000 feet where I began circling to descend for the traffic pattern. As I was passing about 7,000 feet, I was circling to the left over the airport on a southeasterly heading when I noticed what looked to me like the landing light of a relatively slow moving aircraft flying in the opposite direction.  I called the tower and asked if they had other traffic in the area, they said they did not, I was not too surprised to hear that in as much as we were both above the towers airspace so contact was not required.  As we passed abeam each other at about the same altitude and within about one mile, the craft silhouetted against the full moon on the western horizon, when I could see that the craft had no tail and a light on the back as bright as the one on the front that I originally thought was a landing light.  Thinking this was unusual, I turned toward the craft, to the right.  As I turned the craft, also turned to the right and accelerated.  When I started the turn, I was southeast bound, as I turned steeper and steeper to keep the craft in sight, it continued to accelerate in a turning arc about 2 miles out side my turn until I lost sight of it over the top of the aircraft, then in about a 60 degree banked turn then headed to the northeast.  I continued the turn all the way around to a northwesterly heading when I rolled out, not having caught sight of the craft again in the turn. Shortly after rolling out of the turn heading to the northwest....two flying disc pulled up on my left wing, no more than ten feet off my wing tip and perhaps 5 feet higher, where we flew together in formation for perhaps 15 to 20 seconds.  The furthest one was lit slightly ahead of the nearest one which was not lit.  The lights of the city were shining up from the ground in the rain washed air.  I could not see much detail on the lighted craft due to the bright lights on the front and back, but I could see good detail on the nearer one, both craft appeared to be the same.  They were disc shaped, white or light gray in color and I could see what looked like scotch marks on the bottom. The were about the same diameter as the wing span of the Aero Commander or about 55 to 60 feet across.  I could not see any openings of any kind in either of the craft and could not hear any sounds from the craft over the sound of the planes engines. At the time I was flying at about 160 knots, after the 15 or 20 seconds of formation flying the two craft accelerated to about 190 knots and pulled out in front of us about 2 miles when they instantaneously accelerated to a streak of light heading into space.  I looked over to my passenger, who was a little white in color....I'm not sure if he was sick from the high G turn or stunned at what we has just witnessed.  After we landed it took a couple of minutes to get him out of the plane.  I saw him about 5 years later, he still did not wish to talk about it.  As this was occurring I was telling the tower these events as they happened, who never did see the craft....I can not understand why.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,42.315149480968856,-122.84606678200691

I and another soldier were on guard duty at an ammo dump. I was walking ten paces ahead of him (according the rules of patrolling) on the left side of the raised dump mound, as we both became aware of a light flashing in the sky.  It was lighting up the whole area, and seemed to be happening in regular intervals, about 15 seconds apart.  After a few flashes, although I couldn't tell of its origin, I could somehow sense the direction from which it came.  I sped up my pace to get to the far end of the mound, so I could better see where it was coming from.  When I got to the end of the  mound, I looked up at the sky in that direction.  It was a beautiful clear night, you could see forever, but one star seemed to stand out.  It seemed to have a bit of a green tint to it, otherwise it looked like all the other stars.  Then it flashed. I can only describe it as looking like a giant flash cube.  It lit up the whole area. Then it turned red and streaked across the sky, within a second it was out of sight. I freaked out, not being able to believe what I had just witnesed.  The soldier who was behind me didn't see it take off but he saw my reaction to it.  By that time ""to hell with the rules"" we were walking side by side like a couple of scared little kids, as I was telling him what I saw in every detail, when the area lit up again.  We stood there breathless, crouched down watching this thing do just as it had done before.  It lit up the entire area about 5 or 6 times in about 15 second intervals, turned red and streaked back across the sky, gone in a second. Another soldier who was in the guard shack saw the flashing but didn't see where it came from. We did report the incident, but it wasn't taken seriously, we were laughed at. The 1st duty station I was assigned to after training happened to be on a missile range. I was privy to see at that time what was the fastest flying missiles in the US Arsenal.

Date and time of event: 10/08/08 19:45. Location: Hannover PA along Rt.116 (York St.) I witnessed while traveling south toward Hanover, PA on Rt. 116 near Spring Ave. two craft about ¾ the length of a 747 wingspan flying low and at a low speed NE toward York, PA. These two craft in identical shape, but different light patterns flew at a rate of about 60 mph. Their shape was long but I could not tell if it was long and cylindrical, or long and flat. I do know however that they did NOT have a fuselage or tail section as there was no strobes or lights to indicate such, and were low enough (about 1,500 ft.) that I could tell they were not of any known recognizable aircraft. The lights are what first caught my attention. The first craft had bright lights like a jet would like landing lights. There was also a bright flash like a strobe that would come from the bottom center, but it was an inconsistent flash, and not the typical consistent strobe like you would see on a normal aircraft. Both aircraft had four dimmer white lights evenly spaced located in the front of the craft. The second craft followed behind the first at a 45 degree angle and moved from the left to the right side behind the lead craft as they flew overhead. From what I could tell they were spaced about 200ft apart. The second craft did not have the bright landing lights like the first had, nor did it have the bright strobe underneath but again they both were the same shape. The weather last night was a light drizzle. These craft emerged from the clouds and flew just below the ceiling until they flew past beyond my line of sight. I would not usually report something like this, but what disturbs me is what I found out today. As I drove in to my college classes this morning I heard on the news that a 6lb. chunk of ice had fallen through an elderly woman’s home injuring her. This occurred in York, PA about 25 minutes from Hanover where I saw the craft. The ice had fallen yesterday morning at 5:30am, and I saw the craft in Hanover at 7:45pm. You can find the Ice story on the York Dispatch website: http://yorkdispatch.inyork.com/yd/search/ci_10677963?IADID=Search-yorkdispatch.inyork.com-yorkdispatch.inyork.com  The ice is currently being examined at York College to see what contents the ice has. As I am a student here I am going in tomorrow to see if I can find out what they have found and get their opinion. It’s a piece of evidence that could possibly be linked to what I saw. I’d hate to see the government get a hold of this and have the Ice findings disappear.  Does anyone have any ideas as to what this could be and have there been any reports to you guys concerning this issue?",2008-10-31T00:00:00,39.79686141732284,-76.99284251968503

I know someone in one of the other three cars driving behind me on that deserted highway that October or November night between 10 and 11 p.m. in either 1980 or 1981 would remember me getting out of my 1969 yellow Toyota Corolla and pointing up to the spacecrafts, if they were one of the people in one of the other cars that were driving behind me. I am 6'5"" and at that time I weighed about 185 pounds, with 70s-style brown hair so I know I must have looked really skinny then. I was heading south on Highway 288, I believe, but as I said, I was lost so it could have been on another south bound deserted stretch of freeway on my way to where I lived in Lake Jackson, Texas. There were three other cars driving behind me when I came upon the sighting and this is what I saw:  I saw hundreds of sphere or saucer-shaped spacecraft soundlessly landing and taking off in the vacant field or pasture along the freeway. There could easily have been 1,000 of these flying saucers. They had lights in the middle bottom part of them and this ""light"" is what seemed to propel the crafts. They landed three-at-a-time and the moment they landed, three others would launch. They seemed to hover momentarily, then in a beam of light, they would be gone, straight up and out of sight. With the other cars traveling behind me, I knew that I was not the only one who had witnessed this hard to believe sight so I pulled to the shoulder of the highway, exited my car and began walking toward the oncoming cars. I waved and pointed upwards in hopes that someone might have a camera to document the incident. It surprised me when the driver of the first vehicle accelerated and kept going. Soon the second and third vehicle basically did the same thing, leaving me there alone. At that point, one of the smaller saucer-shaped spacecrafts traveled directly toward me, stopping almost overhead, hovering without sound above me. If I could have picked up a rock and thrown it, I know that I could have hit it but it never crossed my mind at the time. There was a noticeably lit dome on the top of the craft which was opaque so I couldn't see into it. I had the distinct feeling that I was being confronted and fear overcame me. I ran to my car, jumped into the driver's seat and with seconds feeling like an eternity, I turned the key. The engine strained and I thought I was doomed but soon, miraculously my car started. I threw the car into gear, floored it and never looked back, however, it seemed to me that I drove away in extra slow motion as the car strained but seemed to continuously pick up speed. It was still dark when I sped away however, looking back on it all now, it seems that I somehow lost several hours. I remember arriving home around daylight the next morning and my wife accused me of being out all night, drinking with the guys. I remember that she had said I was ""a day late,"" but at that time I just shrugged it off and was just so relieved to be home. In 2005 I was diagnosed with an AVM in the left lobe of my brain. I have never considered that I could have been ""abducted"" that night, but I know without a shadow of a doubt that I actually saw what I saw. I am positive the other people in the cars behind me saw the incident as well, however they did not stop as I had expected they would. It upset me that nobody stopped to talk about it with me, but now I realize that they were probably just extremely scared, exactly as I was the moment I realized I was alone. I haven't talked about this incident to too many people. I probably wouldn't believe the story, myself, had I not experienced it first hand. I have often thought about that incident and have wondered who the people in those other three cars could have been so I Googled `UFO sighting in Texas City/Galveston in October/November, 1981. Anyone remember this?' and I saw the story of the guy who said he could see in his peripheral vision that the other driver was pointing upwards. The question I have for that reportee, is, ""Was this other driver a tall, skinny guy standing outside of a yellow 1969 Toyota Corolla?"" If the answer is yes, then my question is, `Hey buddy, why didn't you stop? Do you know I could have been killed, or worse yet, abducted?'  The people in those three cars probably thought I was crazy, but I honestly thought they'd stop, otherwise I would have probably never gotten out of my car. If I would have known they were going to leave me standing there, I would have stayed in the car, too, then floored it and left, but being the social type . . .. I have to say that as I stood on that dark, deserted freeway late that night, that was one time that I wished I hadn't been as tall as I am. My current wife said that in about 1973 or 1974, after a Friday night visit in the wee hours of the next morning, she and her family were walking some (visiting Channelview, Texas) neighbors out to their car in Sheldon Woods, north east of Houston, Texas. She said that as a group, four grown adults, a 13-year-old boy (my wife's brother) a 12-year-old girl (my wife) and a 9-year-old girl (my wife's little sister) witnessed, slowly traveling north over the housetops of the houses in that neighborhood, a huge, though silent, 400 to 500 feet-long rectangle-shaped spacecraft with lights all over it that seemed to be actively surveying the quiet neighborhood. Although as a group, they all just stood and stared up at the hard to describe spacecraft, my wife, her little sister and her parents remember the incident but her brother and the other two adults profess that they don't remember the incident. In fact, they never discussed it until recently. My wife joked that her big brother and the two visiting adults must have been abducted therefore they probably don't remember. She is kidding, of course, but entertaining the thought that I could have been abducted that night in October or November of 1981 (and it could have been 1980) is actually not an entertaining thought. I'd be interested in reading what others may have to say about what the chances are that I could have actually been ""abducted,” and if AVMs are associated with this type of scenario. I will say that at times I have had an extremely difficult life with more than a normal person's share of trials and tribulations. I have always said that most of the difficulty I've experienced has been from the unwise decisions I've made, so it would be comforting to learn that it was never me, but the ALIENS, all along. Seriously, despite the health problems and other difficulties I've had, I've now got my life headed in a direction that I'm content with. After making two incompatible choices for marriage partners, I was blessed with six beautiful children so I am thankful for these women for that. I finally married my high school sweetheart, (who has six children of her own, making it a dozen for us altogether.) She happens to be a professional writer and helped me put this hard-to-believe actual U.F.O. sighting into a flowing, readable story so I truly thank her for that. If you were one of the people in one of the three cars behind me, then it would be great to have someone validate my story, and if you feel like I have felt all these years, have me validate your story, too. Most people report seeing one strange U.F.O. or experience, I've never heard of anyone else ever seeing this many U.F.O.'s in one sighting.

So as I went down the road out of the corner of my eyes I thought I kept seeing flashes of light much like a shooting star. so I just do what I always do and walked forward while looking up for something to happen. I got to the school and it was weird that there was like a bunch of kids playing tackling each other? But I kept walking with a stern face because I felt the presence of extraterrestrials. I felt weird. I walked past them and got to the high school track around the football field. And as I have done in the past I decided to lay down and watch the skies for  any kind of shooting stars or UFOS. Sure enough I saw a shooting star it was green and had a tail. It was awesome and only lasted a second or less in a small part of the sky but I was satisfied to continue watching convinced to make some kind of contact. Observing it was an experience that cant be put into words. Then a few moments later I saw a big streak of white light. It was another shooting star. A few times I saw  lights out of the corner of my eye yet because I had not had a clear visual I dismissed them as irrelevant. They could have been a car a street light even those kids or the school. Eventually I had seen several shooting stars and thought to myself had I accomplished what I came here for? So still lying there I grew cold even though I was hot from previously walking as I had mentioned that 45minute walk or so kind of pissed me off. Once I got to the track I laid down for about 30 minutes then I said something to myself. I wanted to leave within 5 minutes. I wanted to see a UFO go over my head, directly above me. I wanted it to come from my direct right and move towards my left. Imagine how I felt when this happened exactly like I wanted it to. Directly above my eyes as if you shot a laser from the center of the earth up through the ground through my head on the ground looking up through my eyes if that laser beam kept going perfectly straight  it would hit the thing I saw. It was straight above me as I glanced into the heavens. It was only visible for 1 second but it was enough. It started of white with a tail like a shooting star then faded away then reappeared on the same path and was white with a tail again but it rotated half way this time. It rotated and I saw a disk. Yes a disk like a saucer lice a Frisbee like a plate. I am convinced it was an intelligent being and after that I have had a different life I just want to talk to someone about this. I went to this exact web site after I witnessed it to try to find if anyone else saw it and all up and down the east coast there was reports of much similar activity if not identical. I experienced lost time loss of hearing and a surge of power. Like I could control the universe. I even had a dream about the exact event years before it happened can I please get some feed back fellow earthlings. When something like this happens you never forget it, and so I will never let this paranormal event escape. I BELIVE. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

My only reason for this report is to document the incident. On November 20, 2007 I was traveling with four friends and a driver in Beijing, China.  We were on vacation visiting the country and enjoying the sights.   I was sitting in the back seat of the car, if you could call it a seat, because the little suv was full with the 6 of us. I was looking out the front window past the driver when my friend says, ""Hey guys, whats that up in the sky by the tower?""  We didn't know what to think as we clamored to the left side of the car to get a good look. Everyone else immediately saw it, except the driver (he spoke absolutely no English)and myself, and began to throw around comments like, ""it's a blimp"" or ""maybe it's a ufo.""   As I struggled in vain to find the object, my friends took out there cameras and snapped a couple of images of the ufo and tower.  Eventually, I saw it.  The reason I had missed it was because I assumed the altitude of the supposed object to be around 3,000 - 5,000ft.  In actuality, the ufo was at an altitude of 15,000 - 20,000ft (roughly. See photo).  The ufo itself appeared round and definitely had a grey/metallic color. It hovered/remained still the entire time we watched (2-3min), that is, until it vanished from view. I don't know exactly how, but when my eyes were distracted momentarily they returned to find the object gone. Vanished completely, with no sign of it in the surrounding area or contrails. In total, five of us saw the object. I forgot about the incident because it was a friend who took the photographs.  Later, remembering the incident, I got copies of it and looked at them.  I didn't see anything.  That is, until I began to zoom in and scan the area I remember seeing the object around.  Another interesting piece of the puzzle was in the second photo, the object is a little more blurred but there are 4 gold/yellow disk's at approximately the same height only about a mile or two away. I did not mention these disk's earlier because I did not actually see them that day, only the one ufo. It was only upon scrutinizing the photos that I saw them. I am not sure whether or not my friends saw them in addition to the one object. I have four photos of the incident.  Only two of them containing anything.  The other two are after the object departed. Hope this is helpful.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

Now thinking it was maybe a helicopter (no sound though) it just stayed in that position for at least an hour, then it would change it's position in very straight lines, then stop at intervals of 15 to 20 minutes, sometimes covering large distances.

It happened when I was an early teen, but I remember that I still didn't have my drivers licence yet (I got it at 15 years old). That narrows it down to 1976 to 1978. Sorry. It's the best I can do.  The month is also an estimate. I remember it being a moonless warm night.)  My friend and I were about 14 and 17 respectively and on a clear night we were outside in his back yard looking through his telescope.  To our north, we saw five pale green spherical lights that were in a chevron pattern traveling due south at about 100 MPH, or less (estimate). At first, it seemed like lights outlining a single craft; but as they passed directly over our heads, we could clearly make out stars in between the ""Spheres"" of light. We realized that we were looking at 5 separate craft.  We were both (and still are) aviation fanatics. Both were taking flying/glider lessons and I was a later a member of the Civil Air Patrol. These spheres made no sound, had no exhaust traces or trails. They were not aircraft of any kind as we knew them. To estimate their size, I would say that if you held up a baseball at arms length, it would approximate their size (each) to the eye.  My friends yard is on the highest hill in the area. So, as they passed south of us, we could get a better estimate of size/altitude. It was late night so this is still very much an estimate: They were about 50-60 feet in diameter each. They were about 50 feet apart and were about 600 to 800 feet in the air.  As they passed over the next neighborhood south of us, one of the spheres lit an incredibly white light. It first pointed out to the right (east), then immediately aimed (snapped)down at something on the ground. We were astonished! As we watched, the spheres continued to travel south and the beam stayed ""locked"" on whatever it was it was being aimed at. That is to say, the beam stayed ""locked"" on one position on the ground as the spheres continued to move away. We could see it (the light) changing angle and broadening as they (the spheres) got further away. It (the light)then snapped off as fast as it had came on.  Within 2 minutes, they had passed below the horizon/tree line to our south and we lost sight of them. Then all hell broke loose. 2 F-4 Phantom fighters came screaming in from the Gulf of Mexico just to the south of us and we heard a double sonic boom. The following few days had various reports in the St. Pete Times about jets going after an unidentified ""small aircraft"", people seeing strange lights in the sky along the coast and the windows in a Grants Department Store in New Port Richey, Florida had its front windows blown out by the sonic booms.  My friend called Macdill AFB the next day, which is a TAC base and asked about the goings on. He was told by a gentleman on the phone that the jets came from Tyndall AFB in Panama City. When asked why from so far away when we had the same jets at Macdill, his reply was something to the effect of: ""We just wanted to get there the fastest, with the mostest."" He gave no further help.  These booms also caused a crack in my friends ceiling that remains to this day.

Date of Sighting:  Mid January, 1977  Time of Sighting:  Around 1 a.m to 2 a.m. Duration of Sighting:  About 1 minute  Location of Sighting:  Wild Acres Lakes, private lake community in Dingman’s Ferry, Pike County, Pennsylvania. Description of Locale:  Very Rural, Deciduous Woodland  Distance from Object:  Approximately 1,500 feet or 500 yards  Description of Object:  To Naked Eye, looked like bright fire burning on the ground, my closed fist at arms length would about cover the object.   In binoculars, appeared to be a brightly glowing object (not flickering like flames would do) of orange/yellow coloration that seemed to eminate from 2 side-by-side sources, close enough to appear as one object. Weather Conditions:  Very Cold (zero or below zero degrees F), Clear, Ground Frozen Solid, Snow Covered.  No Moon, but Starlit Sky. Circumstances/Description of Sighting:  In January of 1977 I was 24 years old and I worked in construction, but for the winter I took a job as a security guard at Wild Acres Lake in Dingman’s Ferry, Pa.  This was and still is a gated homeowners community in a rural wooded area.  In January of 1977 it was being actively developed with new lots being sold and new homes being built, while many homes were already occupied in the lake community.  My duties were to patrol the roads of the community at night to watch watch for illegal or unusual activity.  As background, I had been in the US Army from 1972 to 1974 with MOS of 95B, Military Police.  I had been stationed in Kaiserslautern, Germany, working with the enlisted rank of SP4 in 15th MP Brigade Headquarters in the S-3 Operations Center working with war contingency plans, a job which required a Top Secret security clearance and required a background investigation. The mid to latter part of January 1977 was very cold in Pike County Pa and most of the northeast, which was one of the coldest Januaries on record.  I don’t recall the exact date of the sighting but it was in the mid to latter part of the month with a moonless sky, very cold, very clear with bright starlit sky, the air crisp, the ground frozen solid and snow covered with at least a foot of crunchy powdery snow.   The night of the sighting I was patrolling the roads of the development routinely, looking for anything unusual.  At this time, the developer had been clearing one of the swampy areas to create a lake, and this entailed logging off the larger trees, bulldozing the stumps into big piles, and burning the piles openly.  At night the piles glowed brightly as the fires continued from the daytime burning, and I kept an eye on them in my rounds to make sure the wind didn’t send embers into surrounding woods and start another fire.  (they didn’t, the piles were in the middle of the frozen swamp removed from the surrounding woods, and the ground was frozen solid and snow covered).  On the night of the sighting I was driving slowly south on Wild Acres Drive between the Long Lake on my right and a low lying frozen swamp on my left.  Across the treeless swamp at a distance of about 1200 feet was a road called The Construction Road in 1977 but now shown on maps as “Luciano Rd”.  At the time the construction road was used for exactly that, for construction vehicles to enter the property instead of entering through the gated main entrance.   Just beyond the Construction Rd the ground rose in elevation above the swamp to maybe 20 or 30 feet.  At the top of the rise, through the leafless trees, I thought I saw a large fire burning on the ground.  As I mentioned above, the size was about the size of my closed fist at the end of my extended arm, at a distance of about 1500 feet.  From my position I was looking towards the east.  Since this was not in an area where the developers were doing any clearing, I was conc! erned th at the woods were on fire, and I stopped my car, rolled down the window and looked at the fire through a good pair of binoculars I had in the car.  Through binoculars, I could see that this wasn’t a fire, which puzzeled me because I was expecting to see a fire.  Instead I saw two side-by-side brightly glowing lights the color of bright fire, but not flickering like fire does, but rather glowing steadily.  The lights seemed to be side-by-side but overlapped, close enough together to be one light with two sources.  I still didn’t know quite what to make of the lights at this point.  However, as I watched through the binoculars, the lights suddenly rose off the ground though the trees which I could clearly see, and actually rose above the top of the tree line about 10 or 20 feet and hovered there for 15 seconds or so.  As the light hovered, I could clearly see the trees underneath, the light was above the trees.  Then after about 15 seconds of hovering, the light ascended at an unbelievably rapid speed not quite straight up, but at an angle just a few degrees off vertical, and left a light trail as it did so, as you see when you quickly waive a light wand or flashlight in your hand in the dark. There was no noise of any kind during the sighting, it was quiet.  No cars in sight.  The area is adjacent to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, a wild and scenic nature area, very rural.  No military bases nearby. Unfortunately I did not think at the time to investigate the site at close quarters, I cannot explain why.  I had never seen anything like it before, nor have I seen anything like it since.  I wish I looked at the site immediately afterwards. The location is approximately -74.90 lon, 41.22 lat.   On a Google Map, I was on Wild Acres drive to the east of the long pond and to the west of the now-wooded swamp area and about 500 feet north of the T intersection.  I was facing east looking across the now-wooded swamp area and across what is now known as Luciano Ln to the wooded rise just to the east of Luciano Lane, at the top of which I saw the light on the ground and saw it rise above the trees.  (It’s about 500-600 feet west of the dam at the end of Wild Acres Lake).  I haven’t been back to the site since, and it might be my imagination, but on the Google satellite image it looks like there might be a bare spot on the ground where I saw the object.  I’d like to go back and have a look. (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

Looked closer and noticed that the blackness had a triangular shape but there was no light at that time.  Absolutely nothing, like the blackness of a deep cave.  There was no sound but the inside of my chest seemed to notice some kind of reverberation that was almost like minute vacuum with some kind of humming feeling.  It looked to be about 500 to 100 feet over the pasture but it was very hard to tell because it would depend on how large it was.  A light came on to the north side at the tip of the triangle that had the flattened edge.  The light seemed to get brighter until you could see it's beam for at least a mile.  The object barely moved forward to the north and almost in a logrhymithic rate continued to speed up to the north.  We watched it move about a mile and followed it to the T in the road where it turned left toward Tulsa and you could see a glow that seemed to envelope the entire object and it kept climbing to the west.   We had to stop near the Grand View school and watched it for what seemed about twenty to fifty miles (about two minutes)until we could no longer see the glow.  Not exactly sure of the date but the time of day is very close.   Do believe it was November of 1977 because it was close to Thanksgiving.

I have been reviewing my report from that time.  There are a couple of things that are incorrect.  The sighting was South of Lake Michigan Drive and West of Covell Road.    A few more things I would like to point out.  The craft may have been 3 to 4 times the size that I stated (200-300 ft.)  As we were driving up Cenntenial Drive (steep incline) the lights caught my eye.  It was about 20-30 miles away, it was coming at us at a very high rate of speed.  It had multiple lights rotating around the middle of the saucer.  As in other reports that I read, the middle of the craft did not come to a point, it had was a verticle surface (5-10 feet or more)  The strangest thing was that as soon as the spot lights under the object focused on us (my friend who was driving killed the lights and coasted to the end of the road, so I felt it did not know we were there) it rose and speed off at an unbelievable rate of speed (thousands of miles an hour or more)  I was in the passenger seat and never took my eyes off of it.  It traveled 30 miles in two or three seconds.  We jumped on 196 East and followed it for about ten minutes.  It looked like a moving star off in the distance. The strangest thing of all is that after we headed back home, none of us spoke about it to each other or anyone that night (family members, etc.).  It wasn't until weeks later that we were all hanging out together, and I mentioned it as a dream.  Instantly both of my friends who were with me had the wierdest looks on thier faces.  I could tell they were freaked out.  We had one or two other friends present at this time.  They thought we were joking.  Each of us took turns telling exactly the same thing that happened.

The object made no sound and traveled in a direct line from SE to NW at a swifter speed than the wind that came out of the east.

It did not come down, however, and continued at a constant altitude and speed until we could no longer see it. None of us have ever seen anything like it and are very interested to know what we saw.

I was sitting looking to the North, He was to my right and looking West when he sighted the object which was tracking South to North, sort'a following the lake shore. It came up from behind me and moved across the sky slightly west of our over head vantage-point. We all re-in-acted the event right away to get the length of time, we agreed that it took between 90-120 seconds to traverse the portion of the sky,  keeping in mind the trees behind and in front of us (his property is in a clearing).

Every one was taken ""a-back"" it appeared to have a constant oscillation, there was no erratic behavior about it as it moved silently across the sky.

My Brothers daughter took 4 pic's of the light on her camera phone, and I am going to forward them to whom ever I need to. The light from the object sorta faded out kind of like it passed our field of view because as it faded I could see a gray shape that was still visible as it moved along.  I would say that it would be analogise to driving by a traffic light for parallel street with a crossing (only much larger, Much Larger!) with the Sun Screen (bonnet or hood... what ever you call it?) this would allow you to see a faint amount of light to an ever increasing amount then to it's zenith followed by an ever decreasing amount till it was no longer visible but you can still see the traffic light, all while oscillating.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,44.6785,-83.3969

They were above the cloud cover so it seemed like we were seeing the reflection of the lights off the clouds.  There were 4 lights circling around, one seemed to be larger than the other three.  They would intersect at times but were going in a circular motion.  We watched for about an hour and then went home, keeping our eye on the lights.  When we got back to the house, they were still there.  We went inside and I kept checking now and then.  Finally when I checked at! around 11:30pm they were gone.  We wished we had seen how they left.  They stayed above the cloud cover, even though there were some clear spots in the sky, they would come just to the outside of the clouds.

There was a little lighting going on so I decided to grab a lawn chair and sit in the entrance to my house.  As the clouds passed, I walked (as I usually do when I talk on the phone) around my drive-way.  As I was looking up at the sky I thought I saw one of those spot lights that business's use for grand openings and stuff.  As I continued to watch I didn't notice the beam of light going into the air.  I also noticed four objects about the size of quarter in the sky.  They circled around the part of the sky I was watching, and then collided together and spread apart again.  Almost looked like a game of pong or something.  Now granted there was a bit of lighting in the clouds...but this was not lightning.  I truly wish I could explain it better; it's something that I've never seen. It had a certain tempo and pattern.  It lasted! maybe 15 minutes; four orbs of light circling around, coming together and splitting off; then starting the pattern all over.  Of course I continued to watch. How it ended:  All that happened was the three other ""strobes"" stopped. One other  light circled the sky for another couple of minutes.  And then it was gone.

I always think about this experience even though its been over 20 years ago and really started to think about it after that police dash cam caught that light in the sky recently... that is exactly what me and a few friends saw out in the country while playing outside. We all were around 16 years old and in pitch darkness or at least hardly any light. It was very late and all of the sudden the whole sky lighted up like daytime and we all could see each other. It was so weird and we talked about it after but we never told anyone as we were kids and just thought it was a big meteorite.... I however have it etched in my mind that it was way way to bright for a meteor. It brought light as if it was daytime. The ground and everything lit up as if it was daytime. It was almost as bright as the sun or so it seemed. We actually could see each other for about 10 to 20 seconds. If you ever heard about this incident, I would really like to know what it was. I am not sure about the date but it was either in 81, 82 or possibly 83. I think it was closer to 82.  I also had another strange thing happen in a dream I had about a UFO one night. I used to live by fresno state college and one night had a dream about a ufo. The next day there was a crop circle in the field that was part of fresno states ag department. It happened right about the time that the movie 'signs' was coming out about the ufo crop circles. They said it was a college prank but I thought it was strange that I would have a dream about it the night before it was seen. The dream was very strange and I could actually see the craft. The next day it was found. They would not let anyone in the field to view the evidence and threatened to prosecute any students that destroyed the crops. They said it was a prank but never caught anyone and never let anyone in the field to view the evidence. Anyway I always thou! ght that was a strange coincidence... the dream and the crop coming after it. remember, I was living at the time about a block away from where the crop circle showed up.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,36.86390063694268,-119.65213566878982

OK, I've never seen anything strange before or since and still can't believe what I say to this day.  So, being the internet age and all, I thought I'd search for what I saw that night to see if anyone else reported it.  I think I found the exact ""thing"" I saw in the sky as reported on http://www.ufopicks.com/. It was the early 80's and I was approximately 10 years old.  My older sister was in the phone with her friend and told me that there was a ""flying saucer"" outside.  I quickly ran to the front window (facing east) and saw what appeared to be either a relatively low flying circular craft with rotating lights (Like L.E.D.'s) slowing pacing in an exact line from west to east and then back again from east to west.  Or it was huge and much higher in the sky than it may have appeared. It was a clear night.  The ""thing"" was right above our house on it's east to west and back again pattern of flying.  I was mezmorized.  I was old enough to know that it wasn't a plane or copter.  It made no noise and very smoothly went about it's business.  I didn't see it ""exit"" the aky because it would come into view for a minute or two before going over the horizon and back again... then at one point it never returned from the horizon.  It seemed as thought it was surveying the area because of it's straight back and forth flight... it would move just a little to the south on each and every ""trip"". FYI... this ""thing"" was somewhere in between Warren and Ford Road (east - west roads) and seemed to disappear from the horizon once it hit Inkster Road (to the east) and Middlebelt Road (to the west)... due to the horizon being limited because of houses and trees. Here is the exact location of where I was viewing this object:  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=6607+Deering+Garden+City+Michigan&sll=42.328981,-83.314819&sspn=0.100384,0.21595&gl=us&ie=UTF8&ll=42.335073,-83.316836&spn=0.025094,0.053988&z=15&iwloc=addr   If anyone else remembers the exact year or can add to my memory, please do so.  I KNOW I saw it, as did my sister and the friend on the phone that lived about a half mile to our west. The exacty description of the ""thing"" was a perfect circle with LED type of yellowish-red lights that rotated around this ""thing""... It seemed to have a top and bottom (both circular)... with the LED's (or whatever) around the middle.  I could not make out the body of the ""thing"" because the lights were too bright. I'm not crazy... really. It was there. My best guess is that it was between 1980-1983. Thanks for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was 16 and planning on stopping by for a few minutes on my way home from work. I was within a few miles of the cabin when I saw a light in the sky, peripherally, to my left. It was bright white with a smaller green light just below and seemed to be diamond shaped. It was descending rapidly, but not straight down. It arced slightly in the direction from which I was coming. It disappeared behind the trees very quickly, the entire sighting lasted only seconds.  I can’t say how far away it was from me, but it seemed to be approximately a mile. Simultaneously with the sighting my car suddenly died. It coasted to a stop on the dirt road. There were no houses nearby, and I was so upset about being stranded in the middle of nowhere that I wasn’t really concerned about the strange lights I had seen, and assumed I was just having car trouble. The last memory I have is my hand on the key, turning it in the ignition to no effect. In the next moment (or so I thought at the time) my hand was still on the key but a feeling of disorientation and confusion washed over me. I knew immediately something was wrong but I had no idea what. Instinctively I tried the ignition again, and to my intense relief, it started right away. I started driving in the direction of the cabin again, feeling quite shaken but not knowing why. When I arrived my father told me about the electricity going out in the cabin and while I don’t remember why, I had the impression it had been an odd event in some way. But I wasn’t concerned until I gathered it had happened a couple of hours before hand, which prompted me to look at my own watch. I was stunned to see it was about 2 hours later than it should have been. I quickly made an excuse about feeling ill, and I did feel nauseous at that moment, so I could go home. Right then I felt an overwhelming desire to leave the area, it felt extremely unsafe being there. Strangely though, I felt no qualms about leaving my father and uncles there, I felt no threat to them at all. For a long time I tried to convince myself that I had somehow fallen asleep at the wheel, and imagined the whole thing. I told no one what I had seen, sure that they would think I was mentally unstable. A few days ago, some 26 years after the event, I told my husband of many years of what had happened to me as a teenager, and his unquestioning belief in me has led me to explore my experiences further. Although I didn’t consciously dwell on what had happened to me, it did affect me. For the next several years after the event I was unable to sleep unless the bed was pushed against the wall and my back was against the wall, literally. My anxiety levels were sky high, especially at night. I had frequent insomnia and nightmares, a problem that continues to plague me to this day. My most disturbing nightmares all have the same theme, involving the extinction of mankind at the hands of an alien race. I know this is not a memory of any kind, but a manifestation of deep seated anxieties that for some inexplicable reason , I never tied to the event until I spoke about it with my husband. To this day I have no memories whatsoever of what happened to me during that missing 2 hours. I currently hold a masters degree and enjoy a fairly wide breadth of knowledge but have never been able to come up with a reasonable explanation.

We had left Madill and were on Hwy 99 just west of Madill.  The road has very low rises, gentle slopes it is not flat.  I was the lead car. What I saw ahead of me on Hwy 99 was a huge reddish orange fireball which made me think there was a bad accident ahead.  My perception was as I topped the little slope I could see the fireball, then as I went down the lower part of the road it could not be seen.  This went on for about 5 miles. At one point, realizing I was driving erratically, I pulled over to explain to my cousin to be careful, as I did not want us to drive into an ongoing accident scene.  She said she could not see anything unusual whatsoever.  It was unnerving to know it was just me seeing this.  This light completely covered the width of the road and was about the size of the sun at sunset, yet my cousin could not see it. I kept on driving slow (thinking I need to be prepared to stop) and never ever came up on the accident.  Finally the light was not seen any more, we had crossed the bridge into Texas.

Hung there until it disappeared My location was behind (directly south of) the old sheds and farm house located at the east end of State Line Road in New Pine Creek, CA (on the Oregon/California border).  My sleeping bag and pad were on the ground with my head at the SE and my feet pointed toward the NW.  Far off to my left, at a point near WNW, I saw a “white light” moving in a straight line across the sky (toward ENE.)  Because the “white light” was moving, I decided it must be an airplane.  At first, because the “white light” was moving at what I call a slower than normal airplane speed, I thought it was a small, private plane -- yet there were no blinking red/green lights.  Due to the lack of blinking lights, I decided it was a much larger airplane and must be flying at approximately 30,000 feet or higher, and I probably would not see blinking lights from that distance.  I presumed the “plane” had have taken off from Portland or Eugene, OR and was heading for Boise, ID, or Salt Lake City, UT – and might have been ahead of schedule.  Therefore, the pilot was flying at less than normal speed so as not to arrive too early at the terminal.  I continued to watch the light for approximately 35-45 minutes (or longer) as it continued to move in a straight line across the sky.  When the “white light” reached the middle of the “cup” of the Big Dipper, it stopped moving; it just hung there!  Puzzled, I continued to watch it very carefully expecting to see some movement that would explain why I had thought the “white light” (airplane) was staying in one place.  Yet it did not appear to move.  Again, it just seemed to be hanging there.  I continued to watch the light for at least another 20-25 minutes as the “white light” remained in the same place.  Then, suddenly I realized, whereas the “white light” was still in the same spot – it was getting smaller and smaller!  I watched the light for many more minutes – until it disappeared.  In thinking carefully about what I had just observed, for that “white light” to have covered the distance to the area of the Big Dipper – he was really moving!  Then, at the place we call the “cup of the Big Dipper,” where the light made a 90-degree turn to its left and moved away from Earth until it could no longer be seen -- again, to me, that meant he was really moving!  Until, and unless, proved otherwise, I firmly believe the “light” was not an airplane, but must have been a UFO “way, way out there.”",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

She was born in April 1986 and this sighting happened in the fall of 1986. I believe it was near the end of October or the beginning November. On this night, my husband and I had put our three daughters to bed at about 9:00pm. We stayed up late watching T.V. and talking. At around 3:00am I was sitting at the end of our bed watching an old movie on T.V. and my husband was lying in our bed watching the movie. As I was watching the movie, I realized that I could hear this sound coming from outside of my bedroom window. At first I didn't think much of it but then I thought to myself, what is that noise at 3:00 in the morning? I sat up straight on the end of my bed and listened. It was a vacuum cleaner! Who would be vacuuming at 3:00 in the morning? And Outside! I said to my husband,""Someone is vacuuming this late at night, or should I say this early in the morning?""  I asked him do you hear that? He said yes. I said ""Is someone drunk or something why would someone do that? He said, ""I don't know, someone being crazy."" I said that I could not understand why they would be outside on the patio vacuuming. We had square cement patios off of our diningrooms in the back yard. We lived in a two story building so our bedroom was on the second floor. I was trying to make sense of hearing a vacuum cleaner running at 3:00am. I told my husband, ""Maybe someone knocked over a potted plant or something and they were cleaning it up""  but at this time! I said I am going to look and see who it is. When I got to my bedroom window, I slowly opened it so who ever was outside would not know that I was watching them. I wasn't going to say anything to them I just wanted to see what was going on. I pushed my face against the screen and looked down below to the direction of where I thought the noise was coming from. I was expecting to see a porch light on and someone vacuuming their patio, I know this sounds crazy but its true. There was no light on. It was totally dark on all of the patios that ran along the back of the building. I thought was is that vacuuming noise? There is no one out here. I was pushing my face against the window screen looking back and forth across the back of the building. Nothing. I had been hearing the vacuuming sound for about 5 minutes by then. After finding no one down below vacuuming their patio, I was confused and looked out over the back yard. It was a big open field with a grove of trees stretching across the back of the field. I still heard the vacuum cleaner running. I don't know why but kneeling on my knees looking out the window, I slowly looked up, what I saw took my breath away! I had to make myself breathe. My mouth was hung open, I could not speak. I could not be seeing what I was seeing! There above the grove of trees a little to my right was a space ship! I remember shaking, my mind was frozen as were my eyes on this huge, massive thing floating before me in the air! All I could think of was to call my husband over he has to witness this, so later on when I told people they would not tell me I was dreaming it all. I could still here the vacuum cleaner sound it was coming from this huge space ship. I remember in my state of shock thinking how can this massive thing only be making such a small sound as a vacuum cleaner? I called my husband, but I dared not look away for fear that it might take off. I could not take my eyes off it, I wanted to remember everything about it. I called my husband again, he was getting annoyed because he was tired. ""What?"" he said to me as I am trying not to pass out from shock and fear. ""Come here, Oh my God, come here!! You are not going to believe this!!"" ""What is it?"" he asked me. "" You wouldn't believe me if I told you!"" I said to him. My husband gets up off of the bed and walks over to where I am and bends down and looks out of the window. He was looking down below and out straight ahead.""What is it?"" he said to me with anger in his voice. I pointed up in the sky and said ""Look over there!""  My husbands knees gave way and he was kneeling beside me staring at this huge space ship."" Oh my God, Oh my God!"" that was all he could say. As we both knelt there staring up at this thing I asked my husband do we have any film in the camera, he said no. We just kept staring. We were both in shock. Oh my God is all that either one of us could say. I wanted to run and find the camera but I was afraid it would be gone when I got back and I wanted to stare at this thing for as long as I possibly could before it flew away. I noticed that the trees underneath the ship were not moving. You would think that the force of the engines would have been making the trees dance around but they were standing still. I could still hear the vacuum cleaner sound coming from this thing. I said to my husband,""Lets try to remember everything about the way it looks."" I told him, how could such a huge ship make just the sound of a vacuum cleaner. He said he did not know and kept staring. At that moment a chill went through me and then fear, we were staring up at this thing, what if they were staring back at us! I told my husband to get down so we both bent down on our hands and knees to where just our eyes were peeking up over the window sill. I said if I see a beam of light coming towards us I'll have a heart attack! My husband said, you and me both!  This whole sighting lasted about 3 minutes from the time my husband came to the window. I will describe to you what we saw. It was huge, it was as wide as a football field and it was perfectly round. It was shaped like, the best way to describe it was like a round football stadium, like the old one in Atlanta. It was thick on the sides, not like a saucer. I saw that it was made from some sort of   black iron or metal, I could see metal beams crossing at different points and some kind of huge bolts holding them in place. There were round shaped humps of metal going down the beams. There were a row of lights going around the middle of the whole ship. And I think the lights did not go on until it started to leave. Because as soon as I noticed the lights, the vacuum sound got higher pitched as it lifted up slowly, then with a sound of wind it took off and within 3 seconds it was a tiny light in the sky. We were in shock, we just knelt there in silence. I don't know how much time passed before we could talk. It was amazing, shocking, frightening and thrilling. My husband doesn't want to talk about it. I could not sleep. I couldn't wait until it was late enough to call my family on the phone. Well, a couple of hours later my phone rang and it was my sister yelling on the other end of the phone that a ufo had been seen in her town that same night. She lived in Newnan, Ga. almost an hour away from me. I told that I knew, that my husband and I had seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was heading east bound on I-40 at about 9PM CST on a clear night with star filled sky.  East of Menifee and west of Conway, AR, (Point A on Google Map) I noticed blinking green and red lights 2 or 3 miles ahead and on the right, just above tree tops.  My first reaction was a new tower had been installed (on a clear night you can see blinking red lights for miles from radio and cellular towers), but within 30 seconds, it was apparent that it wasn't a tower because it was moving, slowly, but it was moving.  As I got closer, (Point B on Google Map) I slowed down to 20 or 30 mph and rolled my passenger window down.  There was no traffic behind me, but there were a few cars passing on the other side of the interstate going west bound.  As I slowed, the object passed just above tree top some 50 yards south of my position right out my passenger window, approximately between hwy 64 and I-40 just west of what is exit 124 now.  Exit 124 was not open at the time, still under construction.  As low, slow and close as the object was, I could not make out any shape at all.  The only visible parts were 3 lights, alternating between red-green-blue.  The object was moving west, north west at about 20 mph no more than 5 feet above the tree tops.  I could not hear any sound from the object at all.  I accelerated, took exit 125 off of I-40, 1 mile down the interstate, onto hwy 64 heading west (point C and D on Google Map).  I again saw the object north west of my position about 2 miles away still traveling west by north west.  By the time I got back to my position parallel to I40 where I had slowed down (point E on map), a 2 mile round trip, the object had crossed over the interstate and was continuing it's path right at tree top, slightly faster now.  I would guess the object was traveling at 50mph now on a slightly more north bound path than before.  As I traveled west on hwy 64 for another 3 or 4 miles.  The object was still in sight, but was steadily getting further away, mostly increasing distance west but also north.  I was traveling at 65 or 70 on hwy 64 West bound, so the object had to have increased it's speed to something above that.  When I turned off of hwy 64 at Hogan Ln, (point F on map) the object was 3 or 4 miles north west of my position and was still visible, though the line of sight was intermittent.   The object at this point was roughly a mile north of the interstate and 3 or 4 miles west.  Upon reflection, I have to rule out an ultralight craft for 3 reasons.  First, it was an absolutely pitch black night, with no moon at all.  Flying an ultralight at treetop height would have been suicide.  Second, as I passed within 50 yards of the object, with my window directly facing it open, it made no sound.  I've been around ultralights enough to know what they sound like and at that distance, I would have clearly heard the motor.  Third, the variety of speed the object was flying at was outside the parameters of an ultralight.  The object was at times traveling at no more than 20mph and at other times well above 70.

On Dec. 24, 2007 at approximately 00:15 on FM 1421, Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas, we were headed South in my Ford Ranger at about 40 to 50 mph when we observed what appeared to be the head lights of an on-coming car in the opposite lane about 500 feet ahead of us bearing North.  As the “headlights” got closer (about 50 feet before passing us) they made a complete 90 degree turn in front of my truck, passed into the farm field next to us and disappeared.  This was witnessed by myself and the passenger of my truck.  At that point I slowed down to about 20 to 30 miles an hour the passenger of my car and I turned to each other and almost at the same time exclaimed, “Did you see that?”   About 10 seconds after this event and both of us being somewhat confused but alert we noted another set of “head lights” coming down the road in the same lane in the same Northerly direction as the previous set of “head lights.”  Although not expecting these second pair of “head lights” to perform in the same manner, that’s exactly what they did (a completely perfect 90 degree turn about 50 feet in front of us) vanishing, again into the field next to us (our right).  It is important to note that the second instance was a more pronounced experience as myself and the passenger of the truck had just witnessed the first incident and were, by then, in a state of high sensory alertness but also completely dumbfounded and confused.  After the second instance, I immediately stopped and got out of the car to look into the field were the lights went and could find no trace of either object.  Please note that the color of the lights were off-white and seemed to be set farther apart then normal head lights.  As the lights passed in front of the truck they also seemed to have a tail…like a comet.  Also important to note is that if these “head lights” had just gone by us I would have thought nothing of it and would have assumed they were normal cars despite the headlights being set slightly farther apart.  It was agreed by myself and the passenger that evening and over many, many recounts of the event at later times (these recounts continuing to the present) that neither of us had ever seen anything maneuver like these lights.  We also both agree that if there would have just been one event then we would have probably discounted it…but both events happened in succession…one after the other.  I can’t even begin to guess what those lights were.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,25.96936205128205,-97.44768564102564

The location of the sighting was Santa Clarita Valley, California, United States on July 13, 1979    According to the husband it was 10.00 p.m. in the evening when he initially saw the object.  According to their testimony the object was 75-100 feet in diameter and directly overhead at a height of 50-75 feet.  The object was disk shaped and its colouring was silver/white metallic.  The length of the sighting was approximately 45 seconds. He writes, ""It was one warm summer Friday around 10:00 p.m. in the evening in California's Santa Clarita Valley. I was brushing the swimming pool with a long pole and attached brush so that the kids could swim the following day. The pole requires you reach up to push down. I was standing on a high platform next to and overlooking the pool and about 4 feet over the rest of the pool area. As I reached to the upper end of pole, I saw a craft approaching the house from about 1-2 blocks away and from the West and heading South East.""  ""I knew right away that it was not a helicopter or plane. It seemed flatter and wider and with lights in a circumference of the main leading edege area. I ran towards the house, some 60 feet, and called my family to see it. Only my wife came out. By that time it was stationary directly over our house and pool. It was approximately 75-100 feet above us. We stood along side of the pool deck. It made no sound whatsoever, and it was at a complete stop over us for about 40 seconds. The only motion was a slight wobble and when it moved and tilted downwards at an angle. I was then able to determine that light was emanating from it's skin and not pool lights reflection. I took the downward tilting as some form of acknowledgment. It remained tilted downwards at a 30-40 degree angle for about 10 seconds. During the entire time, we were frozen in disbelief. It is a strange sensation knowing that what you are seeing is not supposed (to exist) and very foreign. It was (like) seeing a Greyhound Bus floating over your house!""  Witness claims that it had a small portholes and lights around the upper dome section, He describes the object as solid, metallic and shiny. It had a dome on the upper section of the craft and seemed as if created from a single mold with no visible seams. The lower underneath section of the object was concave towards the center and had two rectangular shapes along side each other and the length of the concave under-section. The rectangular shapes were about 7-10 feet in width and ran along the craft's concave underside center. ""I also noticed 2 ski like devices on the front and on each side of the front underside. What caught my attention was that the devices were not in the center or the ""center of gravity"" for the craft's diameter and design but very forward. The skis were S shaped with the top of the S facing forward but a design I could not replicate even though I scored very high on isometric drawings and IQ tests that included realting drawing sequences. Upon the craft leaning in a downward motion we could see a window or cockpit like glass that was situated in the underside, it was on the front lower edge of the round craft. The rectangular window was approximately 4 feet in height and possibly 8-10 feet in length. There was a glow of soft orange and blue lights from the inside but we could not see anyone or any controls"". It remained at a forward and downward angle for about 10 seconds. We both had the sensation of being watched. As it was angled, I noticed that light was emanating from the upper section that was not facing the swimming pool lights. Thus, it seemed to generate light through skin of the craft as the lights that first attracted me faced forward and was much lower than the upper section of the craft. ""My wife and I did not say anything to each other during the experience but she kept saying ""oh my God"" over and over again. The craft then left slowly at 30-40 MPH. I jumped on a wall around our property to continue seeing for at least 7-miles. I instructed my wife not to discuss it, to draw what she saw and then we would compare drawings. They matched, although mine had more detail and accuracy"". I have a background that includes working with Group Propulsion Systems, studied aeronautical engineering followed by busines and later as an executive with several major computer companies. ""What we saw was close, real, solid, and a beautiful designed craft. I know from my aeronautical engineering background that mankind has no such technology"", he concludes.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,34.46418620689655,-118.48207068965517

August 1979 Late evening XXXX ((deleted)) Street Wenatchee, WA, 98801   I was sitting on my front step just before full darkness facing due north when I happened to look up and saw an UFO passing directly overhead, traveling north.  The object appeared to be metallic silver in color, triangular in shape, basically flat underneath with clearly visible joints and rivets.  Also visible underneath were what appeared to be either lights or portholes lit from within.  Nothing was visible inside. The object was extremely large and appeared to be quite close.  A line of poplar trees to my left rose nearly 150’ from the ground and the object cleared them all, blocking out nearly the entire starlit sky. As for speed, the object was very slow. It took seven or eight seconds to disappear from view behind a row of trees across the street.  A jet liner could not have stayed airborne at such a sedate rate of speed.  I have seen 747’s up close in flight and this object was much larger and more massive.  There was no discernable fuselage, no wings or other protruding control devices evident. There was absolute silence, as the object passed overhead; no sound whatsoever came from the ship nor did its passing disturb tree tops or leaves. My immediate thought was that a monstrous crash was imminent, as a significant natural obstacle lay in its path and without accelerating soon, that huge ship was going to plow into Birch Mountain, immediately north of the Wenatchee River. No crash occurred. The object, once out of my line of sight, for all intents and purposes, had simply vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

In less than 10 seconds it dropped and came directly at us, almost straight on. In what seemed like only a very few seconds it was on us covering literally miles in only a few seconds and it's emense size literally covered and engulfed our 1979 Gray Chevy pickup. The first fear was of a head on collision. The absolute shock and fear was indescribable. At this point we were both covered in a brilliant and unbelievable lime/florescent green light that completely blocked out any view outside the truck. We were both completely illuminated in green light. At this point I was in complete un describable terror and total shock like I have never known before or since. I turned to my now ex wife literally screaming with out hearing myself, wondering if I was personally going insane or God knows what only to see her in the exact same state I was in. The look of terror on her face was some thing, much like the entire event, that is so vividly etched in my memory. Ok now this is the part that haunts me every day of my life since. My next memory and hers seems like literally a second later from one of shear terror is one of ""Hmmm that was weird"", and looking at her being totally calm and myself the same way. Our truck was in the exact same place on the highway going 60 miles per hour just as it was when we were in total terror what seemed like only a split second before. There was on my part no swerving or even time to react before we went from complete shock to Hmmm that was interesting. We both watched the green oval object fly off in a south west direction, more southerly than it had approached, over the trees and off into the far distance and up into the sky disappearing from sight as it seemed to climb far off in the distance. We continued the last 3 miles to our house on Loop rd. We did not have a watch or a car clock. When we got home it was 9 o'clock. Then I was even more confused. Where had the near hour gone? At this point I called the Oceana sheriff office and made a report, just in case someone else saw or experienced this. The officer was very nice and took it all seriously and stated "" I have known officers that have seen things they couldn't explain too.""",2009-01-10T00:00:00,43.5899,-86.0841

It had been snowing a couple of days and it was one of my jobs to keep the road and parking lot clear of snow. MY WIFES Godmother and family was visiting from New York City and we were going to have Thinksgiving at the resort.  The night befor Thanksgiving I was plowing snow so guest could make it up the steep mt road to the resort.  My wifes Godmothers son was with me in the truck.  As we were heading down the mt the truck suddenly shut off. We had no lights or power at all.  So we got out of the truck and started back up the mt to the resort. Just as we started to walk up the mt we saw lights that looked like a large lowing flying airplane.  It was so low we could see the wimdows and what looked like people looking out. Right behind it was another one. My first thought was two airplanes were in trouble. I remember them being very long with maybe a doz. windows.  But I did not see wings.  There was no sound and the air seemed to have electricity in it.  There is a small airport near Stowe but it could not handle anything that big I was thinking. After the two objects were no longer in site we continuied to walk up the hill to the resort.  Before arriving, we met my boss driving who can looking for us.  We drove back to where we left the truck and found it with the lights on and the truck started up.  I told my boss what had happened but I don't know if he belived me or not so I didn't talk about it again.

I stopped and watched the object. my father did not see it until i asked him what that thing was. He didnt answer, we just watched the object ascended. it was approximately 50 feet high and thirty feet across. what was most amazing is that it didnt make a sound. we watched it ascend until it disappeared. my father told me that it belonged to the CIA and that i should never say anything to anyone.

We were headed off to see a 10pm movie in town and were sort of in a hurry to make it.  As we came to a stop sign at HWY 290 to make a left turn towards Austin, I noticed a larger-than normal ranch light looming above the hill country/woods across the highway. I was staring at it, wondering why a ranch light was suspended so high up. My wife began asking me what I was looking at, and after I showed her, she calmly said.. 'What is it? I honestly didn't know. We kept looking at it which seemed for minutes, but no movement. I thought maybe it's a jet or plane on a extended flight path into Austin International coming straight at us with a landing light on or something making it appear to be stationary. Shortly, the Bright blueish-white ball or cicle of light began to fade down in intensity and sort of move slowly to the left ( East ) kind of parallel to our highway. Along the back of the circle were two blue rings one atop of the other. My wife and I had opened her moon-roof to try to hear better or get a better view while all of this was happening, but we never could hear any sound whatsoever. The night was a typical 'Texas evening to where you could have heard a pin drop. Not one sound, except for an occasional car passing out on the highway. No one else on the road stopped,slowed down, or appeared to notice what we were looking at.  My wife and I were not sleep deprived, drunken or under the influence of anything. We had only been in a hurry to get to a movie in town. As our object began moving, I started the car back up and took off in dirction of town as we both tried to keep track of it. With my wife and I both reasonably excited, 'her telling me to turn on my lights as well as to watch the road, the object shot fast for what appeared to be several miles, then turn at sharp angle, super fast again and then straight-up disappearing from sight. It all happened incredibly quick and within a few seco! nds if t hat. It was like watching an old episode of 'startrek when they would shoot off into space suddenly. It truly was the strangest-weirdest thing I had ever seen, and I've seen a lot of stuff in my life. I had been in the Air Force as a crewchief on fighter jets and other planes and had never seen any aircraft/jet/plane etc.. to do what I saw. Also to note, I am a very-realistic person about things and have always been a sceptic of 'UFO's in general. My wife and I DID see this object as we've told. That night, we both decided to forget the movie as we planned on seeing for as we were both excited/upset from what we saw. I was really thrown by the whole thing because I couldn't make sense of just what we saw. We drove back to our that night with me constantly asking my wife, 'Did you see that?, Did we really just see that??  I think she was more scared than anything, because she knew by looking at me that we saw something that wasn't right. After getting home, I did call the Police Dept. in town assuring them that this wasn't a prank or that we were not drunk or anything asking them if any one else had called about a strange light over the southwest Austin area, they said no, but it sounded interesting. Get this, they told me I might get a hold of the 'Air-force base or project blue book if it's still out  there. I assured them that it wasn't and told them that I worked on the Air force base( Bergstrom AFB at the time ) and didn't know of any numbers there to call. I thanked them for their time. Interestingly enough, when I called the Airport and spoke to a very-interested and nice person in the tower (APP-CON) they had asked me all the times and location of my event and then directed me to our local 'Travis-county sheriffs dept. The only traffic they (APP-CON) had noticed or had been with that night was a small cessna inbound over the Lake Travis area at around 9:15PM. After calling the 'Sheriffs dept and again ensuring them this was not a prank, they asked a few questions about the incident, like time/our ! location etc.. followed by, 'No we don't think your crazy or making it up, ten or so other people have called us as well about some strange lights over your area. The sheriffs deputy said we can send an officer over if you would like us to make out a report, it's up to you. He said, what ever we saw sounded interesting, and that they had a small incident reporting checklist he would use. My wife and I both agreed, and within a few minutes, a very nice-concerning officer appeared on our street and began looking at us both, asking questions. Before the officer left, he did say, 'Whatever you saw sounds pretty cool, you and a lot of other's seem to have saw the same thing tonight based upon what you guy's described to me. I have told a few folk's here and there about what happened that night, mainly not to forget that evening, but mostly to share a very 'real experience that happened to myself and another person. For many night's after that one evening, my wife would say what's wrong? as I would stand back looking out our windows. I would tell her that I felt really strange, 'Like I saw something that I shouldn't have and it's going to come back or something. I (We )have never seen anything since that evening.

I saw a light appear in the sky while I was watching my small (about 10-inch) black and white TV as I was getting ready to go to sleep.  The time is about right because I was watching Johnny Carson's monologue.  An ad break came on, so I just glanced outside and this is when I saw an orange-red ball of light ""hovering"" in the sky.  I stared at it for a moment, then leaned up to get a better look at it.  At that point, it zoomed away toward the left side of the window (which would equate to a northerly direction of movement) but returned when I lay back down on the pillow.  I looked around my room to see what might be causing a reddish reflection in the window but there was nothing.  I looked back at the window again and found that the ball was still just hovering there.  Testing again that it was something in the room, I leaned forward again and it zoomed off again, as before, and returned when I lay back down.  I tried it again and it zoomed away yet again but not to the left (north).  Instead, it dashed away nearly straight up and did not return when I put my head back on the pillow.  I tried sitting up and down a few more times but it didn't return.  At that point, as I had missed most of Johnny's monologue, I shut off the TV and went to sleep. The next night, during the monologue, the object returned.  We went through the same ritual again but for less time this night: on the second sit-up from the pillow, it zoomed off and away again. This repeated for the next few nights but then never returned. There were no street lights that could explain this as there was only one light in the area and that was almost directly beneath where the sphere was seen.  It couldn't have been someone with a laser pointer since they were not common two decades ago and it would not explain the type of motion that I witnessed.  Further, I did hold up my hand to see if it was broadcasting a confined beam of light, such as a flashlight might project and nothing of that nature was in evidence.  I also made sure two of the nights that everything in the bedroom was shut off and unplugged.  (At the time, that included only my TV, which had no LEDs as it was an old-style dial TV with a built-in antenna, an alarm clock/radio, and an Apple //c computer with external SupraModem 2400 dial-up modem.)  The bedroom door was closed, so no light sources from another room were possible. I have no idea what it was but am convinced that it was not something as easily explained as a reflection or a terrestrial aircraft, not with the flight characteristics that the movements implied.  Thus, this, to my mind, equates to an unidentified flying object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

This is a description of what I saw in the sky at around 6:30 to 7:00 p.m. on sept. 06 2009. I had walked outside to smoke a ciggeriate after dinner as I always do every night. The sky was totally clear of clouds, and as I looked up into the sky towards the northwest direction I noticed that in the distance was what looked like a very small wisp of a cloud. I looked at this for about 3 to 4 minutes and realized that this wasn’t a cloud and that this was a small con-trail and that the object was moving towards my direction. I grew up in SanAntonio Texas around a lot of different kinds of air traffic so I can pretty much determine what I am looking at when I see something in the sky. Whatever was in the sky on this day was no plane because planes leave a lingering con-trail. This trail did not linger, also this object was extremely high. I would estimate from my experience of watching aircraft in the sky that this object was above 75,000 ft. I know what planes! look like at a cursing altitude between 33,000 and 37,000 ft. this object was much higher and going very fast. As I watched the object it flew directly over my location, I heard no noise and could not determine the shape of the object because it was either too high or it was too small, but it was reflective and I could see a small object in front of the con-trail. This is where my story becomes interesting. As I tracked the object in the sky I thought it would just keep flying in the same direction but as the con-trail started to finally fade the object re-appeared moving in exactly the opposite direction within about 5 seconds. That is impossible to do with the type of technology that we have now. The object did not slow down and it did not make a wide sweeping turn as a jet would do. This object just did a 180 degree maneuver and proceed in another direction, and the whole time the con-trail stayed the same and did not linger in the sky as all other trails do. This trail! was completely gone and was very small in length. I ran into ! the apar tment and told my wife and she laughed at me for about 20 min. I then went back outside and looked in the same direction that I first looked in and the object was back almost exactly in the same position that it was in when I first saw it. I then went and got my wife and she saw it to, but this time the object was moving away from us and I could see it for a very long time. I don’t know what I saw but I do know that it was very high, going very fast and it was not an airplane, helicopter, weather balloon, or anything else I can think of.

I pointed it out to my father who was in the front passenger seat(I was in the back seat) and he said that he saw it too and that it did not seem to take on the appearance of an airplane or helicopter.

It appeared to be over the general area of the CVS drug store on tunxis hill in fairfield from our point of view on I-95. We passed some trees just before exiting I-95 via exit 24 southbound and taking a right into the northern direction. When we got off I-95 just after our view being blocked by some trees to the left (north), we could not see the object anymore over tunxis hill, or in any direction for that matter. It seemed to have just disappeared, it was slightly cloudy so that could have been why we couldn't see it anymore.

After 22 years, I am succumbing to the argument that certain sightings –seen in the sky – should be reported regardless of what we believe them to be, or not to be. My sighting was of an unexplainable, nighttime aerial phenomenon that took place in 1987, San Juan Capistrano, California. I lived in a large house at the time, not far from the ocean, and while sitting in the living room facing a very large picture window that faced a sparsely lit, dark expanse of hills and custom homes, a streak of yellow light shot from somewhere overhead and angled downward, across the frame of view afforded by the window. The “beam” of light was essentially a brilliant ribbon of considerable size, flat rather than vertical, utterly silent, that shot across the sky and ended with a sudden, but not particularly bright flash. Rather than the shower of sparks and arcing trails of debris that one would have expected from such a display, the event was more notable for its lack of detail or fancy after-effects. The explosive spikes of light that radiated from the center of the explosion, if it was indeed an explosion at all, showed no signs of gravitational arcs, as if residual remnants were falling to earth. After viewing many modern videos of meteors, bolides, and returning space junk, the light event I witnessed bore no resemblance whatsoever to any of the aforementioned displays. As an amateur astronomer, and a consummate skeptic, I have always believed the phenomenon I witnessed to be some type of high-altitude bolide, a midair, exploding meteor with its own unique characteristics separate from more typical meteors and meteorite strikes. I further supposed that no two bolides should be identical in how they might appear to different observers, thus the lack on my part of any immediate need to report anything. Over the years, however, and especially recently, it has grown apparent that such a sighting as I experienced, should be recorded regardless of how unimportant I may believe it to be, or not to be. One last description of the seeming physicality of this “object” as it streaked across a very dark sky, is the peculiar fact that, as said before, it possessed no detail. I mean this quite literally. The ribbon, as I call it, was entirely uniform in structure, in color, brightness and shape, with no irregularities as would be expected by a completely natural event. It was as if a stripe of solid yellow, similar to a painted highway lane marker, zoomed across my field of view, then came to an abrupt stop as it “popped” and faded into the darkness. It all happened very fast. The stripe also bore its own perspective, meaning I could tell that it was nearest when directly overhead, and that as it trailed off, grew narrow, like train tracks leading off into the distance. Thus the object traveled some distance further before terminating or destructing. This was the strangest thing I have ever seen, and has never been repeated. For what it’s worth, please add this odd little anecdotal tale to the pile, where it can find some meaning, perhaps, for those who truly care about such things.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,33.52540409836065,-117.61945573770491

It did not appear to be moving really fast from our distance, but it circled around the moon I would guess about every 20 seconds.  Knowing how large the moon is, it must have been going VERY fast.  I did not think of this reasoning at the time, because I was achild.  As a child I didn't think much of the inident because kids believe in imaginary stuff like aliens, but as an adult, it seems very strange.

We were exiting a resturant in a plaza. We saw this retangular flat object that was levitating in the sky. It was not that high up. At first we thought it was a balloon or a bird. As we looked closer we all saw that the object was in deed a flat retangular shape with a luminous circle around it.  It kept swaying back and forth in an upward motion.  At first it was hovering over the same spot but then it continued to get higher. This went on for about two to three minutes and it disappeared. We actually could not believe what we were seeing. I typically do not believe in this type of stuff but there is NO other explanantion for this object. The fact that it was dark outside and we could see this black object floating in the air, leeds me to believe that this was something of a different nature. I do not know if this was indeed a UFO, but it was not normal whatever it was.  Please, I am not crazy. There were 3 of us, completely sober, who all witness the same exact object and motions. I did try to take a picture of the object. Only if you hold the carmera a certain way can you see the ""glow"" of the object.  It was a white circle around it. My flash on the camera would not work so I guess the black object did not come through. I just really want some type of explaination as to what this was? Have others reported this type of object before? I am freaked out right now.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,39.17450311744155,-84.48136299381886

Revelations of my UFO sighting have always been met with ridicule by the family and friends I’ve shared it with. The only reason I’m writing this now is because an “open-minded “ friend who I shared my experience with happens to listen to a “coast to coast” on the radio and seemed to hear specifically about sightings of the same type in the same location and time as mine. I admit my recollections of details are a little fuzzy but many memories are clear as day. Here goes: I was a student at UW-Madison in the late 80’s & early 90’s and was coming home for Thanksgiving vacation to be with my family. I caught a ride with my cousin who also lived in Madison and liked to take the “back roads” home to look at all the Christmas lights in the small towns. I recall that we were heading  west on a country highway at night when my cousin pointed out some odd lights far in the distance. I agreed they looked strange and we continued to watch the progress of these lights. As it happens our course turned in a North –South direction and it was clear that the lights were getting closer and if it continued on the same course it’s path would lead it right over us. I told my cousin to pull over to the side of the highway so we could get a better look. Insanely, I recall opening the front passenger window and sticking my head out to look up and was mesmerized by what I saw. What I recall seeing  was  “layers of lights” moving slowly over our vehicle at a low altitude. What struck me most was that  this large form was “silent.” As the UFO moved over our car I pulled my head back in the vehicle and said to my cousin excitedly , “you have got to see this!” When I looked back out the window seconds later – it had vanished. My question to myself was – “what on earth can be that large, airborne, silent and disappear without a trace?” In my opinion this was no weather balloon! I’ve lived quietly with this experience in my memory and only wish I’d reported it sooner to a reputable source such as yourself. My interested friend said that he knows someone in law enforcement that witnessed something similar in the same time frame and location as myself. He said that he may be able to get  “audio” from the police car as it followed a strange UFO. I am wondering if in your database anyone has had a similar experience. I would be very interested to know more if such is the case.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I, and three friends, were partying at my house in Santa Rosa that night. My home was located on the western edge of the city. We were in one of the rooms facing the field (a cow pasture) adjacent to my home. Two spherical objects appeared over the field, probably a quarter mile away. They were, and I am guessing here, about 100 yards across (the red one) and 80 yards across (the orange one), definitely too large to be balloons and surely not balloons as balloons do not glow in the dark like that. The light was coming from inside these objects. We were simply awe-struck with comments like “Do you see that? What is that?” If we had out wits about us we would have found a camera but we could only look in awe. After about six minutes they disappeared. They did not fly away, they just disappeared. Another five minutes passed and they reappeared. They were not moving on either appearance, just hovering over the field probably 100 yards in the air. The night was pitch-black and these things were really bright. After another five minutes they disappeared and did not return although we stared in that direction for a long time. Now, here is the spooky part. Nineteen years later a friend of mine I had known only a couple years casually told me that he had seen some UFOs in 1989. I took a chance and told him “I will describe what you saw,” and I gave him the description I have just recorded above. His jaw dropped and he told me that was exactly what he had seen, only he had seen them while camping out at the beach, a distance of about 20 miles from where the four of us had seen these objects.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,38.45256501240695,-122.71790012406949

While I kept watching I noticed that it seemed to be getting close to a treeline in the distance.   Suddenly, it flipped totally around and that was when I noticed it was triangular in shape.  The broad end of it flared bright red and it shot almost straight up into the sky.  My wife had just missed seeing it. Last month of this year we are in the same town but a different house.   I witnessed on two seperate occasions a bright object moving almost deliberately but smoothly across the sky. I did not see any blinking or recognition lights.  The object would then arc upwards out of sight.  One I saw had been traveling east-north-east.  The other one had been going east-south-east.  My younger brother on the other side of town had also witnessed these craft and also noted the direction of travel as well. He also has a some photographs of some kind of disturbance in the sky.  In one instance, upon closer inspection you can almost make out a triangular shape in the middle of it.  It almost reminds me of the description of the aura given in the tale of the Philadelphia experiment.  My brother had a source tell him that it appears to be the new kind of camoflage being used by military aircraft.  If so, then it just may be using something similar to electro-magnetic fields to make it work.  He said the images were not visible or noticeable until he got the pictures back.  They are on the negatives.  The camera he used was a 35 mm. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2009-03-19T00:00:00,32.97735,-111.5108

We saw the craft moving very slowly from west to east.  It was enormous, maybe the size of a football field.   It made no noise and seemed to block out the sky behind it.  It floated right above the treetops until it disappeared from our sight behind other houses. WSOCTV news that evening reported that they had received calls of similar UFO sightings.

In 1989/90?, I was in Mt. Morris, NY with some college friends.  It was late and dark.  We had just finished watching some movies when we thought it would be a great idea to go visit the small cemetery down the road. To make a long story short, we were walking in the cemetery and- I remember very well- we had to go slow because it was very dark and we couldn’t see the stones.  We weren’t doing anything, just kind of walking around.  We got to the back where there was a small woods with a field on the other side.  We decided to turn around and go back to the house. I clearly remember that I was looking down (stones and all) so that I wouldn’t trip when I suddenly realized that I could see all the stones with some weak shadows.  The light wasn’t blazing bright- kind of like moonlight that is filtered through clouds. I stopped and looked up (as did my friends) and there well above us (but on the horizon) in the sky was a perfectly straight, rectangular bar of light.  It was big enough that you had to move your eyes from left to right to see it all.  I don’t know what direction we were facing.  As we stood there, mouths open, just staring, the bar of light got thinner from the top and the bottom- like you might see when a door to a lit room closes- but horizontally.  It got thinner and thinner and then just disappeared. It did not move except for the “closing” effect.  We asked our astronomy professor at SUNY Geneseo about it the next day.  He said it may have been Northern Lights- NO WAY!. . . straight lines on all sides, controlled closing of the light. I am writing about it now- after many years- on a whim of looking it up on the internet and finding some other accounts that sound exactly like mine.

Steve Bass, now SSD/FI in Cumming Georgia, was assigned to assist in the investigation.  Investigative chores and additional contact with the witness were on-going from mid-April through June and July of 2008. Various authorities and media were contacted during the administrative phase, to include; FAA; Dobbins ARB Public Affairs; Marietta Daily Journal; Atlanta Journal Constitution; NORAD Public Affairs; the Marietta Police Dept; No corroborative information was forthcoming from any of these agencies. NORAD specifically reported that no anomalies had been noted in the area in question. A FOIA against the FAA filed by FI Bass produced a letter of negative findings from the Director, ATO Eastern Service Center, FAA.  Sheets/Bass conducted an on-site interview with the witness on 20May08, as well as a site survey of the neighborhood. Steve Bass also conducted an interview with the second witness (an across-the-street neighbor) who, unknown to the Primary Witness at the time, observed the event from outside of his home on 29March08. Please note that this event was not reported by the PW until 14 days after it's occurrence.  Interview with the Primary Witness (PW): We met the witness at his residence in Marietta, an extremely well kept home, the contents of which demonstrated superior tastes in decorating and living environment. The witness was found to possess a broad scientific background, well educated and well spoken. PW holds USAF certifications that would probably equal an Associates Degree in Electronics (radio, navigation, and radar), as well as aviation training to pilot a Cessna aircraft. Additional advanced education includes a BS in Biochemistry from Purdue and a Masters in Business, also from Purdue. He is presently retired from the largest computer firm in the world, and indicates travel to more than 40 countries during his active career. His wife of many years is still actively engaged in the business world.  These investigators found that the described event (as well as two previous encounters with unknown objects) had greatly affected the PW. He had become HIGHLY motivated to seek answers to what was observed, and began a vigorous pursuit of various areas of research immediately after 29March08. (Note-The PW has now obtained his MUFON FI's credentials and has become a valuable asset in MUFONGA operations in the area of Cobb County Georgia).  The witness recounted the facts he described in his CMS report and different areas were refined by these FIs with additional questions.  PW said that upon first observation of the lights at about 10:30PM, it was as if he was observing a 'descent'. As the event unfolded, he attempted to see beyond the lighting configuration to get the details of exactly what was over his property, but was unable to determine any actual structural detail due to the darkness and obvious dark coloration of the object itself. Gathered from this interview, it is obvious the PW seemed to have had a certain 'calling' as FI Bass describes it. A 'calling' to go out and check his mail, then something that drew his attention to the sky and the subsequent observations and hearing of the described low 'winding down', jet engine-like sound. During said observations, the PW was himself mystified by his conduct and other side issues........that the tree branches overhead in the location to which he had rushed should have been noticeable during the event, but it was if he was looking up with no branches in evidence. Thereafter he lost interest, as if it 'was over' and the lights/object began to move away, but he then became, and remains, extremely motivated to delve into this and other such mysteries. (See witness account field). PW said he determined there was no missing time related to the occurrence.  While some might not understand the 'unusual' feelings attributed to this matter, this writer (Sheets) has experienced the exact same conditions prior to a surprise observation of a major unknown aerial event. In 1997, the writer was investigating two substantial cases; one in Lagrange Georgia within Georgia's infamous 'Troup-Heard UFO Corridor'; and in south Georgia, a series of night reports from law enforcement officials in Jeff Davis County. The Lagrange investigation was arranged for a certain day, and upon grabbing my FI's kit and walking out the door, the writer felt a certain 'calling' (a VERY strong urge) to INSTANTLY and INEXPLICABLY change plans and drive 150+ miles to Jeff Davis County and work on those cases, which had actually been scheduled for the NEXT WEEK. A tense, expectant sensation pervaded the whole drive down to south Georgia........said feelings and sensations ENDING immediately after observation of a dramatic, unknown, night-time aerial display in the area of Jeff Davis County (as if ""well, it's over, that's it""). Thus, a better understanding of the feelings and motivations of the PW. After reviewing all of the circumstances involved in this case, there seems to be some sort of unknown influence at work in this matter. Is this witness, as well as others, more sensitive or more attuned to anomalies in our environment? I would say yes. Do some true 'unknowns', perhaps controlled or generated by an unseen intelligence, project some sort of subtle communication that can be perceived by such sensitive individuals as our PW, or perceived by others known to this writer both within and without MUFON, and perceived by the writer himself? I would say yes. Do some unknown objects project an unusual 'zone' as they hover or move........a zone created by electromagnetic fields, ionization, propulsion, or some other mechanism......giving effects that can influence those nearby? Again I would say yes. In past years, this FI has encountered other case witnesses who have reacted in a similar way, ! some eve ntually joining MUFON and making valuable contributions to our effort, and others not joining the chapter, but remaining 'friends' of MUFON for many years. Finally, might some form of 'telepathy' also be involved in such cases?  Perhaps.  On 20May08, photographs and an event-scene diagram were made, and FI Steve Bass conducted an in-depth interview with the second (separated) witness in this case at his residence across the street from the PW's home.  From FI Bass' field notes and interview:  The second witness (W2) was found to be the mature male homeowner across the street from PW. He is a former aircraft mechanic for defense contractor Lockheed of Marietta, and also a former Lockheed buyer who is ten credit hours away from his Masters in Accounting. In addition to this interview, W2 also provided a sketch of what he observed on the night of 29March08, superimposed onto a printed blow-up photo of PW's home and property. (See photo and sketch). This witness indicates in margin notes on his sketch that he is familiar (due to his past occupation) with the C-5, C-141, C-130, F-16, F-22, DC-9 and other aircraft which fly out of nearby Dobbins ARB.  W2 stated that it was a quiet night in the neighborhood with no one out and about, little traffic, no barking dogs. He stepped outside of his garage to smoke a cigarette between 9 and 10:00PM. He then looked to the east, then ESE, and observed the object in the sky blocking his vision across the street, flying slow and low, right to left, and was about 30 degrees off of the horizon, perhaps about 500 to 1000 feet above ground level. He heard no noise nor saw any lights, and indicated the duration was about 10-20 seconds. Moving at very slow speed, it disappeared to the north, finally about 10-20 degrees above the horizon of the adjacent National Forest. He is of the opinion that it looked brown to him, and as it moved off he got his only look at a more distinct outline, the portion he saw looking like a 'submarine'. W2 said he was surprised and excited and considered calling his neighbor (the PW) but did not, feeling he might already be in bed (he did not know at the time that his neighbor, the PW, had been outside and also made the observation, although from a different angle). An additional conundrum involving W2 is the fact that he was outside in order to smoke a cigarette. FI Bass determined that W2 'lit-up' IMMEDIATELY prior to seeing the object, Bass then inquiring where he was on the cigarette when the object had disappeared. W2 replied that he had finished it, which would have taken at least 5 minutes, 10 minutes max..........however W2's event duration was described as being 10-20 seconds. Is W2 just mistaken about the cigarette time sequence? Was some sort of time distortion in play i.e. the close proximity of the object projecting an influence over W2? Is this an example of missing time? This matter was not resolved........there were just no firm conclusions in this cigarette vs. time issue.  FI Bass continued his commentary regarding W2.....throughout the interview, W2 was relaxed and nonchalant and did not go for a 'more amazing story'. He sometimes searched for the correct words, speaking slowly, and did not appear confused nor did he go on tangents while talking i.e. staying on the subject at hand.  It should be noted here that W2 has been diagnosed with brain cancer, but it seemed not to have been at the stage that affected his thinking or perception very much, if at all. Upon the FIs arrival on 20May08, he was busily at work in his garage tinkering with a lawn mower on his shop bench, and thereafter conversed well with these FIs prior to his official statement to FI Bass. FI Bass' comments regarding the witness are to the effect that this condition ""seems to mildly affect concentration"", but W2 is still ""articulate, intelligent, easily understood, relaxed demeanor, humorous and matter-of-fact"".  It is obvious to these investigators that from the credibility of the two separated witnesses and all of their supportive documents and sketches, and from our investigative findings, that an object from unknown origins overflew low and slow the Marietta Georgia property of the PW on 29March08 at about 10:30PM. Said object was MASSIVE in size, with the PRECISE shape undetermined due to darkness but believed to be rectangular, and containing an array of lights as described and obviously making the bizarre low sound as heard by the PW.  From the PW and W2 sketches, photographs made on-site, and other diagrams, this writer feels that while the PRECISE shape is unknown, the size of this massive object might be as large as a football field 300'x160'. Though from W2's description of it flying away and presenting a ""submarine"" like appearance, it indeed could have been a geometric shape or a rectangle as seen in profile. Again, it was dark and the objects surface was also dark except for the lights observed by the PW.  Note: This event occurred about four (4) miles WNW of Dobbins Air Reserve Base, which also houses the defense contractor offices and factory of Lockheed-Martin. (The home of the PW is in a direct line almost exactly four miles WNW of the westerly end of the Dobbins main runway). Both the military and Lockheed utilize the common air facility. In recent months, MUFONGA has received some additional unsubstantiated information about 'unusual' aerial sightings in that vicinity. FI Bass, with knowledge gained from his aviation work and a review of certain public resources related to this facility, found some possible unusual features within the said compound. It has been found that the Lockheed portion of the compound is PARTICULARLY tight in it's security, which is as it should be for a defense contractor. However these other factors causes one to wonder exactly how forthright is the official response when we seek information regarding things occurring on the doorstep of Dobbins ARB and environs.  BGE; Information Quality 100%=1; Reliability 74%=0.74; Strangeness 14.286%=0.14286; Certainty Index 10.58%=0.1058.  Due to these aforementioned factors, this case is classified as an 'Unknown-UAV'.  Many photos, diagrams, sketches, maps and other official documents were generated by this investigation, too numerous for posting on CMS. The most descriptive and vital of these documents will be electronically attached and the remainder saved in the physical file.

It was moving as if it was a helicopter, but as it got closer, I saw that it wasnt. As it got above my pasture I freaked out and jumped off my horse and got into my truck, because it wasnt slowing down and kept getting lower. I took off and drove back to my house which is about a quarter mile away from my pasture, and when I turned around as I was driving through the gate, the light was about 20 feet above ground and I could clearly tell it was ONLY a floating light. When I drove back to my house I told my parents what had happened. They went back to check out what happened (I did not go because I was too freaked out), and my mother reported seeing the light but it was hovering over my sick horse, and then just floated away.

What was unusual was the light stayed the same with out changing and there was no noise. Both, my husband and I kept saying ""that's weird"", but were convinced it was a plane. After some time we knew this was not right and went out side to see what it was and to our amazement we could distinquish in the night sky, a large triangular shaped object hoovering slightly above the trees of this 3 acre Island.

WE sold the house, and the doctor that purchased it has told me he's been happy and not mentioned anything ""unusual"", and (of course) I was not about to say anything.

It was comfortable, temperaturewise, this sky was clear, the stars, bright.  I could hear what sounded like the wind blowing, but there was no sensation of wind.  I looked at trees in the vicinity, and there was no movement, just the sound of blowing wind.  I looked up at the stars, and there was a definite area with no visible stars, just pure ""blackness"", and this area was moving.  Definitely not cloud cover, just total lack of light, also, no ""running"" lights.  I watched briefly, then went into the store.   Didn't tell any one inside what I had seen, basically, becuase I didn't believe or want to believe that I had seen something.  Whatever it was, it was gone from view when I went back outside.

My mother was saying goodbye to her boyfriend outside because he worked for Newsday and was going to work.  My mothers boyfriend was at the end of my driveway (I heard this after the fact because I was still inside watching TV) and said come over here and take a look at this to my mother, when she came to the end of my driveway and looked into the sky where he was pointing she yelled ""Oh my god"" and ran inside to get me and screamed into the house ""((name deleted)) there is a UFO outside"" ((name deleted)) there is a UFO outside"".  Thinking that my mothers boyfriend had some prank in store for me when I went outside I followed her out the door she ran into the middle of the street where her boyfriend was now standing and when I reached the point where I can see it in the sky I was in awe.  It was a spaceship about the size of a football field hovering but moving very slowly to the right.  The ship made no sound and looked similar to the ship from close encounters of the 3rd kind. I saw the ship briefly because it was between two houses mine and my neighbors and it finally made its way between the trees and at that very moment my dog ran out the door that I left open and took off down the street.  My mother told me to get into the car and her boyfriend left in his car and we took off in the direction that the UFO would have been from where we saw it.  We traveled in the car and got as far as route 110 in farmingdale but we never seen the UFO again. My dog was in front of my house upon our return about an hour later. I went to school the next day, I was 16 at the time and told my story to my class in Science which was appropriate since my teacher was pretty ""out there"".  I was laughed at from my class when a girl in my class who never spoke said ""Oh my god my mother saw the same thing last night and I thought she was crazy"".  The girl lived on Prairie Lane two blocks over from my location on Chapel Lane. The class got pretty shocked and I felt validated in my class and started to say ""see I told ya"".  After school I was walking home from school with my two friends telling them about my experience the night before and telling them about what happened in my class but still was continued to be made fun of.  My friend lived on Saddle Lane one block from where I lived and when I walked into my door my phone rang and it was my friend I just walked home with and he said ""first off don't tell me I told you so but my neighbor ran over to me when I got to my house telling me that his father seen a UFO last night with the same description as me and at the same time that it happened to me"".  I told him I told you so and that is the last time anything has came from this story but it has changed my life.  One thing I can tell anyone reading this is that it wasn't a blimp, plane, or helicopter it was a spacecraft and if I had it on film it would be the best footage of a UFO ever captured by far.  For months after I stood at my driveway with my camcorder waiting for a return of the UFO but it never was seen again I am now 33 years old.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,40.7228,-73.517

There’s one street light on the corner west of my house, and another street light further up the street going toward Main Street (which runs north/south), which is not visible from my house.  When I looked out the window I could see the silhouette of the maple tree next door, and saw that the wind had picked up.  I heard thunder in the distance, but there was no rain.  I stood there at the window for at least 2 or 3 minutes watching for lightning, and after not seeing any I thought I should get back into bed and try to go back to sleep.  But immediately after thinking that, and before I left the window, a bright white, round light caught my eye.  At first I thought it was a firefly, but the light was too large, bright and distinct.  It was just slightly above my eye level, and being that I was on the second floor the light was up near the top of the maple tree that grows in front of the house next door to me (on the east side).  I would say it was approximately 20 feet away from my window.  It was perfectly round, about the size of a tennis ball.  Another one slowly appeared next to the first, and then another, and another – until there were four lights in a row, evenly distanced apart – maybe a foot or less, in a straight line (relative to each other), that was on a slight 20 degree angle – the most distant light slightly higher than the first in the row.  There was no sound, except for a light wind.  These lights hovered near the top of the tree and maintained this linear formation for at least 30 seconds. I don't know if they were individual lights, joining each other; or perhaps they were attached to something else that had slowly moved from behind the tree.  Then! they we re suddenly gone, almost like I blinked and they were gone.  I don’t know what they were, but I do know they weren’t fire flies or street lights.

We live near a small airport (Cumberland Municipal) and my attention was drawn to the sky by a low flying two-engine aircraft. To my surprise, there was another object in the sky unlike any that I have ever seen. It was an almost transparent upside-down bowl-shaped craft. Underneath the craft was what appeared to be a thin solid 'line of light' discharging from the bottom of the 'bowl'. The light had the appearance of a fluorescent light (it could have been circular but from my point of view the light was a straight line). It should be noted that this object remained stationary in the sky. I thought it might be moving away from me, but it was not. It should also be noted that there was a full or ¾ full moon that evening, but this object was well away from the moon. I thought, 'Am I really seeing this?'. However, as I passed the tennis courts - with object still in full view - I heard a lady speaking to her husband saying, '...I don't know. I guess it's an alien invasion or something.' I said to her, 'Do you see that?' She stated, 'Yeah, it's really weird.' I agreed and kept walking (with the stationary object now over my left shoulder). As I turned back to look at the object again, it was gone. I could hardly contain myself until I reached the tennis courts again. I stopped and asked the lady, ‘Did that thing ever show itself?’ She walked over to me and very excitedly said, ‘Oh my God. That thing just vanished!

First of all, I was a skeptic’s skeptic.  My father and three relatives were on their way to a lodge meeting one Monday evening in 1947, near Lewistown, Montana.  Dad was excited as could be the next day relating how they saw the lights of the ""flying saucer"" (I’d never heard the term UFO at that time.) and they pulled the car into an approach, shut it off and all got out to observe the gyrations these lights were performing, close by--and without a sound.   I was thoroughly embarrassed for Dad, his two brothers and nephew, and didn’t relate the incident to ANYONE.  That is until some years later, when strange things were happening near Great Falls, when a TV newsman caught several UFOs circling around Great Falls; and later incidents at Minuteman Missile sights in central Montana. I believe the year was 1990 or 1991.  I don’t remember but it likely late spring to early summertime.  I went to the ""coffee shop"" near the viaduct in Whitefish, where I met the retired GNRY workers I enjoyed having coffee with, and listening to their stories of ""steam railroad"" in years past.  I was sitting with three GNRY retirees.  I was facing Big Mountain, the local ski resort. I observed a very shiny (shinier than chrome) ""airplane"" coming into sight above Big Mountain, approximately 15 miles from where we sat.  (I used to have a friend who owned an old 140 Cessna aircraft, which he used to polish and buff.)  Since it was confusing to me, I mentioned to the three others at our booth, ""I see a UFO flying toward Whitefish.""  I was kind of kidding, but it soon proved quite true.  By this time it was probably about 5 miles?   We watched the ""airplane"" descending and the closer it got, it was obvious at the slow cautious speed it traveled, that it was no ""Cessna aircraft,"" but rather a very thin disk.  (It appeared as though one took two ""cymbals"" and placed one atop the other, it would replicate the shape we were seeing.  There was slightly more ""cabin"" underneath than on top.)   I would estimate the width of the total craft to be 75’ in width. I went to the kitchen and told the owner and his wife we were observing a UFO nearing Whitefish.  The 6 of us went outside to watch this situation.  The UFO came to a stop about ¾ of a mile from us, hovering above (best guess?) Wisconsin Avenue or the east edge of Whitefish Lake when it began hovering about 250-300 feet above the ground.  We observed it in a noiseless, standstill hover for approximately 5 minutes.  Then it took off in a northeast direction, although approximately straight up.  I’d estimate it was out of Earth’s atmosphere in less than five seconds. Sadly the three GNRY retirees have passed away.  The restaurant owner and his ex-wife are still living.  We discuss that day every time I see him.  The incident was reported in the main Kalispell newspaper the next day on the front page.   Now that I’m retired, I plan to go to the Montana Historical Society and go through those years of newspapers on videotape and try to find that story for my own satisfaction; now that I have to defend my status as a former skeptic.

It was the day before my 16th birthday, and my friend was about the same age.    I'm male, my friend was female.  I lost contact with her not too long after the encounter.  I am educated and a Science teacher now.   As for the what we saw that night...  My friend and I were talking about teenage things when we both saw one bright red round dot - circle - bubble (words to describe it) which seemed very far above us.  It was not moving at all.  We discussed, was it a planet reflecting red?  A laser pointer?  Was it a satellite, because it did appear to be far away?  A plane?   Lastly,a UFO?   Anyway, since it wasn't doing anything while we were talking about it, we continued socializing about other topics.  We would look back at the red luminous sphere every so often, but it wasn't moving.  After about 20-30 minutes, we started looking around the night sky again, and again the attention on the red brightness brought us back discussing the object.   At some point, with our attention on it, the red dot split into two identical red round objects; like cell division division had taken place, the two bright red objects started traveling in opposite directions at a steady, medium speed.   Freaked out, my friend and I became scared, and tears welted in my eyes, because I didn't understand what I was seeing.   We both watched with tense anticipation watch the red spheres travel apart.  Within 2 minutes of the splitting, the separated red Unidentified Flying Objects disappeared.  I don't know what we saw that night, but it was something I cannot explain.

My mother, my little sister and me where driving the E6 from Harstad to Fauske (two towns in nithern Norway). When we exited the Kannflog-tunnel, declining down to Sommerset, in Leirfjord, I noticed a flashing light in the sky. It was a cloudy night and no stars where visible, so this light It was a single bright flashing light (minimum 10 flash/sec(can't judge my mind to separate more)) flying on a straight course about west-norhwest (left to right in our wiew). It's hard to estimate things like speed, altitude and size on an unidentified object in the night-sky, but I guess the altitude was about 600 meters above the fjord. Since the surrounding mountains are 3-500m with peeks up to about 1300m. I remember the clouds to be about 800-1000m above the sea. We kept a speed of 80km/h or 50 miles, so we also got kind of a 3D-perspective of the course. If my altitude-estimation is about correct, this object where flying way too slow to use conventional aerodynamical wings. My first thought was a helicopter, but the flashes where on a much higher frequency, and appered much brighter than I have ever seen on a conventional aircraft. (and I've worked as airport-groundpersonell for two years!)  And out of nowhere. When the object was about the middle of the fjord, hundreds or maybe thousands of flashes, in an area of at least 200 meters in diameter (if all my estimates are somewhere close to accurate) kept on fireing for about 2 - 3 seconds(nothing systematical or symmetrical about them) And then it was just that single flashing light on the same low-speed steady-corse crossing the fjord and finally dissappearing behind the mountain towards Sagfjord.

It’s been 15 years since it occurred so I don’t remember the exact date, but, it was during the spring. I am from Pharr, Texas which is a border town in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. When I was in high school I played in a rock-n-roll band. On occasion we would take trips up to Austin and San Antonio to watch rock bands or just sight-see. Our typical route took Highway 281 up north.  On this day we had completed about two-thirds of the trip. We had passed the town of Three Rivers and were about one-third the way from Three Rivers to San Antonio. Back then this tract of road was mostly woods with some ranches and other buildings sparsely populating the land. I turned to look outside my window for no reason; I being on the passenger end of the car. I looked out above the tree line and there, clear as day, was the UFO. The UFO was a perfect sphere, its surface appeared something liked polished aluminum and its diameter was approximately between 7-8 ft. At first I thought it might be a smudge or glare on the window because it appeared to be tracking our car perfectly, absolutely matching our speed perfectly. I adjusted my view several times to see if the image was on the window or whether it really was outside. The UFO was indeed real and flying above the tree line, apparently, tracking us. At this point, I have to admit, the realization that this thing was tracking us frightened me a bit. It’s very difficult to explain the emotions aroused by this kind of occurrence. It was quite alarming. I continued to watch this UFO for many minutes (at least 10 minutes) and then it suddenly occurred to me to tell my friend driving the car. I had been so caught up in the event I had completely ignored him. When I turned to tell him I realized he was already looking at it. He later told me that, after noticing my behavior, he had placed the car in cruise control and was switching between watching the road and watching the UFO. As I turned to once again look at the UFO it had disappeared. Amazingly we were quiet for quite a few minutes before we began talking about. My friend, in particular was quite distressed about the event. We never spoke about it again and I have only told a handful of people about it since. Incidentally, a few years later, another UFO, this one a very large cigar shaped UFO was spotted, not very high in the sky, above my house by some relatives who are also neighbors. They ran to my house to tell me, they were almost to hysterics, but by the time we went outside the UFO had disappeared. Many UFOs were seen throughout the Rio Grande Valley that year. The local news referred to it as a UFO flap. That was the first time I heard that term. I have always wondered if the fact that two UFOs were seen around me was just coincidence or not. I have not been abducted or anything of the sort, in fact I don’t believe alien abductions actually occur, but I have to admit, a bit embarrassingly, that, ever so often , I look up to the sky, a little afraid, wondering if anything up there is watching me.

It is a very twisty winding road for just a few miles to the lake.  About a mile before we got to the lake, my son, sitting in the front passenger seat, said “dad, is that a full moon out?”  I leaned over to look and saw a brilliant white light about a quarter mile away across a canyon and behind the trees on the ridge.  I thought it must be a full moon and told my son “looks like it” and kept driving not thinking anything else about it.  Around a minute later, we turned to go across the small dam at the lake, drove maybe 100 yards and almost hit my friend Frank who was walking fast towards us in the middle of the road.  I stopped fast, and could tell something was wrong.  Franks eyes were wide open, and he was yelling something before I could even roll my window down to ask him what he was doing in the middle of the road.  The first thing I heard him yelling was “Did you see it?  Did you see it?  Did you see the F***ing light?”  I had known Frank about 7 years at that time, and had never seen him act anything like this before.  I shut off my engine, and turned off the lights on my jeep, got out and said “What light?  I saw the full moon.....”  I looked up to see the full moon, but it was a moonless night. Just then, Frank said “LOOK…….there it is”.  That’s when we all 3 saw it going away from us, going slightly right to left through Long Valley, just North of the lake we were standing at.  It was silent, and very bright white.  It moved slowly, perhaps 10 MPH about 100 feet above the ground lighting up the surrounding hills as it moved along.  From there it just moved towards the West and within a few minutes was gone. Catfishing was good that night after all. Frank told us that it was a ring of lights, some different colored ones, and mostly white lights all around the circle, and came across the lake towards him with the circle or ring standing vertically, and made absolutely no sound.

The objects travelled from the south side of the sky to the east side of the sky within a couple of minutes, then disappeared in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.

It seemed to be at a lower altitude and followed at a consistent distance to a smaller light the whole time.  My wife and I didn’t hear a sound. We watched planes at all altitudes all night and could even hear those at a very high altitude as I am in the outskirts of metro. It is dark and quiet. There were absolutely no other lights to these objects. No port starboard or marker lights of any kind. The brighter light was brighter than Mars and Jupiter and did not change in any way from the time we saw it till it disappeared. At first we thought a headlight on a plane however it went over and past us. It is not possible to see a light from behind a plane especially without a change in intensity and I am not an idiot. How could it be a three dimensional light and the object invisible? How could the light intensity not change in any way from horizon to horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.

They were flying in a straight line and keeping the exact distance between them the whole time.   The lead craft was a very dim light and the second following light was very bright.  When I first saw it I thought it was Venus but then I noticed it was following a dimmer light.  I watched as they flew north then gradually changed direction and started west to North Branch.   The unusual part was the lack of blinking lights and It was bright as it was going away from me. Generally the planes I see go dark as they go away from me. They were silent which also seemed unusual to me. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD)),2009-12-12T00:00:00,45.4753,-93.2873

I was looking west at approximately 40 degrees and noticed a large bright light where I knew there was no planet.  I had not seen this light there before.  This was located near but not in the Big Dipper Constellation. I watched the light for approximately 15 minutes and it appeared to be moving at a very slow pace.  It seemed to twinkle and emit a faint glow. I tried to use telephone wires to gauge how far it had moved. A jetliner was passing in the area and it was moving much faster that this object.  I don't believe it was the space station,  as it had already been by around 7:21 at 11 degrees and was not scheduled to make another pass in my area that night. I went inside and about an hour later I came out, the light was gone. I did not notice the light last night when I went out to try to find it. What was it?",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

I stopped dead in my tracks listend for sounds, other likes around the three bright ones and nothing out of the ordinary.  Until one of the lights broke formation behind the trees, but I didn't want to lose sight of the other two over my head.  One was following the other then started to go dark.

I used my binoculars to get a good look at it, it was just to bright to really see in thing specific other than it’s shape.  I asked locals about it and they had not really even noticed it….well they are now.  Curiosity has set in.  Hope someone finds the answer.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

It was approximately 9:10pm EST. Boca Raton, FL. I was in my backyard on my cell phone when I happened to look up. It looked like a very large low flying craft triangular in shape. All sides were rounded with what looked like one oval shaped light on each corner. No bright lights or flashing lights. The entire craft including the oval spheres on each corner were whitish in color but seemed to be emitting a mellow green glow similar to that of which you might see with a glow in the dark plastic toy and It was completely silent. It all happened so fast that by the time I looked up again to try understand what I thought I was seeing it was already heading over my roof and out of my eye sight which left me wondering if I had really seen anything at all but I felt compelled to post here incase there are any other similar sightings in the area.
