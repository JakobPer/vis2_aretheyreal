Our dog, Rusty, alerted me that he needed to be taken outside. It was a very clear night with no clouds and a very bright moon. We all were amazed at how bright the moon was and how far you could see and make out things that you normally cannot see at that time of morning. Upon opening the front door, I saw a bright Amber colored light in the Southwestern sky. Our house sits down in a small valley with a steep hill directly in front of the house. At the top of our road, which is approx. 150 yards away,lies the main road with a row of houses and then another very large valley around 1000 yards behind them. From our house looking up toward the main road, I noticed that the object was hovering about 200 or so feet above the valley. The valley consists of heavy woods, a large lake and several houses. A majority of the valley is wooded and is not heavily populated. Upon standing at the front door and watching the object, it continued to hover in the same area now for approx. 8 minutes.  As the object continued to hover, my son Dustin says he is going to go up to the top of our road for a close look. Once up there, he is overwhelmed by the size of the object and notices that it is Cylinder shaped and the color of gun metal(polished nickle). He notices that the object is much closer to the houses on the main road than we had thought. He also notices that the object is silent, no noise at all and the Amber light stretches the entire length of the object. He also notices that the Amber light is a solid light and though it is very bright, it does night emit a beam out in front of it like a flashlight would or headlights do. What happens next is what really scared him the most. The object, now hovering less that 200 yards from the top of our road changes its shape from Cylinder to Sphere right in front of him. He then takes off running back to the house and literally begs me to shut the door and lock it! While watching it from the front porch, his friend and I had also noticed that it changed shape, but, from our view point, I had thought that the object had just turned instead of changing its shape. Now, instead of us being able to see the light span the entire length of the object, we could only see a small part of the light which made me think that it had turned. But, my sons exact words to me was this: ""Dad, it made no noise and was hovering just behind the houses, it changed it's shape from the cylinder to a sphere and the light is now in the center of the sphere"". ""Please dad, shut the door and lock it...Please!""  At this time, I really started writing all of this down because not only had it scared my son, it really made me fear for our safety. His friend at this time had started to cry. I think it was due to just not knowing what it was or feeling threatened. Now, being about 13 minutes the Sphere started to move to the south. We noticed that as it moved to the south, the Amber light now covered the entire object. As it hovered, it slowly began to make a southwestern turn and very slowly began to move away from us. It moved very slowly and the farther it hovered away from us, the smaller the light got. It was completely out of our view/site at appox. 3:36am. We stood on the front porch for several minutes there after and never saw the object again.  As far as our backgrounds, we are your typical family. I, the dad is a 37 year old male and my son is 14 years old and his friend is 14 years old. We have all been skeptics about the very thing that we witnessed Monday morning. While we do not know what it is that we all witnessed, we would like to know exactly what it was. After talking to my son and his friend, they both stated that they wish not to discuss it. I believe that it scared them as much as it upset me.  Overall, the object was about 80ft in length and about 40ft in thickness. It's color was that of polished nickle or at least that it what color it appeared to be under the brightness of the moon. The object had an Amber colored light that spanned the entire length of the object and was positioned in the center. Once it changed it's shape from Cylinder to Sphere, the Sphere was now around 60 to 80 ft in diameter and was completely silent. The Amber colored light was now positioned in the center of the Sphere and totally surrounded the Sphere as it hovered southwest and completely out of our view. It was not seen there after. The entire event lasted approx. 18 minutes. The temp. outside was in the upper 80's and very humid. The moon was very bright and the skies were very clear. A light northern breeze was blowing at the time of the event.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,36.117557352941176,-80.07612941176471

I sensed whatever was behind it wanted us to see it. These lights were large round and very luminous, but it's light seemed as if it was contained behind something opaque, almost like frosted glass but allowing more of the light to shine through without the dazzling radiance I suspect really exists there. The sky that night was very overcast and I could see these lights through a seemingly thinner lower layer of clouds. These lights most likely were two stationary lights on the tail end of some unconventional type of craft as they were equidistant the whole time they travelled. It could possibly be the tail corners of a triangular craft, as I could not see any projection of anything beyond the light's edges. The lights were similar to light fixtures you see against walls or ceilings that are circular, round and protruding out from a flat surface looking like a deep plate/saucer or a bowl. So the lights were not globes or orbs. This left me with the impression of a triangle as I could only see a undefined darkness of some seemingly solid matter inbetween the lights and infront of them and it too was enshrouded in cloud as the round lights were. It did seem to me that the lights were at the back end of something, but that this 'something' was cleverly cloaked!  Another possibility is that they are two separate vehicles of some sort that travel in ""synch"" or equidistantly somehow but that's not the sense I get from it. So my friend and I were exiting the backside of the complex which is facing East, and I was just saying how nice the weather was for the walk ahead, and as we turned the corner of the drive, we were now facing West. I was looking up to see what the sky was doing and out of my peripheral vision a brightness caught my eye. So I turned my head (North)to look directly at it, as it was coming from a point between North and East going toward South and West.The craft moved extremely fast from at least behind this complex to a fair amount of distance in the sky infront of this complex (but still within my view) within second/s. So just before the craft gets to the frontside of this complex, I said to my friend ""Did(or 'do') you see that?"" and they said ""No! See what?"", and so I pointed to it and they stared totally dumbfounded as it was about to disappear from view. It was my friends first U.F.O./craft sighting,it was my third. There was one thing that intrigued me the most about this particular craft sighting and that is just before it disappeared out of view in the Western sky, it's previously very straight and smooth trajectory suddenly at that last split second in sight, turned kind of erratic looking, and almost wobbly! (This part is like a fraction of a second!) It seemed to my eye it veered a bit to the right a little sharply and suddenly, before zig-zagging the rest of the way out of sight! I asked my friend again if they had seen what I had seen and it was affirmative, we both had seen the same thing. I was somewhat surprised as it was not expected, but not shocked as I think my friend was, as it was a more common experience for me.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,,

At first I just thought it was an aircraft due to the fact that there was a large blinking red light, which appeared to be in the center.  As it drew nearer I thought that there were an extremely large number of lights around the blinking red light which was larger than any light I’ve seen on aircraft that I’ve observed flying over. Then I thought, it’s most likely one of those sky crane helicopters that’s been used in our area lately battling the fires that has ravaged the surrounding mountains to the east. The next thing to go through my mind was do they have whisper mode, because there was no sound at all.  All of these thoughts went through my mind at the same time as I tried to rationalize what I was seeing. Then I ran into my house grabbed my camera ran back outside to see the object make a graceful turn to the right at which time I pointed my camera up and took one picture. Thinking I hadn’t captured anything because it was dark I lowered my camera while watching the object head north, still hearing no sound.  I went back inside and told my wife what I had just seen and then I looked at the photo I had taken. To my surprise I had captured a group of twelve lights surrounding the larger red light. Also, due to the fact that it was a longer exposure it had formed trails, with three of the trails making the exact same pattern in the sky, which I noticed after I put it up on my computer.  The other thing that I noticed about the red light is, to me it appears to be closer to the left side as it makes its turn.  I have no idea as to what it was whether it was a group of lights in formation or lights fixed on an aircraft.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,39.3545,-121.765

The remarkable thing about this was that as i watched this high speed light for approx 7-8 sec, it faded away into nothing.  This was a clear night, no clouds, the object was just past its apex flying across my field of vision, and it just went out.

I was in bed when I heard an extremely loud grating engine sound.  It didn't sound like any aircraft I've ever heard before and I actually thought it might be a plane about to crash into my building.  I live in an apartment in an industrial building and have no other neighbors, so as far as I know I am the only witness.   My building faces an open field on the edge of a bay and a marina to the left/north and also another industrial building across the street.  Beyond the bay is an oil refinery of which some of the lights are visible above the roof of the building, those lights are a steady orange.  I got out of bed and went to my window to look when it sounded like it had passed overhead.  All my lights were out so I was able to see fairly decently in the dark and what I saw was a black equilateral triangular aircraft flying overhead going east. The points of the triangle were pointy, not rounded.  If I had to guess at the dimensions, I'd say this would be approximately 40-50 feet long on each side but I confess I am not spacially adept.  I saw a plane flying in the same area heading north the next night and in comparison to this aircraft the plane is  tiny.  I was only able to see the bottom of the aircraft so I have no description of thickness or what the top or sides of it looked like.  I can't estimate very well how high up it was but I might say a few hundred to 1000 feet above my building.  It seemed to be moving more slowly than a normal airplane would be flying.  The aircraft was solid and each point of the triangle had a large white light and the lights appeared to be connected by thick red/peach colored lines.  There were no lights in the center of it and no other lights that I saw. One of the points of the triangle was pointed toward the direction the aircraft was headed.  So, looking at the back end of the aircraft, the light on the right side of it was flashing in a steady rhythm, maybe 1 flash every 2 seconds or so, it was the only light flashing and only in white.  While the other two lights were not lighting up, they were still visible.   After a couple of minutes, the light at the front of the triangle began to flash white just like the other light and the two lights alternated in a steady rhythm.  I watched this fly in a fairly straight path until it was almost to faint to see, I never saw the third light flash. I do live 30 miles from a military base and considered it might be something from them but I don't know what aircraft out there is triangular.  I also live in the flight path of helicopters from our hospital and know this was not a helicopter. I spent some time looking at images online the next day and know this wasn't an Aurora or a stealth plane, nor was it an Osprey based on the pictures I found.  The object was solid and didn't have any wings.  It was literally a flying triangle and extremely loud, unlike any other aircraft I have ever heard or seen before.   I'm extremely curious to know what it was that I saw!",2009-08-27T00:00:00,48.4648,-122.6092

When the object reached its desired altitude it froze as the blue light caught up to it and leveled off, then both lights turned bright white and began twinkling at each other in increments of 3 flashes per side. It was about 700ft above the ground and about 1 mile away from my car. Then the object flew off south bound down the highway and into the distance, quite quickly. I continued south down US 95 and pulled over for some gas, after a quick fill up continued back on the highway and saw the object again; still twinkling its white lights. it had flown about 4 miles from the sight i saw it rise so i concluded it could not be a toy plane or helicopter ,especially going as fast as it ! was and as far from its point of origin. The object zipped along the highway faster than i was driving (about 90mph) giving me ample time to observe it. With out notice the object turned around and began to head north up the highway. At this point i realized that the object was not 2 individual lights but a tube like object with lights on either side. I watched the lights turn from white to blue then back to red.

Dozens of Orbs December 19, 2008,  12:20pm Dade City, Fl  On Friday I was working in my house. I had to make a trip out to my tool shed for some materials. On exiting I looked up into a beautiful blue partly cloudy sky only to see dozens, I would say at least 75 to 100 metallic orbs headed from due east to due west. These orbs were quite easy to see so I had no need to run into the house for my binoculars. Rather than flying in formation they were spread out but in reference to each were fairly close in the group which was quite a many orbs. Following behind broken away from the group was about 15-20 more. I had about a minute to examine these orbs as they went from about 60 degrees East to about 70 degrees West before they either went into or over  clouds . Their size was about the size of a BB held in your hand. They were all the same size and description. Their speed was as if they were on a Sunday drive and there was absolutely no noise. We are in the inbound path for Tampa International Airport and I could not help but notice that there was no action for a good while. There was very little wind and the temp was about 78º. The orbs didn’t reflect very much light, that is to say that my vision was not hampered by glare, each was clearly visible. I was able so see them so well that I could tell that these objects were round orbs gliding smoothly through the skies, not birds, as I said, I could see them clearly. Neither were they planes or ultra-lights or swamp gas. They were a mass of silent running genuine UFO. I shook for about thirty minutes after the sighting and waited for about an hour before calling the report in. I wanted to get my thoughts together.

As the object was traveling west, it kept getting bigger and traveling at a faster pace. The object dived at a fast speed. After it dived we were not able to see it anymore, due to the fact that there were buildings blocking our view.

We both heard what I can only descibe as a huge jet way too close to our house and only getting louder, then for about half a second, silence and then a huge boom that shook our entire house! We thought for sure there was just a massive plane crash very near our house and ran outside. It of course being Washington, it was raining and we couldnt see anything. Within minutes, we heard 3 seperate helicopters coming from different areas. At that point, we were confident that we would definitly be hearing about this in the news the next morning. Morning came and there was nothing. I spent hours online searching for the smallest piece of report that we werent the only ones that heard and felt whatever this was. Nothing in the papers, online or of course on the news. Its as if it never happened. I just want to make very clear, that whatever this was, when it ""crashed"" our house shook like it was an earthquake. We live in Mount Vernon, WA. My husband has seen some strange things in the sky here in the same area before and we saw strange lights a few years ago out towards Deception Pass, we just cant simply think of anything else it could have been.

On Friday the 8th a retired Air Force vet told me of a sighting two 12-year olds who live in his apartment complex had the previous evening. He was able to set up a meeting with them the following Friday. The two witnesses, a boy and a girl, were in the parking lot of the complex at the time. The boy told me that he first noticed the disc to the west, towards the main entrance of the Beaver Creek resort,which is about three quarters of a mile away. The disc appeared dark and oval shaped with flashing white, red, and yellow lights at first. The disc darted quickly to the northeast, then slowed down and moved eastward down the Eagle River valley, passing to the north of the apartment complex. The boy pointed the disc out to the girl witness and they watched it as it fluttered down the valley before ascending into the clouds. At one time they saw an edge view of the craft which looked cigar shaped with the lights appearing along the upper edge. The sighting occurred as it was starting to get dark and there were broken clouds over the area. The witnesses said there was no sound coming from the disc. The kids immediately went and saw the Air Force vet, who is a neighbor of the boy, and told them what they saw. The kids are very creditable and I believe they saw a UFO. When I asked the boy how large the disc appeared in the sky, using his fingers at arms length, he held his fingers about two inches apart, indicating the UFO was quite low. Due to their age we did not do a report with MUFON. The AF vet said the complex has many hispanics, some of whom are illegal, and they are very closed mouth about things. We had two other sightings reported to me that same day along the I-70 corridor in Eagle County, one of which in Edwards was reported to MUFON CMS#16910. The other one occurred in Eagle CO about 21:30 and is reported at this site. I have gotten some local news coverage about the sightings out here in the hope of finding other witnesses to this sighting and the others.

He was sitting on this front porch stoop (facing West) and noticed a silver sparkling object   appearing  to travel  up the side of Peavine mountain.

He indicated he observed this object for about 30 seconds then decided to get his binoculars and camera. He then observed this object going above the top of Peavine in a westerly or north-westerly direction.  He used is Canon digital camera with the 40 power  lens  and took three pictures, only two frames captured the object which  was just a small dot in the totally blue sky background.  He was so excited that he yelled at me to come and see the object which was shimmering in the sky at some distance, I used his binoculars then got my binoculars to observe the shinny and our US Postman also observed the object.

The flight was not consistent with any aircraft I'm familiar with.  It was slow and methodical, and in the distance.  It appeared to be 2000-4000 feet in altitude, approximately as large as a 2 story house, and appeared to change shape either by rotating or turning over somehow.  I also caught about 4 minutes of video tape; of which about 10-15 seconds are pretty compelling that what I saw is simply unexplained.  Here is a brief description of the events:  	At about 7:30 PM on 5/10/09 I had just finished cleaning up from a massive Mother's Day feast that I had prepared.  I stepped outside on my back porch for some fresh air, when I noticed a very small object in the sky.  I first thought it was a high flying plane at 50,000 feet which sometimes fly overhead.  Then I realized that it was overcast, and that I couldn't possibly see that high.  After reasoning about the cloud cover I thought the object to be around 2000-3000 feet high.  Since then I have learned that the cloud cover was at 7000-8000 that night, so the object was definitely under that ceiling.  My initial thoughts of 2000-3000 feet may be correct, but not for certain. Right after I realized that is was moving too slow for a normal aircraft at that altitude so I called for my girlfriend to come and take a look.  She thought it was odd as well, and I asked her to rush to get the video recorder.  We started shooting the object, and was initially very hard to get into focus as our zoom was at 35 xs and was in auto focus mode.  So if we moved just slightly, or caught the top of a tree, or had a bird fly right by it would keep auto focusing and then blur out the object. Once we fiddled through it for a minute or two, we got the hang of it, and were able to capture several distinctly different shapes not visible with the naked eye.  One was a diamond, one looked like a slightly elongated football, and one like a top with some sort of antennae protruding from the top half of the shape.  There was only one object, but was either turning or rotating to create these different shapes.  The video we have is shaky, showing the object to dart around, but in reality it was moving in a straight line, and our zoom at 35 xs and our shaky hand is the cause for the appeared erratic motion of flight. The flight of the object was in the southern sky headed due north.  As it came north, it seemed to drop in altitude.  Then it went 45 degrees NE, and then headed due east.  As it headed east it appeared to ascend. At various times it appeared to have some sort of halo or ring around the entire object; either from air displacement or something else.  It made no noise, and there were other aircraft in the sky that were farther away and closer that were making noise.  The whole event from start to finish lasted roughly 7-10 minutes, and we have roughly 4-5 minutes of video.  There are about 15 seconds of very compelling shots of an object that I've never seen before. I'm about as well versed in Military Aviation as a private citizen can be, as I'm fascinated with the Military Channel, the Discovery Channel, and the History Channel.  This was not a B2, a F117, F22, or an F35.  I have seen all of them on numerous shows, and I can't see how any of the shapes I saw on the video could be one of those aircraft. Lastly, after my story aired on some local news stations here in town, a gentleman contacted me via fax with some sketches he drew after a sighting with him and his girlfriend on June 20th 2007 at approximately at 7:50 PM.  When I saw the fax it was clear that the images were very similar though he didn’t have a video or a picture.  I contacted him and he came to my office to hear my story.  When he showed up, we talked for a bit.  He seamed genuine in nature, and as he was telling me his story, I quickly realized the similarities to my event.  The object seemed to change shape on an axis, there were at times a blur or a ring around the object obscuring the air around the object, that it moved slowly and deliberately across the sky changing altitude, and that it matched no aircraft he had ever seen either in shape or flight characteristics.  He explained that when he called his girlfriend into the room to see the story on TV she immediately said, “That’s it…”  Although he saw most of the object with the naked eye, it was closer to him than for me, as I wouldn’t have been able to decipher the shapes with my naked eye.  Only with the use of my camera with the zoom all the way at 35 xs was I able to clearly see the shape of the object.  In telling me his story, I could see he felt vindicated of sorts, and was very interested in seeing where this went.  He said with almost 99% certainty that we saw the same object... I can send a still picture, and I'm truly writing to see if we can get any type of explanation of what we saw, or if you could shed some light into where we could go for help.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,38.62382493417588,-90.30852769878884

One large blue light, softly blinking on and off, was in the center of the triangle. The object came up over the tree-line at approximately a 45-degree angle, continued in this direction for several seconds, then suddenly reversed its course in a strange motion, like a rotation, and came back down in another 45-degree angle, until it disappeared behind the trees and could no longer be seen.

I witnessed an unusual object in the sky while driving home from work on March 20, 2008 at about 7:50 p.m.  The object was hovering above the tree tops of a wooded area near FM1960 and Moon Trail Dr.  When I first noticed the very large bright white light in the sky,  I was driving east on FM 1960 and was about 2 miles away from it.  I didn't think much of it as I thought it was an airliner on approach to IAH airport with it's bright landing lights on. However, as I continued to approach it, I realized that is wasn't moving, but hovering over the tree tops about two tenths of a mile off of the main road.  Also strange was the fact that despite a fairly clear evening, the object seemed to be shrouded in fog (too low for a cloud) and the large bright light began moving back and forth onto itself--more like a very large spot light.  Couldn't clearly see the object itself, but could see the light moving back and forth through the fog/vapor.  It was very large, 3-5 times the size of the largest airliner. It continued to hover as I passed it, and I turned off of the main road at first chance to get a better look.  The under side was also shrouded in fog that was illuminated by various small white lights with an overall triangular shape. There seemed to be a smaller platform underneath. As I turned my vehicle to try to follow it, it very slowly and silently moved off towards the north, just above the tree tops out of view.  From the back it looked like a dark rectangular object with 3 large white lights across the back. It was too big for a helicopter or an airliner. There were no other aircraft in the sky at that time. FM 1960 is a busy road and I'm sure someone else had to see it, however there are often planes passing through there on approach to IAH.  If you weren't really paying attention you might just assume it was an airliner--except it was hovering.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,30.00528316455696,-95.22023772151898

Clear blue sky with no clouds. This sighting happened to me as nearly as I can recall back about two years ago, during the month of July of 2008. It may have been something like July 15th or so. I was out in my backyard cutting the grass and I sat down to rest a bit on a 3 foot high railroad tie fence at the back of my yard. My back yard has an elevation slope of about 4 degrees which is why I usually need to rest since half of the grass cutting is ""going up hill"". As I looked up to the north, I noticed a white object floating or stationary over the crest of the mountain ridge which, from my back yard is about 1 1/2 miles north of here. I know it's about 1 1/2 miles from here because of the time it takes for the sound to reach me from the annual fireworks displays each year. Although the fireworks originate from an area on the crest of that mountain about a mile west of here, so for the timing of the flash of fireworks to the ""boom"" is about 9 seconds, but since where I saw the ""UFO"" is a shorter distance, so I approximate it to be about 1 1/2 miles (7 to 8 seconds). I put the shape of the object in your form as ""cigar shaped"" although that's not exactly it's correct shape. I'm a former technical illustrator and since I smoke cigars I'm well aware of the fact that cigar shape doesn't exactly describe it perfectly. The upper and lower sides weren't exactly parallel as in most cigars, but slightly convex - very slightly. And each end of the craft was round, not like in most cigars which are round on one end and the lighting end is flat or just cut straight off. But anyway, that's the best I can describe it verbally, but with drawing it I could draw it exactly as it was. The craft was just white, not shiny metallic like an aluminum aircraft.  Also the craft wasn't blindingly emitting a strong source of light, it was just white like a white object.  One thing that I noticed was that there didn't seem to be any shadow on the underside of the craft,  It was just all white. I took about 1 second to adjust my eyeglasses and then when looking back at it, it just wasn't there anymore. Now I'm 74 years old and have been wearing eyeglasses for about 65 years so I'm well aware of whether or not it was a white piece of fluff or object on my eyeglasses.  The craft I saw I clearly focused on. It wasn't an object on my eyeglasses.  I know the difference after 65 years.  I was a member of the USAF for 4 years and also have my Private Pilot's Certificate so am used to viewing object in the sky. So when I looked back to the object after first seeing it  for about 5 seconds it was just wasn't there anymore. My theory as to why it wasn't there anymore is that either:   1 - It zoomed away in that time, or else,  2 - It just became invisible in that time. Incidentally, I know clouds can disappear in only a few seconds, like about  5 seconds at times, but this object disappeared in only one second.  I know that in film clips on TV that clouds seem to disappear in only maybe about 1 second, but that's only in time lapse filming.  This object disappeared in real time in only 1 second. So, there you have it. Every time I go out to cut the grass now, I always keep an eye on the sky here but haven't  seen that object anymore.  I keep looking but so far, no luck.

I asked the passenger to look up while still in the turn and to simply tell me what they saw.  The witness stated ""Oh my god... It's a flying saucer!""

I made a corrective turn passed the course in the opposite direction so I could see it again in another left hand turn.   We reaquired the target and attempted to photograph the object with a cell phone camera, without success.

As it continued to travel, it started getting dimmer and dimmer until it couldn’t be seen.  I wouldn’t say it traveled very fast, and it never got far enough to be parallel with us/over us (though its path wouldn’t have allowed it go over us).  It was a clear enough night that had it been a plane we could have seen something as it continued further.  There was no flashing or sound; the light was white like any other star. There were three guys (counting myself) and two girls.  We were in high school. Nobody had been drinking, or doing any drugs of any sort.  Everybody saw it clearly and agreed that we couldn’t figure out what it was.

This is my first time reporting this, and will probably be my last. I have already spent time trying to find other witnesses or reports, but came up short. Basically, this had to be one of the most incredible UFO sightings in recent time.. I was 12 and it was during summer break.  I spent it at my grandma's house in Highland. I had a friend, Ryan, who lived across the street.  I spent the night at his house.   At around midnight (exact time, date and month unknown) me and Ryan were laying on his front lawn looking up, staring at the beautiful sky, talking about random topics.  Suddenly, and silently, a triangular shaped craft came into view.  A pretty damn big craft.  Our estimate was that it was several times the size of a 747.  It was relatively close to the ground.  It had to have been black because we saw no outline. We were able to see it was triangular in shape because it had many lights underneath.  I describe it as dim, smokey orange, green and yellow lights, with one big white one in the middle. We stood up shouting and screaming in fear and amazement.  Sometime during the event, I told him to go find a camera or video camera.  The craft suddenly shot a beam of white light to the earth (next to the highway on the! area of dead grass) and then retracted.  Then a few seconds later it shown a light seemingly through the top of it into the clouds.  I was watching it as it continued to fly off. My friend returned with his mom and no camera.  I think the craft was already gone because I remember his mom did not get a chance to see it.  We then noticed his neighbor working in his garage, but it seemed he didnt see the craft, and must not have been there during the event.  It was truely incredible.  I wish I had video or photo footage.  I've been fascinated and a believer ever since. ALL I WANT IS SOME KIND OF CONFORMATION THAT THIS EVENT TOOK PLACE.  I WANT TO TALK TO OTHER WITNESSES!!

Less than ten minutes later I sorted the outboard out and pulled the anchor out of the water.  Just as I was doing this I noticed a clump of what I thought were balloons come out from behind some trees at the side of the river just over a mile from where we were.  I soon noticed however that these spheres I was seeing were too big to be balloons and were travelling quite quickly across the sky even though there was barely any wind. The spheres were perfectly sperical but bobbed up and down a little as they crossed over the river which made it hard for me to distinguish whether there were four or five of them.  They also appeared to be metallic and reflected lots of light.  It took them perhaps 10 seconds to cover a quarter of a mile.  I lost sight of them once they dissappeared behind the river bank.

I was able to watch it for about 10 seconds give or take as it fell, and noticed the apparent size of the object from my distance meant it could not have been terribly far away---my best guess being it fell somewhere beyond campus in the fields beyond.  I should note that this was at night of course, and my sense of distance could have been skewed, but that object was pretty bright and appeared large from my viewpoint. My first impression was it could have been a lone stray firework, but as I studied it, my impression was that of a fireball.  As the object fell, I saw the clouds off in the distance reflect the red light as the red/green ""fireball"" fell past them.

I was hitchiking to Mineral Wells Texas from Goree Texas.  It was very late approx 1 AM.  I was on a farm market road.  There was no traffic.  I was walking along and looked up and saw a airplane I could hear.  I saw a very bright light flying beside the plane, the plane was a comercial plane.  I watched it a minute or so and looked back where I was walking.   A few secound later I look back up and it is flying behind the plane.  I looked back down and then back up and it was flying beside it again. The hair on my neck stood up.  I was honestly scared.  I saw a house about 3-4 hundred yards off the highway with lights on.   I decided to go to it to see if I might use the phone to call my recruiter to come and pick me up.  I had to go over 4 bobwire fences to get to the house.  I knocked on the door and a very harsh voice asked who is it.  I asked to use the phone.  He yelled out you better get out of here before I shoot you.  I didn't waist any time leaving. I crossed over 2 of the fences in a run and as I was going over the third fence I heard shots and heard pellets landing all around me.  From there I cannot tell you anything.   The next thing I remember is being in my recruiters car and pulling into his driveway.  I cannot tell you how I got in his car, how I contacted him to get him to pick me up in his car.  I cannot tell you going over the forth fence or getting on the highway.   When we were pulling up in his driveway it was just starting to get light outside.  So I am missing 4-5 hours that I cannot account for.  I contacted MUFON but they seem to be a joke.  Talked to a man over Skype, can't remenber his name,seen him as we talked.  I told him my story and this thing I have in my body.  It's a tiny spot like a ball.   They told me they were putting together a bus with Xray equipment and would come and Xray this spot and see if it might be a implant.  I told him I can show him lights in the sky every clear night that I cannot explain.   I promise you they are not of this earth.  You can't just look up and see them, there is a way to do it to be able to spot them.   These lights do very strange things that aircraft doesn't do.  Like dog fighting,getting extreamly bright and then just vanishing.  Sorry but I don't think planes do that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I have seen UFO's off and on all my life.  My father even talk's about seeing a cigar shaped UFO while fixing a roof for my grandparents when I was 3 years old.  He saw me on the front lawn when there was a bright light.  My father and his twin brother saw the craft and the light.  I dissapeared for 4 day's then just showed up on my grandparents front lawn with no explimation.  This was in Chesterfield, UT, June 1960. Then March 1973, my ex-husband and I were driving from Tucson AZ to Salt Lake City.  I was driving and he was sleeping in the back seat.  I remember pulling out of Flagstaff AZ and watching the light behind me turn red.  Next thing I remember is being in Park City Utah. I don't know how much time had passed because we did not have a clock or watch with us.  No gas had been used and my exhusband was bleeding out of his nose. I for whatever reason was bleeding from my virgina as if on my period.  The bleeding quit almost immidiatly. Five years later I was almost 5 months pregent when I suddenly found myself in the bathroom with blood all over and no longer with child.  I did not go to the doctor for fear of being told I was crazy.  However I do remember holding a little boy that was moving and his head was too big and his neck was extra long.  Why I would remember that I don't know. I do know that my exhusband was very upset when at the next appointment when the doctor said that I had miscarried.  I have had a history of losing babies.  While I have four children I have had 4 miscarraiges or what the doctor indicated was a misscariage. Each time I was almost 5 months along and then no longer with child. No memmory of losing the baby.  In one case twins. No known reason until recently.  They tell me I have Protine S Diffency with clogaophthy.  And some other unknown genitic disroder they do not understand.  They see it the blood however have no idia what it is.  It is killing me.  Why no one understands. Normally the craft is extreamly large when I do see them.  When they do apear they are large enough for occupation and are disc shaped.  The one time I saw more than one UFO the disk was chasing a craft that looked like a cigar.  There was also a boomarange type craft almost acting like a wing man to the disk shaped craft.  There seemed to be artilary being used because I saw what seemed to be a direct hit to the cigar shaped craft.  They all just winked out.  This incident happen while I lived in Amhurst OH in the summer of 1974. Many times in Tucson AZ we have UFO activity when the Airforce will send aircraft afther the objects.  This happens at least once a year.  We have even been listening to the radio outside and heard reports about a possible UFO then nothing.  I have even been speaking on the phone with my sister when I've seen the UFO and then all sort's of aircraft from the base chasing the UFO right over my house. In May of 2000 I saw a strange craft above the apartment building I was living at and even had a wittness.  A man that also lived there.  He moved the next day without a word. The craft looked to be the size of a 50 gallon drum.  It just floated there.  No sound. No lights. Now the crafts are extreamly small.  No larger than my finger nail.  The 1st time I saw one that small was in Salt Lake City, Utah when I went for a funerl in March of 2008.  Then in July 4th, 2009 in Phoenix AZ.  June 29, 2010 in Tucson, AZ I saw it again. I've seen it six times sense then. I am very delighted yet concerned.  Each time this happens seems to be when a storm is comming about or just ended.  There will be small flashes from the object of different colors.  They hang around for about 10 to 15 minutes.  If I go into the house they come right up to the patio door and stay there. The one this morning it was clear weather when I took my little grandaughter outside to play in the backyard. One of the miniture UFO's actually landed on my little grandaughter.  She is 21 months old.  When I tried to grab it my hand went right through it.  I picked her up and brought her in the house.  The craft just hovered at the door.  Why if my hand went through the thing does it stay outside.  I do not want my grandaughter involved with this for any reason.  Yet it seems that I have no choice.  Is there any other reports of these miniture UFO's? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

While driving East on route 55, just west of where it intersects with the Taconic State Parkway, my wife and I saw what seemed to be a commercial airliner in a completely vertical position, only a few hundred feet off the ground, and heading towards the ground so quickly that both of us fully expected to see or hear an explosion.  When it disappeared behind the tree line, it seemed to us to be maybe a half mile away, and we sped up to what we thought would be the scene of a crash site. Of course, there was no crash, and we tuned in a local radio station to see if there had been an airplane crash in the area.  There was none. This area is across the Hudson River from Stewart Air base, now a commercial airport, and we are both very used to seeing fairly low commercial and military planes, including the huge C-5 Galaxy military transport planes. We only saw the lights for at best 3 seconds, and other than the fact that there were several colored lights which seemed to be along the fuselage of what we thought was the plane (which is unusual) the only thing we could reasonably come up with was that it was a large commercial jet.  Both of us agree there were white, green, and red lights. I’m reporting this because it isn’t possible for a plane of that size to be going that fast in a vertical position straight down, that close to the ground, and not crash.  Neither of us can explain how that would be possible, so we’ve questioned if what we saw was a plane.   This is not the only time I've reported a sighting to your website, but this is certainly the shortest sighting, and yet still very strange.

To NUFORC,  I wish to report a UFO sighting that I saw tonight , 17/7/09 , at approximately 8.30p.m. Australian eastern standard time.  My partner and I were seeing off friends in our back yard and while looking looking into the sky towards the south I noticed a slow moving bright orange object moving from the south-west towards true south . We are located at Launceston, Tasmania and the object was initially travelling from south-west towards south-east and then seemed to turn right heading south and also climbing away.  My partner suggested it was an aircraft but I was sure it wasn’t as there were no red or green flashing navigation lights and I also believed it was not in a viable flight path area as it would have created a problem for normal Launceston airport air traffic . Launceston airport is south of the city of Launceston and the position of this object was at high altitude but seemingly directly above the airport . The object being at a high altitude was of only the size of a star but distinctly bright orange in color . There was scattered cloud and as the object climbed away the intensity of brightness began to vary until eventually we could not see it . I would like to say that I am an astronomy enthusiast and often gaze at the night sky whilst having a cigarette in our back yard and try to identify sky objects such as planets and various stars and sometimes see sattelites . I am certain I have not mistaken this object for a normal aircraft and while I would be thrilled at the prospect of proof of alien visitors buzzing around our world in spaceships , I would never generate a hoax or false claim of this nature . I was going to run inside to grab my digital camera but I realised that the object was going to be out of view within seconds and at best a photo would have only shown a faint , starlike object .

I did not bother at first, thinking that it was a plane. But two minutes later, the same object showed up at a different place in the sky. The light emitted from the sphere was very, very bright. It looked like a very bright fire orb. It was also acting like fire (light intensity going high and low). From this point, this had taken my curiosity. Being a UFO enthousiast myself, I needed to record evidence.  I've seen exactly the same objects 2 times in my life, years ago. 2 minutes later, my DSLR camera was set on the tripod in front of the patio door, ready to take long exposure pictures of the object. The lens used was a Canon 75-300mm at full zoom. From 21h45 to 23h45/midnight, sightings occured every 4 or 5 minutes.  I've managed to take many pictures and even recorded a simple video of one of the objects with a point and shoot camera. At one point, 4 objects showed up at the same time, all were going in the same direction (east).  They disappeared with no  particular order. Saturday July 18th - 21h50 to midnight Exactly the same thing as Friday 17th. Repeated sightings of the same objects. On Monday, I bought a VHS camera in order to record footage of the UFOs if they reappear one day. Unfortunately, nothing showed up since. Not planes - Objects were stationary and they could move back and forth Not helicopters - I saw an helicopter passing by and it did not left the same trail as the UFOs. Plus, the helicopters had blinking lights and the helicopter didn't. The light was so bright, could not be an helicopter. Not fireflies : the objects could hide behind the Frontenac Castle. I'd also like to add that I posted this report on a car enthousiast message board and a guy saw the same thing from the north shore of the city at the same time.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

What’s that up in the sky?” so my friends and I turned around and saw a flying object in the distance. It must have been about 3 or 4 miles away. But it was a very clear night with no clouds and you could se stars. But it was definitely not a star. What we say was a round, spinning object zipping throughout the sky.  It had neon coloring and the lights would switch colors. It started with neon blue, then it turned into neon green, then a bright white light and then it went dark. We were kind of confused and it lighted back up and was a deep red color. When it was the red color, it was flashing. It went out again and then it started doing the color cycle again. there was a ring around the object and thats where the lights were going around. in the middle, it was pitch black.It was then out of our point of view because of houses and some trees. We came home, and my sister looked out her window just to see if it would pop up again, and soon after it did come up and then it disappeared. That was the last of it. When we were coming home from the pool, we had some weird power outage types of things. The lights were going out on our street and when we got home, the lights in our living room were being kind of funky and were going on and off and like flickering.

The events are as follows:  On the evening of July 17, 2009 - at approximately ten minutes after 10:00 PM, I was sitting on my front porch having a cigarette. I am in my 40s and reside with my immediate family and my older sister's immediate family. My older sister suddenly came out of the house talking on her cell phone to my (male relative), who was telling her about what he was seeing while on route to my residence. I heard her exclaim something to the effect; ""FIREBALLS?! - What do mean Fireballs? - What, they're in the sky?!"". She continued discussing it over the phone and then the call ended and she walked back into the house. A short time later my (male relative) pulled up in his car and got out - and we began to talk about what he had seen. According to him - he was on the corner intersections of S. Main St., And Oxford State Road across from the Mcdonalds restaurant when he noticed people watching three objects in the dark night time sky. He described the objects as ""little black balls with greenish white fire like jet exhaust that wrapped around each of them"" , and that the jet exhaust would ""blast out"" - and then ""suck right back into them"". He said that he observed one of them drop from the formation of the three - nearly to ground level, and the rise right back up and return to formation (it did this only once according to him). I asked him if he had gotten a cell phone picture of this - and he replied that he had, but it ""didn't turn out"" so he deleted it. He described the objects as large and bright. He went into the house - and I remained on the porch, and a short time later my neighbors returned home across the street. There were two cars of people - and one was a car full of kids (assuming his kids and their friends / relatives?). They got out of the car and were screaming about what THEY had seen as well. I yelled at them that my (male relative) had also just seen the very same thing - and I walked across the street to discuss it with them. They showed me a cell phone picture of a formation of three identical, ethereal looking boomering shaped lights (not lights in a boomerang formation - but each light was shaped like a boomerang or more accurately a chevron - like a wide letter ""v"". I asked them if they were green and they said ""No - they were more whitish looking"". They also revealed a detail that my (male relative) did not reveal, and that was that these objects were trailed by - or dropped from - a larger object or other objects behind them and just behind, or beneath the low cloud cover.These other - or this other object they described as three red lights in a ""smiley face"" type of configuration. They described it - and the other objects as being big. Both they - and my (male relative) confirmed that the original objects were lost from sight when they eventually dropped to ground level. And - both parties relayed to me that the objects first initially appeared ""out of nowhere"" to begin with. Inquiries to the Middletown Police department should be made - as well as inquiries to discover other potential witnesses as well - as the objects were apparantly noticed by multiple parties in the area, and were quite obvious. Although I wish to remain anonymous - a graphic of the photo - and a map of the area will be submitted to you momentarily.

After watching this for around 30 mintues or so, we then saw another light going in the direction of the object we had been observing. this I easily identified as an airplane, (due to the flashing red lights) however, when the plane got somewhat close in the direction of the object, we then saw the object take off at a REDICULOUS speed and a weird angle almost arching upward towards the sky. .we watched as the object got smaller and smaller until we could no longer see it.

They were brighter than any light on a plane and were static with no blinking what so ever. The objects were spherical and unlike a plane or helicopter of any kind. The way and direction they were traveling was very odd. They were all moving horizontally at very slow speed, in what appeared to be an organized formation. They were in two groups. A group of 3 led and a group of 5. After watching these crafts for a couple of minutes, they seemed to individually break formation and start moving higher up and away from us. The once extremely bright spheres began to slowly fade away right before our eyes until it they completely gone!  There were no clouds in the sky at the time and no obstruction of our view.

The weather was perfect. I was enjoying the day, seated in the patio, working with my PC.   Then I heard and saw a green helicopter flying low and I tried to photograph it, but couldn't because because I had to adjust the zoom and could nto be fast enough, so I kept taking photos of the sky, towards the mountains and freeway 118, farther away.  Later upon examining all the photos in my PC, I saw the object that looks like a saucer, shiny surface and all. (This is a crop of the original, zoomed-in photo.)   Later in the afternoon, I heard another chopper, went out, and there was the same green one.  I tried again, but it was too low to focus and I had my camera in zoom to take photos of distant objects, so I could not catch it.  Again, I continued to take pictures of the sky at random.  I waved goodbye to the green chopper as it went behind the trees and out of sight. The photos in the afternoon pictures look like triangular objects, I am sure these cannot be birds at a distance; they would have to be gigantic to photograph this way.

I would say it was like large sausage shaped lights entwined into each other it was a sunny day and my hallway is dark it came from my bathroom, I would not say it floated it seemed to have a motion like the sausage lights were moving within the shape of a rounded off cube.  There were no hard edges and the lights within the shape moved as it was going from one room to the next. At first thought I thought it was bluish lights on some of these sausage shapes and some were perfectly white.  Luminescent.  It seemed to hover for a second and I had a strange feeling it was intelligent. I know that people are starting to think I am crazy.  That is okay by me.  I just know that someone out there has seen something like this. I have also had some crazy stuff happening at home.  Something said something in my ear while I was lying down.   My dog who was beside me heard it and started to bark like there was someone in the room.  It was loud and I could feel it down my ear canal.  I have been researching to see if someone had died in this house but I have come up with no explanation. I think all this started to happen in the last few years when I saw a round object in the day sky go over my backyard. It had a military plane a few hundred feet above it. My husband was in the living room with me when I watched the handle on my sun porch move and the door opened.  He heard the handle and went over to check it.  No explanation for that either.

It was last year when I saw this unidentified flying object. I didn't knew where to report it then.  However, I'm reporting it now because I saw an article in my local newspaper today regarding a UFO sighting in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, so I decided to search for a place to report my sighting. This is not a joke.  It was around May or June last year.  I was waiting for my girlfriend in my car at a petrol station directly opposite her house which was location opposite the Malaysia National Zoo. It was a sunny afternoon.  The time was approximately between 1300 to 1400 hours.  I was looking into the sky because I have a habit of gazing at cloud formations. It was then I noticed a golden sphere object in the air, the color was somewhat rough like sandpaper, perhaps matted. I thought I was seeing things, so just to confirm it, I got out of my car and took a good look at it again.  It was still there hovering about the clouds as though it was trying to use the sun's glare to cover it's existence. The UFO was hovering approximately 10-12 Kilometers above ground level.  I'm not quite good with measurements but it's about the altitude of a flying airplane. After 2 to 3 minutes, the UFO started to gain altitude till it disappeared amongst the clouds.  Not sure if it went into space or what, but it certainly doesn't look like a mirage. I can't see any proper means of propulsion on the unidentified flying object but it was definitely spherical.  Hope this report helps out the research on UFO.  This was definitely my first sighting. None of the Characteristics check-boxes below fits the description.  The UFO is just as I described it, no lights or anything, it just seems that the gold surface of the UFO reflects the light from the sun. This is the latitude an longitude according to my search on Google Maps: 3.207056,101.755012.   Hope it helps. I am contactable through my email: ((e-address deleted)).",2010-07-28T00:00:00,,

This report is to document a sighting of an unidentifiable object in the sky that was witnessed by myself.   I have a part time job delivering the AnnArbor.com newspaper on Thursday and Sunday Mornings.  I typically start delivering my papers at around 2:00 am.  I have ~150 customers and I have a very set routine of delivering my route.   On the Morning of July 22, 2010, at exactly 2:40am (I just remembered that I called my wife when this event happened and I verified the time when I called her).  I called my wife at 2:42 am and told her about what I saw and that I was coming home because I was too freaked out to continue delivering my papers. There is a street called Louis Lane in Hamburg, MI.  It is a residential street in a generally rural area and the street is probably ½ to ¾ mile long and is in the shape of a horseshoe.  The street is along the north side of the main road (Strawberry Lake Road).  Imagine breaking the horseshoe shaped street into two parts, the eastern half of the street and the western half of the street.  I always begin delivering papers on this street on the eastern portion of the horseshoe and am facing north when I pull into this street.   I pulled into a customer’s driveway, threw the paper up by the garage, and reversed out of the driveway to continue on my way.  When I began to proceed, I saw a flash of blueish light (like lightning) along the northern horizon.   I looked out my windshield to see if a storm was maybe on its way, but it was one of the clearest nights this summer.  However, at that moment a second flash was closer and brighter and my NPR radio station cut to static for may! be 5 seconds.   This was really creepy, but I continued on my way.  At this point I was rounding the top of the Horseshoe and was facing west, I looked out my driver side window which was facing to the south and that is when I saw what really made me think about it being a ""U.F.O.""   The object that I witnessed was about 20 degrees off of the southern horizon, just above a line of trees.   The object was less than 100’ in the air, it was glowing electric blue in color, it was approximately the size of a quarter and was definitely close, I’d say within a ¼ mile distance.  The object moved westward while it descended behind the trees and appeared to land. As I watched the object disappear behind the trees, I continued to drive slowly and was now facing south and was now on the western portion of Louis Lane.  I put my car in park and turned off my lights and continued to look south towards where I saw the object disappear.  I stayed for maybe a minute and witnessed some intermittent blue colored flashing coming from the direction of the object.   I called my wife at exactly 2:42 am and told her what I just saw.  I told her that I didn’t want to finish my route at night and was going to wait until day to finish.  I was pretty scared, so I got out of the neighborhood, and drove east at 75 mph down Strawberry Lake Road, until I got into town. I stopped at the Hamburg Township Police department and seriously considered walking in to report what I saw, but I didn’t.  In Hamburg, MI, there is a 24-hour ((deleted)) gas station that I always stop at before I start my route.  I always ((speak)) with the guy who works midnights, his name is ((name deleted)).   On my way back home, I stopped to tell ((name deleted)) what I saw.  ((name deleted)) was in some disbelief, but he said that it was kind of strange because there was a very brief loss of electricity at the gas station at around the same time that I told him what I saw.   ((name deleted)) said that it could be the Police helicopters, because they look for people growing marijuana at night.  I expressed that I didn’t think it was a helicopter, because the whole thing was glowing electric blue.   I then drove the 10 miles back to my house, eventually went to sleep and finished delivering my papers when it was light outside. I am a ((deleted)) student and attend ((deleted)) school in Ann Arbor, MI.  I told a few students what had happened earlier that morning, and two of my classmates, said that they were up late and also experienced the brief power outage at around the same time.  However, these guys live in the city of Ann Arbor, and I was nearly 15 miles north of the City of Ann Arbor when this happened. The event that I witnessed was very brief and I left before I could see anything else happen.  Just thinking about this event still makes my skin crawl.  I used to prefer delivering my papers when its dark, but I seriously don’t think I’m ever going to start my route until the sun comes up. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be sober-minded and credible.  We also received a telephone call from a woman in Harper Woods (Detroit) about what sounds to be the same event, but we have not received a follow-up written report from her.

TITLE:  Bull Mutilated in Burr Oak Pasture   The Jewell County Sheriff’s Department has received a report of a bull being killed and mutilated in a pasture north of Burr Oak.  Owners of the bull are Bill and Linda Wilson, Burr Oak.  The bull was found by the Wilsons on Sunday. When the bull was found the animal’s ears, eyes and tongue were among the body parts apparently removed.  Blood was not found around or on the carcass.  The carcass was examined by a veterinarian and a full investigation begun.  The killing may have been part of a cult related ritual, but this has not been proven. The sheriff’s department learned two days prior to this incident in Jewell County a similar incident was reported near Colorado Springs. The Wilson’s bull was in a gated pasture with other cows and calves but none of the animals were killed.  The pasture is located in Walnut Township, about one-half mile west of the Union Cemetery.

Superior Nebraska Express Newspaper Article Dated December 31, 2009: ((BEGIN TEXT OF ARTICLE)) Another dead bull found; appears to have been mutilated   Another bull which may have been killed and mutilated has been found in Jewell County.   A few weeks ago a similar incident was reported to the Jewell County Sheriff’s office. According to Sheriff Dave Fullerton, the cause of the recent bull’s death has not been determined.  The animal was found and reported to the sheriff’s office last Tuesday by Jim Harris.  The bull was owned by Mike Harris but running in Jim Harris’ pasture.  It was found in a remote low area of a pasture located on 140 Road about one-third mile north of V Road. The bull was last seen by Jim Harris the prior Thursday afternoon so the time of death has been placed between that afternoon and its discovery the following Tuesday. According to Fullerton, the bull had one ear and other body parts cut off.  Since the bull was  lying on its right side, the sheriff could not see if the other ear of the right eye had been cut.  He observed, ""There was blood around the eye, on the left side and indications that it was partly cut, in an attempt to remove it as had been done in the other bull mutilation.""  Fullerton said the person or person’s responsible, did not finish cutting out the tongue, eye or eyes, as had been done in the other mutilation.  He noted, ""Something may have interrupted whoever is responsible and caused them to leave the scene before they completed the act."" Fullerton checked for tracks in the snow but could only find cow tracks. The bull thought to be mutilated a month ago was found in a pasture north of Burr Oak.  That animal belonged to William Wilson, Burr Oak.  Both bulls were black in color. Fullerton and the Jewell County Crime Stoppers ask if anyone has information as to who may have done this to call the Jewell County Crime Stoppers"" ((END TEXT OF ARTICLE)) (NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the young woman in Columbus, NE, who took the time to locate, retype, and submit this report.

Our west window had a perfect view of the fireworks that were launched over the lake.  After the ""grand finale"" at about 10:40, I got up to put the dog outside one last time for the night, and went our our back door.   I looked up towards the western sky and saw several pairs of bright orange lights moving from the WSW horizon (roughly the ""8:00"" position) in a NNE direction.  The lights were each at least as bright as Venus, which was still visible in the western sky at that time.  They just immediately struck me as very odd due to the orange color -- had they been the traditional white/yellow light of airplanes, I would have just assumed it was a group of planes traveling together in some sort of formation. I immediately called out to my mother ""Quick, look out the west window, there are UFO's in the sky"" -- only half jokingly, because the lights were just so wierd.  At the very same time, my mother was calling out to me ""What are those lights?""  They struck her as very odd, too, her comment was ""are we being invaded?""  I went outside to get a better look.  Over the next roughly 10 minutes, there were probably a total of 8 to 9 pairs of these orange lights, traveling from the 8:00 position on the western horizon to the area of the Big Dipper constellation, which was in the northwestern sky perhaps 3/4ths of the way up from the horizon.  The lights appeared on the horizon generally about every 60 to 90 seconds, and at most times there were probably 2 sets of them visible in the sky.  It took each pair of lights perhaps one and a half to two minutes to move that distance -- they appeared to be rather slow-moving. When the lights got quite high in the sky, most of the way towards the region of the Big Dipper, the lights dimmed and then finally went out entirely and the objects were no longer visible. At perhaps 10:50, about 10 minutes after the first objects appeared, there were no more to be seen, and I thought they were gone. After about 5 minutes, another 3 or 4 pairs of objects appeared following the exact same trajectory.  The last of these disappeared and I waited another 2 or 3 minutes and went inside -- I noted it was 11:03 pm when I came inside at that point. I have no idea how high or how far away these objects were.  When the lights first appeared, I should also note that I could see at least 3 planes in the sky in the same general region of the sky as these lights.  One of the planes was very low, with a single white light and moving from SE to NW, possibly to make an approach to Oakland Pontiac International Airport about 3 or 4 miles to the nother.  The other two planes were probably commercial passenger jets -- higher up, and flashing white, red, and green lights, one traveling from the NW to the SE, the other very high and traveling almost due west to due east. The unknown orange objects may have been low enough to be at the altitudes that small private planes fly at, or, for all I know, they may have been in orbit.  I should note that it was a very clear night, and even at that late hour there was still a glow of twilight on the western horizon, so it's possible, I guess, that if these were objects in orbit the light may have been the last rays of the sunlight bouncing off the objects.  I have seen the space shuttle in the International Space Station before, and those actually move in a similar manner to these unknown objects, but on those, when I saw them, the light was a very yellow light similar to Venus, not orange.  So, still kind of odd in my opinion. I couldn't detect any noise from the objects, but as I said, I have no idea how far away from them I was, and also, it was a very noisy night, with a lot of fireworks and firecrackers still going off, and a noisy party somewhere a street or two over with rock music playing on a p.a. system and people laughging and hollering. I find it hard to believe that a lot of people would not have seen these objects.  Since it was Saturday July 3rd, a great number of people were having parties and get-togethers, and it was a perfect, warm, clear, beautiful evening, and there was a lot of activity in the area, a lot of cars on the road, and so forth.  Since over 1.2 million people live in Oakland County, Michigan, I find it really hard to believe that a lot of people wouldn't have seen these lights, and I find it even harder to believe that they wouldn't have struck others as odd, too. I truly don't have a clue what these objects may have been -- some kind of squadron of old planes or ultralites traveling to an air show?  Military planes?  Had the lights been white/yellow, I would have thought so. I did ask my brother-in-law, who was a cargo pilot in the airforce during the Vietnam era, and who still is a private pilot, and he stated that planes would only have white/yellow lights, plus the blinking red and green wing lights on larger planes, but I suppose even he could be wrong.  Satelites?  Any that I've seen reflecting the sunlight were a more white/yellow light as well.  So, what they were, I truly don't know.  I just know I haven't seen anything that color before moving like a plane moves, and definitely not in pairs and groups.  I carefully watched the local news that night and for the next few days, checked the local papers, and looked online, because I thought this might be a newsworthy event, or at least someone might offer an explanation of these lights.  Since then, I've done a lot of searching online, and I haven't found any references to this event.  It still baffles me because the lights were just such an odd color of orange, so unlike any aircraft I've seen.",2010-07-28T00:00:00,42.56757908163265,-83.38085408163265

About seven minutes later, we heard a very faint noise above us and saw the ""strobe"" light again as we were still walking towards the boardwalk.  From what I recall, the light was white-colored (it was sort of like what a helicopter beam light looks like when they're searching for someone).  The beam of light went over us and we all saw it touch the sidewalk.  After this the ufo or whatever it was started to take off slowly then reached a faster speed as it flew off into the distance. Keep in mind that all of us were completely sober when we saw this.  Also, when we looked up we couldn't really see what color the actual flying object was, but it had a green square colored light on the bottom of it.  Behind the green square of light was the weird white-ish strobe light thing that would actually reach down and hit the sidewalk.

Around 9:08 pm or so on Saturday July 10, 2010, I was driving North on Congress Avenue and was about 1/2 mile from 10th Avenue when I saw an orange glowing ball or balloon shape above the tree line due west in direction (I was looking left out my driver's side window).  The planet Venus was at an angle of 35 degrees in the horizon due West and the object was about 25 degrees angle from the horizon slightly to the north of Venus.   The glow was the same color as the Space Shuttle when it launches at night (I've seen about 5 night launches before).  The glow looked like a thin ring on the outside with a solid glowing circle at the inside bottom of the ring.  The object hovered or moved very slowly northwesterly for about 7-8 seconds.  Then it rapidly accelerated and in a perfectly straight line toward the Northwest disappeared past the horizon in about 2 seconds looking more like a small star as it disappeared.   I see planes fly over all the time from Palm Beach International Airport and this object was moving about 50-100 times faster when it disappeared.

It was traveling at the speed of a plane, and as it approached..  my younger son and I saw something behind the glow...  almost like a parachute shape, but translucent looking.  My son said it looked like  a glare on something behind the light.  But then that shape went away, and all we saw was a red fireball.  By this point, it looked like a plane on fire.  My older son called for my sister to come outside.   We stood in shock.. it looked like a plane in flight that was in flames.  We were scared because we thought it was a plane on fire and we were just waiting for it to fall... and my mind was thinking, ""How can a plane st! ill fly if it's on fire?""... but it continued on in the distance until it could no longer be seen.  Once it was gone, we realized that it could not have been a plane because there was no noise, but it was moving in the direction that we had seen planes coming from earlier.

This was also witnessed by my wife and our two sons, and also my friend and his wife (and perhaps his two kids).   We first saw the objects while driving home in our cars from a fireworks event in town.  We were in two separate cars but close to each other.  We were about 1.5 miles away from where the fireworks were when we saw about 5-6 objects low in the sky.  We first saw the objects travelling down Landry Avenue, toward Kelly Boulevard (in North Attleboro), in the vicinity of the Joseph Martin Elementary school.  They appeared to be travelling north to south (or slightly northwest to southeast).   My wife first saw them, as I was driving the car.  I looked over and my initial thought was that whatever they were, it was definitely strange (particularly the brightness and the slow movement of them).  I thought it was a constellation for a split second, but then quickly realized they were too low and too bright to be a constellation.  Again, they were very low in the sky and much brighter than any night star or planet that I’ve ever seen. (I should mention that we had a weather cold front move through earlier in the late afternoon that day with heavy rain, so there was still a heavy overcast, although the town fireworks went off as planned.  The cloud ceiling was high enough that the fireworks were visible; no issues there.  There was no rain at the time of this sighting). We proceeded to drive to my house, which was just around the corner.  My friend and his wife were heading to their house, which was some 30 minutes drive away (Northborough, MA).  As I got out of my car, 3 of the objects were almost directly overhead.  My guess is that they were several hundred feet up in the sky, to maybe a thousand feet.  They were all uniformly reddish/orangish and appeared to ""shimmer"" slightly.  They had the shape of a small dome, and they were fairly large (you didn’t have to strain to see them).  They were definitely larger than anything in the sky and symmetrical as best I could tell.  My wife and my two boys witnessed the same thing.  I called my friend on his cell phone and asked if he saw them, and he said he had, and thought they looked really strange.  He was puzzled too.  2 of the 3 objects were very close to each other at one point, with the 3rd one straggling behind.  At one point, the 3rd one seemed to increase its velocity slightly, moving sideways, toward where the other two were.   What I thought was really unique is that they made absolutely no sound.  They kind of hovered, then moved slightly.  I watched them for only about a minute, and then they disappeared into the overcast above. I called the local police and they said they didn’t receive any calls; same for the local newspaper, nothing.   North Attleboro is a town of about 30,000 or so, so we’re not a rural area; others should also have seen this (particularly with fireworks having just ended and a lot of cars on the road).  Landry Avenue is a main route that took people away from the fireworks, which many people viewed at the High School, also on Landry Avenue. I also sent an email to several friends that are in my section of town to ask them if they saw anything; I haven’t received responses back yet, as of this morning.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,41.96598279569893,-71.32585268817203

The plane, even though still low from departing off from Newark, flew much higher than this UFO.  The only sound I heard was that of the plane accelerating.

I saw a bright white light coming towards me way above in the clear sky.  As  it came closer,it got brighter.  My family was home, but I was so shocked that I couldn't speak.  There  was no noise from the craft-there is always a noise from planes and helicopters,not this time.  As it got closer over  head..I saw a half shaped small craft..with a white light in front and 6-7 small red lights in back of it.  I was thrilled,yet amazed at the same time.   I never thought I'd live to see the day when I saw a UFO!!!   After it went over the back of the building,I ran to the front of our condo and it didnt appear,the craft had disappeared !  I went to my mom and sister and told them..they were mad that I hadnt told them when I saw it because they wanted to see it too.By the way,I don't drink or do drugs.All my! senses were in tact. I said to them that maybe it was one of those unmanned drones that Los Angeles has over southern California to patrol it..then we thought about it and said no. Then I looked online that night to see if anyone else saw it or if it was reported on the tv news.Nothing was reported.So..I've told my story on some UFO websites now.Some people had similiar stories around the same time.The crazy thing is I only remember it happened at night  and on the first week of January 2010.I cant remember what date it was.Its like I'm still in shock.My family cant remember when I told them..though my sister thought I saw it New Years Eve.I dont think so. When I told my other sister I saw a UFO..she shared her own UFO story that happened to her years ago. Its like she was afraid to tell anyone because they might think shes crazy.

To start my report, I would like to say, that I do not believe in UFOS (I mean the extra-terrestial ones that is).  I believe that what is up in the sky, and I can’t identify, I call it a UFO.  And that is what happened about 10 months ago (It could be a year ago) .  Why report it now?  Well, I was just watching a program on TV tonight about UFOS and it brought to mind the day, about 10 months to a year ago that I saw one. It so happens that it was about 6:20 to 6:40 p.m. and I was in my back yard cleaning my lawn equipment.  When I finished cleaning, I raised my arms to stretch and between two trees that are  about 25 feet tall and spaced from one another about 15 feet, in that small space (I was about 20 feet away from the trees),  and for about 5 second or less, I saw what appeared to be an extra-large black Jet Engine moving (by itself) from Canovanas to Rio Grande to Luquillo.  I know what a Jet Engine looks like because I worked in the Airport and that is what it looked like.  It was flying alone!  The ""extra-large black Jet Engine"" that I saw was about 500 to 800 feet up in the air and about 800 feet (could be a little bit more) away from where I was standing.   I saw it so clearly, that I could see orange, light yellow and blue streaks of a thin flame streaming from the front to the back of the engine.   From the distance that I was standing I would say that it was probably moving at about 100 or more miles per hour.  If I were to figure out it’s size from the distance and height that I saw it, I would say that it was probably about 8 to 10 feet high and 10 to 12 feet long.  I may be wrong, not sure.  I did not hear any sound. I proceeded to tell my wife about it and I called my daughter, who lived in Luquillo to her cell phone, but she told me she was in San Juan, but that she had not seen anything strange and told me to call the radio stations to verify if some else had seen anything.  I did not call the radio stations.  My wife, daughter and son believe in extra-terrestial beings and were delighted with my ""sighting."" About an hour later I turned on the radio to check if someone had seen anything, but no one talked about any sightings. I Thought I should tell my story to verify if anyone else had told a similar story in that time frame for the Puerto Rico area.  The sighting date would be either May or March of 2008.

Eleven American students, an American teacher, a Chinese guide, and myself (one of the American students traveling in Beijing, China) witnessed strange colorful lights in the sky during a bus ride around 10:00 PM on July 2, 2008, as well as from our hotel rooms up until 1:00 AM when we went to bed.   I looked out the bus window and saw two large flare shaped lights hovering over the city (one green and one blue).  I asked the Chinese guide what they were, and neither she nor anyone else could explain them.  They were not fireworks.  A few seconds later, a red one appeared in a different location for a brief moment when it quickly vanished as several white lights flashed around it.  We arrived at our hotel and my roommate and I looked out our 8th story window to see a pentagonal formation of five lights as well as two green lights with long flickering tails slowly moving over the horizon towards the formation.  The formation spanned a distance several miles wide and several miles high in the night sky.  The light on the far left of the formation was rapidly changing color from blue to green to purple to red to yellow and so on.  The other four lights were yellow or white in color and were slowly moving along the perimeter of the pentagon.  My roommate and I watched the lights for nearly two hours.  A couple of times during the event a red light shot out from the colorful light and eventually returned to the colorful light. As we watched the green lights rise toward the formation we noticed that once they reached a certain height in the sky, they lost their shimmering tails and green color and joined the formation of yellow and white lights. The most shocking moment came when three of the green lights with tails were traveling toward the formation. At the same time as if connected by an unseen force, they all swayed quickly to the left, and back to the right. We continued to watch the lights and even tried to take some photos and video, but lights of the buildings in Beijing were too bright to get a ! clear sh ot, and the images and videos barely show the lights. We thought of every possible explanation for the source of the lights, but nothing could explain their unique movements.

In addition, I had posted a previous ufo report on 7-21-07; this was under the same circumstances and was titled on this web site “THE OBSERVANT SPHERE”.  This sighting, however, was no sphere and I will try to describe it to the best of my ability and maybe throw in my own judgment to what it was. The date was 7-05-08 and I was, again, at my apartment pool in Canton Michigan; I was in the pool itself floating looking up towards the sky.  At first I was just looking at this hawk circling over head, watching it closely then something reflective caught my eye.  At that instant I stood up in the pool and rubbed my eyes to make sure that water was not causing me to see things then I peered up again and noticed that the object had become more visible.  I turned to this really attractive young woman and asked her if she could see what I saw.  At first she said “yea I see that bird”, and then I said “no… look higher” and she gasps saying “oh yea….what is that?”  At this point I realized I was not delusional from drinking heavily the day before.  Also at this point I noticed everyone at the pool starting to look up as well and I looked back up to view the object and noticed this: it started out stationary over I-275 and Ford road, as a silvery twinkle and slowly turned into a silvery doughnut shaped liquidly fluid like structure that seemed to reflect light very well.  At about a minute and thirty seconds past the first observance, the object started to rotate sideways until it became a twinkle again and vanished. I have reported ufo’s before but this was by far the strangest and most impressive.  After the sighting I ran back to my apartment and told my fiancé of what I had just witnessed and she believed me but my gut instinct was to research this a little more and wait for others to report it before making my own report.  I thought it was possible that it was unique weather phenomenon but after searching the web and Utube for doughnut ufo’s, I came to the conclusion that it was genuine.  I believe that what I observed was just the tip of the iceberg and that what ever I saw was somehow distorted by either its means of propulsion ”gravity?” or by its cloaking device.  I also believe that this is a repeated pattern and that there will be something in the skies above Ford road and I-275 sometime in July of 2009 probably around the time of 15:00-16:00 hrs, hopefully or I’m going to look bad. Maybe this year I will take my video camera to the pool, but that might look creepy. Thanks for your time",2009-04-14T00:00:00,42.30922619808307,-83.4868319488818

We watched it for a good while, and it started moving up, down, left, right and then it made snake like movements.  After probable about 45 min. of watching my mom wanted to go lay down in the living room.  We watched T.V. for a little while, but I wanted to go see if it was still there, so I went back in to the bedroom and looked out the window, and it was still there.      I watched it for a little while longer and it slowly made its way behind the trees across the highway.  For some reason my eyes moved to the big dipper in the sky you could see it perfectly out that side window.   As I was watching I noticed a very dull star at the very end of the big dippers handle.  I thought to myself what is that?  That shouldn’t be there and then all the sudden it shot from where I saw it.  It was so fast and bright.  When I first seen it come out of the sky it was so bright and then it dimmed down and I could really see it was a triangle . The whole thing was glowing. It came so fast from that spot it left two trails behind it.  To me it looked like something straight out of Star Trek and it scared me.  I almost thought it was an asteroid.   It came to a complete stop turned to the north and slowly moved away. I was in complete shock.  I tried hollering for my mom while this was going on but no sound would come out of my mouth.  I couldn’t stop looking at it.  It was the most alien light I had ever seen in my life, and I will probably never see it again.  I don’t know what I saw but I’ve never seen anything like it ever .

Just got home from a late night at the casino.  Quickly checked e-mails and prepared to go to bed.  Still dark outside with no indication of sun rising yet.  I turned off my bedroom light and laid down on the bed, just before I closed my eyes, I saw a light in the sky.  My bed is right beside the window which faces east.  I have no curtains, and I live on the 17th floor of an apartment building.  Mind you, I filed a report one month ago.  I have to admit I have a more heightened awarness of the night sky now.   The view from my bedroom allows me to see the entire eastern night sky.  To redirect attention for a second, other than the last report I filed in Late January, I have had to other sightings, one in grade eight, and the other sometime in late highschool.   My first sighting was at a religious retreat in Orangeville, Ontario (1987).   All the boys slept in a large room with rows of beds either facing toward the inside wall or the outside window.  My bed was facing the large lengthy window.  It was approximately half an hour after the lights had been turned off (10 pm).  I noticed a green glowing, saucer shaped object hovering above the tree line approximately 300 meters away.  There was quite a bit of fog.   I watched it for a few seconds when I saw a beam of green light go down into the trees, that is when I woke everyone up to look at it.  Most were asleep.  Of the 25 classmates in the room, approximately five others witnessed it.   After about a minute, the green glowing object slowly disapated.   The second sighting occured while drving northbound on highway 404 heading toward Richmond Hill, a small town north of Toronto.  This occured sometime in 1993.   I was in the back, left seat of a friends car.  It was the middle of the day.  I looked up and saw a clearly orange triangular shaped object maybe 1 km high.  I pointed it out to my friends, but because of there position, they could not see it.  The driver had to focus on the road, as well.   It hovered for 30 seconds then shot directly st! raight u p at an astonishing speed and disappeared out of site. Now back to the latest sighting.  I quickly determined the light I was looking at was not a plane.  There were no flashing lights, and the light was almost luminescent.  The best I could describe it, as if it was floating across the sky.  The light was approximately a km in the sky.  I stood on my bed and watched the light, it quickly sped away at an alarming speed.   At this point I was convinced it was not a plane.  From the vantage point of my bedroom window, planes normally take approximatel 10 minutes to completely disappear out of sight.  This object not only sped away in less than thirty seconds, it followed an angle in the sky different from an airplane.  Airplanes follow a logical direction in the sky and approach the horizon at a slow and steady speed.   This object reached 'horizon level' in under 30 seconds.  Fighter planes could possibly move at those speeds, but this happened 5:45 in the morning with no sonic boom to be heard.

After the second time we didn’t see it anymore.  The UFO appeared to be moving northeast and getting lower because houses and the mountain in the area began to get in the way of my girlfriend and my vision.   I am convinced that I saw a UFO,  I just wanted to get closer to see more  Which was really hard at the speed it was moving and the landscape in that area that is really hilly which can block ones vision.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,33.859164858490566,-117.57944646226416

It was around 10:15 pm. I look in the sky all the time. One of my friends that was with us is an engineer and gets into the paranormal and UFO’s. We talk about it a lot. This was very crazy and much unexpected. Over the Tucson Mountains to our west, we noticed 3 Hugh orange lights and changing colors to red and white. At the same time we noticed 2 more strange white smaller lights over head a lot closer to us. They made no noise what so ever, and there was no running lights or any blinking lights on it.  Looking back over at the 3 lights over the Tucson Mountains as they changed color and where pulsating. Just like the Phoenix UFO on the news some years ago. They went out one by one and out of order. Then with in a couple of short minutes later they showed up over the Silverbell mountains and did the exact same thing then disappeared. My friends where looking at the 2 over our head and did not see the lights over the Silverbell mountains. When I told them too look they disappeared that fast. I looked back at the smaller lights over our heads as they where coming closer too us. These lights where white, and pulsating and moving more up then down. No other lights on the craft. One was just hovering. The second one was moving away to the west of our position. Then it disappeared. Boom! Just gone!  I know none of the objects we had been looking at where any type of plane. Or helicopter. I live right by the Air force base and the Tucson Air Port and see and hear planes every day. The last one that was hovering stayed there for a few minutes, and then it made a very wide circle and went back to where it was hovering. Then did the same thing as the other one did. Slowly moved to the west and in front of all our eyes it pulsated then disappeared. Two days later on 2-23-09 I was standing outside my home looking up into the sky at all the stars and planes still thinking about the other night. When a white light with no running lights or any other blinking lights on it came from the east, very slow. As it came closer I noticed it was not making any sound what so ever. It then got Hugh so bright that it hurt my eyes. It then stopped due south of my home just with in a mile of me. I noticed 3 Air force jets circling it. The light then went down in intensity. Then flu away to the west and then it was gone in a second. The Air Force jets seam to be following it away. After it disappeared the Air Force jets just went back to the base after 5 minutes or so. All I could say is I have been around for 48 years and have been a sky watcher all my life. This was a special few days.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

I stopped at the corner of Esplanade and Topaz Street to look up and see the vehicle perform maneuvers for about 10 minutes. It appeared to be a solid object, with a ring of blue white light around the outside. Occasionally some small strobes were visible as it tumbled and moved back and forth laterally. It appeared to be somewhere over Esplanade and Pacific Coast Highway. There was no sound whatsoever and the object rotated and tumbled about for several minutes.

After it traveled from left to right it hesitated, and then traveled sharply back to the left for a short time, and then changed direction again to proceed to travel to the right out of the scope of the skylight. I ran outside to follow it further but it was no longer there.  I feel that it could not have been a space station or a satellite sighting because it moved too fast and because of the way it changed direction. When I first saw it through my skylight I thought it was a shooting star or a comet.   If I was to try to debunk this account I would take into consideration that we live within 120 miles + or - of the Norfolk air force navy base.  I would first consider this either a shooting star based on it’s appearance or a test rocket from said base, however it rapidly changed direction and speed.  This was no rocket in low altitude and it was no space station.  I understand that rockets and earthly crafts travel fast, however this damn thing was booking.   I first thought it to be a shooting star. To be perfectly frank I was offended by the rudeness of the hotline phone proctor who asked me to summarize this in ten seconds and after five would interrupt because he needed to go to a social engagement.  If this organization’s goal is to obtain all ufo sightings, it would be nice to show patience for every caller who takes the time to call this hotline to hear their description of the sighting and to assist them in reporting it.  I was very excited to share this sighting and was disappointed that the staff was not interested in what I had to share.  I hope in the future you will have time to answer the call when it is first made so I will not have to call again nor have someone else speak to the hotline on my behalf in order to seriously be heard by an organization that represents itself as one that wants to hear about strange sightings encountered whenever and wherever they occur.  I do not understand the goal of this organization.  I thought it was to receive informati! onal accounts of ufo sighting or reports as stated in the name.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,37.8076,-78.6842

The shape was bizarre to me since it looked like a stingray; there were 4 orange lights one on top two on the sides and one at the tail.  They did not blink or change intensity all the time.  The colour was a very beautiful orange and intense. I just want to add the sky was clear there were 18 Celsius or 64 Fahrenheit and also it was a full moon.  The UFO was way to big in order to be mistaken with a star or an airplane.  There was no sound from it or anything else that will get your attention. I tried to take a picture with my cell phone but nothing came clear.  If there is a buzz or someone else saw it I will be happy to share my experience with him/her.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,,

It was hovering near the constellations of Cepheus and Cassiopea.  It was nearly motionless though it appeared to move vertically very slowly during the two minutes it was visible. The orange reddish light had a flickering appearance and was slightly larger than the apparent size of the ISS and was much less bright than the ISS.  My best guess on apparent magnitude would be roughly 1.0. After two minutes the light disappeared from sight.  The light made no sound and appeared to be roughly 2-4 miles away.  It had no navigation lights, anti-collision strobes or landing lights like the normal air traffic in this area.  The local visibility was excellent with no clouds in the sky and no haze.

I was in downtown Ogden, Utah, coming out of a building to the parking lot where several other people stood very excited about something in northwestern sky.   As I looked up in that direction I saw at least 8 spheres of orange lights.  One man was attempting to film this with his digital camera (which was unsuccessful).  He was looking through the zoom lens and said they looked really big in relation the foreground.  The men present also said there had been at least 15 lights earlier but  some had already dimmed. As we watched, we saw a small plane heading south to the Ogden Airport.  The lights appeared to move up and spread out more.  They all moved in a horizontal independent motion with no sound.  One of the men who was there first stated he saw them ""pour out"" of a spot in the sky 10-12 minutes earlier. As I studied the balls of light I could see that the orange glow was of nothing like I have ever seen.  It seemed to have an organic quality with a rich color and no pulsing. All of us felt we were being watched. Then to our amazement the lights snapped into geometric star formations.  Most of them drew into the Orion constellation. The remainder of the spheres spread out over our heads.  When they moved in this way, we all felt uneasy, as it was such an intelligent action. At that point all of them started to fade their color and with the naked eye you could see a dim metallic surface on the spheres like the way the dark side of the moon glows.  Within two minutes they kept fading out to be barely visible and then it was stars in their place.

Heavy objects were being tossed about by the strong winds and it was very dangerous to be traveling as almost all traffic lights were malfunctioning due to the weather. It was about six o'clock in the evening as i started to cook when i heard a great noise out on my balcony.  I walked over and saw my heavy metal and glass furniture being lifted and tossed about like newspaper but i looked over toward my right and saw bright flashes of lights almost like fire over toward a heavily wooded area.  My first thought was a fire must have started over there but the way the bright lights were lighting up only that part of the sky seemed weird to me.  It seemed as if something on the ground over in that direction was projecting a light towards the sky in a cone shape not a natural shape as if it was a fire. Yet the lights kinda flickered like a fire with orange, pink, white and yellow colors.  This lasted for about fifteen minutes. I was stuck in place and suddenly i saw a round object shoot directly up from the spot that the lights were coming from into what seemed like clouds or fog.  At that same moment all the lights sort of sucked into the sky where the object disappeared and then total darkness as if no light were ever over there.  Seconds later a bright blue/green light flashed in the area of the sky where the object and the lights disappeared and the blue/green color lingered for a few seconds and sort of drifted off into the clouds or fog.

I was walking down the bike path when it was dark out, I was going down to the Dairy Queen to meet a friend, my ride.  On my way to the path, I saw something strange moving through the air, I could barely tell what it was and I incorrectly (or maybe correctly) thought I saw a UFO. I concluded that it was just a plane but there were more lights in the sky around. I'm about 45 min from Ohare so I know that my area has some looparound flight paths near it, and there seemed to be a ton of planes circling, you could almost always see one or two along a path at any given time or place (even later at the coffee shop many miles away there were still planes everywhere in the sky.)  There may be some back up because of the weather, it seemed like a storm is brewing in the air.  But on my way down the path, I saw another light in the distance, in a different direction that seemed... out of place. Once I got to where I could see clearly, it already had enough time to leave! . I kept on walking and about five minutes later I felt something change in the air. It was like the atmosphere had changed yet I was not consciously aware of it yet. It was more like instinct that made me turn my head, and I'm glad I did. I saw something strange looking come out of the area behind me and to my left. It was a collection of three lights and one blinking one. I would have thought it was another plane except it seemed different, something felt wrong about it. As it passed over me, it took about 15-25 sec to pass from the horizon to my back left to the front right, I saw what it was. It was very hard to focus on it or to look at what it was. It felt like, consciously, I could only observe my surroundings instead of rationally comprehend or pick apart details. I know what I saw but it was hard to get anything to register, I couldn't pick it apart like I could shapes in a cloud. It was hard to see but it was only a few hundred feet above me, it was triangular and! had large lobed sides. It seemed outlined in something glowin! g white or translucent but shrouded as to not be too showy. As it passed I could see that there was something on the bottom, I'm not sure if it was energy pads or whatever that was the light, but I could tell it was not an airplane, it was low enough to see, but still high up. The memory is a little hard to remember of how exactly it looked, like I said, it seemed hard to focus on. As it was going into the distance I noticed it was in a new shape. The triangle seemed to turn into a T shape of disconnected lights but I never saw he conversion, only before and after. That may have been due to distance, but I do have pretty good eyesight and don't often make up shapes like that. As it passed a few hundred feet over me, it wasn't loud. It sounded like it was a jet that was much much further up, but even that sound seemed... artificial. As if it was something that would not be noticed in the background of air traffic noise, but when looked at sounded... off. And the object was much too c! lose to have normally been that quiet, if a jet was that low, car alarms would be going off and the ground rumbling. As it glided over me, for I was in the center of a very small village with noone else around as far as I could see, the hum of the electricity seemed to temporarily change. I don't remember if the frequencies got higher or lower but I remember hearing a distinct change that only happened as it was passing over the building that had neon signs. What's odd is that I tried to tell the friends I hung out with multiple times about the sighting but no matter how hard I tried, the conversation would always get wildly diverted. I tried, but I couldn't slip it in in the few hours we were at Caribou Coffee. Even when I would do my best to specifically bring it up, the person I was trying to tell, the UFO junkie, kept suddenly getting compelled to finish a thought from 20, 30 minutes earlier in conversation. I could get not get a word about that in edgewise, even though! if I blatantly said I saw a UFO we would have been talking ab! out it a ll night. As I walked home from Denny's (yes, too many different restaurants,) about a good mile from home and at the top of a hill next to which is my house in the expansive valley below it, I could see helicopters everywhere. Even If I couldn't see bright lights like I could from some of them, there was always one around. I would look into the sky and see a flash of some helicopter or something very far off, an impossible distance to identify what, but it was the artificial flash of a helicopter. They were everywhere. Cops too were hurriedly congregating, I saw three suddenly rush into a meeting place and I was walking across the street from the storage facility they met at. They got out of their cars and talked about ""I saw blah"" ""It was seen"" ""blah blah seen."" I  couldn't really make out what they were saying, but they were all sharing about something they saw. It may have been in relation to a criminal act, but events were weird as is. (What's weird is that the UFO remi! nded me of a dream I had a while back about UFOs. I almost never have dreams about them and I know that it wasn't a real abduction, just my unconscious playing around, but it still looked similar to my abduction dream.) Oh yeah, plus there were a ton of other aircraft around, but this glided by pretty quickly and in it's own direction, not one that is a flight path. It was foggy and hazy tonight everywhere, but this was mostly below the clouds.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,,

I am a 20-year-old college student, and I live in Bonita Springs, FL. I work as a waiter and a carpenter and go to school as well. I understand the skepticism regarding UFOs. I accept the existence of aliens as extremely likely, but I recognize that there are people who misidentify things they see or falsify reports for attention or other personal gains. This is where my skepticism lies; not in the subject of UFOs, but those who report them. This may seem ironic as I myself am reporting a sighting, but my hope is that this report will not be disregarded. I have neither a desire nor motive to claim to see something I did not.  That being said, I do wear contact lenses and had them in during the sighting. I was not under the influence of alcohol, tobacco, or any other drug with the exception of caffeine as I had a cup of coffee about ten minutes before the sighting occurred. What I witnessed occurred for approximately five minutes at 8:10 pm in the eastern sky. There was not a cloud in the sky and the stars were visible in all directions.  At about 8:00 pm I finished my cup of coffee and then took my dog for a walk. A couple of minutes into my walk, I saw a shooting star in the southern sky as I was about to turn left (to the east) onto another street. This got my attention, and I began to observe the night sky in hopes of possibly seeing another.  Now heading east, I continued walking, periodically scanning the sky. It was after another few minutes that I first noticed an amber ball of light, which struck me as being at a very high altitude, moving from south to north across the sky. It was about 45 degrees above the horizon at first, but then it turned to the east while slowly climbing degree by degree above the horizon, getting smaller and smaller. It appeared to me that this light had turned away from me and was gaining more and more altitude. It began to twinkle, much like a star, as it got smaller and smaller until I could no longer see it.  I continued walking east down the street and checking the area of the sky for another minute until I reached the point at which I normally turn around. Seeing nothing where the light was, I turned around and began walking to the west. About a minute later I stopped and turned around and looked to the area of the sky where I had seen the amber speck of light. I observed a second moving in the same south to north fashion as the first at about the altitude. I watched it briefly until a car was coming and I turned back around. A few seconds later looked back again and could not locate the light which I attribute to a nearby street light. I continued walking west.  I checked the sky over my shoulder three more times as I walked, and on the third scan I saw a third light. It too was the same amber color as the first two, but it was moving away from me to the east, and climbing degree by degree above the horizon as it did so. I feel this was a spate light from the second as this one was more to the right (south) in the sky than the first two were. Again my impression was that this light was both gaining altitude and moving away from me, getting smaller and smaller.  There was no street light nearby, so I was able to observe this light for the longest before I could no longer see it. As it got very small, it emitted a single pulse of white light which was much larger and more intense than the amber ball itself. The ball then rapidly became extremely tiny in the sky, twinkling until I could see it off and on for a short while then not at all.  Only after the balls were gone did I notice other aircraft flying in the sky, mainly because this is when I looked for them. I saw several, all much closer to the horizon than the amber balls were, and they were all equipped with strobe and running lights. Three in particular caught my attention. They were headed to the east and appeared to by flying in a widely spaced diagonal line formation. Whether or not they were military I do not know, but that was my initial impression.  These balls of amber lights and the pulse of white light emitted by one are beyond my identification. I do not believe they were ball lightning as the sky was perfectly clear. My theory is that the lights I observed were those given off by the method of propulsion used by alien craft. This is only my best guess however, and while I do realize there may be other explanations, I could not think of one that fits to what I saw.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,26.368205111821087,-81.78585399361023

I work a part-time job, in a small city. It's sort of a one in a million chance that anybody will ever see something that they might think was a U.F.O. in their lifetime. I have been extremely lucky enough to have had more than two strange sightings of lights in the sky in my lifetime, so far, and had never given thought to reporting any of them, until now. Tonight, my girlfriend and I were leaving a friend's house, and we both happened to catch a glimpse of something just above the roof tops across the street. In the distance, if not just within the city limits, just outside the border, there was a glowing red light flying not too high in the sky. It was pulsating at a slow, random pace. The red light would slowly fade from bright red, to orange, to yellow, and white, then then start all over again. We do have a local airport a few miles outside of town, so usually I dismiss lights in the sky right away, thinking they belong to a small plane on it's way to the little airport. But we waited to see if the object would reveal any blinking lights that would give away the fact that it was only a small airplane, which it did not. Instead, after about two and a half minutes of observing the pulsating object in the sky, it disappeared just before it would have vanished behind some massive trees in our sight. It went from red, to orange, to yellow, and then it was gone, as if the light itself just turned off. We waited a minute longer to see if it would pop up again on the other side of the trees, but it never did. After that, my girlfriend and I got in my car and drove out to the edge of town, which wasn't that far, to see if we could spot it leaving, but there was nothing. Not even airplanes from the local airport, or commercial airliners. It was just stars in the night sky. About ten minutes later, I called my friend, where we had just left, and told him about the sighting. He then walked outside, and witnessed at least three “shooting stars” toward the same area the object was headed, within a couple of minutes time. Unfortunately I had no means to record this sighting. I do have my own camcorder, but it was at home, and I had my phone on me, which has a video recording device built into it, but it wouldn't pick up anything that faint and distant at night time. Normally I would only share a story like this with friends, but this sighting was just too bizarre to keep to myself. I thought maybe if I sent this story to you tonight, someone else who could've possibly seen the object might write to you, or someone else about it. I do not expect a response from this report. Either way, I know what we saw, and it wasn't an airplane. Maybe now I will learn to always keep my camcorder on me, so that one day, I may contribute a good piece of evidence to the ever growing library of U.F.O. videos. It's just being in the right place, at the right time.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,38.70717218543046,-121.79490860927153

Tonight, she left class at approximately 19:35 p.m EST.  I called her cell phone as I often do to determine her time of arrival for dinner. When she answered my call, she was extremely upset and crying.  She stated that when she pulled onto North Abbe Road (heading North) in Elyria, OH there was a very large oblong object in the sky that was gray in color and had red and white flashing lights.  The object appeared to be sitting still and was not very high in the sky.  She was nearly hysterical.  I talked to her from my cell phone to her cell phone her entire drive home.  When she arrived home she was still very upset and crying.  I asked why she was so scared.  She couldn't explain why, she just kept saying I couldn't understand.  She almost immediately went to sleep which is highly unusual.

On Saturday, March 13, 2010, at 7:15 p.m, a witness reported a number of orange colored circular objects were seen for about 15 minutes in Edmonds, Washington State.  Eventually, a group of about 20 persons in a large apartment complex gathered to witness these movements. First some background explanations, the witness used the term “low” to mean that the orange objects were larger than the stars in the sky, so the witness felt like they were at a lower level.  These objects were not close to ground level.  Also, the apartment complex pool is used as a reference point to describe the movement of these far. way objects The witness reported that initially 3-4 objects that looked like the color of fire were coming in “low”, moving from south to north. Then one orange circular object broke away this initial group.  This single orange object moved further north until it was seen over the apartment complex pool.  Then, after a few seconds that object disappeared. During this time, the witness said “little by little” other orange objects kept moving from the south to north, and when they got by the pool they disappeared. The approximate viewing time was said to be 15 minutes Then the sky was clear. The witness guessed there were more than 20 orange objects, but not more than 40. Approximately 20 people in the complex saw these orange objects.  Many were out because they were smoking.  They attracted more viewers because they were saying loudly, “Look up in the sky!”.  The witness went outside because the dog was barking and upon checking outside the apartment the third time the witness saw this group of people looking orange objects in the sky. It was reported from another person in the apartment complex that the emergency phone number 911 was called. The 911 operator was reported as saying that a massive amount of calls were received from all over.  Some of the questions asked by the 911 operator were:  “Was anything burning?   Did it hit anything?  Where did it come from?”  It was also reported that the 911 operator said  that a request would be put out for cars out investigate.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,47.82623459119497,-122.3462679245283

As the barren street curved around back of the school I noticed an LAPD (airport police) car with one officer parked facing the same direction I was now walking (North). I passed him on the sidewalk.

Suddenly I see what appear to be two large white spherical helium balloons revolving around each other in a jerky manner that I considered odd since the breeze was about 5mph from the South. They appeared low over the rooftops. I continued to watch the objects and they seemed to stop their Westward movement and began to slowly rise. They appeared to be below 1000 ft. when first spotted because I could clearly see the jet traffic well above it. The object(s) continued slowly rising in the northern sky about 30degrees from zenith still doing this strange revolving movement. I watched them rise until they were at least 30,000 feet because they were well above the air traffic at this time. About this time the LAPD car which was almost a block behind me decided to move on. As he passed me I pointed to the sky and pointed to what was by now a very small spec in the sky. He eventually found it and then I described what I saw. He looked at me like he didn’t know what to think and I said so long. After he left there was a miltary jet that appeared traveling North over Santa Monica bay at about 20k ft. but it was well under the object at this time. I continued to watch until it disappeared. I don’t know that the max altitude of a helium balloon is nor have I ever seen one do this.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,33.9454,-118.4398

I reluctantly followed her outside and she proceeded to try and show me two things or objects flying way up in the sky one after the other. It was difficult to see them as she told me that they weren't any sort of known aircraft. I was finally after a couple of minutes able to see them and instructed her to continue watching them as to I was going to get my camera. I ran back into our apartment and got my Canon 5D camera and switched lenses to a 70 to 200mm zoom to attempt to get a shot of them. I used the automatic settings on the camera to insure I did get some quick results if possible. Once back outside I did see them for a second time and proceeded to take a few photographs of each object. The first photograph was taken at 17:47. Neighbors of ours saw me run outside of our apartment with my camera and decided to follow me to see what was going on. They too saw the objects. Our position here in Santa Ana California was on Main St between Mac Arthur and Dyer Road just south of Alton Drive. We were facing due north looking up at about 60 degrees.

Date: 17 October 2008   Time: 1915-1930 MST   Location: 1 mile northwest of Colony, Wyoming. Duration of Sighting: Approx 5 minutes. Number of witnesses: 3  Description of Sighting: I exited the building where I work at approximately 1915 hrs.  At approx. 10 degrees above the horizon I viewed a light in the WSW sky.  I called a co-worker to look at the light.  The light was amber in color, very similar to the mercury vapor street lights that are common.  The intensity was about twice the yard light of a ranch that is five miles from our location.  However the size of the light was three to four times larger and did not vary in intensity for the duration of the sighting. We viewed the light and noticed that it was moving.  It was moving very slowly and without deviation from whatever ""course"" it was on.  The general movement could have been east to west, but from our perspective, it looked as if the light was descending.  We observed this light for at least five minutes.  Our observation was with naked eye and with 10X binoculars.  We could not discern any shape to the object, just a ""light.""  We observed this object until it went into obscura over the horizon, at around 250 degrees azimuth. We considered what it may have been, and agreed that it was not a conventional aircraft, nor a celestial body.  The only possible conventional explanation we could determine from our sighting was that it was possibly a satellite reflecting the sun.  Though other obvious satellites we have seen did not have the same color of light, nor did they reflect light so consistently or so long to our respective position as this object may have been. The witnesses have a combined experience of 70 years in ground radar, satellite tracking, and working with military aircraft.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

I noticed what looked like a star slowly moving northward in the southern sky approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. The object was the intensity of a moderately bright star and appeared to gain speed as it traversed just west of overhead. When almost directly overhead it dimmed and then briefly lit up more brightly than before, to the point of being the brightest object in the sky. At this point I called for my wife to come out and look and as soon as she stepped out the object dimmed once more, and then briefly intensified before disappearing into the area of the Big Dipper.  A commercial jet passed from east to west (slightly north of my vantage point) shortly before the object passed and appeared to be much lower in altitude than the object. The object seemed to zigzag and change speed almost imperceptibly and the entire time gave the impression that it was as far away as a star. It was a white light with no blinking, flashing, or changing colors other than the brief dimming and intensifying described above.

About 200 feet high was an unmanned aircraft flying right over my truck in an eastward direction. It was all white with a high aspect ratio wing similar to the Global Hawk. I reached for my camera but it was too late, the plane was too far on the horizon. So, I climbed out of my truck to get some pictures of the lake bed and surrounding mountains. When I arrived at home later that day, I downloaded the pictures onto my computer and sent some to my friends. Later on in the night, I reviewed the pictures again and made a startling discovery.  On one of the pictures, I scrolled up high in the sky and noticed something that at first looked like the moon.  Then I zoomed in and it was a white ring with another ring inside it.

UFO Sighting:   Today (August 5, 2009) at approximately 7:30 p.m., myself and three others witnessed what I can only describe as a UFO.  We are located about 10 miles west of Panama City Beach, Florida.  Then sun was about to go over the horizon when I saw a small light about two to three times larger than a star appears to be.  The light was located southwest of us over the water approx. 5 to 8 miles away.  The angle above the horizon was about 35 degrees.  The color of the light was an orange-yellow, similar to that of the color of the sun. After a few seconds the light disappeared then reappeared slightly to the left.  That light then disappeared and seconds later two lights appeared a little to the left of where they had just been, then about four or five appeared, again to the left.  This sequence of disappearing and appearing went on for about 2 or 3 minutes.  These lights were not moving when they were visible, only disappearing and reappearing.  The lights disappeared for a final time traveling a total of a few miles.  The lights were in a line, appearing to be lined up in the direction that they were moving. Every time the lights disappeared they sort of faded out for a second or two.  Their path was a straight line.  There was no noise or anything else associated with this event. I previously considered myself somewhat of a skeptic when it came to UFOs.  So at first I was trying to think of what else it could be.  There are a few Air Force and Navy bases near by, but this was definitely something I had never before seen.  There was no other solid object or anything visible that they could be connected to.  After seeing this I looked up pictures on the internet of UFOs, and found these lights’ appearance to be similar to the event that took place a few years back in Arizona, known as the ""Phoenix Lights.""

My eighteen year old son had been out with friends prior to the sighting.  He doesn't drink or take drugs, but he called me to come visit to show me some pictures, so this is a second hand report.  (I live in Salt Lake City, and he lives 12 miles south of me.)  He explained, the moon was up and he went into the house to get his camera and take picture of the moon with his Pentax Digital SLR 6 MP camera, with his 70-300 telephoto lens.  As he was taking pictures of the moon, he noted a dark object slowly moving and hovering about 30-50 feet in the air toward the northeast, adjacent to an elementary school about an eighth of a mile away.  It was dark, and he could barely see the object, but noted it was slowly moving. He directed his camera toward it an got some picture. This evening, the 7th of August, I finally met with him and he showed me his pictures that he downloaded to his mother's laptop.  The picture quality was poor, but his pictures did appear to show a saucer shaped object, with some sort of a glow or reflection below it.  He said when he saw it, it gave him a 'chill,' and felt like he was dreaming, he could not believe what he was seeing.  It was slightly above the trees, and the pictures did show that it had gained some altitude, but still was hovering, with no sound.  He managed to get several pictures.  Since this is a residental area, except for the large fields around the school, I would estimate that the disk or object, was only about 30 feet or so long.  He went back into the house, and didn't see where the object went, except that it was no longer there.  This may be something else, like a balloon, but even the pictures, as poor as they are, seem to show something unusual.  This may be nothing, but perhaps others saw it also, and perhaps worth reporting it to you.  I served in the military as a pilot. (I got off active duty and became a part time civilian flight instructor and worked for the Fire Department in SLC, which I still do.) One clear early morning about 02:30, in July of 1983, over the starry night skys of Utah, my student and I did witness an unusual craft within 50 feet. I remember the craft or object had a very unusual 'belly.' It was a chilling experience, and never dared report it.

I thought maybe it was a plane hitting the sun at an angle that made it disappear.  About 20 seconds later it appeared in the same area again.  It traveled upward again very gracefully and then disappeared.  I did see some birds in the sky, but they were much lower.  This could not have been a bird - it was way to high.  It disappeared and reappeared 4 times.  I was driving where there are many high hills and twisting roads so I eventually lost track of the area it was.  I concluded that it could not be a plane because a plane travels upwards and forwards, this was just t! raveling upwards.  I am a mother of two and a teacher.  I would not make this up.  Maybe it was some sort of reflection?  In appearance, it was not at all like the stories of UFOs I have heard of in the past.  Hmmm . . . . . ?",2009-08-27T00:00:00,33.45240084388186,-117.6169088607595

I went outside and saw that there was nobody around.  I quickly noticed 3 bright orange lights about 1,000 ft up coming out of the north-west sky heading south-east, slower than an incoming aircraft about to land (we live in the flight path of Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn.)   The lights were set up in a triangular pattern on the front. I banged on the house to get my wife’s attention and she quickly came outside to join me and asked me what the problem was, and I asked her to look up and tell me what it was that I was looking at.  She saw immediately what I was looking at and asked me what it was. I said, you tell me” and she said, ""I don’t know.""   She kept staring at it and soon she said, ""Oh, my god, it’s round.""  I agreed with her and we continued watching the UFO as it glided silently over us heading south-east.  It was as large as a 747 aircraft but round and made no noise whatsoever. We watched for 10 minutes as it passed directly over us and as it passed, it was obvious that the lights were only in the front of the craft, no lights underneath or in the back, and no blinking lights either.  Just after it passed over us, the lights began to disappear from sight similar to a car passing you on the road. My wife and I sincerely believe that we witnessed a UFO and are only disappointed that no-one else saw it from our neighborhood and that we were unable to get its attention in hopes that it would land near us.

It had come from the West over my house flying East at the same height of the wispy clouds above me.  I do not know how high that was.  In seconds it disappeared into the distance.  It was a clean, concise ball of light.  No vapor, or tail, or distortion. After it had disappeared, to my right in the sky was a small plane that was flying higher than the ball of light did. In a few more minutes a commercial jet plane came over my house and it seemed to be crawling in the sky compared to the speed of the earlier ball of light.

Seemed like it was partially reflective and partially opaque. At some some point, it crossed just below of the morning moon and and aircraft passed at the same time.

My wife said what’s that pointing to the east at an large object stationary in the sky.  The object appeared to be oblong in shape and a bright rust-orange color. It looked like separate lights  (you could see dark between the lights making it look like segmented lighting) lined up in a row slightly curved to the east.  The object  brightened in intensity then faded quickly and was not visible (this sighting lasted 7-10 seconds).  We both watched the area and then the same type of object started to appear again approx. 6 miles south of where this last object had disappeared from. It was not as bright and faded quickly and was not visible (this second sighting lasted maybe 4-6 seconds). The object was located over the Armargosa Mountain Range in Death Valley (the ridge line of the mountain was still quite visible).  I did a compass bearing after the sighting which was 29 degrees (declination set to 15 east) from Stovepipe Wells Village. The line of sight runs from Stovepipe to Corkscrew Peak to Armargosa Mountain Range to North of Beatty, Nv. We watch the International Space Station and Space Shuttle quite often from here. Neither of these were visible tonight in the Death Valley area (11/17/2009) in checking the ISS Human Space Flight Site. The size of the object is what amazed us!   The Space Station and Space Shuttle (even when docked together ) are just large moving (non-blinking) lights in the sky.  And regular aircraft in the area are just small to moderate blinking lights in the sky.  In comparison and distance from us, this object had to be at least a HALF MILE in length!",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

First I thought it was a far off plane coming in for a landing.         (Lebanon Airport is on a hill right behind my job site) then this light faded as another came on.  This was in a straight line, so I thought the plane was banking and I was seeing the other wing.

The lights repeated this pattern at least 6 times.  I am not sure how far away these lights were from my position, but they were low in the sky. I stopped a coworker to show him just before the display ended.   He was as baffled as I was.  We could hear a plane take off from the airport.  It flew over us at this time.

When I pulled around the corner by my house in the rural village where I live, I saw two large, bright golden orbs above the road just south of my house.  They were stationary, parallel to each other, and fairly close to each other at a height of, by my estimate, of about 150 or so feet above the road.  They were also moving in an erratic manner side-by-side to each other, sort of leapfrogging over one another.  One would quickly leapfrog over the other to a parallel position next to the one just jumped.   Then the one just jumped would perform the same maneuver over the first one in the same direction.  This occurred maybe two to three times then they reversed the process in the opposite direction.  Once, the lights seemed to flick off to black but shortly came back on.  When the maneuvers seemed to have ended and they both went black, I parked my car and got out in the dark, but seeing nothing in the sky went into my house. Within about twenty minutes of my sighting, I received a phone call from a friend in my town who lives about 2 miles from me saying that in the company of their son they had observed a similar display on their way home from a different direction to town.  They stopped, got out of their car, and went to a field above their home to further observe a similar performance to mine above their field. The activity I saw occurred maybe two to three times in a matter of a few minutes from the time I stopped in the road to observe them.  I was stopped in the travel lane of the road while seeing this activity.  Three or four cars passed me in the road during this time.  Though no one else stopped, I can’t believe no one else saw this because of the size of the orbs, their proximity directly above the dark road, and their erratic behavior.  Very odd. Apparently many UFO sightings were observed and reported locally at this time, but the media has attributed them to the Leonid Meteor showers that are occurring.  This is not what I observed.  I have watched the sky most of my life. I have seen the comets Hale-Bopp and Halley’s, meteors and their showers, and satellites.  These definitely are NOT what I saw.

The aircraft, from a closer view, had two bright orange lights, one in front and one in the back, and white and blue flashings lights on either wing.  The shape of the craft was undetermined because it was really dark. Another one of these lights passed over our heads, but still not close enough to get a great description.

I have also been a member of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. I am quite familiar with observing various aircraft at various altitudes, meteors, fireballs, as well as tiny polar orbital satellites. Last night, Wednesday 13th of May 2009, at around 10:30pm I was observing the stars out of my home's side window looking toward the north west and I saw a very unusual event. My home is situated in Orleans Ontario, a suburb of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. One of the “stars” I was looking toward became a stationary, relatively bright white light with a ring around it. It then began moving laterally from left to right, maintaining the same brightness and ring.  Then it quickly 'faded out'.  When I timed it out later, the whole event probably lasted no more than eight seconds. It demonstrated to me that to see something like this, you had to be in the right place, at the right time, looking toward the right direction. I'm reporting it here (as a UFO) because of the following reasons... If it was a natural phenomenon: it was most likely a meteor that was traveling toward me. That would explain the short duration of brightness, and the slight travel from left to right before fading out. Some haze in the sky would explain the ring around it. But why did it become very bright and remain stationary in the sky at first? And if pieces breaking off it made it change direction while it was coming down, why did it move horizontally, but not downward if it was under the influence of gravity?  If it was an aircraft: it was most likely the landing lights facing me. Once again haze would explain the ring around the central bright white light. But the white was not a 'tungsten' white, it was a pure white light. The brightening of the light and fading of the light is explainable if a rotation of an aircraft toward or away from me occurs, but how could it move laterally from left to right while maintaining the landing lights toward me. (Landing lights shine out ahead of the nose of an aircraft for the pilots to light ahead in the direction of their travel, not out from the aircraft body toward the tips of the wings). I had continued looking for a long time after its disappearance to see if any aircraft  navigational lights appeared moving along the extended path of the original white light, to no avail. Following the event I began double checking my observation by going through a mental process of critical thinking (which is stated in summary above). But as I was witnessing it in real time, I was struck with awe, or shock, and an sense that this was perhaps something that was neither man-made nor a phenomenon of nature.

My boy friend an I was going eastbound on 198 coming from I5 we were about 7to 10 miles from Lemoore naval base. I was driving. 198 is a straight road. There is empty fields on each side of 198, until you get to the naval base. As we were driving I saw what looked to be an aircraft flying only about 10 feet above the ground, going north to south across 198. I said, What is that look how low that plane is flying"". My boyfriend said thats not a plane thats a helecopter.We were about a mile from it than. As we approuched its path which it seemed to be going back and forth on the same path it was in no way a plane or a helecopter. There is nothing on this earth known to man that can do what this craft didAs we approched it , it was in the field on the north bound side. It was already turned around and was headed back over 198 to the southbound side.I was driving so it was on my side. This thing was only a 100 ft from the ground .It had about six bright lights that ran straight across it. It was as long as a tractor, trailor. It turned right around on a dime when it made a turn it turned to the left. As we approched, the craft seemed to speed up. and was headed right for us. The lights in the front I saw start pointing downward right for us . We were so scared we thought this thing was gonna crash right into us. Right when it reached us I looked up the lights blinded us but looked up at it out my window and if i stuck my arm out the window i could of touched the bright lights on it as it went over us. thats how low this thing was. Right when I thought it was gonna crash into us the craft went up and over us then back down to the other side of the field.When the craft was about to go over our ford Ranger Truck, I looked up at it . It looked like one huge wing It was made of metal. silver in color.The lights were bright, but I could see the outline of the craft.the huge craft was very thin. The craft looked compleatly differant as we were comimg up on it , compared to what this thing looked lik! e from a side veiw. It was so unbelivable. This thing I know was messing with us . We saw this craft turn around an b line it right at us and speed up.We really thought we were dead. My boyfriend ducked just before it went over us. I was shaking for hours after that . The craft proceeded to the southbound side of 198 turned and repeated back and fourth about 3 more times before it ended up crossing 198 going north and dissapeared .I watched it cross 3 more times in my rear mirror. My boyfriend wanted to turn around but i told him forget you that thing almost just crashed into us. I know this wasnt any aircraft of ours this was huge, It houvered 10 feet from the ground it was fast and it could turn on a dime. We dont have anything like that. Also there is no piolot gonna fly across a highway that low coming at cars. That is against the law. The most unusual thing about it was as it went over us there was no sound also somthing that big would of blown me a bit for how close he came over me .There was no wind I drove steady.But No Sound . Please I wish someone will get ahold of me about our sighting. I need to talk to somone. cant stop thinking about that night.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,36.29200975609756,-119.82940609756098

I saw a light over a field in my backyard that I have never seen before.  It was a bright amber light.  The coloring resembled a bright light inside of a brown paper bag.  The light seemed to be too far off of the ground to be a spot light or new cell tower.  I grabbed a pair of 8X binoculars and went to the corner of my yard to take a better look.  I could see a larger version of the amber light through the binoculars with hardly any detail but the light did not appear to be just glare.  There seemed to be some type of object.  As I watched, it was almost like the small halo that changed positions around the bottom of the object the way a spot light would.  However there was no definitive beam of light. As I continued to watch and tried to figure out of it was some type of balloon or helicopter, the object VERY slowly continued to rise and rise.  I thought that the object may be some type of helicopter however I heard absolutely no noise. Next I saw random parts of the field light up but I could not find the source of the light.  This happened 3 times.  I glanced from side to side as I saw the green grass light up. Next The object began to move north and that is when I saw multiple blinking red lights under the object.  The amber glow was dissipating at that point.  There seemed to be 6 or so red lights in a triangle formation like bowling pins on the bottom of a single object.  I tried to record the object with my cell phone but it wouldn't pick up the light, all it recorded was black. As the object moved to north it picked up pace very fast.  The object moved rapidly over a nearby farm from my vantage point with all the red lights visible.  At this point there seemed to be a clear light on the front part of the object. There was only approximately 1-2 minutes from when the object began moving north until it was out of my sight.  As it moved on its course I could see another blinking lighted object that appeared to be further away than the initial object.  The primary object moved directly past the 2nd object from my point of view.  The second object appeared as a single blinking light of red, blue, and white.  I could see the second object long after the first object was out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We had already witnessed two orange orbs in the same area about a month ago so I looked up and a few seconds later I saw one for myself except it was a “boomerang” shaped craft with 5 orange lights; one at the tip, one on each end and one on the center of each “arm” it was difficult to tell how high it was flying but I would guess approx. 3,000-4,000 feet, about as high as the local mountains. It was larger than an airplane; next to a full moon I would estimate it to be about a sixth of the size. It flew NW and disappeared into the clouds. I kept looking up into the sky when we both saw another (or the same, I’m not sure) object flying NE, then from the opposite direction one of the same size and shape came towards it, I thought they were going to collide but they instead seemed to merge into each other and become one larger object which then changed shape; the orange lights on both objects began to sort of swirl around then the craft(s) took on a double diamond shaped appearance before flying off in a NW direction. We then went back to our apartment about 7 blocks away; once there I witnessed another chevron or “boomerang” shaped object flying south through the sky from our front patio. At that point we decided to get our digital camera to try and record the objects and went back outside. I saw the chevron shaped object at least two other times, once flying north and then south. At this point we went outside to the street for a better view. A couple of minutes later I witnessed another chevron shaped object that appeared to be larger and flying lower than the others. It also had the orange lights on the bottom, more than the first, however this time the lights seemed to be moving in a very coordinated pattern, as I watched the lights seemed to swirl around each other in circles. There was absolutely no noise from any of these objects. Unfortunately our camera was unable to pick up the video we tried to record, however we’ve decided to take it with us when we go out riding now just in case. I will update if we see anything else.

I was traveling East on the 126 freeway with no other cars around  me.  There was no moon in the sky  and the area is a farming valley so except for my headlights there was no other sources of light in the area.  I happened to look to the Eastern horizon and slightly north when I noticed four red lights in the sky in a diamond shaped pattern hanging what  appeared to be approximately 200-300 feet above the Northern mountain range.   Although these lights were in the distance I wasn’t sure at the time what they truly were.  These lights were stationary and were constant at all times. As I continued to drive East I was beginning to notice that I was becoming aware that I was getting closer to these lights in the sky.  Growing up around an airport most of my life I knew an airplane or helicopter when I seen one, such as a strobe light on such craft.  These lights always kept the same distance telling me that they were on a craft and were apparently on one side of this craft, but because of the extreme darkness in the area I couldn’t tell you what this craft look like.  For the next 20 minutes I continues to see this light pattern in the sky. As I approached an area of this freeway, where the freeway would now turn to go around portions of the Northern mountain side that came towards the valley floor I could not see the lights due to my view being block. As I came around the curve in the road, out of thin area four large orbs of light appeared over a little mountain right in front my view.  These lights were large, as large as a house, and were of white light with speckles of grey within the orb.  Each orb had a halo surrounding it in what was the same color as lighting yellow and lit up the top of this mountain, which had a power line tower on top of it,.  These orbs were also in a diamond shape configuration.  Although I had my radio on in the car I could hear an electrical discharge as they appeared.  Within a second or two from appearing they quickly disappeared back into thin air. I’ll tell you that I was keeping my eyes on the road and trying to make sense of way I had just appeared and disappeared in front of m! e. As I cleared this part of the road and was traveling due East again and looked to the Eastern horizon and slightly North again.  Now I was approaching two sets of four red lights in the sky in a diamond shaped pattern side by side.  I opened my window and notice no sound from the air as I drove past these lights in the sky. I couldn’t talk to anyone about this incident for two days because I was trying to process what I had witnessed that night.  I finally came to the conclusion that I had witness teleportation of an alien spacecraft.  I had witness alien technology in action.   After a while I began to tell people who I have known for at least several years about this event, including an older woman who was a widow.  As I told her this story, she told me her husband was a fighter pilot in WWII in the pacific theater.  He had spoke to her several times that while flying in daylight he saw a black disc object in the air with him which had four red lights on the back end of this craft in a diamond shaped pattern.  When he tried to fly towards this craft, the ship would race away from his plane.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,,

However, the object did not move but remained stationary, or cruised at such a slow crawl that it appeared to be hovering. We considered it might be radio-tower lights (of which there are many on the mountains in that stretch of road) but the lights were above us and the road. Our next thought was that it could be a helicopter, but there was no detectable blade noise and the distance between the lights was closer to an airplane wingspan; it would have had to have been a bigger helicopter than I'm aware of in existence. I can't think of anything else that can hover or travel at such slow speeds besides a blimp...but how often are blimps even flown?...especially after dark and over a highway, rather than a sporting event?  It remained in our line of sight as we drove for approximately 30 seconds to under a minute before the road curvature obscured our view behind the treeline.

The object was not moving, and was not emitting any lights or sounds, but I could tell the object was shiny due to the fact the sun was reflecting off of the object. As a passed a few trees, and my line of sight was broken, I looked back in the general area only to find the object was gone.  I slowed down my car from  about 30mph to about 15mph and scanned the sky and the fields that I could see, but the object had disappeared.

About 7-10 minutes later we were approaching Intersection 196, Capital Circle NE, when we finally got a good look at what we’d seen from a distance. There were two objects.  The first was a small, highly reflective, bullet shaped object with no wings or tail.  The second was rather more startling.  Keeping pace behind the bullet shaped object was ‘V’ shaped object that was quite simply the biggest think  I've ever seen in the sky.  Although a good distance away it was easily the size of a football stadium, possibly larger.  The object was dark gray/brown in color. My wife was quite shaken up by this.  I was excited!  She slammed on the breaks pretty hard on the off ramp when she saw this thing and noticed other people around her doing the same thing, looking up at the sky.

There was hardly any traffic on the road because of the hour.  This neon blue light moved downward toward as if coming down a staircase.   The object stopped in front of a business park just to the left of us, approximately 25 yards away, and changed from a blue light orb to three neon blue squares linked together in a vertical rectangle tilted forward from the top.  The neon blue light pulsed at a very high rate and radiated from the the blue squares but the object itself made no sound.  The object itself appeared to be slightly smaller than the light on the light post next to it, approximately 10"" in length.  It hovered from side to side and up and down, turning sideways and back again; remaining in an a! rea of about 2-3 cubit feet.   As it turned sideways to reveal it's profile there didn't appear to be anything behind the blue light bar that we could see.   At first we thought it must be a toy.  There was not a single person around the object or in the parking lot of the business park.  Our driver said it could not be a toy because no transmitter could reach that far, given the fact that it descended from a visual point out of the night sky high above us.  A car coming from behind us also stopped to watch this intriging object as well as a man in a truck coming from the other direction.  The object then returned to the blue light orb and began traveling NE just above the roof tops.  It seemed to be traveling very slow at first so I told my friend driving to follow it.  Before we could get the car turned around the object acceleratled in a straight line NE and disappeared. I believe whatever it was came with an objective and that it traveled so low to the roof tops so that it could travel without much detection.  I also believe that it's destination were somewhere reasonably close or else it would have made it's descention elsewhere.

The First time I had seen this thing and got videotape of it was on May 1st 2010. I was on my way to bed around 11:30pm when I went for one last cigarette, and when I looked up into the sky I saw a strange flashing object way up in the sky above my trailer park. This would be in the North East. The object stayed there for a while and bounced around in the sky from NNE to the North. I had just purchased a camcorder about a month before hand primarily for use in recording precious moments of my baby girl, so I went in grabbed the camcorder came out and started filming the thing, this time it was down lower in the sky. I then went in grabbed a flashlight, and the object flashed brighter at me when I flashed the flashlight at it, before it slowly made its way due North through the tree line. I immediately filed a police report and the officers looked at me as if I were a kook even though I had showed them the video. Later that morning my husband told me it may have been an in ! flight jet refueling procedure, but over our town? So I phoned the Cold Lake Alberta Air force base and reported my sighting there. Needless to say although I’m a new mother with a sound mind and had many respected positions in my careers, I have been receiving flak about my experience. Upon researching websites, over the weeks following this incident, I was shocked to see how many reports of UFO’s there actually are, and that this object has been seen in this part of northern Alberta for over the past ten years. Here is the first video of the object: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5R8i8XHt2g  I find I couldn’t sleep and I went out ever night watching and waiting for this object to return. On May 24th around 3 am, I saw the thing again over the Catholic school, so I jumped in my car told my husband to watch the baby and went to the field near the school to try to get a better image of it. I made sure I purchased a tripod for the camcorder and this time brought along a 3 million candle powered flashlight. I discovered upon flashing the spotlight at the object the thing seemed to get scared? It went dark took off and stopped over the sawmill that my husband later estimated is about five kilometers from the school straight to the east. After about five minutes, the thing disappeared. I turned to go back to my car in the parking lot, when suddenly the thing reappeared over the trailer park again. It made a white semi circle glare, went dark and then sped off towards the radio towers north of town. I jumped in my car and followed the thing that stayed stationary over the field north of the towers. I couldn’t get it on video because the thing had turned its lights off? But now I wonder if I was just following a satellite that disappeared, and I was just seeing things above the field? Needless to say I got really spooked standing out in the middle of a dark back road trying to get a (?) on video. I decided to get out of there, and head for home. So now I think I’ve gone crazy, my husband doesn’t believe me, and is questioning if I’m fit to raise our daughter. I keep watching the video trying to stop the frames to get a clear view of whatever it could be which I’m sure my husband was thrilled about. When on May 28th around 11:30 or a bit later before midnight, the weather had turned cloudy, so I decided to actually stop waiting for this thing to come back, and actually get to bed at a decent time. I was going for my last cigarette when low and behold there it was again this time up in the clouds to the NNW, shining away. The weather had turned overcast, and I checked the cloud ceiling on the weather network later to discover the ceiling was at 3900ft. So I’m estimating that the object was another 500feet into the clouds. I keep my camera on a tripod now by the door, so grabbed it and started filming the object, and finally got a clear image of the thing. Its maneuverability is unbelievable, yet I still question coul! d this be a night kite an old man supposedly flies in a field a kilometer north from my doorstep? I got my husband out of bed, and he now believes me Thank-GOD! He says this definitely is not an old mans kite with LED lights on it. I looked everywhere online for any new technology a person could buy and place on a kite that would make it glow and pulsate like that, but so far haven’t turned up anything remotely close to this thing. Here’s the new clearer video I shot of it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SOu7NTHY-w  If anybody knows what this might be, please contact me through this report, Thank-you.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,53.5834,-116.4356

My second thought was an aircraft coming down on fire, but the speed was too fast for an aircraft.   Then I noticed that it was quite large. Much larger than any star I had ever seen.  Not as large as the moon, but absolutely not a plane or helicopter.  It had a greenish color to it with a dark area in the middle.  It arced in the sky heading to the south east, and then appeared to be falling to the earth when it suddenly disappeared.  The entire encounter only lasted approximately 10-15 seconds.

I think it was moving at a 45 deg angle downward, and then began (on a dime) to move in a line parallel to the earth, and directly in my direction (northward).  The speed probably about that of a fighter jet with afterburners going (based on past observations of those).  Object was a self-luminous body, grey-blue-white, not very bright, about like the moon behind thick clouds, and was retangular, with no lights whatsoever.  No sound at all.  The backyard is quiet, and it flew directly overhead.

There was no wind at all.  This was not a bird or balloon.  It was hauling straight line, overhead.  I was very careful to make mental notes as I observed, trying to see any extensions beyond the rectangular shape, but could not see anything more.

You  hear this heavy strong engine bursting sound going off and on as if something is cruising through space.   As the night turns to day you see the green ""round"" fire ball appear and then the sound goes quiet until you hear an explosion and the object darts off into the horizon with no trails.  The strange part is that upon turning the sound up the volume gets caught or stuck and if you pause the film you will continue to hear it unless you close the file and re-open.

PDT on April 15th, 2010 in Ventura California. I was looking toward the west at the constellation of Orion when I heard a brief ""screech"" sound lasting around one second and coming from the vicinity which I was viewing. Thinking it was an owl I quickly looked for it and saw a faint silhouette of something moving in the clear sky.  At first it looked like it was a large bird high in the air as the front and two sides were heavily darkened against the mostly dark sky.  It was moving toward me and over a period of about 2 seconds it became clearer and resembled a hang-glider. It was descending and moving toward the east and seemed to be gliding smoothly, making no sound that I could hear.   As it reached its closest point to me, what looked to be several hundred feet or so, a very sharp and definite outline appeared.  It was an equilateral triangle and had three circular areas symmetrically placed near the tips. There was a slight contrast between the gray triangular area and the circular areas, as the circular portions ! had a very faint glowing quality to them.  As it silently continued moving away from me, the craft seemed to have only 2 dimensions.  It looked completely flat like it was a projection.  It began to gently ripple with smooth wave patterns and disappeared within a little over a second after doing so. The total event lasted around 8 seconds. I have my master’s degree in physics and teach college level physics as a career.  I am also involved in astronomy.  I am about 20 minutes drive from a naval base and do hear and see military aircraft from time to time. Though it is possible that I was seeing a ""secret aircraft,""  I am doubtful that such a craft would be flown in such plain view as it was very apparent what was seen.  Judging from the change in angular diameter, its descent was fairly rapid and it changed from a dark, fluctuating shadow into a crisp configuration, lightly contrasted against the clear dark sky.  I would estimate the base of the triangle to be around 50 feet, though I could be way off.   Once leveled off at around 500 feet, it glided forward at perhaps 100 miles per hour until it disappeared from sight somewhat like a mirage does. The measured angle from the horizontal at which the craft began to wave out of sight was around 20 degrees.  It all happened very fast and was short in duration, m! aking it difficult to be definite on measurements.  All in all, I saw a craft without doubt and I am perplexed by what I have seen.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,34.29657455830389,-119.23991625441697

The two lights moved in a perfectly straight line across the sky, but were paired up with each other, and swapped relative positions with each other several times, one behind the other, then rotating to side by side, then back to front-and back, a few different times, randomly. The lights were a constant brightness, no blinking or wavering, they did not leave a trail. There was no sound at all. The whole incident was over in perhaps 3 seconds.

The sky was partly cloudy, the sun was down, but the sky was still light. This section of highway looks down over Holyoke to the left.  Westover Air Reserve base rotating beacon is easily seen on the left. I noticed 3 orange lights to the right of the highway in a triangular formation. They appeared to be independent - (not connected to one another). They were to my right and forward of my position.  They were roughly 600’ high and clearly visible.  There are several airfields in this area, so at first I thought little of the lights - but the color was a distinctly different orange color, very different from any surrounding lights in the area. They were about as bright as a small plane's landing light.  There were no aircraft strobes, tail beacon, or nav lights. All 3 lights were approximately the same distance apart, with 2 in front, and 1 in the rear.  They appeared to be moving together very slowly in a north, north east direction - very smoothly.  My view became obscured momentarily due to a line of trees on the right side of the highway. Once past the tree line and the lights were back in view, the rear light appeared to just go out.  I fully expected to see some kind of craft (airplane, balloon, etc.) where the rear light had been, but there was nothing.  I then lost sight of them since I had past them by then.  The sighting was approximately 1 minute. It was only the odd color of the lights, and the numerous reports from the 4th of July weekend that prompted me to submit a report.

It was a glowing orange ball (orb?) heading on a north by northwest trajectory and was about 200-300 feet in the sky.  It was totally silent, was going very straight and swift, and was quite bright.  The light intensity was steady, never flickered or changed intensity at all.  It never deviated in elevation as it came overhead and passed over us. We were almost under it. My one daughter was actually crying it was so odd.  The thing that baffles me most....I never saw anything like it before.  I really wanted to say it was a Chinese sky lantern or a homemade hot-air balloon....but I never saw one ever like this. I used to make and fly model hot-air balloons....I even sold plans on how to build one in the classifieds of a particular magazine.  I've made them out of clear dry cleaner bags and tissue paper, etc.  I've flown probably 60-70 model hot-air balloons in my lifetime (I'm 43) and never seen anything like what we saw on the night of July 2.   Me and my wife are avid sky watchers and definitely know what meteors, satellites, planes, ISS etc looks like. This defies explanation to us. What we saw, and we were CLOSE to it.... was a bright round orange light inside what seemed to be a perfectly round glass sphere...  I guess that would be my best description.  I would guess...and this is just a guess based on my experience...to be around 7-8 ft in diameter.  Perhaps what seemed to be a glass sphere surrounding the ball of light could've actually been just the ""flare"" effect of the bright light. Also.... we had a county fair going on that night.....but this came from a direction that it couldn't possibly have came from the fair...I'm puzzled to explain it.",2010-07-10T00:00:00,41.64256582914573,-86.1410391959799

It is several acres of park ground with an outdoor stage for concerts, etc.  We were seated in lawn chairs on the west side of the park/stage area.  A few feet to the west of us is a street, on the other side of which is Addison Airport for small planes.   As part of the festivities there were flyovers by vintage war airplanes, circling the park area.  The wind section of the symphony was playing music on the stage as the vintage planes occasionally circled the park.  Our chairs were facing the stage, a few yards to our southeast, with the airport behind us.  I do not know the time, but it was still light, approximately 8- 8:30 pm. I happened to notice and began to watch something bright orange, somewhat circular in shape, approaching from the behind the stage (from the south) travelling in a straight line to the northwest, crossing over the Addison airport. I pointed it out to my friend and we both watched as a 2nd object appeared behind the first one.  The two objects flew silently in a straight line from south to northwest.  There was nothing unusual about the flight pattern, only that they were bright orange and that I had never seen anything of that color before, and that they were somewhat circular in shape. The vintage planes had been flying at a lower altitude where you could clearly see their shape.  The two orange objects were a lot higher in the sky, but low enough to appear an approximate 4 inch diameter as we viewed it.  They moved quickly.  Our line of sight was about a mile, and it took a couple of minutes for them to disappear from view. We both watched and commented about it. I made a joke that maybe it was ufo’s for our 4th of July festivities. They were definitely not airplanes as we know them. I have never seen any kind of ufo before and I didn’t think any more about it until I heard your report on Coast to Coast that there were many such sightings on July 4, and I mentally noted that we had seen these objects on July 3, but at a July 4 celebration.

We saw 4 bright WHITE lights hanging in the sky NW of our home in the distance.   They were equally spaced in a horizontal formation tilted up from bottom left to top right.  The lights faded in and out several times.  They also circled around one another several times, before going back into a horizontal line formation.  At one point they all came together in a focused point.  They fanned back out into the horizontal slanted formation.  Then, as though you were shutting off the lights, they disappeared one after another.  The height of the lights was a ½ a story above the sight line of the closest home, approximately 200 yds. away.  I’m not a UFO believer, but I can’t think of any rational explanation for what I saw.  Cloud cover is extremely low at ~1000 feet.  Of note, the Dayton air show IS in town and toward that direction, BUT the ended today at 5:00 p.m.   Amanda I noticed 4 bright lights in a line.  They remained in a line approximately 15-30 seconds after I first noticed them.  I was looking North/Northwest from the deck that is approximately 12’ off of the ground (ground is elevated from a pond).  I noticed the lights begin to move and seemed to orbit around one another when I mentioned that to my friends.  The lights began rotating around and additionally, starting to move in a non-linear pattern.  The lights started flashing.  Specifically, the farthest light from the front and/or on the right began flashing on and off.  This lasted approximately 1 minute.  The lights moved further west and then they began to flash on and off in sequence; each one time on and then off.  At the very end, the lights flashed off, one light at a time until all the lights were off.  The lights were bright and resembled a street light without the aura around it.     My name is Cheri F and I live in Lebanon, OH. I was sitting on my back deck tonight (Sat, July 18) when we noticed 4 odd lights in the distance, northwest of our house. They were the strangest things I’ve ever seen. When we first saw them, I ran inside and grabbed the camera to take video. They seemed to move in a snake-like formation. One would fade away and then reappear on the other end. I’ve been to numerous air shows and come from a history of air force veterans/pilots and these didn’t move like anything I’ve ever seen before. They kind of floated/hovered but seemed to move very fast when they did move. They didn’t twinkle or flash, they were just solid orbs of light. There definitely seemed to be a “leader” among the lights. We watched as they moved into the distance, converged into one, broke back out and then disappeared one at a time like lights switching off.  RJ S On the evening of July 18th, I was at my friend Andy’s house in Lebanon, Ohio.  I was on Andy’s deck with him and his wife Cheryl and my girlfriend Amanda.  Amanda noticed something in the sky and directed our attention to it.  At first glance, it appeared to be airplanes.  I know that the Dayton, OH air show was today, so I assumed that it was just some planes from that event.  However, upon further observation it didn’t appear to be like any plane or formation I had ever seen.  There were four “planes,” each having one bright white-ish light (pretty sure that most planes have lights on both wing and the tail).  They traveled in an “S” formation in a North-Northwest direction, with the back “4th” plane’s light slowing dimming to “off” and then turning back on.  The “planes” were traveling faster than typical planes and seemed to be flying low in the air – there have been a lot of clouds in the sky today and the planes were well below the clouds.  As the planes flew away, the first plane’s light disappeared, then the lights from the second, third and finally fourth.  They didn’t turn back on after this point – as if the planes just disappeared.  I observed the planes for probably 2-2:30 minutes before they disappeared.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,39.4543,-84.2258

I was looking to the Southeast skies from the driveway of my house.  The moon was not yet showing and there were no clouds in the sky. I saw a brightly lit object in the sky several finger widths above the horizon and wondered which planet it was since it was too large to be a star or if I was actually seeing a satellite or the space station.  To the right of the object I saw what I thought was a plane flashing a very intense green navigation light.  I say intense because it was “starring”. As I watched it, the green flashing changed in color and flashing pattern. The color changed from a light green through the color spectrum to a purple between flashes or it glowed a few seconds changing colors.  The flashing pattern wasn't steady. I studied the object several minutes perceiving that its flight path was stalling, then changing course by several degrees, then correcting to its original course.  To make sure I wasn’t seeing things I went inside to ask my brother in law to look at it as well.  I thought I was seriously seeing things.  As he came outside it was still very high in altitude but closer to us.  We both stood in my driveway looking at the object continue to change: color, light intensity, speed, and minute direction. Its general course was to the Northwest. At this time we had been watching it for 9 minutes and it was just past directly overhead.  I was expecting to see the red navigation light or an anti-collision light but there weren’t any.  It stopped and hovered at a very high altitude for several minutes. About this time a neighbor was coming outside to get in his car and drive somewhere.  He paused for a moment looking at my bother in law am I staring at the sky above us.  Then he looked up through his windshield and promptly rolled down his window asking us what that was that we all were looking at. He said, ""I don’t think it’s a plane.""  To which we both said, ""Not sure yet, but it could be.""    As we said that it started moving directly to the south.  It didn’t make a rolling turn.  There was no normal aircraft movement in that you would normally see.  Even a fast break with speed flaps does not turn 140 degrees to the left instantly.  It continued on the southern course and a much faster rate of speed and appeared to be getting smaller.  Then it suddenly disappeared or stopped flashing.  As it did so, the stars in the area started to all blink in unison.  They blinked like this for several minutes then did the normal blinking from atmospheric condition if you will.  I have a background in military aviation maintenance and as a flight observer on helicopters.  I have flown over 450 hours of night flights both aided and unaided.

They would move left or right and sometimes drop altitude then ascend again, then hover in one position and fade out, then flair up again, and it started the sequence all over again. They looked like they would sometimes form a pattern. For example, two of the lights got into a straight line, but with some distance between them. Then they both moved away from each other, and then eventually faded away. Many of them did this randomly all around us, but mostly just in pairs. We saw a few of them seem like it dropped another light (aircraft) from under it. Also, we saw many planes fly over us so we were able to compare the lights and you could clearly tell that the lights weren’t any type of plane.

Our table was located right next to a large picture window, facing North at the end of Main Street.   As I looked out, I noticed a small Cessna airplane flying slowly on its final approach to the Bismarck airport.  Just as I was losing sight of the Cessna, I looked back to my right and spotted a silver metallic object flying extremely fast in a straight line from East to West.   The object appeared to be disk shaped, similar to a double-convex lens if looked at from a side view.  The object was approximately 1/4 mile to the North and appeared to be flying at a lower altitude than the Cessna had been, I estimate about 300 to 400 feet above ground level.  I believe the airplane would have been moving at about 80 knots, therefore, I would estimate the disk shaped object was moving at between 500 and 700 mph, as I lost sight of it within 2-3 seconds.   The object appeared to be a little smaller than the airplane, approximately 18 feet in diameter. I am an amateur radio operator and trained weather spotter.  I have taken fixed wing flying lessons and have built and flown R.C. model aircraft for many years.  I am familiar with most types of aircraft and I have seen anything in the sky like this before.

It was traveling at a very high rate of speed.  The fireball was bright orangish and was directly to the west of us. We could see it as it passed in and out of the low clouds, reminded me of the flame coming off a missle. But, I didn't think it was.  A few minutes later we saw another one.  Same type direction and so forth.  The Fourth one though, came out of the south and flew directly over head at which point I could no longer see it for the clouds.

I saw a, steadily Red, glowing light/object in the SW sky heading from SW to N-NE. (more north I think)  No other lights on the object that I could see.   Moving at speed of an airplane but no sound, no “structure” seen, no blinking/flashing lights and if I recall correctly it was just below the overcast/clouds it may have been “reflecting a bit” off of them.   It was definitely low in the sky at height of planes I often see going into O’Hare. Time Lapse  Aprox 10-15 Secs.    Aprx. Time: 11pm well after fireworks. I was standing looking around in the sky at the stars, planes etc.  I had a set of binoculars around my neck (which I occasionally do now when observing the night sky).  This object caught my attention as I happened to be looking SW.  I kept looking with my bare eyes as it traveled closer towards me (initially dismissing it as probable helicopter or plane). When I still couldn’t make it out, I took two steps forward , looked down to grab the binoculars and sit (so I could steady my hands) to get closer view…………but, in the few seconds it took to look down, grab binocs and glance back up…while trying to feel for the chair………it disappeared.  No where to be found as I continued to pan the sky and recapture it. Now, I was with one other person who did NOT see the object because it disappeared before I made any comment about it.   Even though I was VERY curious about the object, I  kind of “blew it off”  thinking, no way this happens two years in a row, it must have been legit craft and went into the clouds when I diverted my gaze. 2 Years in a row?  That’s a weird part of this occurrence.  The same thing happened last year (and I reported it on this site then -you can view it there) July 4th 2009.  At about same time/diff trajectory.  But,  in 2009 the color and appearance was more like a Hazy Orange glowing basketball/orb- more definitively round with an entirely fuzzy glow emitting from the object itself.  Now-In 2010 the object was definitely Red and I don’t think I would describe it as purely “round” NOR as having a “hazy” glow……any ambient glow was more of a steady “reflection off clouds” this time. Sorry my facts aren’t exact.  As mentioned, I wasn’t going to post this as I find it rather odd that, (1) It happened on Independence Day when millions would likely be looking to the skies.  And (2) Similar events happen two years in a row?  This does not change what I saw – either year --without a doubt.  But, It makes me suspicious that somebody might be pulling off a big hoax/scam/trick somehow….or, some manmade flying thing makes the same trip every year on the 4th?  There were many sightings last year too. I decided to post my observation after I went into your site to see, by chance, if anyone else saw what I saw and was surprised to see one other Streamwood, IL. report. Plus many others elsewhere.  I hope you can investigate this somehow to see if there is an “earthly” answer.  Next year on 4th maybe you can send out trained spotters in Midwest with good equipment?  Last comment:  I found the July 4th 2009 Orange Hazy Glowing Ball much more disturbing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was looking east at about 9:45pm when I noticed what looked like a lantern with orange flames in it up in the sky.  It was slowly moving NNE.  Then I noticed that there were 3 ""lanterns"" in formation moving NNE at about 20 mph.  I thought they were part of some type of airplane until I noticed that I could see distant fireworks within the triangle formed by the 3 objects. My father's eyesight is not as good as mine and he did not see the objects clearly.  He did report seeing ""dim lights"" but nothing clearly. The objects were moving in the exact same direction and speed.  One object was in the lead and the other two were at the same altitude following.  All objects appeared to be like flames – orange and flickering. It appeared that the ""flames"" were encased in rectangles.  The objects were bigger than stars but much smaller than the moon.  I would estimate the objects to be 20 feet high by 15 feet wide, at about 500 feet altitude, approximately a half mile away.  The objects continued to move NNE until they were out of sight.

Report #2 Last Friday, July 9th at around 1pm, I witnessed an aircraft hovering in the sky for a few minutes while speaking with Evva.  I thought it was hovering at a height much higher than consistent with commercial airliners landing or having just taken to the sky. I was standing at 1390 Grand View Drive in Berkeley and it seemed like the aircraft was directly above us.  The color of the aircraft was dark brown or black and shaped like a perfect cylinder, with neither any tapering at either end or anything resembling the wings of an airplane.  The end of the aircraft looked like the color chrome, but that may have been the sunlight glinting off of it.  Based on the altitude I estimate the aircraft was hovering at, it seemed like it's size was much larger than a commercial aircraft. After a few minutes, the aircraft reoriented itself from an original position consistent with the hull of an airplane flying horizontally to one flying vertically, while still holding almost the exact same position in the sky.

It was a clear blue sky and I was east of Skykomish at the Martin Creek trailhead for the Iron Goat Trail.  I thought I would head further up the road past the trailhead parking area on US Forest Service road 6710 for some pictures.  (There were two cars in the dirt parking lot).  Further on, I pasted a parked white full size van with a family that had been apparently hiking. I came to a side road that headed up the mountain on my right. I decided to take that road up to get some pictures of the scenery.  I then decided I would drive up as far as I could go where I could turn around safely. I found that spot and turned around and stopped to get my pictures.  From this spot I took 11 pictures, a few east up the valley and a few back down the road I had just come up.  I finally got back in my truck and headed back down the hill.  It was not until after my vacation when I returned back to California that I reviewed the pictures after they were enlarged on my computer at work.  I noticed on three pictures a spot that I thought must have been on the lens. All the other pictures had nothing on them. One was taken up the valley to the east and one to the west. Another at Mount Rainier National Park.  I became very interested when I enlarged these photos and wanted someone to take a look at them. I am sending a third photo that was taken on Thursday July 15, 2010 at 11:53 a.m. (exact) at Mount Rainier National Park from the east side of the mountain on the road up to Sunrise.

The UFO I talked about seemed to appear as if it came out of a hole in the night sky about a half mile from me.  I also mentioned that it seemed to be headed down at an angle that would take it to a small grouping of ground lights that looked like a small town in the distance.   The craft crossed the highway in front of me and just as it came closer to the ground it disappeared as if into another hole in our air space.  I pulled off the highway, took out my Road Atlas to find out what town the ground lights in the distance was.  There were no towns on the map, however, the area in question was shown on the map with the words ""Military Reservation"".    About a half mile further down the road, I came to a very long road going off to the right towards the lights.  There was no sign of any kind. Until the UFO sighting reported today above the airport in China, I had never heard of a rectangular UFO being reported.  The photo shown in the report is representative of the UFO I observed years ago in Washington State.   I thought my comments might be important to someone.

I pointed to one in the western sky headed due north and at approximately 40 degrees above the horizon and had them watch it.  It was approximately the same size and brightness of the surrounding stars. My husband flashed his Ryobi flashlight twice at the ""satellite"" and it stopped  WNW of us.  It lit up about as bright as 20 or 30 stars. He again flashed his Ryobi at this light and again it flashed as brightly as the first time.  The flashes were approximately 15 seconds apart. While the others watched to see if it would move I came in and got the phone to call this in to NUFORC.  I took the phone out with me and the object was still stationary.  The position of the light was roughly 10 degrees south and west of  Phecda.   I could see it until 11:02pm EST when it dimmed out and was no longer visible.  We did not see it continue north. The visiting couple were scared enough to leave, which they did while I was still on the hotline.

At approximately 11:45 pm on Thursday, January 7, 2010, a co-worker and myself went outside to warm up our vehicles due to the cold weather.  As we were starting the vehicles, we both caught sight of an object in the air approximately 1 mile away.  We both made reference as to how low the object was, maybe 1-2000 feet in the air.  The trajectory of the object was by no means in the direction of any nearby airports, and was flying in an extremely straight path.  These things in and of themselves are not entirely out of the ordinary.  However, the following statements were mind baffling. The speed of the aircraft was very slow.  Judging from our vantage point, the object appeared to be moving somewhere in the range of 30-50 mph.  To say that the object was “probably 2 miles up in the air so it appeared to move slower than it was” does not apply here.  If that were the case, then my estimated size of the object would be about 1000 feet wide, as opposed to the large airliner-size that it appeared.  There were 3 lights on the object; one on each of the sides, and one near what would be considered the back. The final piece of information about the object was that it was completely silent.  On a clear, cold night in January, with little or no wind to affect the sound, almost any plane in the air is audible to some extent. Not this particular object.   Normally with an aircraft at 5 times its height a faint engine roar could still be heard; but totally silent.   We watched the object for a couple of minutes as it slowly made its way off into the distance.   It was not until I got home and started looking online did I realize that I very well might have seen a UFO.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,41.3083,-72.4653

When I came around a slight curve, just before a long straight away, I noticed lights ahead of me and to the right just above the tree line.  The lights were not immensely bright, like a star or a spot light, but more like soft, white lights seen in recessed fixtures, which these looked very similar to.  There were four lights in a straight, horizontal line, with equal distance inbetween each light(approx. 10-15 ft)and seemed to be fixed in relation to one another.  Since there is only an empty pasture in the area the lights were over, it struck me as very odd to see them there.   While attempting to grasp an idea of what type of aircraft would be that low (150-200 ft approx) I was assuming I would see a newly constructed drilling rig in the field with an illuminated light platform.   But as I approached, slowing down to get a better look, I realized the object! seemed to be moving southwest towards my north-northwest approach.  My wife, who was just ahead of me in another vehicle, did not see the lights at all as she passed.  There was a vehicle right behind me on this two lane road,so I couldn't stop - as I wanted to.  Instead I slowed to a crawl as I reached the spot the lights were hovering or flying by, leaning forward as much as possible to see to my right if I could see a structure attaching the lights.  At the same time I rolled my window down to see if I could hear a jet engine or roto blades as I passed.  The only thing I could hear was my truck engine and the road.  I believe the object passed over me from the passenger side as  I passed the spot I originally saw them at.  I looked back over my right shoulder to see if I could see the back side of the lights and I couldn't see anything.  I drove into my neighborhood, constantly looking back to see if I could see anything and there was nothing there.  My wife and I grabb! ed a video camera from the house and drove back out minutes la! ter to s ee if we could see anything at all and there was nothing else unusual.  The next day we drove down the same road several times, taking pictures of the area the lights were seen.  By estimating the one stand of trees just in front of the lights, I would guess the lights were just above them at 150-200 ft. above the ground.

I became very familiar with the flight pattern into and back out of the airport, having taken over 15 trips by the date of this sighting.   After arriving at the airport I would rent a car and travel East on Touhy to my hotel in Skokie.  Each week I enjoyed watching the incoming flight line.  Planes would only be about a few hundred to a couple thousand feet up at that point.  I knew this by listening to the flight deck communications when I would arrive.   On this Sunday early evening I noticed a particularly large aircraft with the typical front fuselage and side wing lights in a triangle pattern.  Usually the larger aircraft appear to be moving slowly due to their size.  As I traveled east on Touhy, however, I noticed that this large aircraft appeared to be moving too slowly - not what I was used to seeing.  Within a few moments I realized it was hovering, and the motion was mine.   As I approached Western Ave intersection I noted that it was hovering above buildings to my right.  I turned the corner on Greenwood to make a run around the block to hopefully see it from behind.  Instead I saw it in the same place as I rounded the block - it definitely was hovering, and it was a large dark triangle with a few lights to define its shape.   On Touhy again I decided to round the block one more time and stop on a side street to get out to have a look.  By the time I got to a stopping place it was gone.  At no time did I hear any noise from the object.   I am a research scientist with trained observation skills, and can say for sure that I saw a hovering triange shaped aircraft that was out of place in this area.  On my return to the airport Wednesday of that week (it was Thanksgiving week) it was daylight, and I noted that there were no towers or any other structures in the area that could have explained this craft.   I have permanently located to the Chica go area now and would be happy to review the sighting on site.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

This happened back in January, 2009.  I don't recall the exact date, but I have seen a couple of reports on your website of similar sightings, so I thought I would report it.   My wife, my daughter and I were travelling home at approximately 9:00 pm.  We were heading east on Jericho Turnpike, in the eastern portion of Commack, approaching Smithtown.  My wife was driving, I was in the front passenger seat and my daughter (17) was in the back seat.  Traffic was light, as it was a cold winter evening.  We were stopped at a red light when suddenly I saw, above and ahead of us, what looked like a shooting star....except it was very large, and bright green!   The first thought that entered my head was a meteor.  It was heading in a northerly and downward direction, so it passed in front of us from right to left.  It was only visible for a couple of seconds, as it was moving very fast, but as it flashed by, it momentarily lit up the sky around it in a bright green color.  As I stated , it was moving in a downward trajectory, so much so that it looked like it might crash in the neighborhood to our north, and I silently braced myself to hear some sort of explosion.  But nothing more happened.  After the object had passed, I waited a few seconds and then asked (trying not to sound too excited) ""did anyone just see that?""  To my relief (that I wasn't having hallucinations), both my wife and daughter replied, tentatively, ""ummm...yeah"".  I then asked whether either of them had any idea what we might have just seen.  My wife, almost too quickly, blurted out ""oh, it must have just been a shooting star"".  I could tell by her voice that she really didn't believe this, but my wife is someone who does not like to engage in any discussions about anything paranormal, etc.  So, I just let this go, and didn't bother to comment that I've seen many shooting stars in my lifetime; that they are not this BIG; and that they aren't BRIGHT GREEN!  I tried to make more light conversation about what we'd just seen, but I ! got the distinct impression that both wife and daughter were a bit creeped out by it, and didn't want to talk about it, so I dropped the subject.  However, one last postscript to this....about a mile east of our sighting, we encountered a County police car coming in the opposite direction toward us.  The officer was not using his siren, but had all of his emergency flashers on, and was driving at a high rate of speed.   He was obviously making a silent response to something urgent, and as he approached us, he made a screeching right turn onto a side street and headed north into the neighborhood where I thought our ""shooting star"" might crash.  (He made the turn almost on two wheels, and was drivng so fast that my wife commented, ""Whoa....where's HE going?"")   I don't know if the two events were just coincidence....or if the officer saw the same thing that we did!  I have no idea what it was that we saw...I am not saying it was a ""flying saucer""....just that it was NOT an ordinary shooting star.  I won't say it was unlike anything else I've ever seen, because I did have a similar sighting several years ago, late at night, while sitting on my deck.  In that instance, however, the same type of green ""shooting star"" went directly overhead, travelling west to east, and did not appear to be travelling downward.   I don't wish to identify myself, just to say that I consider myself a qualified observer, as I am a 24-year-veteran law enforcement officer.

We all saw a bright orange light moving roughly from west to east, and we stopped all of our festivities (musicians included) to watch.  The fireworks for the evening had ended several minutes before. The sighting took about 4-5 minutes before the sphere was out of sight.  It flew (floated) directly over the restaurant. I estimate its height to be no more than 4,000 feet above the ground. The object appeared small, maybe a few meters across, and, just like last year's sighting, emanated a fuzzy orange color that looked a lot like a plasma.  There was no sound, and several other attendees said they had also seen the same kind of event last year. From there, I walked back to my home, and continued to look for more orange lights.  I wasn't disappointed.  I sat on my rooftop, and after about 5 minutes, another orange sphere came from the north and traveled almost exactly south, until it was out of sight.  It floated quite a distance away over the ocean.  So from where I live, I was looking directly west.  There was no sound. About two minutes later a third orange sphere, this time maybe 300 yards closer to my home, floated by, north to south. Again, no sound.  These orange spheres were then followed by two red spheres, each about two to three minutes apart, and each one slightly closer to my home, by what appeared to be equal distances.  It looked as though they were all following a specific north to south direction in a grid pattern, all of the objects acting together. If I take all of the spheres as one complete sighting, then the sighting lasted a total of about 30-35 minutes.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,,

Of course the tree is stationary and you can see in the video how the star/balloon UFO was moving back and forth. my brother ran inside to get the tripod kuz it was difficult to zoom and focus of the object, then we lost it. I continued to look for it up in the sky and found it again, I tryied recording it but it was too small to focus on. Then i noticed that there was another next to it and it seemed as if they were playing (they were moving close and away from each other). Seconds later I lost sight of them again and then noticed a third maybe twice as far or small as the previous and it simply blended into the blue sky.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

Even when it has been cloudy and there are no stars out, this bright white light is still there. We got our telescope out and the next night we looked at it and the way to describe it best was it was shaped like a round fried egg, sunny side up.

This is a letter I wrote about my sighting to my wife overseas. It includes a lot of details that you might find interesting or useful, so I will include everything instead of typing a new report. I just heard that there was a report on San Diego Local News within the last few 3 days of people reporting the same sighting. Monday Febuary 23rd 2009  I swear to you on my life Yas'...this is all true....This is how it happened....It was about 1:10 am...I went out onto the back deck to call in my cat. She didn't appear. I sat down in my usual spot and lit a cigarette to wait for her. As I looked back up I saw three little red lights way off in the distance. Jets I thought. We live right in the middle of the flight path for San Diego Airport, so I watch the incoming jets lined up in the distance 20 or 30 miles away when it's clear. Which it was this night. No clouds. But I quickly noticed that there was something different about these lights. They weren't staggered like planes lining up for their landing approach which I I've seen thousands of times in my life and watched out here for the last month and 1/2 everynight. Next I'm like, but the Airport is closed. It's been closed for at least an hour. No incoming or outgoing flights until 6:00 am. So I'm thinking smaller private planes..? Military Jets.? Why are the lights not flashing like ALL jets and planes do..with red lights on the right wing and green on the left. These are just red. Constant ..No flash at all. And they are coming closer, but they are still all together like in a pattern. They were getting brighter and bigger, but they were moving much slower than any planes..Taking way longer to get to where they should be in the landing path. Helicopters..?  They are getting closer and it's starting to hit me that I may be seeing something very strange. By now I'm standing up going saying out loud to myself...What the hell are those ? And they just kept coming still way off maybe 10 miles or more..But defenitely coming straight towards me. It was getting weirder by the second as they kept approaching.Then I slipped in the door and grabbed the binoculars. Is it a blimp..? Some kind of balloon. It was defenitely not an aircraft, helicopter or anything like that. It was coming right up over the top of the mountain ridge on the other side of the valley. And it was then I really started to kinda freak out..not really, but more like excited...what was it.... I came back out on the deck and I put the binoculars up to my eyes and focused. What I saw made my jaw drop. It was Huge..I mean the size of a Football field.One more second and that was it..Everything suddenly clicked in my brain... I had logically ruled out every possible explanation. It was a UFO. My mind had no doubt at that point. I was seeing a ""real"" UFO. I was wittnessing what they call a ""sighting"". I knew I had never seen anything like this in my life and then I realised it was one soild object. A triangle. It was perfectly visible now and moving slow...floating no sound..It just hit me..NO Sound at all.  Oh my God. I was in shock. Through the binoculars it was very clear and I could now see the defenite shape of a triangle and just then it started to turn slightly and I could see the red lights..one on the nose and two on the rear tips. A giant silent floating triangle. I couldn't beleive what I was seeing...but yet I really did..I knew. I kept staring in amazement..And the it rotated even more and swung around completly where I could see it from the side. It was incredible.! Then it just stopped..and hung there and I focused the binoculars on it again and I could cleary see the outline of the triangle. barely visible..but it was defenitely there..It was slightly brighter than the sky behind it, but it blended in so well you had to really look closely to see it. Oh my God ! Picture..I gotta get a picture...!  By now I had been watching it for at least 7 minutes or more...It just hung there..almost motionless...completly silent...Like I said it was giant...three times the size of even our largest Jumbo Jets...Bigger than the Damm Space Shuttle..My mind was racing now...I was afraid to walk away and grab the camera in case it did someting or took off...But I made my move...Boom I dashed in the house..snatched my Mom's camera and ran back out..10 seconds....Still there...! I turned on the camera and started to take the shot, but the display menu was on the screen and in the viewfinder and it wouldn't shoot...Damm it..! I kept messing with it with one eye on the lights...I could not get it to work..I tried for two more minute I'd say and then I gave up....And went back to staring through the binoculars...It was absoultely stunning. My brain is racing a million miles an hour.... With thoughts like........Is anyone else seeing this...? Can I be the only one in this entire valley that is seeing this...? Should I call someone..?...who...? 911...? the news station..?...Someone has to see this....God why is the camera stuck.. I am standing here looking at a UFO just hanging in the sky and I can't get a picture..Who is gonna beleive this..?   Mom...!  I have to wake her up...I start to go inside to wake her up...What if it's gone by the time she gets out here...? She is gonna think I have lost my mind or I am drunk or on drugs or something...Anything except seeing a UFO....! Oh well..I have to take a chance it will still be here...it's been here this long and with no sign of moving..I hesitated only a few seconds more and made my move...she can make the camera work...! It's her camera.!...Boom..I ran.....Ten seconds I am upstairs at her door pounding Mom Get Up..! Mom..! Wake up.....!  She answers starteled from her sleep...Jeffrey what is it....?  Whats wrong..?     I hear her getting up... Outside....Look out the window..!  She says while frantically getting dressed, Whatis it...?   I don't know I said....Lights..Red Lights...We gotta get a picture....!   She gets to her window and looks out I guess and says ...""Jeffrey those lights are on the Road  across the hill""...I had already started back downstairs and was yelling..""Get down here..Hurry..You gotta see this and the damm camera won't work...!  I hear ""my step father""grumbling in the background....""What the Hell is going on ?"".... I hollared back at him..Get up _____, get out here quick...get your camera..your not gonna beleive this thing...! I was gone  In less than a minute I was back out and I looked up praying it was still there. It was. Same spot. Just ""hovering"" there..effortlessly. I go back to the binoculars...It is mesmerizing. A few seconds later and Mom is beside me...Still not sure what I'm seeing....She looks out and says again..""my name""...""Those lights are on the hill over there""  Kinda pointing across the valley off to her right .....I say No Mom...Up there..In the Sky......and point as I handed her the binoculars.  She puts them up to her eyes and fixes on the lights.....I waited for what I knew was coming.....Oh My God.!...Jeffrey..What is that ?  It's a UFO Mom...""There is no doubt in my mind"". Look at that thing...the size of it. She already knew I was right. It was undeniable. It can be nothing other than a UFO. She just keeps staring going...""Oh My God...It's unbeleivable...""  I start pointing out all the details...No sound...the outline..telling her to look really close and keep the binoculars very still. She could see it all perfectly..She was astonished. I could still see it fine with just fine without the binoculars.  ""We gotta get a picture Mom...Fix the camera... I practically hand to pry the binoculars out of her hand and handed her the camera.. She turned it back on and waited for it to set, but it did the same thing..and she kept messing with it but it wouldn't take a shot. It just kept getting stuck.And I knew it wasn't going to. I was frantic to get a photo and yelled for ""My step father"" again a few seconds later he was there. Still half asleep ..going ""What the Hell you guys..."".....We just pointed...and I handed him the binoculars. All the while, Mom is still fumbling with her camera, looking up and down still shocked. Then it's ---""his""--- turn..After he looks at it for a few seconds....Same thing...""Oh My God""...That is a UFO ____...!..Look how big it is..!  We said something like Yes...Yes..Get your camera ----------This one is stuck... Another minute of mumbling words and staring at it in awe and he hands Mom the binoculars and takes off for his camera. I was pissed that I don't have one right now, except for on my phone, and that would not have shown up so far away. Even with their cameras it might not show up very well but I think it should be visible and it could be some kind of proof. Mom and I just keep staring and I tell how it appeared and everything. We were both still toatally stunned. What a sight. We were so excited and were convinced it was very real. Our eyes couldn't lie to us. By now it had been over 15 minutes since I first saw it. ______ comes back with his camera, and gets ready to shoot....But of course...It goes dead....He turns it back on...Boom...It shuts down again...Dead battery...We are all frustrated...Damm It.I don't know what is more unbeleivable..A UFO hanging in the sky in front of us or that we have two cameras that won't work....I can't beleive we can't get a picture... Another couple minutes and we realized that neither camera was going to work and we were disappointed, but still excited. We talked about calling 911...the police...fire department...But we just kept staring. I am serious Baby...It was truly Fantastic..I wish you could have been here to see it yourself. Then as we continued taking turns with the binoculars, It started to move again. We all said something...It began to turn it's nose back toward the direction it had came from go sideways..the it suddenly pulled up until it became completely vertical...straight up and down like it was standing on it's tail end with it's nose pointing straight up in the sky. It stopped there for a few seconds, and then it flipped around and went back leveled out facing the direction it had appeared from and hovered there again. To see it turn like that we all knew that anything we have that flys in the sky can not make those manuevers...especially without making a sound....We watched...eyes wide open..fascinated.... But what happened next was the most incredible part of the whole thing and left us almost speechless..It slowly began to disappear...one light at a time....what looked like the ""front light"" slowly dimmed out...It wasn't moving away though like the way it approached. It was actually vanishing....the 1st light...then the 2nd and then the 3rd...it took about 30 seconds to disappear. And it was gone just like that. It wasn't like it moved far away or went up or anything..it completly vanished right in mid air. We talked about the whole thing for about 45 minutes...All kinds of ideasand questions...what it was...what it wasn't...why was it here...did anyone else see it or report it..get a picture or video.....Is it possible for us to be the only people to see it....On and on..... We turned on the news and went through the local channels..Nothing.... We said we should report it..but to who..?...the police..and what would they do...Laugh..Probably take the report and throw it away..thats it. So I said I would go on the internet and find a UFO ""Hotline"" or something and make a report and see if anyone else made any reports also. About an half an hour after it had gone I looked out my window and saw several small planes flying around the area which was wierd that late at night..They flew around the area for a while and they flew off. I went back to the internet and a few hours later the next thing I knew it was 6:00 and the sun was coming up. Then I heard jets... Military jets...they were blazing around all over up there going around in a sort of big circle. This went on for about half an hour and then fly off away. They defenitely looked like they were looking for something. I'm pretty sure I know what it was..!  As of now I have not found any peports from that night, but I haven't looked yet today..But I will. Someone had to have seen it too.  What an experience Yas'. I'm not kidding Babe it was straight out of a movie scene...but undeniably real. Thank God I woke Mom and _______  up and we all saw it together...Otherwise they would probably beleive I saw something..but that it was something more explainable than a UFO. But we all agree it wasn't. I am 100% positive in my mind that it was some kind of ""Craft""...Who was inside it is the big question. Extraterrestrials...?or was it the military testing a secret ""spacecraft"" which we supposedly crashed in Roswell New Mexico back in the 1947and we learned how to work and used the technology to build our own ""Ships"". All that goes on about 600 miles or so from San Diego in Nevada at the militarys most secretive base called Area 51. People claim they have all kinds of strange ""spacecraft"" out there. Who really knows. Why would they fly anything down here in San Diego..? I personally don't think it was ""us"" flying that thing. I beleive it was defenitely extraterrestrial in origin. We are wondering if it will appear again.....sometimes ""sightings"" as they call them happen alot in clusters in the same area over a short period of time.....it's possible.and I'm ready with a camera that works..just in case... I doubt it.  But we'll be keeping our eyes on the sky around here thats for sure.......I stayed up last night to see if it would return...It didn't. I could go on and on about all the details but I'll stop for now.and write more later. Pretty wild huh Babe !?! I'll tell you one thing...It was defenitely an experience that none of us will ever forget as long as we live.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

We were leaving Brandon, MS and on our way back to school in Starkville, MS.  The drive is around 110 miles.  We were about 15 miles outside of Brandon when I started to see the light.  In my front windshield while I was driving, I started to see two long white objects dot in and out the sky. It was like they were moving in and out the sky or in between the clouds.  During this time my friend girl did not notice them because she was busy on the phone. After about 10 to 15 min. the disappeared from the front windshield. I didn’t want to say anything to my friend about them because I did not want her to think I was crazy. As soon as she got off the phone she asked me did I see the 4 lights going in and back and forth. They had move to the passenger side of the car. When she said that I started to freak out. I told her I seen the earlier in the front windshield but it was only 2. She started to hold the steering wheel for me while I look behind me. The were like 4 white bluish light that were oval shape. They looked an little different in shape when they were in my front windshield. The looked like 2 white bluish lights that were long. At first we thought it might have been a light tower somewhere near by but I knew it wasn’t because I come back and forth on this road at night ever weekend. The lights trailed us for about 60min or 60 miles outside of Brandon. At one point and time, it looked like we were passing them but the caught back up with us in about 5 min. I believe we would have been able to see them a little better if it wasn’t cloudy. I knew it wasn’t a light house because as soon as we come in Starkville there is a tower that shines a light that goes around. It was so cloudy that when we made it to Starkville we couldn’t really see the beam the light house was putting out. These light were going in and out of each other. It seemed like their was a light in  the center that the other lights attach from. I believe in UFO’s but I couldn’t believe I seen something like this in real life.

AS it entered it stopped in the sky almost as fast as it came in and floated slowly from my left to right, a south to north movement as I could tell. After the initial bright flash of light as it broke into our atmosphere and as it began it's glide/descent, the light quickly faded but not light instant on instant off. It just dimmed but as the celestial craft dimmed it also began to cloak or transform into a small light behind the foliage of the tree. I could see the small light just either go away from me or disappear altogether. My friend witnessed some of the event but not all; from the dimming glide to the small light. This event took about 10 seconds or so. I was in total awe but the initial reaction I felt was that stir in your stomach and that tinge of fear that comes from seeing something so celestial you just know it is not of this world. I thought. ""Oh my God"" and I exclaimed 'what is that!?!"" which was then when my friend pulled the focus. I could see the object/craft so clearly as it entered our airspace, and I say that because I have seen many things concerning outer/inner world phenomenon like fireballs screaming across the sky, meteors striking our atmosphere so hard I could see the outer layer of earth's atmosphere and even sightings of UFO's floating in the sky. This brightness entered our earth and came to a halt as if it was the easiest thing an aircraft could do. The second sighting came at 9:35pm the very same day, Sunday 27th and lasted more or less about a minute. Me and my friends jokingly said, ""let's sit outside and lets see em again."" We looked in the same position and my friend says,""here they come"" but in a joking manner because he saw a bright star coming at us. He said it again, and then again and I realized the pitch in his voice changed and this object was moving straight towards us. It was moving, no gliding across the sky from west(southwest) to east(northeast). It was in perfect view and I could see the diamond shape craft/celestial with a light that was so bright and . . . pure. I mean, I can't really describe it because I have NEVER seen such beautiful white bright light like this celestial emanated. It was smooth as glass and it was so bright and white there was this hue of blue in the center of the diamond shape... incredible beauty of light! It was so . . . pure  It was too early for a star to be this bright. Even Venus was dim because there was light in the sky still. This was as pure brightness and a color of light I had never seen.  As it moved across the sky it was unworldly in its movement. By that I mean unlike any aircraft we know today. Not like a plane or even a high flying jet aircraft. They ALL move with a worldly rhythm but this moved so effortlessly across the sky at a pace that is not of this planet.  It glided without movement or turbulence of any kind and the brightness of the light NEVER wavered.  It stayed beautiful and bright throughout the course of it's flight until it went out of our vision.  It moved from west to east and it was SILENT and PERFECT! NO SOUND came from this celestial at all.  I ran from one yard to another yard to follow the flight path and I tried videotaping it but I could not capture it.  I'll look again but it was dark on camera. I know something big is happening. It just falls into place with what I know is occurring with the planets.  My psychic ability tells me that we are in a transformation for all the human race but now I realize this is on a much larger scale than even I had foreseen. I am still in awe and I know this is not just another sighting, I just know that. Seeing something move across the sky is one thing; watching a diamond craft/celestial enter our airspace, and come to a halt like it did with such ease is another.  Maybe it didn't know, or care, that I saw it enter but it wanted us/me to see it later that evening.  It was clear and not fuzzy, it was close and not far away although I cannot tell the size from its flight.  It looked HUGE when it entered the portal early morning but much smaller when we saw it later.  I/we saw it clearly and it was, for lack of better words, beautifully perfect.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,40.8011,-121.4688

I saw something reflecting in the sky that caught my attention and pointed it out to my husband.  It was traveling from East to West, was silver, and cigar or oval shape.  We kept discussing what we thought it could be, since we were intrigued by this ""thing"" in the sky.  There was no contrail from a jet/airplane and it seemed to be hovering at times, so we ruled out that option.  My husband then thought it could be the Space Station reflecting off the sun, so we called a friend who then went to the Space Station Tracking site.  He called us back and said the Space Station was not in our area at that particular time and the Space Station only travels from West to East.  During this time, my husband pulled over the truck so I could look through our binoculars, but I could never find the object when I used them.  My husband tried! as well, but our binoculars must not be that magnified.  We then continued on our way home, while following this object in the sky.  It seemed to move very slowly and would stop and hover.  We could still see the object slowly moving when we turned and pulled over on Cty. Rd. O towards home.  While traveling on Cty. Rd.

I began to watch it as it traveled across the sky very slowly.  It was low for a jet or commercial plane, but still much higher than any blimp you would normally see.  I began to think maybe it was a weather balloon of some type, but eventually decided that since it was traveling on such a direct path that it must be some sort of vehicle with an engine.  I was first surprised by the fact of a blimp so high in the air at first, but what really surprised me was what happened after it had traveled halfway across the sky.  It was traveling at the same speed, never stopped or slowed or sped up, yet when it had traveled roughly halfway across the horizon it spat out a huge chunk of white ""smoke"".  Then about 3-5 seconds later it spit out another hunk of what I thought was smoke.  Now there were 2 dashes ! of smoke across the sky coming from what I thought was a blimp.  My second witness also witnessed these puffs of smoke.  However, seconds after these two puffs were spat out, it began to emit a CONSTANT trail of this smoke like substance, just like your typical Chemtrail (or Contrail, I suppose).  After traveling at the same speed completely across the horizon, this Blimp (which looked like a cigar covered in Aluminum foil) just SUDDENLY, out of nowhere without changing a thing in trajectory, speed, or altitude, began to omit a chemtrail. It literally looked like a giant crop-dusting blimp, miles in the air.

I live in Crestline, California. My training started at 8:00am so I had to leave Crestline about 7:00am.  As I was leaving my home, traveling East along Lake Drive, close to Lake Gregory, I spotted three objects in the morning sky. It was a clear day and the sun was rising. I was about a block from having to make a right turn onto Lake Gregory Drive towards Hwy 18 when I spotted 3 flying objects.  I immediately slowed down and glanced in the rear view mirror for just and instant to see if there were any cars behind me.  I knew I had to make a turn at the stop sign and would possibly lose sight of them, so I milked the moment and took my time getting to the stop sign.  The objects were right in front of me and I had a perfect view through the front windshield.   2 of the objects were jets and the other was a bright glowing ! disc or sphere like UFO which was traveling right in between the 2 jets, flying about the same speed.  The jets had their after burners on and I could see the exhaust trail very clearly behind them.  The UFO on the other hand had no after burner or exhaust of any kind.  They were about 2:00 high and about 30,000 to 40,000 feet up.  The jets were small in comparison to the UFO which seemed to be about twice their size. The UFO looked like a bright planet or star, which is what I thought it was at first, but then I realized because it was right in the middle between the two jets and moving along with them, it could be neither.  Because the UFO was so bright, I thought the UFO might be reflecting the morning sun but the jets undersides were not reflecting the sun so I deduced that the UFO was lit up on its own accord. I could very well be wrong about that but I figured that the jets being a much duller silver would have been lit up by the sun as well, but they weren’t. I couldn’t ! tell if they were Military jets but they appeared to be so. Th! ey defin itely were not passenger planes and they were moving much to fast.  At first the UFO was centered on each side of the two wings of the both jets then as a few seconds passed, it lagged behind a little until it was near there tails.  I could make out the UFO more clearly then the jets because it was very bright and much larger and round. The contrast was exiting. I estimated the distance between the two jets and the UFO to be about a ½ mile to a mile on each side. The UFO seemed to darken a little from a bright starry silver to a shiny metallic silver. At one point it looked as if it had blinked off and on very quickly, right before it disappeared. It also seemed to get brighter right before it blinked out. This happened right before my eyes as the two jets kept on the same direction. I was amazed when it did this but this was not the first time I have seen UFO’s and I have seen them make this kind of maneuver before.  In fact I have seen them much closer as close as 100 feet! .  Back to this sighting, I was glued to this UFO the whole time then it was just gone. This happened right before I made the right turn onto Lake Gregory Drive. I watched a bit more and waited to see if the UFO would blink back in but it did not. As I continued to visually follow the jets I felt a thump as I went off the road onto a burm that was on the right. This happened about a block after I made the right turn. This spectacle had my full attention and I was fortunate that I didn’t hit anything on the right side of me other then dirt.  I put on the brakes and came to a stop along side the road, still not taking my eyes of the 2 jets. The 2 jets kept on flying in the same direction with the after burners still on and then gradually they disappeared over the top of the mountain ridge. This took about another minute. I also noted that the exhaust contrail behind the jets were the same, which was about two inches long, so I assumed they didn’t change there speed during the! entire sighting. The jets also did not change direction or di! stance f rom each other the entire time. I concluded that the jets where either escorting this UFO or chasing it. In any case because the UFO fell behind a bit of the jets and the jets didn’t slow down with it, it appeared that the UFO was in full control of the situation. I continued to watch a bit more after the jets and their exhausts contrails were gone hoping the UFO might appear somewhere else, but it didn’t as far as I could see. I had to get to my training class and drive a little faster to make up for the lost time. I did not tell anyone at training but I did tell my family when I got home. Later on that week, I told a couple friends who are UFO buffs. It was an interesting sighting to say the least.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,34.2557,-117.304

I was almost able to make out a chevron in the first, but they were so high up and moving so fast that it wasn't a vivid chevron per say, but the color did look un-natural to the night sky (dimmer but 'steadier glow' than typical stars). The formation crossed the entire night sky and I lost sight of it as it headed further west/northwest coming from the east, almost directly overhead... about 70-80 degrees. The shapes came together or it could have been the angle, but they disappeared as they 'converged' still at approx 80 degrees.

I saw two things:  the first was clearly a jet airplane, very small and moving near the horizon in a southernly direction,  but with the blinking lights there was no question it was a jet.  I then saw what I first thought was a ""shooting star"" to the west of the jet, but it was moving in a north westerly direction--kind of at a 45 degree angle--moving UP, not down.  But it did not dissipate like a shooting star, it just kept moving upwards at a 45 degree angle at a high rate of speed for somthing that small.   It looked just like a twinkling star--similar to those in the sky around it--not like the far off jet I had already seen.   It continued to move up in the western sky, then slowed and stopped.  It looked just like the other twinkling stars in the sky.   Then it just stayed t! here, fixed.  I thought it must be another jet that had ascended then turned either away from me, or towards me, and would either grow larger or disappear, as planes at night do.  But it did neither.

Although they seemed directly above the flight pattern for landing, I expect they were slightly north/northeast. My sense were that these objects could have been parachutes as they may seemed rectangular in shape, and since they didn't appear to be moving laterally, that's all I could think of.  While watching them for about 15 seconds, a third object appeared to the east of them but was a bright blue and of the same shape.  This third object reinforced my reasoning for thinking they were parachutes, because I could imagine that being a parachute color.  The only thing that baffled me about the parachute theory was who would attempt, or get permission to parachute in this area with such heavy airline traffic. About 10 seconds after I first noticed the blue object, it disappeared.  I didn’t see it move or actually disappear, as I was talking to a passerby about it, but when I looked back up it was gone.

The white ""dot"" was high in the sky and appeared to be reflecting the sun.  I immediately assumed it may be another balloon. Upon further focus of my eyes against the clear blue sky absent of any clouds, I began to notice about 10-20 more white ""dots.""  They did appear to be stars, so I stared at them to see if they were moving.  Some appeared to be close to one another, they were in no specific pattern just sort of scattered.  I believe I perceived some of them getting really close to each other and then moving back apart.  They all were relatively stationary, not moving in any one direction but sort of holding their position. I was at a dog park, my and some other dogs where barking at the hot air balloon, so I kept having to look away.  When I looked back up, each time, there were less and less until I could no longer see any of them.   As I left the park I could see no stars or white ""dots"" anywhere. 30 mins later, in St. Peters I observed 2 what I assume were military jets judging from the contrails flying in a SE to W direction.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,38.79,-90.8549

I had an instantaneous feeling of fright consume my body because I know what I was looking at was really there.  I immediatley slowed down to try and get a better look, but another car was coming up behind me and I felt obligated to move along.  I hoped to drive along another 100 feet or so and be able to pull over and see through the trees, but when that opportunity came, I could not find the object.  The area in which the object was was about 400-500 feet off the ground....well below the two ""mountain"" tops which it was flying between.  This was not a plane or helicopter.  I think some other people may have seen this...because I noticed an unusually high number of skid marks (I could smell the freshness) on that exact spot when I went back later that day.

On 7/23/08 my wife, brother-in-law and myself were having coffee on our deck. I noticed an orange ball of light and said “Hey, what is that”? My wife and brother turned to see the OBOL (Orange ball of light) just as it was fading away. It was in the NE sky just above tree level but couldn’t tell how far away it was. We talked about it for a few minutes and we saw more lights. They didn’t move they would just fade in and stay on for about 5 -7 seconds then fade out. My wife called in to our 19 yr old son and his girlfriend and told them to come out and take a look. They both came out and we saw a set of two lights. One came on then the second. Once the second had reached its peak in brightness the first one faded out then the second faded. I said that it looked like it was only a mile or so away and I was going to drive in that direction to see what I could see. As I got over by Wainwright middle school my wife yelled into the cell phone that there was another one. I put my head between the steering wheel and the windshield of the car and it was directly above me. That one actually had a secondary light that split way from the original ball. Just before I left the house my son was getting his video camera and caught a few sets of lights on his digital video camera. He got a series of three lights just behind the tree line and the light that was over my car. The video shows the second OBOL splitting off the first one. The light I saw above my car would have bigger than my car if it had been on the ground.   I was directly under that one. There were about 6 different sets of lights that night. Some had only one, some had two and a few had three. There were 5 witnesses for the 23rd of July 2008. We saw tiny white non flashing pin lights flying all over the area where we had seen the OBOL. After we had seen the first two lights my Brother-in-law said “Look at that little white light flying after that airliner. He’s going to hit it!!!” It flew VERY fast and caught up with the airliner and fl! ew just above it until it was out of the area then peeled back and SHOT towards the east where it had came from. The very last light we had seen (I was back home by now) there we two pin point white lights closing in on the OBOL from both sides and when it disappeared the two tiny white lights shot straight up into the air nearly colliding and shot towards the north. In total there were about 4 pin lights while this was all going on. The OBOL showed up every 4-5 minutes in different areas in the NE sky. It was 22:40 when we saw the last one and went in to see if there was anything on the news. On July 24th my wife and I had to work the next morning so she went to bed and told me to wake her if I had seen anything. Right on time 22:30 the first one showed up. I ran inside got my wife and this time my daughter was home and I had her come out on the deck to watch. The lights looked the same but were in a different pattern. This time there we several lights coming on at the same time in different parts of the NE sky. On both nights if all lights would have been on they would have formed a perfect horizontal line spanning about a 5-7 mile stretch. My wife called my mother who lives in Clarkshill and her and my brother went outside and saw them. The next day I called my friend who is a police officer and he said he saw them too and had no idea what they were. So on this night we had 5 witnesses in three different parts of the county who saw them. My wife thought she saw one way off in the distance around the Delphi area, but it was too far away and she couldn’t be sure",2008-08-12T00:00:00,40.39735667215816,-86.86183146622734

I noticed a small drop of light moving through the trees and was trying to figure out if it was a lightning bug or a plane, but I never could be sure.  This was nothing compared to what we eventually saw.  We got out of the car with our flashlights and we were just goofing around.  All of a sudden, my friend calls my attention, “come here! look! Look!”  I was completely spellbound by this object.  I kept checking myself to make sure I was not crazy and we kept reassuring each other.  I was very curious and without fear as the object swarmed around the tree tops.  My friend was yelling at me to get back in the car because he was terrified.  I don’t know what would have happened if I continued to welcome the craft.  I did not feel like it wanted to do me harm, but I just felt overwhelmed.  It seemed like the more I welcomed it, the more it moved towards me and became more noticeable.  It was an orb with a revolving disc around it that was covered in lights, and it moved without any noise, and so elegantly.  It was so intricate that it is hard to describe.  It moved in all directions, stopping and changing speed.  It even followed us out to the main road and stopped when we stopped and kept observing us.  It was the most amazing experience I have ever had.  I am not a crazy person.  I know what I saw, but I don’t know what it was.

It seemed like it was responding to me somehow.  I can’t explain it.  All I know is that my eyes and mind are open and I am a believer.  It was NOT a plane.  It was NOT a hallucination.

His father reported this story to the authorities. I wouldn't bother if there weren't multiple witnesses. Here goes... It's kind of one my of things, to go outside at night and just look at stars for a while. I like to sit and watch Venus, and that's what I was doing a couple days ago around midnight. I put out my cigarette and turned to go back inside, but a much brighter light caught my eye halfway through a turn. It was something like 4 to 5 times brighter and larger than Venus appears, and it was red-orange. That light was only seen for a couple seconds before it was just gone. I couldn't tell if I was seeing things or not, so I continued to go inside. Not five minutes later, I got a phone call from my friend, saying that he and his dad were watching three of what I thought I saw. Confirmation made me run outside to see if I was missing the rest of the show, and I was. It gets very interesting here, because it was a little more than just a light show. First off, the three red-orange balls of light were moving very, very fast, AND in classic triangular formations. They ""danced,"" too. The best I can describe it is that they spiral around each other. As they ""danced,"" they individually changed in brightness and speed. It was clear there were several terrestiral aircraft in the skies observing them. The next stage of display included what seemed to be flares dropped from the lights straight down. The ""flares"" were brighter than the crafts themselves, and a distant ""boom"" or roar could be heard clearly enough. After that, the formation disappeared east. I continued to watch, but what I saw next was just different. This one was much smaller, white, and not so flashy. It flew north several times faster than the terrestrial craft it came upon. I assumed it could also be terrestrial, but then it whipped around in a circle around the airplane, hooked off the right and just disappeared. I've seen strange things in the sky before, but it's extremely rare. The last time I saw something that strange was around the time of the Arizona saucer fiasco. I'm not unsure I didn't just see the same thing myself. I have my opinions about the UFO phenomena, and then I have my observations. Next time, I would like to have something with which to document my observations on video, but under my excitement, I just didn't do it. Regardless, it's clear by the photograph of the object in Mackey, Indiana, that the same crafts or similar ones are being seen in other counties.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

Dr Mitchell, 77, said during a radio interview that sources at the space agency who had had contact with aliens described the beings as 'little people who look strange to us.'  He said supposedly real-life ET's were similar to the traditional image of a small frame, large eyes and head.  Chillingly, he claimed our technology is ""not nearly as sophisticated"" as theirs and ""had they been hostile"", he warned ""we would be been gone by now"".  Dr Mitchell, along with with Apollo 14 commander Alan Shepard, holds the record for the longest ever moon walk, at nine hours and 17 minutes following their 1971 mission.  ""I happen to have been privileged enough to be in on the fact that we've been visited on this planet and the UFO phenomena is real,"" Dr Mitchell said.  ""It's been well covered up by all our governments for the last 60 years or so, but slowly it's leaked out and some of us have been privileged to have been briefed on some of it.  ""I've been in military and intelligence circles, who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge, yes - we have been visited. Reading the papers recently, it's been happening quite a bit.""   Dr Mitchell, who has a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering and a Doctor of Science degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics claimed Roswell was real and similar alien visits continue to be investigated.  He told the astonished Kerrang! radio host Nick Margerrison: ""This is really starting to open up. I think we're headed for real disclosure and some serious organisations are moving in that direction.""  Mr Margerrison said: ""I thought I'd stumbled on some sort of astronaut humour but he was absolutely serious that aliens are definitely out there and there's no debating it.""  Officials from NASA, however, were quick to play the comments down.  In a statement, a spokesman said: ""NASA does not track UFOs. NASA is not involved in any sort of cover up about alien life on this planet or anywhere in the universe.  'Dr Mitchell is a great American, but we do not share his opinions on this issue.'",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

I had thought to myself that there is no way you would see a star at 10:10 a.m. PDST. The object proceeded to move due east and west little bits at a time making right angle turns to the north then south. The object then immediately darted accross the sky to what seemed at least 100 miles then stopping instaniously remaining stationary for some 15 minutes while moving at a slower rate but makeing right angle turns every few seconds. We continued working while it remained in the sky when suddenly I noticed it dissapeared the re-appeared near the moon again 2 seconds later. This time I noticed the intense bright white object was joined with a second bright red object looking to be the same size. They seemed to ""play"" with each other for at least 25 minutes making more right angle turns at incredible rates of speed in the western half of the sky darting from the north to south side. I could not really make out what size the UFO's were, all I can really say is it appeared to be two bright dots simular to stars in the sky. I am an experienced pilot who flew for many years since I was a child then flying for Forestry for the British Columbia Gov't and I have to say this was by no means any type of conventional aircraft that the public knows.

Slowly moving to east. Long Description of Sighting Report It was dark and clear below 2000 ft. As I was driving east on Hwy 37, past Skaggs Island, about 3-5 miles west of Vallejo, I saw two bright, white lights in the sky. At first, they appeared to be two landing lights from a larger airplane. I didn't pay too much attention to them, I just noted that it looked like an airplane, going in the same general direction as a ""right downwind"" for runway 6 at Napa Airport (KAPC). If it was a private jet in the pattern, they'd be at ~1500 ft - and that's about what it looked like. I did start to notice that the ""airplane"" seemed to be ""downwind"" longer than normal, as it didn't turn right, to base, as it should have done - so, I started watching it more closely. Maybe it was a helicopter? But, a helicopter doesn't have widely spaced ""landing lights"". Maybe it was a helicopter with an advertising grid below, with 2 large lights? It seemed odd to me - and since I'd never seen a helicopter with a lighted advertising display, that would have to been pointed towards me so that the ""directional"" landing lights would stay a brightly white, from my viewpoint. Then, oddly, the two lights, that were level, seemed to bank and turn left (to my right, as it had seemed to be heading towards me). What was odd, is that the two lights, didn't change in intensity. ""Landing lights"", are ""directional"". If they aren't pointed at you, they, basically, go out. I'm a licensed pilot with quite a bit of night flying experience - and being based up north of San Francisco Airport, you can watch the landing lights of the passenger jets take off at night and watch them wink out as the jet makes it's turn after takeoff. So, when this ""thing's"" right side light seemed to drop, and it seemed to turn ""left"" (my right), back south(ish) towards central Vallejo, it really stood out that the 2 lights didn't change in intensity at all. That would infer a non-directional light - and that wouldn't be on an airplane - as a non-directional light that bright, would blind the pilot's vision. Then, as it seemed to still be at about 1000-1500 ft, I saw a string of 7-8 dimmer lights tying the two bright light together. What was odd, and different from my first impression, was that the right side bright light stayed ~30 degrees lower than the upper left light (as if ""it"" was still banking) - but, the two lights stayed offset and the pair of bright lights (and the 7-8 dimmer lights connecting them) began obviously traveling east, at, I'd guess, at 40-50 mph. (as in def not 10-20 and def not 60-70) It wasn't turning anymore, it was traveling east over Hwy 80 up the Auto Mall ""valley"" - still with the two lights offset in height. I'd been watching it over the Napa River Bridge, through Vallejo (on 37), past 6 Flags Amusement park. I lost sight of it while taking the 37 / 80 west offramp. behind the overpass. I caught a brief glance of it looking backwards on 80 - Then I couldn't see the 7-8 dimmer lights between the 2 bright lights, but traffic was a bit hectic there. I took the first offramp and doubled back on Admiral Callaghan, I couldn't see it, but caught a momentary glimpse of a lighted spot 1000 to 1500 ft up on the valley ridge, right about at the Target store shopping center. I'd guess that it was 80% to 90% of the way to the top of the hills (I could see the outline of the ridgeline). The lighted spot was reflected light, and I couldn't see any particular point of light, just a very brightly lighted area 50 to 100 ft wide up near the ridge. I lost direct line of sight behind the auto dealers and when I got to the top of Admiral Callaghan, I couldn't see the light on the hill anymore. I went down to Auto Mall Parkway, turned right and kept looking up to find the lights again. Nothing. In recreating my initial view, what I first had thought was ""downwind"" on Rwy 6 at KAPC, was wrong. The lights were over the northern edges of the town of Vallejo, a few miles south of the airport, about inline with the Napa / Solono county borders. I'm 100% sure of the 2 non-directional lights, the 7-8 dimmer lights and the slow speed, the altitude and the light on the hillside. No smoke, no flicker, no pulsation. On January 4th, at about 6pm, I called the FAA tower at KAPC and asked the controller if they had had any other sighting reports on the 23rd. He didn't, and he checked with the controller on duty that night, and he didn't see anything, either. The lights would have been to the south of the tower, behind the controller's visual operating area (runways are north of the tower). Duration of observation, about 10 - 12 minutes. If someone else describes a similar sighting, feel free to contact me.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,38.11715994764398,-122.22782198952879

It was incredibly fast.   It left a solid tail light behind which remained behind it.   At first I thought it was a “shooting star” but as I stared at it I realized that it was not like any “shooting star” I had ever seen.   It flew horizontally.    It came to an abrupt halt and remained stationary.    It was circular and flat (like a hockey puck) and incredibly brilliant and fast.   There was no sound whatsoever. Then another object appeared sort of slowly.  It was much higher up and much much bigger.    It was odd shaped – seemed to be angular and outlined by pin prick lights.   The centre of this object was in darkness.    The pin prick lights got a little brighter and then the object hovered.     Again there was no sound whatsoever. Both objects hovered for several seconds and then the brilliant “hockey puck” just vanished which took me by surprise and then I realized the other object had also vanished.   The thought occurred to me afterwards that this was a rendezvous and the “Mother” ship had come for the reconnaissance craft.     Does this sort of thing happen?  The sky was black at the time with no stars visible.   The weather was cold and dry.   This was a residential built up area and as I walked home I saw few cars.

The photos were part of a steetlamp experiment that was inspired by Miceal Ledwith and Klaus Heinneman's book The Orb Project. I was fascinated by Miceal's theory on Orbs as fluorescing beings and had similar observations myself.  I wanted to take the experiment into a different direction - that of shooting straight into fluorescing streetlamps.  I have been astounded by some of the results. But the biggest discovery was before I shot the photos.  I was aiming the camera at the streetlamp when I saw the UFO materialise.  I didn't even have my finger on the button to activate the infra-red or flash. Like looking at the UFO in a live movie, I noticed something interesting.  If I tilted the camera left or right, up or down very slightly, perhaps no more than 5 to 10 degrees, the Orbs came into view or vanished, or demonstrated a partial materialisation as can be seen in the selection of photos.

On November 19th 2009 at approx. 1940 (7:40 pm) my stepson called and he was telling me about some unexplained lights that he was observing southwest of his home. He lives 5 miles NW of Okeechobee, Fl.  I went outside of my home and began to look for the objects. I live 18 miles SE of Okeechobee, Fl, as we are rural there is a very low level of ambient light so I have an exceptional view of the night sky. Because I didn’t know the brightness of the objects that my stepson was observing, I turned off my backyard and garage light. My stepson and I were talking on our cell phones for several minutes while I attempted to locate the small-lighted objects that he has been observing for at least 10 minutes. At about 1950 (7:50 pm) I was looking west northwest over my neighbors’ home, and I observed several small lights moving in an area roughly 20 degrees wide and thirty to forty degrees high and approximately 25 degrees above the horizon. This corresponded to where my son-in-law was now looking. I was not able to determine the range or altitude of the small-lighted objects. These small-lighted objects were moving erratically and on several occasions when the lights came within close proximity to one another, I would see a very bright inverted tear shaped orange glow that would last for about 5 seconds. During the time I was watching the group of small-lighted objects were working slowly in a northerly direction. Sometime during all of this I asked my wife to come outside and see what I was looking at. My wife was able to see three of the small-lighted objects but none of the bright orange glows appeared. The activity that I observed continued for about 5-7 minutes then cease! d. All of the small lights disappeared and I never saw another of the bright orange glows. During the time that I was observing all of this activity I was communicating by cell phone to my stepson and he was observing exactly the same activity that I was. I attempted to capture a few pictures on my cell phone camera but the movements were so erratic that I was unable to do so. Some observations that I had were: Small-lighted objects were flashing points of white light, the movements of the these objects were very erratic and of a type not consistent with any aircraft that I have ever seen. The lights didn’t appear to be following one another they closed on each other from a heads on attitude. I didn’t see anything being emitted from these objects The bright orange glows were many times larger than the small-lighted objects and had no movement component to them. These glows all looked similar in shape and size; there were no trails from these glows in any direction. I also was watching the air traffic in the area. I did not see any sudden course changes or any other abnormal flight patterns. Because we are in the center of Florida there is allot of air traffic transitioning the area at multiple altitudes and directions. After this light show was over, my stepson and I were talking about what we had just seen and I asked him what he originally saw that caused him to call me. His statement is below: He had gone outside to sit with a couple of his friends. They were talking and he happened to look up.  He noticed a “V” shaped formation of small objects moving from the south. He continued to watch and then he saw another formation of the lights moving from the north. This second group of lights were scattered and not a discernable formation. The “V” shaped group moved past the scattered group and turned 180 degrees and that is when the orange glows began. At this point he gave me a call.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,27.252879687500002,-81.0074328125

It was as bright as any satellite we have ever seen, like an “Iridium Flare”.  I would say it was as bright as Venus ever gets.  I said to her, “Do you see that bright satellite?” while pointing to it.  She said she did. We watched it moving for a few seconds, at the typical speed a satellite moves.  It then dimmed to the brightness of a faint star.  We know satellites fade as they enter the Earth’s shadow, so it was expected.  What was NOT expected was that the “satellite” made an instantaneous left turn and headed north-east, passing next to the bright star Arcturas on its way.  I watched it fade in brightness until it was no longer visible, in northern part of the constellation Bootes.  I said to my wife, “Satellites never change direction like that.”  She agreed, as she has seen at least a hundred of satellites as well, and is familiar with the way they move across the sky. When we first noticed it, it was in the general area that commercial aircraft take, but it had no blinking lights.  Commercial aircraft don’t make tight turns like that.  And it made no sound whatsoever.  Commercial aircraft are very audible, both as they approach my area, and as they depart the area. There were no other aircraft visible, or audible, at this time. So there we have it, a second mysterious light over my area making 90 degree turns, silently, in a single month.  But this time, I have a witness.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,33.68582744565217,-116.9679269021739
A Bluish-white object with glowing aura hurtles through the sky at great speeds,Austin,TX,2009-05-14T23:15:00,sphere,2-3 seconds,"Occurred : 5/14/2009 23:15  (Entered as : 05/14/09 23:15) Reported: 5/14/2009 10:55:49 PM 22:55 Posted: 6/9/2009 Location: Austin, TX Shape: Sphere Duration:2-3 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70041.html,"A Bluish-white object with glowing aura hurtles through the sky at great speeds As I was jogging westward along 53rd St. past the intersection of Rowena, I saw out of the corner of my left eye, a bright object hurtling across the sky, above the trees.  I immediately looked at it as it traveled out of sight behind trees.  The whole episode last 2-3 seconds, long enough to train my eyes on the object as it went out of view. What it looked like was a spherical bright object shrouded within a hazy fog or glowing aura, traveling at very fast speed.  The color of the object was bright white with a bluish tint, or more accurately, the sphere was bright white while the glow surrounding it was bluish-white.  It seemed, instinctively, like a meteorite flying through the air but there were things about it that made me question that possibility.  One, the trajectory was straight and level, not at an angle downward.  Also, the shooting stars I've seen in the past have always been bright and sharply defined, never one with a glowing aura surrounding it.  That immediately seemed very odd and out of place.  Plus, the time that I was able to view the object, 2-3 seconds, doesn't sound like a long enough time but compared to the shooting stars I'm familiar with, it's almost an eternity.  Not only that, it didn't feel like it was going to dissipate, or burn out, as it went behind the trees but rather to continue on its present trajectory. If I was to describe it's dimension and where it was within the environment, I would say it was roughly 200-300 feet in the air and was traveling at 100 MPH+.  (It could've have been higher but then the speed would have been amazingly fast.  I would stay with the original estimation.)  The object appeared about 3-5 feet wide while the glow extended outward 10 feet or so and maybe 15-20 feet behind.  That would seem to suggest a trail (or a tail) but I couldn't really detect anything like a vapor trail or smoke. If push came to shove, I would say it could've been a significant meteorite, if I had to say it was anything identifiable.  But the color, trajectory and the glow seems to conflict with that hunch. That's about it.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

I noticed it was a half moon this morning, and my chickens were already up and making noise (the usual). As I stood there (and as I often do), I looked directly up from my position into the night sky and I was faced to the East (the Moon would be on my right hand side, the Dipper on my Left). I usually see airliners this early in the morning (one, maybe two), either coming from OKC to DFW, or from Tinker AFB in OKC, with their typical, and never confused, blinking red lights. The stars are out his morning, the moon not extremely bright, so I figured I might see one. I did see SOMETHING, but not an airliner/jet. It was moving directly above me, from West (directly above me) to East (directly in front of me, very slightly SE, slow, long curve), and did NOT have ANY blinking lights at all. In fact, the only reason I DID see it is because unlike a jet, this twinkled from time to time like a Star (and not steady like a jet or planet, and Venus is up (I think it is her), east of the Moon's position, which was to my front right, at about the 1 O'Clock position, the Moon at my 4 O' Clock position). The only reason I wondered about this, is that it left NO visible trail in a clear, partially moonlit sky (such as a foreign object, or meteorite), and was moving MUCH faster than any object I have EVER seen. It covered (from my view) directly above me, to almost Tree top in the FAR distance/horizon in less than 2 minutes, and to date, after having seen thousands of airliners/military jets move over us, I have NOT seen one cover that much distance in that amount of time. It was extremely high up, for me to not distinctly see the typical airliner lights (which you always see). It was a fairly steady blue-ish light, which twinkled, had no ""burn"" trail such as a meteor (that ""electrical wire/copper in a fire"" type of trail), and finally simply disappeared (faded), still no trail, and no airliner lights. As it moved, I shifted my vision 4-5 times to other parts of the sky to compare/confirm that it was (A)Not my vision playing tricks, (B)Not a Star I was mistaking, (C)Not an Airliner (I moved my physical position to confirm) and (D)Not a Meteor.

The red lights would then swirl up, loop and zig zag around in the sky, turning white after a period of five minutes.

It was slowly moving higher in the sky from the north and moving west to east.  When the sun began rising, it was difficult to see the smaller white lights dancing around, however I did notice that they moved closer to this ""binary star"" and began swarming around it like fireflies, winking in and out.

I’m used to seeing meteors and satellites in my images, but never like this. A friend of mine who is a professional astronomer and the Curator of an observatory in Washington state examined the image and can’t explain it either. When the image is zoomed in on, there are no others lights are visible (like red or white for an aircraft). The astronomer and I both thought that perhaps it was just a meteor that was heavy in nickel, that would show as green as it heated up. But on second thought, he felt that in his experience (which spans decades) he’s never seen a green meteor that would take up a whole trail like this and be this brilliant. The laser idea also came up, but I’ve been doing this for a long time, and had green lasers in my field of view for star trails images; in my experience they’ve never shown this brilliant, if at all. Also, if it were a laser, they would have had to hold it steady for 5 whole minutes, an almost impossible task. The streak also shows that it was very quick, because it doesn’t move in motion with the stars in the background. I’m open to any ideas…thanks!

The jet i could hear clear as day and it was up much higher than this object .

One at a time in a space of 2 hours or so. I am a student of history attending the University of Iceland.  I’d like to note that I’ve never seen anything like this before.  I do believe it is possible that aliens may have visited us and that UFOs might be alien spacecraft.  The things I witnessed yesterday night left a lasting impression on me and I’m actually filing this report because I just need to get this sighting of my chest. Last night me and my girlfriend had just finished watching a movie. The time was roughly 2:45 am.  I walk out onto my deck and light cigarette. As I am smoking the cigarette I notice a light descending across the sky.  My first thought is; “Oh cool, a shooting star”. But the object moved far too slow for any shooting stars that I’ve ever seen and it’s descent was taking much longer then any shooting star I’ve observed.  As I’ve been looking at it for maybe 5 seconds it suddenly starts to ascend in a curve and then suddenly it makes a U-turn in the sky and bolts at high velocity in the opposite direction it was originally travelling.  By the time this happens I’ve called my girlfriend to come look.  Then the object vanishes but reappears a short distance away from it’s vanishing position about 2 seconds later, takes off at high speed again and then vanishes again. By this time my girlfriend is outside with me but missed seeing the object. About 30-40 minutes later I went back outside both to see if I could see some more of these things and to have a cigarette. After gazing at the sky for 2 minutes or so I noticed another light. This light moved in a straight line but seemed to be changing speeds as it did. I observed 5 lights like these in a 15-20 minute timeframe and they all moved in the same line but I never saw more then one at a time. I lost sight of the lights as they moved over my apartment building. They must have been very high up. I called my girlfriend to see these and she saw two of them and agreed with me that there was something strange about those lights. As it was really cold outside I went back inside. As I was about to go to sleep at about 4:40 am or so I went outside again to have a cigarette before bed. It was beginning to light up a bit outside but still semi-dark. I then observed about 5-6 lights appear one at a time far away on the horizon. They seemed to appear out of nowhere and then they would bolt away at high speed and vanish. One of the lights actually took a whirl in the air before bolting away. Then I went to sleep. I would like to note that the sky that night was mostly cloud free and it was very starbright. Also I would like to note that due to a volcano that is erupting about 200-300 kilometers away from here there was very little airtraffic due to the ash, although none of the ash has reached Reykjavik yet a lot of European flights to Iceland have been cancelled in the last few days. Maybe that UFO was observing the volcano and used the chance as there were no other aircraft around, but that’s just speculations.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,,

I was out birding Saturday evening at Valley View Preserve.  It was about 935pm.  There were scattered fireworks going off to the south and the northeast but I think it was still a little too light out for people to start setting things off in earnest.  The sky was clear or had a few clouds.  I was looking at and scanning the tree line with binoculars for perched owls when I saw this persistent orange-yellow light in the sky south or southwest hovering in the same spot at maybe 45-50 degrees above the horizon and not flickering.  The light was maybe 2 or 3 times larger than Venus in the sky and certainly way smaller than the moon.  I had no idea what it was but eventually figured it was either a) some kind of firework b) the back of a distant plane/jet or maybe c)the launch of some kind of rocket or something since the last weird thing I saw in the sky, that was kind of similar to this event, was part of an NSA Atlas rocket launch. After a few minutes of shining in exactly the same spot in the sky, the light stopped and I saw this gray, blurry object slowly arc a very short distance east from where the light had been until it faded away or I just lost track of it in the increasing darkness.  The gray object, which I figured was the emitter of the light, was roughly the same size as the light or maybe slightly smaller and possibly top-like in shape.  I watched the whole sequence with and without binoculars but don't recall the binoculars giving me a much better view of the event except that they more clearly revealed a non-flickering light.  The light was shining for a few minutes and I saw the gray object for probably less than 30 seconds. I don't know what it actually was but still think it could have been one of the things I thought it might be.  If it was a firework, I've never seen anything exactly like it before.  The light looked sort of like a Roman candle if there was just one flare, no smoke trail and the flare stayed in one spot in the sky instead of moving in an arc.  If it was a plane, there should have been blinking lights on the object after the light, it should have moved in a more direct way and I should have heard some sort of sound.  I don't recall hearing any sounds that I could attribute to the light/object.  And if it was some sort of rocket, it didn't seem to leave Earth's atmosphere and was a little different than what I saw before. I had actually completely forgotten about this until Peter Davenport appeared on Coast to Coast AM and am submitting this report per his request.

It also passed in the opposite direction of the display.

They passed at about the speed of an ultralite, from one horizon to the other. I’m judging their height above the ground to be roughly the altitude a search plane might fly.  They definitely did not fly as high as a  passenger plane. None of us could hear a sound coming from it. All three orbs appeared to be about the size of a pea, held at arms length.

At 8:50 PM we saw a single large reddish orange glowing orb coming from the south moving slowing northward; it was very low, maybe 250 to 300' above the rooftops.  There was absolutely no sound being emitted from the illuminating sphere.  We watched it for about 5-10 minutes as it passed over our neighborhood and then got into our car and drove to the gas station at the corner of Martin and Zerdt roads.  We could see fireworks off in the distance so we sat in the car for about 15 minutes and watched.   As we drove home heading west on Martin Road, we saw a formation of 3 glowing orbs.  This time I really thought, hey these things are extraterrestrial and I want to make sure there not hot air balloons or helicopters.  So we slowed down to almost a complete stop, rolled down the windows to see if we could hear helicopter blades, but there was no sound at all.   And they were not hot air balloons.   We had traffic behind us, so we had to move on and we are not sure where they went, but assume they continued to move northward as did the first one.  We were sitting outside and then around 10 pm we saw one more solitary glowing orb, but at a higher altitude than the others and this one was either blinking, or something behind it was blinking and we watched it move northward as well, then the dog barked, we looked away and when we looked up again it had disappeared.   Then about 15 minutes later my boyfriend said, look at that satellite.  And I said, where?  Then I exclaimed, Wow, did you see that?   He said I sure did, wow!   We saw four distinct bright lights that looked like stars that were in a cluster which was kind of vibrating and then they formed into a line and just zip off into space on at a time very quickly.  It made warp speed seem slow, they just zipped up and off into space and where gone! in an instant.   Neither of us had ever witnessed anything like this before.  We believe that since the orbs were so slow moving and close to the ground there must have been a number of others who saw the same thing on that clear 4th of July night in Huntsville, Alabama. For the skeptics, I looked up sky lanterns and balloons on-line and just wanted to let you know that there was no way the first one or the second set of three that we saw were in any way sky lanterns. These illuminating things  were huge.  They moved steadily and with a purpose.  Not anything similar to a sky lantern and we were close enough to tell that they were not hot air balloons.   My boyfriend thinks they were as large as a VW bug and my estimate is a bit larger.  They did not flicker and produced an energy glow that was supernatural.   This is the first time I have ever looked at a ufo site and ever posted any such thing.   We are both of sound mind and we were not under the influence that night.   I'd like to know if anyone else has seen large orbs so closely?   Thanks.",2010-07-10T00:00:00,34.727967771639044,-86.62783879680786

That is when things got even stranger.  The cloud began to take shape and was soon the brightest light in the night sky.  It was a differnt color of light than the stars in the night sky.  The color was of a yellowish glow and at least 5 times if not more the brightness of any other star in the sky.   I called on my wife and son to come see what they thought it was.  The light appeared to move before all in witness.  I grabbed my camerea and was able to take 2 photos.  I took both photos using the zoom on my camera and tried using a chair and a cooler to stablize my camera.  The light was the only visible light to even be picked up on my camera.  Before I could take a third the brightness faded to where it was no longer visible on my camera.(within 30 seconds)  It soon began to look like a comet in the sky. (when looking at a comet dead on it is harder to see than when looking at it from corner of eye.)   The stars around the object appeared clear and in focus.

There were only 4 of us really looking up. The other two were under a small lattice awning in the back yard of the home and didn't see what we were seeing.

It was my birthday today and a friend and I decided to have dinner and relax at the Newport Beach Pier. After dinner we laid out some blankets on the sand a few hundred yards away from the Pier. It was a quiet night despite some celebratory camp fires going on. As we laid back, looking at the stars, listening to the ocean, we noticed the two of the stars were moving back and forth and occasional they moved to the side but did so fairly quick. No sound came from these ""stars,"" but they did shine a tad brighter than the rest of the stationary stars they were around. One thing we did notice before my lady friend got so nervous she demanded we leave, was that when planes flew near these ""stars"" the stars would move away from the planes a good distance and then stop for a while before deciding to move again. Whatever these things were, they made no sound but moved seamlessly through the air. Again, the beach was dark and the sky was clear, we had a great shot of whatever these things were. There was a helicopter and several airplanes overhead. Quite a few commercial. There was only one plane (non-commercial, I believe) that got close to these things and that's when they moved away from potential contact. About three weeks ago I did hear about these ""stars"" or UFO's posing as stars on Coast to Coast AM by a guy who lives in the desert that has been using high-beam light to signal them and they signal back and move-in when engaged. I am trying desperately to find an answer out of all this as to what it might be, but my lady friend got so upset she almost threw-up and couldn't stop shaking. I'll admit, it made me nervous, also. I immediately thought of that broadcast and what was said and felt I too had witnessed the same thing.

Clear skies and very light out.  I’m skeptical of other peoples reports as well as when I saw today.  At first I thought it was a blimp, because it appeared white and very slow moving, but I’ve seen many blimps and this was much to thin and much longer than a blimp.  If I had to make a guess, I’d say it was nearly 10,000 feet high from the ground.  It was long and cylindrical in shape.  My next guess is that it was a low flying plane at an angle where I couldn’t make out the wings, and I’m still open to that possibility.  However, if it were an airliner flying that low, then it would have been moving much faster, compared to this object to be moving at the rate of a blimp.  I was driving on the highway during rush hour so I couldn’t stop and get a better look.  But it was clear as day.  Another reason it didn’t seem like an airliner was that I couldn’t make out any wings or a tail wing.    Even as the road twisted giving me a different angle of view, still no wings.  I had sight of it for over a minute at least.  Then the thing seemed to change direction pointing away from me.  I still had clear sight of it, while trying to avoid and accident, it seemed to move a little further in the distance then just vanished.  There were no clouds in the sky and visibility was great, so I don’t know how this thing vanished like it did.  I’m 31, and I’ve seen plenty of blimps, airliners, jets, etc...

Arc shaped and semi-tranparent. I was standing outside with my mom and fiance.  My mom was in the car already and by the time she got out it was gone.  But my fiance saw it first, she looked up and said ""What’s that?"". I thought she was talking about the big dipper because that's where she was pointing, so I said ""That’s the Big Dipper."" and she said ""no that"".  Then I saw it looked huge, it was semi-transparent it was arc shape, like  this ( but huge. I couldn't judge well its height very well id say 3000ft up.  It looked like if sat on the ground it would have been several football fields in length at least.  Despite its size it made no sound I could hear, I have good hearing, and so does my fiance.  I'm 20yrs old, and she’s 18. It was quiet outside as well.  It was moving slowly compared to normal aircraft. My mom started the car and the car lights came on, I yelled at her to turn the car off and she did but by the time I turned back around it was gone. My fiance says she thought it kind of flapped slightly like a large slow moving bird mind you she agreed on its size, she said ""If it was a creature it was still the size of several football fields."" The best way I can explain it is if you took a paper plate, cut out the middle leaving only the curved edges, then cut out a quarter section of the edge giving you a rainbow arc shape, now make it see through, like glass. I could even see the stars through it. I kept looking for it hoping to see it again, but I doubt I will it looked pretty set on its course. I didn’t see it flap and she said it wasn’t very noticeable movement, I think since it was transparent the way it moved in front of the stars did give an appearance of it rippling, I think that might have been what she saw. I hope someone else besides us saw it, it was an amazing sight. Even if it didn’t last long.  As for us, I am a 20 year old Male. I have lived in this city most of my life.

Off The Ground Forming A Triangle Flash In And Out Twice & Then From Afar Coyotes Howl At It For 4-5 Minutes MY UFO TESTIMONY:  It was Saturday, July 17, 2010.  Me, my girlfriend and her son visited the Bruneau Dunes Observatory in Idaho (between Bruneau and Mountain Home).  The staff was there along with us and 20 or so other people.  They did not allow us to have on any white lights and the only lights there were the small red reflector type electrically lit lights on the cement.  At around 11 PM I was facing what I believe was South East towards the Education Center (look at the map I provide.  I think that was the direction) and suddenly out of nowhere, above the building, three white lights with green on the outer parts of the lights flickered for 1 to 2 seconds and then they in a sense “turned off” like you turn off a light in a room. It just went black.  It seemed that even though these lights were like 7 FT. or so above the building, they were actually coming from further away, ahead of us and were probably a lot bigger than what we saw.  Keep in mind the building is 10 FT or more in height. I think! I said out loud, “What was that?”  There was a guy on the left of me who saw it too and so did my girlfriend who was on the right side of me. They both clearly confirmed what I saw.  We continued to look in that same direction and only a few seconds later the three lights flickered on again for 1-2 seconds and then disappeared.  Whatever it was, it did not emit any noise at all.  From where I was standing, it looked as if each light was 2 ft. or so in diameter or almost double the size of the moon from where I was standing if I put my thumb up to the moon which was to the right of us almost behind us.  They looked size-wise like three double-sized basketball shaped balls of light that were glowing white and green and shook a little bit.  There was 1 light on top and two others on the bottom, forming a triangle shape, but I did not see any structure holding it all together. It must have been much further away from us. About a few minutes later, we suddenly started hearing a pack of coyotes a little bit from the left of the building, but far ahead of us, over 150 FT or more away making some very nasty howling noises as if they were on the defense against something that upset them. They were howling (right) in the direction of where we saw the 3 lights.  Their intense howlings got more intense and nasty for about 4-5 minutes or so.  Keep in mind that we never heard the coyotes howl before or after they howled.  This only took place after the lights emitted twice and then ended.  After that, they went on the coyotes went on and on for 4-5 minutes.  I asked one of the staff members who was manning one of the telescopes about it and I told him what the three of us saw.  He said to me, “What are you guys smoking?”  Still the young guy in a baseball cap who was about 6 ft. tall and around 27-32 years old saw the lights.  Me, I’m 35 and my girlfriend is 38.  All three of us saw it.  We, the three witnesses, and my girlfriend’s son were the last ones to stay at the observatory with the staff.  I spoke with the person who gave the presentation in the education center earlier at 9 pm and he didn’t act like he didn’t believe us but from what it looked like, he had never heard of this before and was startled a bit but very calm and professional.  We then went home. It is weird to call this a UFO since as it seems from what I saw it was a ""UO"" (Unidentified Object) since I nor the other witnesses saw it ""fly"" or ""fly away"".  It just blinked in and then out and then the coyote's flipped out, yelling at whatever it was. Some background info you should know: Today, July 19, 2010, I contacted the Bruneau Dunes Observatory and mentioned this situation that happened on Saturday.  They were very nice.  Apparently this had never happened there before.  I asked what was beyond the building.  Two people at different times on the phone told me there was 150 FT of mowed green grass.  Beyond that is a lake, which they call “small lake” (people fish there) which is left of “big lake”.  Apparently both lakes combined make up half the size of a football field (300 Acres).  With that info and the fact that they said that coyotes are afraid of people and would not be on the 150 ft. of grass behind the buildings, they must have been on the grounds area past the grass and on the surrounding left of “small lake”.  I won’t make any assumptions, but if I put this info together, it seems to me that whatever this triangular light object was (at least we saw it as triangular from our view) it could have been hovering over ! the lake and it flipped out the coyotes 2 minutes after we saw it and they were yelling at this object for 3-5 minutes.  I also contacted Mountain Home Air Force Base that is way on the other side of all this and spoke to them about it.  The lady mentioned that they did not hear about any of this and that they do not have any dealings in that area since they are on the complete other side of it (behind where we were standing).  Other info I found out is that the observatory is 20 miles south of Mountain Home and 6 miles SW of Bruneau.  I believe that is what the lady at the observatory told me. MY GIRLFRIEND’S UFO TESTIMONY:  It was past 11 PM on July 17, 2010.  We were at the Bruneau Dunes Observatory in Idaho.  I was lying down on the circular cement seating to the right with my head up looking towards the tree next to the Bruneau Dunes Observatory Education Center.  First I saw two round lights.  One at the top and one below it to the left of it and it appeared that there was another light behind the branches of the tree on the right.  They flickered forward and back for a second, but when they retracted it was very smooth.  It looked as if they were on top of the roof but they weren't.  I didn't know what they were.  And then I sat up and asked my boyfriend, ""Did you see that?"" and he said to me, ""What was that about?"" and then I saw it again.  I saw like three rounded white flickering lights. They were not aligned. I saw one on top and the other one was one across from the other.  I said again to my boyfriend, ""Did you see that?"" and then he said, ""(my name), what was that?""  And there was a young guy sitting opposite from me on the circular cement seating area, and he said, ""I saw that too.  What was that about?""  And then I told my son, ""You missed it!""  He was sitting in front of me on the cement seating area but was looking in the opposite direction.  My boyfriend, the guy and I started talking about what we saw.  My son was also with us as we were talking.  I thought it was cool but weird since I didn't know where it came from.  My boyfriend said, ""I saw three lights and they were kind of green.""  And then the guy who also saw it agreed with my boyfriend and said, Yeah, they were green."" I said, ""No. The ones I saw, they were white.""  As we were talking, the coyotes started to howl and they angrily started barking, like they saw something. They were on the left side of where the lights flashed.  The coyotes were howling for about 4 minutes then stopped.  That was the only time we heard the coyotes that night. After the coyotes stopped howling, my boyfriend told one of the observatory staff members what we saw and then he said to my boyfriend, ""What are you smoking?""  Then my boyfriend said to him, ""I'm not the only one who saw it?  They saw it too.  My boyfriend pointed at me and the other guy who saw it.  Then my boyfriend said to the observatory staff member, ""If I'm smoking something, it's Parliament Ultra Lights and Wallgreens is my supplier.""  The three of us and my son continued talking about it, wondering what were those lights.  We had the question the whole night: “What was that?""  And nobody could answer the question about what we saw.",2010-07-28T00:00:00,,

I was driving.  My sister said, ""Is that a satellite?"" and upon that I look around to see what she’s referring to, and suddenly see on her side of the car an enormous flying object that had lights all across the side I was looking at.   As I’m trying to drive and also adjust my eyes to the very dark night sky, I start seeing that whatever it is I’m looking at is flying at a tilt.  I assumed it was a plane with extra lights along the wings, but then as I keep looking it starts listing upwards and the lights that were on a 45 degree angle on the ""wings"" suddenly started tilting/listing up into vertical and kept rotating all the way around 180 degrees.  I didn’t understand what I was seeing and thought that it was a plane that was crashing into the ground, but it was in such slow motion I just had to pull over.    As I pulled off onto the emergency lane, we saw what appeared to be a saucer/oval shape gigantic ship with lights all around the rim.  When it was tilted I could see that they went all around the rim.  This ship looked to me like it was the size of two football stadiums or so.  That is all I can compare it to.  It was so big and silent. The ""ship"" looked like it was dark grey or black and the lights around the rim were yellowish. Not plane lights and no green or red or flashing.  There were three distinctly brighter lights on the side I was looking at, one on the left, one in the center, and one at the right side, but there were a few smaller lights. All the lights were glowing in different capacities.  This ""ship"" seemed to be ""landed"" after it did the somersaults in slow motion, next to a very dark mountainside. There was no sound from this ""ship.""  After a few brief moments we saw the first of five balls of light that slowly floated out from the left side (from my view looking at it) of the ship.  These lights were a silvery ball is the only way I can describe it, but we were at quite a distance from the mountain and where the ship was.  One after another these silver glowing balls came out but at different travel paths.  They were going around the base and midpoint of the mountain slowly but steadily.  The ship that I was looking at slowly had the lights around the rim go dim or something and they were not as prevalent.   The most startling thing was that the ship appeared to disappear.  I’m not 100% certain of that as I don’t understand how that could happen but from my vantage point it either disappeared or lowered behind land or a hill that I could not see as it was so dark in the desert that night. I was not going to go check out this situation, as my sister and I were traveling alone at night and I started to get nervous being on the side of the road with big rigs going by so I decided that we saw enough of whatever we were looking at and we went on our way to continue on to Marina del Rey, CA where I live. I have not looked into any other sightings or websites or books to see if other people have seen what I saw.  Please let me know if there are other sightings similar to this so I know I’m not crazy or making things up that have a good explanation.  Maybe the military is doing something new?   I am a museum director here in Los Angeles and have a very professional and public career and don’t really want to share this beyond our discussions together. Thank you.",2010-07-28T00:00:00,,

The first thought was they belonged to a new cell tower.  Further observation with 7 x 35 binoculars showed a pair of identical objects that had red glowing vertical bodies and each with a midway ring with 4 separate green lights, (from our viewing position.).  The objects appeared on the same horizontal plane in what appeared as a stationary position.

I noticed 3 orange/red lights in the sky, brighter than standard aviation lights, glowing and at the same height of helicopters, all flying in unison and at the same rate, one behind the other.  I was taken aback at first, because I know that most helicopters in the area flash and blink lights and more importantly, make a noise.  No planes fly in and out of the area at that hour of the morning. The objects were travelling at a constant rate toward my home.  As they neared, the lights of each three went out one by one.  I have never seen or experienced aviation aircraft to suddenly turn off any of their lights to the point of complete darkness.  I followed the path of the lights of where I thought they would have been should the lights have stayed on, and in the darkness I saw a faint grey shape, that became slightly larger in size, with no light, no flashing, that you would expect from any aviation aircraft, especially over populated London areas. Again, these orange/red glowing ‘orbs’ and the shape were at the height of helicopters, and completely silent.  It was the silence and the shape that has completely got me baffled. At about 3:10am, several helicopters came into the area and circled for some time.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,,

The Blue and Green lights were like someone pointing a bright flashlight at you from a distance.  The color and intensity resembled laser light.  It was neither incandescent nor florescent but very bright light like a high intensity LED.  The lights both gave out two small sharp rays of light from the orb’s body at a 45 degree angle towards the ground.  The trail of light  were small but visible. I thought it was someone pointing a laser light into the air but it was very bright and showed no trail from the laser’s origin. I stared at the two lights for about 30 seconds in shock trying to make out what it could be, initially I thought it was a hovering helicopter or a UAV but they moved way to fast and in different directions for it to be any aircraft I have ever seen.  At one time the blue orb shot straight upwards into a low cloud and then regrouped with the green orb. I got my video camera but couldn’t get a focus on the objects in time before they disappeared into the horizon. Both orbs are assumed to be at a estimated 5 to 10 thousand feet or more off my line of sight above the horizon.  My estimated of its location is off shore of the Chevron Oil processing plant in West Oahu, about 3 miles north of the Barbers Point Light House. I can not tell if it was over land or not but seemed to be just off shore.  It was impossible to get a scale size of the objects but that they seemed close to land. I called my friend who works at the ATC tower in Honolulu Airport but he called back and stated no reports from the tower.  I also contact a friend on the west side of the island but stated that he saw nothing.  The news had no reports as well. I am sure someone else saw it too.  It is possible for someone that was driving West on H1 Freeway towards Makakilo, HI at about 2130 - 2135 hrs.

I was not wearing glasses nor could I explain what I saw by finding any reflective surfaces within the field of view. Three lights, a little larger than a star appears, appeared to the left of the moon (about 3 deg) and were moving as soon as I saw them.  I think the lights were white, but the event was so short that I’m really not sure.  They moved across 60 deg of my field of view within less than 2 seconds from the same inclination of the moon to about 10deg lower.  My view was then blocked by a tree so I couldn’t see where they went.  I walked to where I could see behind the tree and the lights were gone. The lights were aligned along the axis of movement, but were slightly out of alignment.  I would have thought this to be a jet except that it was moving way too fast and there was no sound at all.  If it were close to account for the movement, there should have been sound (the early morning was silent).  If it were far to explain lack of sound then it was moving way too fast.

We were then looking upwards towards the Eastern sky when 3 dim but distinct white lights forming an equilateral triangle flew overhead at high speed on about an 80 degree Easterly heading.   No outline of a craft was visible. The lights each had appearances more like that of illuminated rings rather than being solid, and the intensity of each ring was about that of a medium star that is easily observable.   If there had been street or yard lights nearby, they probably would not have been visible.  I definitely feel that they were all on one craft of some sort as they did not vary in distance or orientation to each other at all.

I’d estimate that they traveled 30 to 35 degrees of the sky in 3 to 4 seconds before we lost sight behind the trees and roof.  The wind was calm and we heard absolutely no sound.   This craft had just went out of sight, when we spotted a single ring of light of the same magnitude and speed following a parallel path slightly to the south.  It may have been slightly larger than the other rings.  Or lower?   My initial gut feeling was that these lights were traveling at an altitude in excess of 10,000 feet with a speed in the thousands of miles per hour.  I have no way to know what the actual altitude was, but they did not appear to get smaller or less brilliant as they passed, so that indicates to me that they were of significantly high altitude. What appeared to be an airliner was almost directly overhead shortly after the rings and the lights on it were much brighter and the speed was slower by many many times.  The temperature was 12 degrees and the stars were bright and crisp, so even thought they were dim, the rings of light were very distinct and stayed at the same intensity for the brief time they were visible. Added 1/27/10:  My date read the above and agreed on everything other than she said she thought the rings were visible at least 4 seconds.   I  feel the speed could have been  15 - 20,000 mph if the airliner speed was 600 MPH.

Just as a joke i mentioned to my fellow passengers that there was a spaceship on fire in the sky.  They all dismissed what i had to say and looked up to see if they could see what i had just spotted. At this point they turned to me and said they agreed with what i had seen and to slow down.  I took a second look because i had only joked about it, I pulled over to the side of the road as to not cause a road traffic accident, and on studying it further it appeared to me that it was a very strange shape and i started to panic that it was an aircraft on fire. If i hadn't watched it for a while i could have dismissed it as a hot air balloon.  But, what would an air balloon be doing in the skys at that time of night. Then i had the strangest thought that it may have been a handglider, or some type of air travel, perhaps motorised, on fire. By this time traffic was building up and the object had seemed to float above us.  It was quite big.  And also very low.  I grabbed for my phone to try and record this occurrence and jumped out of the car to get a better view.  I couldn't set my phone to night mode to make it more visible quick enough and in an instant it had shot upwards into the sky and disappeared into nothing. On analyzing what i had seen for many days and complete disection of my state of mind i have come to the conclusion that this is factual.  May not necessarily be another lifeform, but definately unexplainable.  Had i been on my own i probably would have dismissed it and never mentioned it but it was magical.

These two red orbs were pulsing on and off at a rate of about 20 -30 times a minute.  The on to off timing was uniformly equal and pulsing in unison.  The size of the red orbs were slightly smaller than your thumbnail held at arms’ length and the shape was perfectly circular with a very defined edge, no fuzziness or light diffusion.  The distance between the two orbs was approximately the width of your fist at arms’ length.  There was some relative motion between the two objects:  the one on the left appeared steady on its course while the one on the right changed its altitude dipping down and then back to its level position.  As I continued driving due west the objects appeared to be drifting to the left or southward and now the roadway was turning slightly northward to a west-north-west heading and the view of the objects were being obstructed by trees.  I thought I would pull over and stop to watch these red orbs and continued forward to have a clearer view now appearing through my side window.  The clear view was now coming up, but before I pulled off to the shoulder there appeared what I would describe as a burst from between and above the plane of the two orbs not unlike a jet going supersonic with its wing producing a shock wave.  I had traveled about a mile in this episode so it was visible to me for about one minute.  I continued onward where the road crosses over the railroad tracks to view southward the moonless night sky but could see no lights or movement there. In review of this event I could not make any determination of the distance, speed, or direction involved or if any sound was made as my car windows were closed.  Looking at a map of the area shows that when I first sighted the object it could have been over Rhome, Aurora or Boyd, or beyond by 100’s of miles, or it could have been just beyond the tree line right over hwy 287 just a mile in front of me.  At the time, I thought the direction of travel was southward, but who’s to say that I was actually seeing it departing straight away from me (west) on just a slight southward track.  If that were true perhaps those who reside in Newark, Azle, Reno, or Springtown may have seen this occurrence.

On Friday afternoon, March 6, 2009 at about 4:05 PM EST, myself and both my parents witnessed an object flying through the sky from the NW to the NE.  We were sitting outside at our picnic table, because it was such a nice day outside - the sun was shining and there weren't any clouds in the sky.  I looked up in the sky and saw a trail running vertically between the NW and NE portions of the sky, which we see often when outside.  I pointed the trail out to my parents, and not but two seconds later I saw the object come flying out from behind the top portion of a pine tree, seemingly out of nowhere.  It moved fairly quickly, I'd say quicker than airplanes that we always see flying by.  The area of the sky that we saw the object in is the same area that we always see airplanes and helicopters flying in the same direction. The object was silver and shiny; we noted after seeing it that it was the same color as a silver chain-link fence.  We did not see any wings at all and it made absolutely no noise.  I'm not sure if you would classify it as cylinder, cigar, or oval shaped, but we described it as looking like a submarine.  It was flat looking on the top and bottom and rounded on each end, just like a submarine.  It was flying lower than the airplanes we normally see flying by (and we see lots of airplanes going over where we live and they are extremely noisy), and it was low enough that if it had writing on the sides, we'd be able to read it (but there was no writing on it).  It was obvious to us it wasn't an airplane or a helicopter, and it was low enough that if it were a blimp, we'd be able to tell.  It literally looked like a flying submarine. I would estimate that the object took about 6-8 seconds to get out of our viewing and get behind some more pine trees where we couldn't see it anymore.  About 5 seconds later, a commercial airplane (the kind we always see flying over) came flying from the same direction, NW, flying towards the same direction that the object went, NE.  The object didn’t have any lights that we could see (though it was the daytime and sunny, so we couldn’t tell for sure) and it didn’t leave any kind of trail behind. My father told me to report it here that very day, but I wanted to wait and see if anyone else saw something and then I forgot about it.  But then, on March 20, 2009 at around 2:45 AM EST, we heard an extremely loud boom come out of nowhere.  It sounded almost like a tree splitting in two or a really loud cracking sound.  Later on in the day on the local news, they reported that everyone in the area had heard the noise and they think it was some kind of a sonic boom.  People who were outside said they saw a fireball in the sky, including some police officers.  The electricity also went out at about the same time at one of the hospitals in the area.  After hearing that noise, I thought I'd better report what we saw earlier this month, in case there is some kind of connection with that sort of thing.

Taking a walk during my lunch break I had this immediate feeling that I should look up, and when I did I saw a large, round, dark object . This object was spinning slowly and had the look of burnished metal or plastic. It began to come closer and I was determined to not look away no matter what, so I got a really good look at it. The object never stopped spinning and sort of glided in the wind, was out of the SSW, and was moving against the wind. It appeared very stark against the background of high, fluffy, white clouds. The object moved directly overhead and was stationary for a good 15 seconds. The bottom appeared to be almost plastic with a few brownish marks on it. The surface seemed to fold in on itself--not like liquid in an operating blender would do, but kind of wrinkled together. It had to be 30-40 ft. in diameter. I recently went back to the sighting location so I could get a better fix on the object’s size. There are two old coke mill towers right next to where I was standing at the time of the sighting that are about 10 stories high, and this thing had to be no more than 200 ft. above me. It was large. Then, as I watched, it moved very gracefully, (against the wind) to the SSW, and as it did I saw at about 600 ft away, it either rolled onto its side or morphed to a classic saucer shape. I continued to watch and after a couple more hundred feet it changed again to delta sort of shape! Its movement was very fluid and very well defined, and the way it moved is rather difficult to describe. It sort of slipped and dipped in the air from one place to another.

The rotation was the lower left light seemed to move forward or maybe the right moved backward. As it levelled out it faded from view. Sort of just dimmed out.

I noticed a VERY bright light in the sky.  This UFO incident appeared over towards the pacific ocean off the coast of Oxnard/Ventura county (my position). It had the appearence of a shooting star, or small meteor entering the atmosphere.  It was like a fireball and it glowed a bright red/orange color, so I knew something was entering the atmosphere.  I have seen small meteors enter the earth's atmosphere and burn for a brief second.  Well this UFO had been burning for about 30 seconds with a LARGE tail.  After I noticed it, it had emitted an object.  The object was glowing White, and VERY bright and not flickering.  The best way to describe this object would be a flare burning as bright as magnesium. *it was a great distance away so the material must have been rather large because it was burning so brightly i could see it and could not have been a hand flare because those are too small.*  The UFO emitted 3 of these objects.  As soon as the object emitted this bright white light, it stayed lit for 3 seconds, then it died out. As soon as the first object died out a 2nd one came and also for 3 seconds. As soon as that died a 3rd was emitted, and again lasted 3 seconds and disappeared.  When the 3rd object disappeared the UFO appeared to have slowed down its entry into the atmosphere and the glowing red/orange color dissapated away as it slowed down.  I noticed it left a smoke trail when emitting the bright white objects.  It was an awkward shape, large enough that I could see its shape and draw it out.  The UFO glowed a magnificent Gold color.  Then it was just hovering in the sky, and then slowly *from my position* started moving left and away from me *south west direction*.  It still glowed a gold color, and did NOT have any lights flashing on it, nor have ANY sound.  Something traveling that fast into the earths atmosphere should have set off a sonic boom. I waited and heard nothing.  It was traveling away fr! om me, h overing rather gently.  It was moving slowly, then started picking up speed and going higher ""UP"" INTO the atmosphere.  The gold color dimmed as it picked up speed, then got brighter 2 seconds later.  The gold UFO was flying off into the sky then the bright gold light was growing fainter, but I could still see it, then all of a sudden it VANISHED. BLACK. GONE.  I was stunned and amazed that I witnessed this event and called my girlfriend halfway into this.  I looked back where I had originally seen it and it left a trail of smoke and debree in the sky.  I kept walking my dog and the smoke still remained.  It had a spiral look to it and next to it another small smoke plume.  I am 19 years old male college student, I am not crazy, I have my head on my shoulders. I have great eye sight and do not wear glasses.   I witnessed this event and I remember seeing this website on TV so I decided to report the incident.  This was NOT a plane, nor a meteor.  This was something significant.  It came RUSHING down into the atmosphere, then emitted objects, hovered away and disappeared going back up into the atmosphere.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,34.19450050251256,-119.16316080402011

It was very dark but you could still see the dark outlines of the pine trees in the woods and the lights from the neighboring houses.  The flying lights reminded me of a police car’s lights and I thought I was catching a reflection in the window glass from the room behind me.  My son’s bedroom was directly behind me and a police officer lives up a road right in front of my house.  The mail box the police officer uses is also right across the road from my house.  The lights were almost standing still and then moved very slowly to the left.  I wondered what the police car was up to so I turned around to see out windows in the front of the house.  That’s when I was shocked by the fact that my bedroom do! or was closed and that what I was looking at was not a reflection.  I stood up and put my face and hands to the glass to block all reflections from other lights in my room and I saw clearly a large set of lights in a very strange configuration moving very slowly to the left over my neighbors house. There were three colors of lights.   The largest lights were a pair of rectangular almost square lights.  The light on the right was bright blue and the light connected to it on the left was bright white.  Both of these lights were very bright and the shape was very clear.  Two small red lights were above these lights, one on the left and one on the right.  One small red light was in the center on the bottom.  The whole thing looked like a mixed up set of tail lights on the rear end of a car.  I was talking to my father the whole time and he said that I was starting to worry him.  I described what I saw to him and he said go outside to see if I could hear anything.  I went out my! back door onto my porch and stood on my picnic table.

I knew that what I was seeing had to be something very odd maybe a UFO.  I was convinced of this by the slow speed, the distinct shape of lights, the brightness of the lights, and the dead silence.  The lights then moved on to the left behind a larger set of pine trees.  When I moved my head back and forth I could still catch glimpses of it.  The lights then started to come back to the right and then the moved back to the left even further until I could not see it at all.  While I was standing on my picnic table talking to my father after the lights vanished, I saw the small white lights of an airplane way up in the sky.

It was about 11:30pm central and I was outside in my backyard on the phone with a friend, looking at the stars as I frequently do when I'm outside, and I notice a flashing red light sitting in the sky to the south west.  I continue on with my conversation just watching it when it starts to move east still flashing. I ask my friend who lives about 7 blocks north of me to go outside and look, he sees it as well but dismissed it since he has work in the morning. So we get off the phone and I continue watching it, it then changes direction from moving east to moving west immediately without slowing and appeared to continue at the same speed it had been going, which is when I decided to go inside and tell my Father to come out and look.  So we go to our back yard and continue observing it, it then starts moving from west to north.  We watch it for a little while, every now and then the light would just stop then resume 10-20 seconds later, not in sequence, just at random times this would happen.  It continued doing strange maneuvers such as ascending and descending quickly, changing direction without slowing, sometimes stopping altogether, and changing speed sporadically from very slow to fast. It stays in about the same general area, to the south and to the west turning, moving back and forth up and down over that area.  We were already amazed by how it was changing direction immediately with no change of speed, it didn't slow down it simply started moving the opposite direction in an instant, and did that numerous times.  After a while of this it is in the same area, still south west but slightly more west, and it stops as it had done a few times before.  This next part happens over the span of 3-4 seconds:  When it stops the light goes off, also as it had done numerous times beforehand, and suddenly emits a very very bright white orb of light about twice the size of the initial flashing red object we had been observing, and I'm talking ! really bright, this white orb seemingly splits into 2 orbs of ! light, o ne descending and one ascending which both dim and go out very quickly. As I said that happened over the course of 3-4 seconds, and was quite extraordinary. The object then resumes moving, and is heading west to a point where the tree line behind our house was blocking our view so we couldn't see it. Over the course of the next 10 or more minutes we would see it over the tree line a few times, moving south, sometimes north, and still flashing. At a few points in time over the course of the whole observation when the blinking would cease, rather than us not seeing it which had happened a few times, it would appear as just a solid red light moving, then continue flashing. The flashes were slow the whole time they were happening, not in perfect sequence but each was about one second apart, sometimes slightly faster sometimes slightly slower. So at this point we're only seeing it every now and then over the treeline, until it moves farther west to the point where we don't see it! at all for about 5 minutes. It had never made any noise. There are many fighter jets at our airport currently, they fly over many times a day, they are much louder and fly much lower than the commercial planes that fly over town do, about the same altitude the propeller planes fly at. One takes off from the airport which is about 1 1/2 miles west of our house, we saw it ascend from the area of the airport, it was flying low, looped around east over the very edge of town not far from our house with all of it's lights on, and as it turned south west the engines got much louder, and took off fast in the direction of the object we had been observing until it too moved far enough that the tree line prevented us from seeing it. We continued watching  for a while and neither returned. It was right about 12:25am when we decided to go in since it was late and the event appeared to be over. I've returned outside numerous times over the course of the night and it has not returned, an! d obviously decided it was worth reporting, in hopes somebody ! else may have seen this. It has inspired me to buy a high definition video camera, it would have been amazing to have recorded. ((NUFORC Note:  Celestial body?  PD))",2010-07-06T00:00:00,38.851675,-97.61407647058823

I witnessed two similar phenomena occur twice within a half-hour or less of each other.  Not being too familiar with the area I don’t know exactly where I was located, but for the first event, I’d say I was between 25-50 miles northwest of Indianapolis, and for the second, maybe 50-75 miles northwest of Indianapolis.  For the second sighting, I’m reasonably sure that I was located no more than halfway between Indianapolis and Gary – most likely closer to Indianapolis.  Giving a generous estimation, I’d say both events occurred between 7:30 and 9:00 p.m. EST.  It’s more likely that they occurred between 7:30 and 8:30, but I wasn’t paying close attention to the time. I saw each time a single streak of yellow light occur in the northern sky heading north/northwest.  Each event lasted about 1 second each, moved extremely fast, and seemed to travel a great distance, assuming they were as far away as they appeared.  They looked to be pretty far away, but I could not accurately guess the number of miles.  The streaks were not directly overhead, but they were closer to being overhead than they were to the horizon.  They appeared to be as long as a pencil when it’s held at arm’s length away when they completed their streak.  There was a definite movement of the light.  That is, they did not appear immediately as a solid line.  They began as a point and streaked across a portion of the night sky, as if someone had drawn a line with a yellow marker.  As soon as the lights reached a certain distance, they faded immediately. There were no stars in the sky, and that coupled with the fact that I saw it twice led me to believe that they were not shooting stars.  It was not raining, nor was there thunder, so I’m sure they were not lightning streaks.  They appeared out of and returned to nothing, it seemed.  They were both very unnatural-looking phenomena.

This sighting has been an ongoing event which started in November 2005. The area the sighting occurred is on my families farm in the rural county of Culpeper Virginia. It all started when we had a party in November of 2005. The lights were first noticed by a friend who said ""what is that"" I looked and saw what I can only describe as something that looked similar to the Phoenix lights.  There were approximately 15 people at the party and we were all baffled. The lights were bright white in color and looked like a ORB/sphere in shape. After about 15 minutes of viewing, I asked my friends if what we are seeing were flares from the near by Quantico Military base. Most agreed and than one said ""Yep, I think your"" but before he could finish his sentence someone else said ""I have never seen flares move like that.  Astonishingly the lights started to move in unison in a easterly direction.  There were Approximately 10 lights, all were lined up in a straight line, from west to east, and seemed to make a noticeable outline of something HUGE. Unbelievably this collection of lights started to move, from our vantage point it looked to be at least 200 feet long and flying at a estimated 300 feet over the tree line.  The lights moved slowly approximately 2.5 miles and than started to turn north. Because of this turn these lights made a dip up then gradually swept North.  This is when we noticed there was another collection of lights on the bottom of this thing. I think this is when most of us realized this was something very special and quite extraordinary. After the lights completed their turn we were able to see the back which was comprised of what looked like eight lights, four on top four on the bottom. There also was a strange haze between the top and bottom lights, I'm not sure how to describe it but it was a blurry bluish haze. It was shortly after this when the lights faded from view as it continued to head north in the direction of Washington DC. About 6 months later I received a phone call from one of my friends, he was also at the November party and saw the ""Virginia Lights"". He explained that he had camped the night before at the property and had another sighting of the lights. This time he said it didn't turn North but stayed due east in the direction of the Fredricksburg area. The reason I am reporting this to you now is that I had another sighting of the ""Virginia Lights"" this past weekend. This time the lights were further off in the distance when first spotted and again headed North but in a more North Easterly direction, again toward Washington DC. Interestingly, the lights seem to be rising out of the tree line which is approximately 3-5 miles distance. I have done some internet research on the lights and found there has been some very similar sightings occurring throughout the Northern Virginia area. In particular, there were a few sightings in the vicinity of Dale City and the Woodbridge Va area. The description of these sightings were so eerily similar and since this was the direction we saw the lights heading makes me think we may have seen the same thing. That's all I have for now. You are welcome to contact me if you have any additional questions about this sighting. I hope this report helps you in your research. Thanks, The Virginia Lights",2008-10-31T00:00:00,38.4348,-77.9866

The streak was bright white and went from high in the sky to low behind the trees (which were about 50 yards away and 30 feet high).  I noted the streak was thicker than what I thought a shooting star to be and then thought that it was a meteor breaking through the atmosphere.  The streak of light disappeared behind the trees and a moment later a large rectangularly shaped patch of light appeared above us on our right (North-west). The vehicle we were traveling in was moving about 65-75 mph and the rectangular light was obscured by the roof of my car as I got close to it and it was directly on our right.  It is then that 4 of my passengers witnessed a second large rectangular light appear next to the first and together they traveled over the highway behind us and disappeared behind more trees.  The lights were very bright white, so much so that they were almost bluish, and my back right passenger said he saw the two rectangular patches as having bulges in their centers, leading us to believe they were cylindrical in shape, like two cans of soup.  The objects were pretty low in the sky and as far as we could tell close to us. There were six in the car.  The driver was the only one to see the 'shooting star' ahead of us on the left, and all but 1 of us saw the rectangles.  The driver did not see the duo of rectangles or their movements behind the car.  All six are seniors at Fairfield University and in good academic standing and have never seen anything like this before. NOTE: About four miles north east of where we saw these lights is Sikorsky airfield, where they build and test airplanes and helicopters, so this may have been something from there, however the movements, shape and color lead us to believe otherwise.

I am unsure of the exact time but I left the cottage my family had rented for the week in the Outer Banks of North Carolina at about 9:20 and the event occurred about 9:30 maybe. My family, consisting of my parents, two sisters, two cousins, aunt and uncle, and grandmother all left to look for fiddler crabs at the beach (though my grandmother stayed at the cottage). We looked for crabs with flashlights for a while and we saw a lot of them. My dad and uncle brought beach chairs and beer and sat on the beach enjoying the stars. After a while people began to get bored and I sat in one of the chairs and looked at the stars. The fog was creating an effect, which made some stars near the horizons flicker weirdly, and I atched the stars and occasional airplane for a while. I saw something, which my family and I thought, was a satellite but we decided it was moving too slowly and eventually lost sight of it in the fog. We concluded that it was an airplane without the flashing lights. Between this airplane(?) and the flickering effect the fog gave the stars the night sky was looking a little odd. (Though I must clarify that the night sky was still clearly visible, just hazy near the horizons.) All of my family except my dad, my aunt, and my youngest sister had gotten bored and returned to the cottage by this point in my stargazing. I was thinking of returning to the cottage when I saw something in the sky south of us that made me point and exclaim “Holy shit, what is that?” I saw three blinking red lights in a triangular pattern in the sky moving east. My dad, aunt, and sister saw it as well, and though they definitely said something, I don’t remember exactly what. We watched the sight for several minutes. The red lights moved through the sky in the same general direction. I am not sure if they were three very distant aircraft or if they were lights on one large and very close aircraft. They (or it) made no noise. The lights adjusted formation as they flew, but generally kept in a triangular pattern. This triangle seemed to change dimensions as it flew. If these were three aircraft then they had adjusted their flying formation; if it was one, it was tilting or turning. My dad and I both think that a fourth light may have appeared once or twice but we are not sure. While I was watching I distinctly thought that the lights were one large and close aircraft. I thought I could see a triangular or disk-shaped body but it was probably my imagination. The lights turned and they appeared to be moving towards us, moving in our direction and getting farther apart. This is part of what made me think it was one aircraft. I said something along the lines of Woohoo, I’ve finally seen a UFO.” (I’m a UFO/cryptozoology enthusiast and wanted to see something along these lines for a long time.) But as it came closer I began to feel somewhat frightened and crouched low to the sand. I thought about shining my flashlight towards it, but it was unlikely to be close enough to be illuminated by a cheap flashlight we found in the cottage’s kitchen drawer. All it would do is obscure the sight of the lights (and perhaps, I thought, provoke the occupants of the aircraft or aircrafts.) 	My sister got scared and returned to the cottage. I recalled what I knew of UFO and alien lore and wondered if I would return to the cottage to find that several hours had passed. After seeming to move towards us for about a minute, maybe less, (it was difficult to judge how long the experience was, I was so transfixed,) the lights seemed to move away from us. My sister had returned to the dune deck near the beach and was shining a flashlight at us. We all yelled at her to turn it off, the light was obscuring our view of the lights. The lights shortly disappeared. I do not know if they shut off or if they disappeared into the fog shrouding the horizons. With the lights gone my fear evaporated. I grinned and ran back to the cottage. My sister met me on the dune deck and asked me if the lights were gone. I told her that they were and went back to the cottage. I found that there was no lost time and informed the rest of my family that they had “missed the UFO.” My sister (the one who had not been at the beach when I saw the UFO) said that she didn’t believe my other sister when she told her the news while I was still watching the UFO. My dad and aunt quickly followed me and we explained the story to everyone else. I then wrote this down.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

The lights were in a vertical alignment, like what you would see if a commercial jet banked 90-degrees.   At the very top was a pulsating white light (not flashing).  Below that were two blue lights.  Much further below (50 to 100 feet) the blue lights was a single red light. As I followed it moving away, it seemed to be a shape like a vertical cigar.  It caught my attention and I tried to keep it in view.  I but it disappeared behind some taller buildings in the city to the North.  I then drove around another mile to the Church Street exit (Exit 7).  While exiting the thruway, I saw the same light pattern over my left shoulder.  This time, it was much larger and the light pattern was now 30-degrees from horizontal.  The craft was heading southeast towards Lake Erie and was travelling without making any detectable noise.  If it were a commercial jet, it would definitely have been very audible at the low altitude it appeared to be flying.  The exit I was on is off of an elevated section of the thruway so I quickly descended to a point where my view of the craft was blocked by the thruway. I raced to get to a location where I would have a clear view over Lake Erie.  I reached an opening about 20-seconds later, but to my dismay, the craft could not be found.  In the close up view (2nd sighting), the red light was bright and not flashing.  The blue lights now appeared to be more of a blue glow like from some type of propulsion system.  I would compare it to the blue lights on the rear of the starship destroyer in the movie Star Wars.

It immediately caught my eye because it started flying up from the ground.  At first it was moving kind of like a helicopter, but looked nothing like a helicopter.  It was dark but I could make out the shape of the object against the Maricopa lit horizon.  It was diamond shaped, with 1 light(white) on 3 of the corners, pointing down (perpendicular to the craft).  The fourth corner had more of a head light pointing in line (parallel) with the craft.

I started to think it was some sort of irrigation type sprinkler of some sort for a crop field.  The object turned vertical (as if the baseball diamond stood up on one side) and was moving as if it were attached to an arm.   It moved on an arc like path for a few seconds and then returned to a “normal” orientation and started flying, somewhat weaving back and forth, headed slightly more west than NW, not more than 100 feet above the ground.  It was definitely going faster than me (I was going approx. 80) but probably not more than 120mph as it was only moderately leaving me behind.

On August 8, 2009 I was on my way home from Connecticut with my wife and two children when I noticed a strange single orange/red light in the sky.  I was traveling easterly and the object appeared stationary and slightly to the north relative to my point of observation.  The size of the light was larger than normal planet observations and I believe in the wrong part of the sky for any common astrological phenomenon that I am familiar with (please note that I do not have a background in astronomy). I pointed the object out to my wife and son (daughter was asleep) and we tried to figure out what it was.  We all continued to watch the object while completing the remainder of our trip home (~1/4 mile). Shortly after turning on to the access road to our condo complex we all realized that there were multiple objects of the same size and basic characteristics described earlier.  My wife passed our point and shoot digital camera to me and I began to take video footage while finishing the drive home (hand out the window, very shaky). After we parked we continued to observe the objects along with several neighbors who also noticed the activity in the sky.  As we watched there were at least 24 of the objects traveling in pairs along what appeared to be the same flight path (traveling at relatively low altitude in a southeasterly direction toward Easton’s Point, then ascending).  When the objects reached a similar altitude they disappeared. None of the observers present could readily account for the origin or purpose of the lights.

On august 8, 2009, my friend and I were driving south on Roux Rd. extension towards Back Rd in Alfred, Maine. At exactly 09:20pm, I looked out my driver’s side window towards the eastern sky and observed a rectangular-shaped glowing object moving towards us, at an altitude I would approximate as about 2 or thousand feet, that immediately caught my attention as something unusual. I said “what the heck is that, and stopped the car and got out. We observed this object coming towards us, then it began to veer to our left, towards the north and apparently back towards Bunganut Pond. It was then that we saw another identical object following the first at the same speed and altitude, and then a 3rd. I did not hear any noise at all, but I had left my car running, so I told my friend to shut it off to see if we could hear anything, but the night was completely silent. At this point, my mind was trying to come up with some logical explanation for what they were, even as we were watching them silently glide past us. We observed them for at least 3 or 4 minutes. As they seemed to be about over the Pond we had just left, they started to ascend at a fairly constant speed and just kept going until they disappeared into a point. My 1st thought was that they were planes with some kind of odd lighting on them, but they were rectangular and seemingly composed only of light. Then I thought maybe they were those “paragliders”, the ones with a fan strapped to their backs, but again, I knew they would make a whirring sound as well, so we listened very intently for any noise, but there was not a sound. I have to report that it was a clear night, a ¾ moon, so the sky was pretty bright and some stars were visible. After regaining some of my composure, I realized that I had my camera phone on my belt, and I was able to excitedly take 2 pictures, the 1st normal and the 2nd zoomed as close as possible. It was hard to keep the objects in my viewfinder under zoom and apparently I did not get the 2nd picture in the frame, but the 1st definitely shows as a point of light. We stood there in awe discussing what we had seen for a few moments, and then we got back in the car and proceeded to pull onto Back Rd heading east. My friend called her father, who we assumed was either back at the camp on the Pond, or already in the car coming up behind us, to see if they had also seen it. He said they hadn’t seen anything and they were driving up behind us on Roux Rd Ext, when suddenly I saw yet another single object to my left following the exact same route as the others. I stopped the car and jumped out, and my friend began yelling to her father to look and he said he was also seeing it from Roux Rd! He was asking “what the hell is that thing” to her on the phone as I just watched it fly silently by right in front of me from right to left. It then made a wide turn to the right just as the others had and began to ascend. We watched it continue to ascend until it too disappeared into a point of light. The best I can describe the objects is that they were rectangular, and the bottom seemed to be on fire. They did not appear to have any form at all, but rather it looked like a “line of fire” with a glowing rectangle of light above the fire part. They were definitely not anything that appeared to be man-made, they moved at a constant rate, and they did not just fly away from us but rather ascended until they disappeared.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,43.4958,-70.6841

On the drive home with my boyfriend, I spotted a light in the sky that caught my attention.  It was a disk-like shape with many yellow-white lights moving in a circular motion around the craft.  The object also had one small red light near the top center of the craft.  I pointed the object out to my boyfriend and within about a minute, the object had moved all the way across the valley of Reno, NV, and could barely be seen anymore. We noticed that a helicopter came relatively close to the object several times, but the object seemed unaffected by its presence. We decided to attempt to follow the craft to investigate further.  As we drove across the city, the craft moved closer and farther away, sometimes hovering in one spot for several moments.  At one point, we got near enough to the craft that we could see with the unaided eye its true shape.  It was still disk shaped, but it had become apparent to us that there were two rows of lights instead of one, spin! ning around the craft in a circular motion.  At our closest, the object was a few hundred feet in the air away from us.  At this point, the object turned onto its side, much like a Frisbee rolling on the ground, then turned back to its flat side, and began again to move away from where we parked. We continued to drive throughout the city to get closer, but the object eventually disappeared from sight altogether.  In the dark it was very difficult to see the full shape of the object, but I and my boyfriend are certain that this was no helicopter, plane, or child's toy.  We attempted to both photograph and videotape the object, but neither method was successful in picking up the image.  To clarify, neither of us have ever seen anything like this.  We are both young college students with no history of mental illness.  We have seen TV shows regarding these kinds of incidents, and have always found them to be exaggerated and quite unrealistic.  After today, we are unsure what to believe and are searching for some sort of logical explanation.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,39.50650741150443,-119.8174511061947

The lights were the same size and the same color, white. My guess is that the object was about 1/2 mile straight up but what was so odd was the rate of speed it was travelling and the fact that there was no noise. The object cleared the western horizon to a point on the eastern horizon where I could no longer see it in less than 30 seconds. I did not give this a whole lot of thought until the object reappeared from the western horizon at approximately 10:45pm. It was travelling about 10 degrees further north this time with the same trajectory and appearance, again crossing the space from horizon to horizon in less than 30 seconds. My daughter witnessed both passes with me and my wife witn! essed only the second pass. We are very accustomed to seeing many types of aircraft flying at various altitudes as we are within 10 miles of the Rockford airport as well as being on a heavily travelled flight path used by Ohare airport. Again, the flashing lights were not that odd but rather the speed and the fact that there was no noise at all. No chance that it was a satellite as the object was way too low.

We had just changed places when I looked up and saw a large, slow moving, circular object moving from North to South about 1000 feet away and about 500 feet in the air. I was looking at it as I was facing Southwest. It is not possible for me to guess how large it was. It did not move as fast as a plane and it was much larger than a helicopter. It had red lights all around the perimeter and they all blinked in unison. That is what caught my attention. Airplanes usually have red and white lights blinking at different times. I ran into the house to get our camera, but by the time I came back out, it was much to far away to photograph. I have always wondered why no one gets a good photo of these things – now I know.  I also did not have my glasses on and as the object got further and further away, my view was blurring. I ran upstairs to get my glasses, but by the time I got back downstairs, I could not longer see the object. My husband didn’t see it--he had his back to the object and he thought I was kidding when I said there was something weird in the sky overhead. I said I thought I was looking at a UFO and he didn’t believe me. I kept telling him to ""turn around, turn around, turn around or you will miss it!""  By the time I convinced him to turn around, it had already moved quite a ways away. He did not get a good look. He said he thought it could be an airplane, but that it didn’t look like any plane he knew of. Unfortunately, he didn’t turn around soon enough to get a good look. It was all over in two to three minutes. Airplanes do not have dozens of lights in a circular pattern all blinking in unison. This object was flying about the speed of a small single engine plane or a bit slower, but it was a huge object. I am pretty sure that what I saw was not an airplane. It moved very slowly for its size and was not high enough in the air to be an airliner. It was not shaped like an airliner. It was either oval or circular in shape. It made no noise as it passed over. We live about 30 miles from an air force base. That could explain it.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,38.214000000000006,-90.0135

Observed near Millpond Park, 11178 W Blanchard Rd, Blanchard, Michigan 49310  My fiance and I saw an orange orb in the sky in mid-Michigan, USA. It was luminous and steady, not moving at all, perfectly round and orange in color. At first I thought it might be a radio tower but there was none -- it appeared over a wide field out in the country. It seemed suspended in the air, not wavering, the orange light steady and unflickering. Excepting the moon, it appeared larger than any planet I’d seen in the night sky and appeared to be northeast in the sky, judging from the position of the pavilion where we were located. Clouds moved in the sky BEHIND the object but the object was motionless. It was windy out -- light storms and rain had been moving in and out of the area that evening. We enjoy watching nature and had seen clouds drifting over the waning moon about a half hour before seeing the orb. I’d say the height off the ground seemed to be about 15 stories or more -- about the height of a radio tower. It faded away after a few minutes but never moved fr! om the spot where we’d first seen it (but it was in the sky when we first observed it… we did not observe it “appear.”)  We pointed the object out to a couple who were at the event with us. They looked at it but didn’t seem phased. I wish I’d had my camera! We tried the cell phone camera but it didn’t catch the light. It seemed beautiful and odd. My boyfriend and I are both nature enthusiasts and spend quite a lot of time outdoors observing and photographing nature. I'm a graphic designer and natural clairsentient. Interestingly enough, I had ""vibes"" about attending the gathering in Blanchard, despite an iffy weather report, and joked to my boyfriend about maybe seeing a crop circle (we'd just watched a documentary about them a few weeks before).

Hi nuforc staff this is a first for me and i feel silly actually going to the trouble to send this report, but i cant help what i saw on the evening of wednesday december 24 .  First i must say that i have seen what i believed to be a ufo several years ago (5 or more)  that was three very bright lights in the shape of a triangle.  There were muptiple witnessness that saw the object that simply disapeared after a few seconds.  So in saying that, since that incident i have become obsessed in watching for ufos or anything that could not be explained.  I have become an avid skywatcher and have not seen anything out of the ordinary since, until now.  After this incident i searched online for the proper way to report this type of thing and i found this is the way to go. On the evening of Wed. Dec 24 2008, after trying to return a christmas gift i was heading home in the major metro and just before i reached my destination i witnessed a large strange orange light in the NNW sky ahead of me.  I just happened to stare long enough approximately 6-8 seconds to witness another much smaller light that appeared to be the exact same color as the larger light eminate from the larger one and slowly float to the earth in a straight line.  When the smaller light appeared to reach the ground the light in the sky just disappeared. My first impression when i saw the light was an airplane but i remember thinking quickly the plane has dirt inside the light because of the odd color.  Then when the smaller light appeared out of the other i was quickly thinking that sparks were coming out of the plane and i was witnessing a plane malfuntion or crash.  Then when the second object never flickered and went to the earth at the same slow speed and as soon as it seemed to reach earth the object in the sky simply went out, i knew i was seeing something unordinary.  So i pulled off the side of the road and stopped to look for a plane or helicopter.  I stared at that part of the sky for anything flying and seen absolutely nothing.  The background was nothing but sky with a few high level clouds.  I hope to talk to any representative who wishes to hear this account in person.

We were visiting friends after attending a midnight Christmas service at a local Church. At approximately 12:30 am we entered the A47 perimeter road into Earl Shilton, which is under construction. Just before entering the road entitled “Carr’s Hill”, I observed a large reddish light towards the northeast. The light was stationary or moving very slowly. I did not mention it to my wife at the time as she was driving. Suddenly the light became slightly brighter and from beneath the light appeared a smaller light, which immediately descended to the ground and disappeared The smaller light seemed to be controlled as it descended very slowly. I mentioned it to my wife and she confirmed she had also observed it. We drove to the other side of Shilton, which opens up to the soar valley and we would be able to see the night view of the countryside stretching to the light haze of Leicester, however both light sources were not to be seen. Due to observing only a light source in the middle of the night, I am unable to give a true perspective of size, the light source did disappear behind the hill of Earl Shilton village and therefore the light source would have been of considerable size.   Using this perspective I would estimate that the light descended toward the area of small village called Thurlaston.

This is not a first hand viewing but rather a first hand photo so it may be an aircraft. It was about 11am on Christmas Day 25 December 2008, outside a small town Swaffham in Norfolk, United Kingdom. I am submitting this because there should not have been much flying around at 11am on Christmas Morning. My wife and I stopped the car to show our son the pigs in Norfolk. My wife took 2 pictures with maybe a 30 second interval between them no more than that.  The camera was a simple disposable camera you buy at the supermarket. I have attached both pictures.  I have smudged my boys face as I don’t like putting him on the internet. The first picture shows no object in the sky. Then she wound the camera up to the next frame and took a step back.  Then she took the next picture. The second picture shows a small object in the sky at the centre of the picture. I noticed this when we were looking at the prints. We also had a copy on CD so I looked at it on the computer.  It looks slightly strange but could also be a military aircraft. There are two US Airforce bases about 14 miles away.  RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall so it could be a fighter or something like that but I guess it would be unlikely at it was Christmas morning. Thank You",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

My daughter is 7 years old and was playing in the back yard.  I had just plugged in the deep fryer and had my back to her when she called to me to look. I turned around and saw it immediately.  You couldn’t miss it.  The sun was setting behind the mountains between my house and the Reagan Presidential Library and the sky around the mountaintops was a beautiful orange glow. The craft was a bright glowing beautiful light blue exactly the color of the inside of a flame from a lighter.  Not the red part of the flame, but the inner blue part of a lighter flame.  It was shaped like a hockey puck.  It was flying less than 100 feet above the ground and was going around in circles over the mountain slopes.  I saw it from the side from my backyard about 6000 feet or1 mile away, so from that perspective, it looked flat just like a hockey puck. I gauged the size of the craft, from 50-75 ft. in diameter, based on a large white water storage tank that sits on one of the hills it was flying over.  It flew silently in circles over these hills and since I saw it from the side, it was banking from side to side as it reached the outer extent of its circular flight, like a skateboarder in a pool. My first thought was how beautiful it was and how gracefully it traversed the sky.  Then it appeared to come closer to me and I got a little nervous.  Next it went back to the mountain and ducked out of sight.  My daughter said, ""Look, Daddy, it’s gone.""  I told her it would be right back and sure enough it came back from around the other side of the mountain like it had flown all the way around the mountain. All I could think is, ""I WANT ONE!!!""  Later, 2 huge helicopters were searching the hills with spot lights looking for something. I still look, but haven’s seen it again. Please let me know if anyone else saw it or captured of film.

It was not a plane, and it did not look like any meteor I ever saw.  It moved too quietly and too fast for a plane, and too slowly to be a meteor.  The orange glow was very distinct.  The two smaller spheres on its bottom were too large for aircraft lights and were not flashing or bright enough. As I said, the object traveled west to east, low in the sky.

Time: 11:30 AM. Place: Barnstormers Flying Club, Kempton Park, South Africa. Description: 2 disc shaped objects captured in aircraft photo.  On Sunday 17th May, 2009 I was taking photographs of radio controlled model aircraft at an airshow at my local club. The day was very clear, without any clouds, but was extremely windy as a cold front had just moved in from the South.  The only full sized aircraft were commercial airliners approaching OR Tambo International airport at an elevation of approximately 2000 metres above ground level. No small aircraft or helicopters were seen in the vicinity at all during the day. There were several incidents the worst 2 being aircraft that went totally out of control and crashed into the ground. My camera, a Cannon EOS 350 D Digital fitted with a 300 mm lens, was consistently going into an error mode requiring switching off and on to reset. This was mildly annoying. Another anomaly was that where I was sitting, amongst the parked model aircraft, all of them switched off, I though I heard the electronic relays “chattering” occasionally but dismissed it as impossible. On the following morning whilst downloading to my PC all the photographs that I had taken I spotted 2 strange “blobs”. On closer examination after zooming the picture the “blobs” resemble disc shaped flying objects. Unfortunately the focus is not good as I was focusing on the model aircraft. The aircraft were about 150 meters away but the “blobs” are about 10 to 15 kM away. Could these be the typical saucer shaped UFO’s that we read about so often?  I am a normal, educated and responsible male adult, 68 years of age. I am not prone to exaggerating and have an analytical approach as I am a qualified professional Electrical Engineer. This is the first time that I have actually seen something like this, although I have seen strange fast moving lights at night. I live close to OR Tambo international airport as well as DENEL semi military aircraft facility. If you require the original photograph please give me an e-mail address to send it to. It is 2.42 MB in size.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,,

I tried to get a picture, but couldn’t get the object clearly in the view finder of my cell phone. I left my daughter, after being sure she was inside and the door was locked. As I was going out, I looked in my rearview mirror and the two lights were right behind me!!  Man did I take off!!  It was still behind me when I got to the end of the road near the mailboxes, So I stopped. When I stopped, it stropped maybe was 30 feet from me.  I took a picture, but in my excitement, forgot to press the save button!. Whatever this thing is, it likes where it is since we have seen it three times now.  We are realizing that if it wanted to hurt us, it had every opportunity to do so.   I even stopped half way down the road and stood up in the car and out of the top sunroof -cell phone it hand to try to see it and get a picture-lights off, of course, but kept the motor running for a fast exit, if necessary. The second time we saw it, it took off in a great big hurry since it was a moonlite night.  Hope that account will be posted soon.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,37.6357,-79.0982

My family and I were traveling East on Hwy 13 from Erin towards Clarksville on Sunday April 18, 2010 around 3:45 pm.  Directly ahead of us, (guessing over Cumberland Heights area was where it was) my husband and I both watched as this oddly shaped tangerine/peach colored rectangle passed in front of our field of vision going in a northerly direction. I say oddly shaped because the leading edge had well defined 90 degree edges on it and the length was consistent with a rectangle, but the back end was less well defined almost as if it was fading or in a mist at the back end.  The colors were very pretty and bright, and kind of rippled with different shades of orange, tangerine, peach, and even a little pinkish or salmon color. We were far enough away to see it in its entirety, and we saw no other aircraft around (at first I thought it might be a banner pulled behind a plane, but the sky was otherwise empty).  My husband suggested it was a blimp, but the shape was wrong, as was the area, for the area is very rural. We watched it as we continued our drive into town for about 4 minutes and my husband even sped up to get closer to it so that we could see it in more detail.  The closer we got, the more vivid the colors were.  We were also able to say without doubt that it was not being powered by or pulled behind any other craft in the sky.  We were trying to get close enough to see if it had any marking or writing on it, but as soon as we got close enough, the road went between two tree covered hills and we lost sight.  I would say that when we lost sight of the craft we were approximately 200 yards away and the craft was flying about 150 feet high, just over the tops of the trees on the hills that surround the road.  It didn't leave any con-trail, unless the 'mistiness' of the back end would qualify, and it didn't seem to make any noise, but our distance from the craft and the fact we were in a moving vehicle could have been the reason we heard nothing. As we came out of the hills, my children (age 11 and 14) and I scoured the sky behind us and to the north for the rest of the drive in, but didn't see it again.  We figured it had to have landed somewhere in the woods, because it was just gone. We talked about it and we were all left scratching our heads.  To my total consternation, we had left the camera at home, and our cell doesn't have a camera, so we were unable to get a picture of it. We do live near an army base, and there are army aircraft of all sorts in the sky over us on a regular basis.  This sighting also took place not far from a TVA power plant off the Cumberland River.  I am unsure if this has anything to do with the sighting, but not far from the sighting is a small back country looking road that has been closed and gated with a sign saying something to the effect - closed by order of the U.S Government.  Could they all be related??   I am reporting this in the hopes that someone else saw what we saw and can verify or disprove to us what it was we saw.  My true hope is that someone else was able to get a picture or video of this UFO so that I don't wonder for the rest of my days what it was that we saw.

Then they would cross each other. I got home and looked at object with a pair of binoculars. There were three at this time. Only one came close enough for me to get a good look (about 8 seconds) I could clearly see that the closest object was a very bright silver triangle (could be from the bright sun reflection) the objects left short contrails that were shaped like a snakes tongue. These objects would perform criss cross maneuvers and sudden upward and downward arcs. I watched as a third object began to sort of dogfight with the two others. This was very high in the sky. Way above normal air traffic. After about another 5 minutes they disappeared out of site heading towards Molokai. I took about 10 photos. None are ve! ry good I only can see the contrails. The maneuvers did not seem out of this world. I was watching because they looked to be possibly, my first thought, cloud seeding because of the patterns.

On Wednesday April 20th at about 8:45pm, I was driving south bound on I-5, just south of San Clemente when I noticed a slender triangular shaped object above my car.  I couldn’t tell the size of it. It was either really high and very large or really low and not that large.  If I put my arm all the way out it was the slightly larger than my hand.  It had lights pulsating in sequence beginning from the point of the triangle (the front) down to the back and then back up to the front.  When it reached the front the lights would pause for a second and then start the rotation over again.  I followed the object for a total of about 10 minutes, and was able to get a pretty good look of it.  The lights on it where a light blue in color.  The bottom/belly of the object appeared to be rounded. The object appeared to be a midnight blue in color but that could have been a reflection from the flashing blue lights.  For about 5 minutes the object was going with traffic while zigzagging left and right over the freeway.  After a little bit, still traveling in a zigzag path, it began to speed up until it traveled out of sight.  At 9 pm my boyfriend called me.  While explaining to him what I had seen,  I saw another light.  At that point I was coming up to the agricultural check point on the northbound side of I-5.  At first I thought it was an airplane.  When I got closer I realized it wasn’t moving and it was only about 100 yards above the freeway.  It was a solid white light approximately the size of my thumb at arms length just floating about the freeway.  As I drove past it I was able to look out the drivers side window and see nothing attached to it.  It was just a single bright floating light.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,33.45240084388186,-117.6169088607595

It was very high in the air, way too high to be a helicopter with a spot light on, and was definitely not a plane.  I don't know the exact direction, but it came from the inner harbor area, and went over Patterson Park.  I asked everyone to look up at the light and everyone agreed it was definitely not a helicopter due to how high it was.  It seemed to be in the height of where commercial planes fly, but it was definitely not a plane.  It was about a pen cap size, definitely bigger than a star or a planet you can see with your eyes.  It moved slowly, it didn't zig or zag, just in a slow fluid way.  Then, towards the end, it was hard to see as it was like it was shimmering out of sight.  You really had to look for it to find it towards the end, then it just disappeared.  It was a clear night with barely any clouds in the sky so it wasn't like it disappeared behind a cloud.

My wife mentioned that she and some other people saw the same light earlier in the evening in the same approximate path but didn't mention it until the second sighting.  I was videotaping at the time it was sighted the second time and managed to get some video of it.  It's not great video as I had to remove a lens from the camera I was using to shoot the fireworks and struggled with the focus as it had been set to manual for the fireworks setup.  Some of the video is crisp enough to at least see the object clearly for a few moments at a time.  I'm fairly certain this was probably something terrestrial but it didn't resemble fireworks, aircraft, or balloons i'm familiar with so I figured i'd submit this and see if anyone else saw it as well.  The observers ranged in age from 13 to late 40's.  Blue collar to white collar workers.  Most reside in Indiana.  Several are from the Chicago area.",2010-07-10T00:00:00,41.5933,-87.1562

This sighting lasted probably less than a minute.  I walked outside on my patio early that morning and looked up at the stars in the clear predawn sky.  I turned my head to the left and at that moment I noticed a bright light, maybe twice the size of Venus.  The light appeared to be moving right at me even though very high up and it seems that as it noticed that I was looking straight at it, it then began to move backwards and then to go up even higher until it finally became non-visible. So many thoughts went through my head at a rapid speed regarding what I might have thought this thing to be as I was looking at it.  I knew that it couldn’t be a satellite because it was just too bright and because of the way that it had just suddenly reversed itself and went straight up till it disappeared.  I have never seen satellites behave that way.  There were no running lights, no port or starboard lights on what I was seeing.  It was just a big ball of light.  The light also seemed to be sort of flickering at the center.  I say flicker, but I mean that it was more like if one were to take some crinkled tin foil and move it around in the hand just slightly so that it throws light reflections around. There actually was a car going by at exactly the same time that I saw this light in the sky.  I remember thinking as it happened that the lights on this car could be reflecting on something and causing this light in the sky, but quickly dismissed that idea since the car was down below me and on the street behind my apartment, which is on the second level, and the bright light I saw in the sky seemed too high up to be a reflection from anything on the ground. This sighting affected me in a very unfamiliar way.  I feel that my reaction to it was very instinctual and quick. I became very afraid as I stood there watching it move up into non-visibility.  I think the hair on my arms stood up and that it made my skin crawl.  The one thing that really got to me was that I felt this light was being stealthy and creeping in on me and when I turned my head to look at it, it just backed away, as though it knew that I was looking at it and sort of catching it in the act.  I felt like a frightened animal, or a cornered animal.  I then just gave up on watching it disappear and bolted back inside.  Upon entering I looked at the clock and it was 4 a.m.  My clock on the wall is two minutes fast, so the actual time was more like 3:58 a.m.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,45.70981012145749,-111.05357489878543

Having said that, what I and two other people, saw last night was clearly a UFO as it’s flight characteristics, shape, engine, and course defies normal know aircraft.  Also note that  I’m former military, Commercial Law Enforcement, and of sound mind and body with Pilot vision with corrective glasses on (I was warring my new prescription glasses).   The below state of events is true and factual to the best of my knowledge. The tempture in Yamhill County during the day was in the lower 90’s and where I live about 3 miles north of the town of Yamhill on State Hwy 47 the wind was picking up and I decided to go outside and let the dogs play and water some plants, a new maple tree, and some rose bushes while letting the house cool down for the night.   I had just completed watering the tree, my landlord's son had some guest come by earlier and they were leaving.  As they were leaving I walked to the west corner of the front porch and began to water the rose bush.  It was a beautiful night, not a cloud in the sky and all the stars were shinning bright.  I looked up and toward the west hills of the small valley where I live and saw a bright white sphere shaped object moving across the sky at a low altitude and making no sound.   Now you have to understand aircraft of all types fly over the house all the time and some at low altitude and in all directions.  I’m close to the McMinnville Airport, Port of Portland Hillsboro Airport which can both handle jet liners (up to 747-100 @ McMinnville and  757 @ Hillsboro)  plus the house is on the glide path for final at the Portland International Airport.  I can see their tail markings without the use of binoculars.   When the jets come in on a PDX vector it’s south to north and their landing lights are on and at night the lights project forward.   This object was not projecting light forward.  It was making no sounds of any kind and when it moved from west to the east it wasn’t a smooth glide it was jagged.  I stepped back as it started across the house so I could get a better look.  I kept saying, “ what the hell is that thing.”  I called out for landlord’s son as loud as I could. When he came out of his home I just said,  “ look . . . . . . . . !” and point up in the sky at the object. I then said, “ listen . . . . . . no sound.”  He agree and about a that time is when his wife came out to see what all the commotion was about and he pointed up and said, “look at this.”  His wife said, “ It’s not flying to straight is it?” I replied , “no it’s not.” Now the object was not flying over the house, north of the home.  Within a few minutes the craft was over my landlord's son’s house and still heading east.  This is when I notice a regular aircraft, flying higher than the object (at least 10,000 feet higher) and in the same direction and that gave me some distance reference and scale as that aircraft was at about 33,000 feet or higher and the object was much lower than that.  Still moving without sound and in a jagged direction, the object cleared the landlord's son’s home and was heading of the west hills of this small valley.   As it crossed over it disappeared (vanished) with out any type of marker lights from behind it.  I stood there with the landlord’s son and we where comparing what we had seen.   That’s when I became scared for the first time sense the death of my wife.  My thoughts are one of come up with some kind of logical kind of answer to what I just saw. ""If I saw what I think I saw . . . . . . . . it’s not real . . . . . . is it?""  ""What if it comes back?""  I stayed out side looking up for about a half hour and then it dawned on me to call the police non emergency line and report what I had seen.  I called Yamhill County  Communication Center (YCOM) and he contacted a sheriff’s Deputy and he in turned called me and left a message with y! our (National UFO Reporting Center) phone number as he didn’t know how the handle such a report.

This was about 5 miles south of the Eugene airport and directly in the landing/takeoff path of aircraft from the airport.  If you look at a map of the airport you will see the main runway runs north to south, so this UFO crossed directly across the path of normal air traffic.  I haven't see an airplane ever move in an west to east pattern this close to the airport. Craft details.  I have no idea how to judge the height or speed of the UFO.  It was much too bright and moving to slow to be a satellite.  We did see satellite about 10 minutes after the UFO was gone for comparison.  The craft flew directly over head and was completely silent.  As it moved east, it finally sped up and was not visible any longer. About 30 minutes, we either saw the same UFO or one that looked exactly like it.  It was moving south to north at a rapid pace, but was far to the east of us.  An airplane with blinking light was moving in the opposite direction at the same time, but the UFO was much quicker and appeared to be at a much lower altitude. I also believe we saw this UFO on July 4th.  We were north of the Eugene Airport by 10 miles.  The light appeared to be south of the Airport and stopped hovered for about 10 minutes.

We did not think too much of it and continued to drive to Hilltop parking lot. The parking lot was full because of the time of night and it was hard to find a spot. We were driving up and down the lanes, suddenly facing the hilltop dorms. Hovering very closely over the buildings was a strange craft. We stared at it, and it began to move VERY slowly, without any sound. As it got closer we were able to get a better look, the aircraft was in the shape of a triangle, with orange lights at each point of the triangle and a white light in the middle, and from what we observed it was about twice the size of a car. We kept driving, staring at it. We couldn’t see it anymore as we were weaving up and down the lanes. Then as we turned again, we realized it was above our car, following us throughout the lot. We stopped the car, and the craft moved over the trees. Thinking it was gone we decided to move the car to a different area of the parking lot. As we began to move again, the craft started to come back towards the area we were in. Terrified, we jumped out of the car and ran to our building. We cannot explain what we saw.

I was staring at the sky in the backyard of an isla vista house where a band was playing. There were about 25 people in the backyard with me, but they were over near the house while I was away to the side a bit just star gazing. Suddenly I noticed movement in the sky and saw a triangular shaped ship moving across the sky at a smooth, quick cruising speed, dead silent. I couldn't tell how large or far away it was, but if you were looking in the sky, it was about the size of a large tostito chip. The ship could have been black, or possible a grey (it was dark outside so it was difficult to tell, but I could see the whole outline of the ship.) Along the sides there were lights in a V pattern pointing in the direction that the ship was moving. You could barely see the ship in the sky, as the lights were incredibly dim. They may have just been white circles on the bottom of the ship, but I could see the V pattern made with 7 dim small circles. While I watched it fly over, the significance of what I was seeing set in when it was already directly over my head and moving away fast. I turned around and started yelling and pointing so someone else would see, but everyone kind of lazily looked up, and noone else saw it. I immediately went and called 411 to hook me up to a UFO hotline, and the guy just cracked up and sent me to the FBI which was an answering machine. Interestingly, this coincidentally happened right after. I wanted to head out to find where to report it online, but I thought I would stop at the beach first and star gaze for a bit (hoping another one would show up). I actually couldn't stop looking up for the rest of the night. Anyways, these 2 guys were walking up from the beach as I walked over. We started talking and I told them what happened earlier. I was talking about how crazy it was that I just saw this article, and heard an interview of Dr Edgar Mitchel (6th man on the moon) basically confirming that aliens were real, the gov knows it and has for 60 years, and area 51 was actually a crash where they have bodies. (check out the interview http://www.kerrangradio.co.uk/Article.asp?id=804160&spid= )  Now check this out: The guy I'm talking to acts surprised I mention area 51 and says ""my dad worked for area 51. He's actually in therapy right now because of it."" I freak out and start asking him questions and he continues ""he didn't even tell me. My mom had told me even though she wasn't supposed to."" How crazy is that? As he was leaving I yelled to him ""Hey, tell me that sh*t's real. They have bodies don't they?"" he replied ""yeah it's real."" Then he kinda realized what he was saying and he says ""shit, I just told you some shit i'm not even sposed to know and Im def not supposed to say"".  I'm a believer.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,,

The time was about 22 minutes after 10 pm when I noticed a very bright star off in the south southwest sky, between two other stars of average brightness.  It wasn't long, maybe just a few seconds before we both realized this very bright star seemed to be moving.  When we say bright, we mean like venus has been for the last several weeks, just really standing out in the night's sky.  So the ""craft"" (obviously can't call it a star now that it's moving), began to move upward in relation to it's neighboring stars then began to get brighter very quickly which we realized was being caused by it moving rapidly in our direction. As it approached I guessed it looked to be no more than 1 mile up, either that or it was a very large craft because as it flew over us we could distinguish individual lights on the body of the craft.  Also I could faintly see that there was a blinking of some sort, however my girlfriend got a much better view as she had run inside and got the binoculars.  She then raced to the north side of the house as it flew overhead and told me a moment later that she was able to clearly see what appeared to be a paramecium shaped craft with rythmically pulsing light from front to back. The craft continued it's North by Northeasterly course until I could no longer see it. It was extremely bright to me the whole 3 minutes that I was watching it. I have been fascinated by technology and space my whole life and am very familiar with our current abilities as humans in regards to vehicles and propulsion systems.  This craft or vehicle that my girlfriend and I both saw last night in no way compares to anything I have ever seen or heard of that humans can construct. It doesn't even compare to stretching our most advanced flying vehicles to the point of absurdity.  The reason I say that is the most shocking part of the experience for us:  The Speed of this craft, based on its apparent size, distance and luminosity had to be upwards of 5 or 6 Hundred MPH.  For all of its speed and distance covered, the craft we saw remained COMPLETELY silent.  I mean this thing didn't make a sound. Not in the distance and not when it was right above us, and it looked like it was over Sacramento 1 minute, then right above us in Nevada City the next, then on it's way over Nevada the next minute.

They asked me to come look outside; that they have seen a UFO. I rolled off the couch and when I looked, there was a bright light, that looked like a star...  The problem?  It was moving in circular, diagonal, vertical and horizontal motions.  It is sort of difficult to see, but if stared at long enough it is possible to see the movement.  Also, it seemed to have smaller red dots sort of behind it, but still part of the same craft.  Not only did we see this moving object but we saw a much smaller, and less dim, object come from the larger UFO and fly through the sky and disappear! I cannot even explain the amazement we all shared. Now, tonight, I decided to follow up on what I had seen last night and it is there again! It isn't even that far over in the sky as it previously was before..  Maybe a foot or so from my point of view. Tonight already I have seen about five flying objects around this light. They fly around it and then seem to disappear out of nowhere.  One my boyfriend pointed out and because before disappearing a blue beam of light shot from it.  Please look into this.. I feel as if my family cannot be the only ones who are witnessing this. P.S my boyfriend, a skeptic beyond all belief, even agreed that there were flying objects and that the white light in the sky was moving! I still remain amazed as I write this letter to you.
