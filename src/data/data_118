I was watching TV in my bedroom when a strange bright, blue orb passed across my shade drawn window right in front of my that I was facing.  It was going from east to west as I looked south.  It crossed the top half of the window width in about 2-3 seconds, falling at approximately a 25 degree angle.  I had my bedroom light on so to see it through my ratfia type shades it had to be very bright.  I thought it could be a meteor, large drone or UFO and thought it was going to crash some where into the area in the fields by Connors Rd or just west toward Rt 47. I quickly jumped up and went to the window in the bathroom where it had no shades to see if there was fire in the nearby field.  Didn't see any.  Went out onto the front porch to look and listen and heard many dogs or coyotes barking.  It was so unusual that I decided to get in my car and drive down the road to see if I could see some crash or fire. I went down Red Gate the next street south to see if it was perhaps closer.  Drove down to the T with my lights off looking to the south to see if I could see anything. I didn't see anything unusual, so I went further to Conners Rd.  I drove down it to the West, also with my lights off looking on both sides of the road. Didn't see anything so I turned around half way up the hill before Rt 47 then drove back to Kendall. When I came to the stop sign at Connors and Kendall, I looked South and saw a large Black SUV type vehicle with headlights off, but yellow parking lights on, near the Woodlands entrance but on the East side of the road.  It was strange as I couldn't imagine a car stopped there unless it had seen it to. I thought about stooping to ask them if they had seen it, but it didn't feel right being there, so I didn't. I drove back home, parked in the garage, got out of the car and immediately heard a Helicopter overhead going west near to me and then just past Rt. 47.  I went out onto the driveway to see if I could spot it and immediately heard a second Helicopter that seemed to be coming up from the south along Rt 47 west of me. All of this had taken place in under 15 minutes. I stayed out in the middle of the dark driveway for about 3 or 4 minutes until I didn't hear the helicopters anymore. ((Dog's name deleted)) was barking inside the house so I closed the garage door and went inside to calm him. I then opened the front door and went onto the porch to listen. I didn't hear anything more. No helicopters or strange sounds, or lights even at that point--probably about 9:50 pm.  It was all very strange and I now think maybe some type of UFO fell nearby and the helicopters were out scouting or retrieving.  The large Black SUV could have been Men in  Black as the car gave me a strange feeling, big, dark, tinted windows I think, and in a strange country road location to stop and pull over.  After I had a chance to think about it all, it was just very unusual.",2017-12-21T00:00:00,,

It appeared to be a triangular shaped craft with 3 large white lights.  (These white lights were way larger than typical ""position marker,"" lights.)  The white lights were on all three ""points of the triangle.""  One on the leading edge/nose of the craft and one on each other tip of the triangle.  These lights were all flashing in unison at a rate of roughly once every 1 to 1.5 seconds. The clouds were relatively low that night and the craft was just above the cloud line, but only about half to 2/3's high as the traditional aircraft that flew over about 5 minutes later, between approx 23:00 and 23:10.  (Give or take 10 minutes.)  (I had no trouble seeing the red and green position marker lights on the wing tips of the regular airplane, even though it was significantly higher in altitude.)  The sketchy part was that the triangular craft flew into these thicker clouds, and from my vantage point, disappeared as it went behind a large evergreen tree.  After waiting for about 30 seconds, I was astounded that it did NOT come out the other side of the denser clouds, (or the tree.)  I even walked to a different vantage point to change the angle I was viewing from, so that I could see beyond the tallest evergreen, and the craft didn't reappear.  I continued to watch for at least another 10 minutes, but the only other thing I saw was a standard airplane.  Since it was dark, I can't tell you what it was or even how many engines the standard plane had. The fact that the white lights that were flashing, were far larger (at least 10x bigger, and that's accounting for the difference in altitude too,) and flashing much more slowly than the airplane I saw with the red and green position lights. Kind of weird, huh?  Kind of bummed that I didn't get a peek at the craft itself, just the lights in the sky. Oh yes, the of the 3 lines that made up the triangle, the two that met at the nose were equal in length, the trailing edge of the triangle, that line was a little bit longer, making the craft not quite an equilateral triangle, but rather an isosceles triangle.  (Sorry, geometry is not my strong suit, nor are things like judging angles and altitude.  I am hoping that the low cloud cover and the aircraft that flew over afterwards will give you more to go on.)  I did locate an image that looks very similar to what I saw on google images and will send you the link if you would like.",2017-11-03T00:00:00,48.06684121621622,-122.20199054054054

I saw something in the middle of the night last night that I feel compelled to report to you. I have been unable to sleep at night this past month, and have become used to lying awake in bed while it is dark, and then falling asleep as day breaks.  I have attributed this to stress, as my stress levels this past few months have been off the charts. I have recently started sleeping with the windows open, since the cooling breeze off San Francisco Bay comes through my bedroom window.  As I live on the third floor of the building, it is uncomfortably warm most of the day, so I welcome the cool breeze. There is another building approximately 20 feet away out this same window that is about 4 feet taller than this one, I am thus afforded a bare horizontal “strip” of sky, starting above the building next door, ending with the top boundary of the window, covering a span of approx 10 degrees of sky, as the primary view out my bedroom window. Most nights I simply lie there and stare at that strip of sky, which, frankly, is quite dull.  At most, I catch a plane or two slowly circling in its low-altitube path toward the Oakland International Airport, which is about five minutes from my apartment building.  There is the occasional star that will break through the haze, or be plainly visible on clear nights, but I have never seen anything unusual, until last night/this morning. During the wee hours (approx 3:50am) this morning (11-23-17), I was lying there, staring out the window, unable to sleep again.  It was fairly overcast last night, with a faint star sometimes shining through the overcast haze as it would thin at times, and then becoming invisible again.  This is usually what I see, other than the occasional plane on its low-altitude path to OAK airport. At approx 3:50am, my jaw dropped open as I saw a single bright white light ZOOM past, completely in my view.  It went by in literally a split second, but I clearly saw it.  My window faces a few degrees NW of true West, so this object would have been travelling a few degrees NE of true North.  Its path was completely horizontal, ie: it went in a line parallel with the top of the next building.  There was NO sound.  It was completely silent. It was obviously low enough to be below the overcast haze.  It was uncharacteriscally bright.  It also travelled faster than anything I have seen before.  It literally ZIPPED past my window, flying horizontally, in the span of a second .  It was there, coming into my view from the left, travelling to the right, and was gone. This is only the second sighting of something I had no explanation for in my life.  It was flying faster than any aircraft I have ever seen, including fighter jets.  Much faster.  And there was no sound as it went past, ruling out a fighter jet.  And it was a single, bright white dot of light.  No red, no blue, no green, no blinking.  Just a steady white light travelling horizontally, faster than anything I’ve ever seen before. As far as altitude or distance, my only frame of reference is that it was below the layer of haze, but above the roof of the building next door, obviously.  And it was brilliantly bright white.  My overall impression was that it was flying fairly “low”, compared to how high the planes coming into OAK usually fly. I have not seen any other reports from early this morning, so I have no idea if anyone else saw it and said anything about it.  It was gone before I could even begin to clamber out of bed to see if I could see it off to the right. Thank you for taking the time to read this.  As I said, this is only the second time in my life that I have seen something in the sky that could not be explained away by conventional explanations. The only other time I’ve seen something inexplicable was entirely different. It happened in 1999, when I lived in Austin, Texas.  I lived in the country at the time, and was taking a walk down our long dirt driveway to make sure our front gate was closed.  It had to have been between 10pm and midnight, but I do not remember the exact month and day.  I want to say it was in the middle of summer.  Our property was oriented squarely on the East/West axis, so our driveway was a 400 foot straight dirt road along our North border, running exactly East-West, with the gate at the road being on the Eastern boundary. It was an overcast night, so the cloud ceiling was obvious, as the city lights a few miles away bounced off the haze and created bit of a pinkish glow to the clouds.  Glancing up slightly so my eyes took in the Eastern horizon I saw a large, unmistakeably rigid “V” shaped bank of oddly cohesive clouds moving directly from North to South, about 15 degrees above the horizon. It was like watching a “fuzzy pink V of clouds” move silently in a straight line.  It was not moving fast, but steadily and silently.  It disappeared behind a bank of trees on our property and i was not able to follow it any further. No sound, no lights emanating from it, but rather a true “V” that seemed to be made of clouds, moving silently and steadily, and what seemed purposefully, from North to South, at a consistent rate of speed. This was not “clouds being blown aimlessly by the breeze”…there were no other “low” clouds below the ceiling of the overcast sky.  There were absolutely no “lower” clouds present at all, besides this “V”.  This thing moved steadily, as if propelled at a consistent rate of speed.  I remember thinking, “Cloaked craft made to look like clouds?” at the time. I was heavily into UFO research during that period of my life, and had, of course, read/seen the reports of “V-shaped craft”, but this thing was not your typical “big black V”…it had no lights, and it had to have been huge…covering at least several city blocks in the span between the “tips” of the ends of the “V” shape.  It was not a solid triangle, but instead a “V” or “boomerang” of pinkish fuzzy clouds moving below the obvious cloud ceiling above.  I never saw it nor anything like it again. Sorry to have squeezed two sightings into one report, but actually remembered the Austin sighting after detailing the one. Thank you again.  I check your site regularly for new reports.  Yours is the most measured and least “hyped and sensationalized” of all the “ufo reporting” sites out there, and I commend you on your method of reporting.",2017-12-04T00:00:00,37.768319587628866,-122.27405773195876

My boyfriend went to his mother's camper and had her come out and look also.  The lights moved and changed directions a few times.  We watched for about 5 mins then 2 helicopters flew towards the lights at which time the orb stopped moving then proceeded north west and the green light headed west.  When the lights were too dim to see clearly, I was headed back into the house when my son yelled at me to look because there were more lights.  When I looked to the West I saw two hot pink very bright lights with a green light in the center lined up perfectly spaced vertically coming over the mountain straight towards us. We then yelled at the neighbor and my boyfriend to look and I knocked on my ! other neighbor's door and had him and his girlfriend come out and look at the lights as they were so shocking amd unusual.  The two pink and green light moved in a strange manner, shifting position and changing direction quickly moving towards us but always keeping in a triangular pattern with the green in the center. Just to the east  of the pink and green lights was a smaller  red light we noticed at one point that was harder to see and it did not follow the pink and green lights as they traveled so we lost track of it. We saw what we identified as a plane come across the sky from the West towards the formation at which time the green and pinklights paused then moved off to the northwest, shifting an appearing to get farther apart but still equally distanced and triangular in nature.

We stayed outside for about 10 mins after that and saw no further strange lights but an incredible amount of air traffic flying much lower than usual which we also found strange.

The object was a greyish/purple color, couldn't be a could as the clouds were way darker in color.  In the middle of the object was a single bright light, never flashed but remained constant.  It moved in a sidewards motion very slowly.  I noticed as it moved, it started slowing disappearing.  It took a quick second until I noticed it was gone by the Hakimo side mountain.

Its bright red light was on in addition to the mandatory flashing red light, so that was really easy to recognize, and the sound was familiar. The object itself was discernible at first only because it was blocking out the sky behind it.  I thought it was an owl or flock of birds, but quickly realized that it was about the size of two aircraft carriers end to end, based on my estimate of the altitude.  I believe it was at about 50,000 feet or higher.  Unfortunately, there is just no way for me to guess the altitude.  It may have been much lower and smaller than I believe, but it was completely silent and it would have taken a massive amount of engine power to maintain lift (although the shape was less than aerodynamic) on anything that size, so I am unable to comprehend it being any lower.  I can't imagine anything being much higher, because of the massive size.  My rational brain does not compute that.  There was no apparent exhaust or visible means of propulsion, which probably would have been evident at lower altitudes. It was jet black, although there were six or seven evenly spaced, small, lighter areas on each side of the craft which provided enough contrast so that I could make out the perimeter and track the object itself rather than extrapolating the path based on the stars it was blocking out. It was all very dark and visually difficult to follow, but it was just visible enough for me to report objective facts with absolute certainty. It was cigar or diamond shaped; the ends were not blunt but there was no way to tell how the ends were specifically shaped from my perspective.  It definitely had a length to width ratio of about 1:5 from my vantage point.  It was traveling at a high speed regardless of altitude, covering a 20 degree arc of sky in about 30 seconds.  It actually looked more like a speeding rail car than an aircraft, just smoothly gliding through the sky.  The entire sighting lasted about 45 seconds.  At that point, I was no longer able to visually track the object because of light pollution in its general direction.  I was quite bewildered. MCAS Miramar is about ten miles west of the objects apparent position.  They do operate various RADAR sites. Montgomery field is a municipal airport which has RADAR, 10 miles southwest, as is the international airport, Lindbergh Field, which would be twenty miles southwest of the apparent object position.  Miramar maintains 24 hour ""full service"" jet intercept ability with at least two pilots and interceptor/fighter jets available at any given time, along with proper ground control and communications.  That info was provided by the base Provost Marshall several years ago and is not speculative.  It would be worthwhile to verify that again. I have seen an intercept; and can safely say that two fighter jets flying at 3,500 feet with afterburners on over a residential neighborhood is quite audibly (and visually) spectacular at night.  This occurred minutes after a sighting which occurred with my family in about 2009.  A report was filed on that sighting as well; with the in! vestigation ultimately suggesting that we may have seen the ISS in orbit.  Last I checked, the ISS was not a self-luminous saucer shaped object making impossible maneuvers and scaring the hell out of my family and myself, only to be chased by jets less than three minutes after we saw it.  But I'm no NASA engineer, that's for sure.",2017-11-03T00:00:00,32.97723982300885,-117.02342477876107

We constantly have planes taking off and doing exercises at night.  I am familiar with how they come in to land, the patterns they do, coloring of the lights, etc.   On this particular night I was working on multiple aircraft and as I'm walking to one of them I noticed a bright orange light coming from the South West, which is directly in line with our runway.  I don't particularly remember any of our jets going up prior to seeing the light but could possibly be a cargo aircraft.  Normally our jets have bright white lights, but since this light was orange, I assumed it wasn't one of ours, or the bulb was just old and needed to be replaced.  It didn't appear to be moving but normally their approach is pretty far so it could have been descending at a slow rate. Thinking nothing else of it, I continued to work on the aircraft for about 5-10 minutes and noticed the light was still there in the exact same spot.  Perhaps maybe it made a go-around, but it never passed over the base to make a pattern like they normally do if they miss the approach or practice.  The light stayed there for about 2 minutes after looking at it then disappeared.  I told my other co-workers and they saw the light too, but jokingly played it off that they were aliens.  About 5 minutes later the light appeared again but this time there were multiple smaller orange lights in a formation to the left of the larger light, in the exact same spot again. I couldn't tell if the smaller lights were all individual craft or part of a larger one. None of them appeared to be moving. I thought maybe they could be flares and they're just just practicing but it made no sense that 1, the lights all were the same color, 2. why would they pop flares while on approach to land? and 3. flares die out after about 5-10 seconds but these stayed eliminated for another 2-3 minutes. Then they all disappeared. This repeated 3 more times until it stopped. Nothing ever landed later that night, and found out later none of the squadrons were flying at that time. The light was bright enough at times I thought it was coming right towards us but it never moved from that single spot. There are no other larger airports around that can support aircraft with large lights like the ones I saw, except for 40 miles north west in Boise.  Can't guarantee what I saw is concrete evidence of extraterrestrial objects but they were definitely out of the ordinary and I haven't seen the lights prior or after the incident. Normally jets practice in the same areas and do the same patterns for about a week or so so all the pilots can practice at it since we have multiple day/night shifts. Was really strange.

As I watched, they continued flying in circular formation, criss crossing one another, at the same time rising higher and higher. I ran inside to grab my phone and tried to record it, but when I got back out, (literally 3 seconds later) the objects were so high in the sky I could barely see them anymore.  My camera could not detect anything.  I continued watching them move up, and a little southeast until they finally disappeared completely. All of this happened within the timeframe of 1 minute, just minutes past the 3 o'clock hour, central time.",2017-12-04T00:00:00,39.79513762886598,-89.66251786941581

Relative to the size of a full moon this figure appeared 4 times larger as it got closer to the surface of land.  While in the sky compared to a full size moon it was smaller than the moon and appeared to be only as 1/32 the size of the moon.  Also smaller black Dracula drooping looking figures flew across the moon and were smaller than the moon.  The crafts sort of moved like a bumble bee or a fly.  Many planes and jets were in the sky.  Smaller tear drop light figures also began appearing in the sky in a very calm smoothing upward progression.  The sky was very active.

Its speed was comparable to the many airplanes that circle our location waiting to land in Philadelphia. It's altitude was comparable to the air traffic as well which is approximately 10,000 - 12,000 feet. This object had an aura or haze around it.  It made a slow turn to the South and eventually faded from sight.  Its speed was constant and its altitude remained constant the entire 3 minutes I observed it. I took 3 pictures with my phone.

I thought it was a really clear night and we were looking at the constellation of the little dipper.  We thought the little dipper had red stars...until they started moving.  The red lights flickered and moved around each other, as if they were weaving between themselves.  After about two minutes, we noticed that there was one cluster of red stars.  It was like a circle of four, very tight knit red lights. This cluster moved over Polaris, and we were absolutely shocked that it blocked the star.  All the red lights began to move towards each other, towards this cluster. The friend that noticed the red lights ran indoors to retrieve his phone to take a picture, and I tried shouting to him to come back; something weird was occuring.  Within ten seconds of our friend being gone, every red light added on to the cluster, creating a sort of 'pinecone' of red lights.  They were together, but you could clearly see that there was a black line or space between each light.  It was ovular, being thinner at the top and thicker in the middle. Two or three lights in this pinecone of red light would flash white before turning back to red.  Most of the lights flashed eventually, some did not. Our friend ran back outside and exclaimed in fear, we were all excited and scared at the events unfolding before our eyes.  The red craft moved suddenly down, further and further until it was nearly out of view behind a neighbor's house.  As the craft moved further down, it caught on fire at the bottom as it entered the Earth's atmosphere.  It couldn't have been a weather balloon or asteroid, nothing we thought of convinced us; rational explanations didn't sound convincing.

I have debated for years whether to report this or not and have decided to file this report because the incidents, I feel, are related.  I am not exactly sure of the exact time for incident one, but it was a full moon, I had my 1957 chevy and have determined it must have been during the June, July, or August 1965 time period.  Incident two happened about July or August 1985-6 because our son was born in 1973 and he was about 13 when this incident occurred. Incident One:  Around summertime (nighttime 9:00pm’ish) 1965 my then-girlfriend (now wife) and I were sitting on the back of my 57’ chevy listening to music and looking up at the sky – near downtown Ogden, Utah.  It was a beautiful moonlit night.  Hill Air Force Base (HAFB) is just south of us approx. 10 miles and we were watching the airplanes flying out from HAFB and over us.  I believe it was a C-119 flying box-car that was flying north from HAFB when we noticed a round circular object flying right on its tail following it north towards Brigham City.  The moon was full and its shine lit both the airplane and the UFO up.  We could clearly see the wings and double fuselage/box tail section of the airplane and clearly see the perfectly round object right behind it following it.  It appeared just a bit smaller than the airplane. It had 3 colored lights around its circular perimeter.  We watched it for a few minutes as they both flew north.  Suddenly the UFO abruptly shot right (east) instan! tly over the mountains east of Ogden and flew south across the peaks of the mountain range. We were pretty excited so my girlfriend and her 2 little brothers and I jumped in the car and headed south towards Weber Canyon couple miles to see if we could see it again.  We didn’t, so I turned around and headed back towards her house.  After a couple of minutes her brothers (around 10 and 13 years old) kept yelling “there it is, there it is!”  I finally stopped and jumped out of the car and the UFO was flying slowly north again in and out of the canyons along the mountain side near the top of the peaks.  This range is between Ogden Canyon to the north and Weber Canyon to the south with Mt. Ogden peak near the middle.  The Snow Basin Ski Resort is on the east side of Mt. Ogden. I watched it a few minutes as it slowly flew north, we then headed back to her house near 30th street and Ogden Avenue which was only a few more blocks than where we stopped.  When we got there and out of the car again the UFO was still moving slowing along the top of the peaks in and out of the canyons.  There are a fair number of small canyons and ridges between Ogden and Weber Canyons.  Suddenly the UFO stopped just above the mountain and hovered very near an area known as Hidden Valley which is north of Mt. Ogden and south of Ogden Canyon and near the top of that part of the mountain.  This area is just north of the Snow Basin Ski Resort.  The UFO’s lights went off, the silver object was still hovering there and slowly descended onto the top of the mountain above Hidden Valley finally ending just out of view.  Due to the moon light, the UFO was clearly visible and perfectly round.  The Hidden Valley trail starts at about 22nd street and east of Ogden, is about 2.5 miles ! with a vertical ascent of about 2200 feet above the valley floor (description from website).  Mt. Ogden’s elevation is 9570 feet.  Soon after it disappeared from view, a bright yellow light slowly flashed on and off out of the exact area the UFO had either disappeared or landed on the top the mountain.  We watched until nearly 2:00 am.  The flashing was repeated slowly as on for a second then off for a while like a minute or more. My girlfriend’s mother and several neighbors plus she and I and her two little brothers watched this light flash for a long time.  We all watched it also descend into that area of the mountain. Finally, I called our local popular radio station which at that time was KLO radio.  I’m guessing I called him around 11:00 o’clock or so.  He promptly ridiculed me and made fun of me pretty harshly then told me he didn’t want to hear about and hung up on me.  Within a few minutes a small airplane flew out of Ogden airport just east of us a few miles and flew directly towards that same area of the mountain and made one circle around the area where that light had flashed and returned directly to the airport.  I then believed others must have seen the UFO as well otherwise an airplane wouldn’t have flown out there and straight back. Being 17 years old, I was pretty irritated at the KLO announcer’s attitude towards me so a drove out to the KLO radio station at about 2:00 am.  The KLO towers and station were towards Hooper Utah and South of Roy Utah about 3-4 miles from downtown Ogden.  In those days, it was all pasture/farmland with nothing around.  It was usually pitch black out that way at night.  I ultimately talked to the Radio announcer for a long time – he was signing off about the time I got there.  He told me he had about 30 calls about the same UFO/object and flashing light with many of them describing exactly what we saw.  He also told me he was out there by himself and didn’t want to hear about UFOs, he also related a few stories of his on that happened to him out there. Incident Two:  This happened about July or August 1985 or 1986.  I was the Boy Scout leader, my girlfriend mentioned in incident one above and I were married in 1968 and we had four children by this time.  My son was born 1973 and must have been about 13.  I had taken the Boy Scouts on a small backpack trip up to the Hidden Valley area described in Incident One above.  I had always wanted to hike up there since Incident One above. It was really hot and we left later in the afternoon.  We parked at a gravel parking lot on 22nd street east side of Ogden by the canal and began hiking up the trail which went along the face of the mountain, up through the cliffs, up a small canyon finally ending at the Hidden Valley area.  We pitched our tents, ate some dinner over a fire and by this time it was dark.  I told the boys a few scary stories and we went to bed.  I slept outside by the fire, the boys all had their own tents. Sometime during the night I realized a bright yellow light was shining directly on me (our camp area) and I woke up, looked up to the top of the canyon which was the top of the mountain and the yellow bright light was originating from there.  Very, very bright yellowish light!   I just remember sitting up a bit and looking up at the light which would have been roughly a 40 degree angle or so to the top where the light originated.  It must have been roughly a mile or so distance to the top of the mountain where the light was shining from.  There is a relatively flat area up there, I have hunted deer in that area.  There are no roads and no way to access it except as a strenuous hike from either side of the mountain.  This was the same exact area where the UFO in Incident One described above had descended and apparently landed. I watched the bright light for a while but do not remember anything beyond that, don’t remember if it went out or I just went back to sleep.  I have never asked the boys who were with me if they remember the light or not.  I’ve always thought that night was very odd and about how bright the light was that was illuminating us. I have often wondered about these two incidents and if they are related.  Seems peculiar that they wouldn’t be related since there is absolutely no access to that area. I have researched some UFO historical data but have never found any reports describing the actions of the UFO during that time frame.  One similar in 1967 east of Salt Lake City but none in the Ogden area. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My husband and I were working and living in Baxter, KY, at this time and were in visiting my mother, who lived at this time just off Cumberland Falls Hwy, which is where we both grew up. My husband was raised literally at the mouth of The Dainel Boone National Forest in the Rose Town Community area.  He grew up in those woods.  Camping, fishing and hunting since he was a young kid.  I was very impressed when we first met with his knowledge of the area. We had only been married a few years, and altho we had already experienced many adventurous exploits in this beautiful area, we had never encountered anything in our lives of this outrageous proportion!  When one witnesses something like this I don't believe they ever forget. It was getting late and we were just out driving enjoying our time together.  Our young son was with grandma where we always stayed when we got to come on to visit. My husband still remembers the exact spot.  This is a remote area, no homes, no electric, nothing but trees, water and nature for miles. My husband was driving and I was talking when he said, ""What is that"" with a alarmed kind of tone I said what's what?  Oftentimes, he would see Wildlife that I would miss from talking and or looking off somewhere else. There's some kind of huge light over through there pointing ahead of us and toward the left.  For a minute or so we didn't see it and then there it was up on the distance. We drove at a normal rate of speed to be on gravel, all the while talking and wondering to each other what it could be.  We were both I think nervous somewhat, but too curious to turn back.  The what seemed to be a solid white super bright light keep getting larger and more visible the closer we drove. We were like ""What is that""and probley what's going on here.We still weren't sure what we were witnessing until we got right up on it as we dropped around and down over a pretty steep curve,and there it was big a light as big as a Volkswagen and so bright it lit up all the trees just below it.  It was just right above the big trees that were growing near the edge of the road. I don't know why we thought what we thought or why we said and did what we did next but we did and we are both still alive today so we feel blessed and grateful that things went as they did especially from that point on. My husband said, "" Should I turn the car off?""  I said no just kill the light's we had already rolled the windows down and there was absolutely no sound! Crazy,..We had also slowed down to just be able to get a grasp I guess on this once in a lifetime experience, but the second that my husband turned off the headlights IT WAS  GONE!!  But where too. It didn't make a start up sound we didn't see it flying off through the sky.  Nothing just vanished the exact moment that our headlights were turned off.Vanished..  There wasn't any talk between my husband and I for a bit because my husband turned those headlights right back on and we were probley a half a mile away from that spot in what seemed like a fishtailing, gravel flying second. We have told this too many friends and family members through the years really in hopes that they would broaden their views on life that exist probley on many other planets and if ever they should find themselves doubting or any of their own children someday maybe they will always remembe remember our story and convince future generations to believe and take a interest on knowing the truth that we are not alone.

In approximately November of 1990, I was travelling across the state of North Dakota.   The event happened at approximately 11:00pm near Tappen, ND.  I was travelling West on I-94 in my Chevrolet Citation on my way back to school.   It was a Sunday night. The event began and ended in about a 5-7 second time span.    As I travelling West-bound,  I noticed a bright pulsing light on the horizon.  As best my memory can recall, I’d say it was pulsing about 2x per second.    It began on the West horizon, and then the next thing I knew it was near me and then, as quick as it came upon me, I saw it disappear in my rear view mirror as quick as I saw it coming. A few things I remember vividly.  It seemed as though it was travelling relatively low.  If I had to guess, I’d say somewhere between 2000-5000 feet above ground (but that’s just a guess).  Secondly, it was a pulsing bright, white light.   It pulsed at a rate of about 2x per second.   The speed at which it was travelling seemed relatively constant.  It appeared on my horizon quickly, became a little brighter as it came upon my location and then was less brighter again as it disappeared on the East horizon in my rear view mirror. I have no explanation for what I saw, but I know it would be impossible for any Earth made object to do what this thing did that night. The weather at the time was cold.  I estimate it to be below freezing.  The sky was clear and calm, as I remember the sky being very dark but the stars being very vivid.

On or about Oct 15, 1996, (date known because morning radio was talking about the birth of Madonna’s daughter), at around 5-6am callers in to the station started reporting an explosion over an area from southern Oklahoma to the Dallas area. Many of the callers reported seeing the object before the explosion –-but I don’t remember their descriptions. One of the callers, though, identified himself as a police officer.  I do not remember if he was city or county or state.  He described a crash zone and said the object was definitely NOT a plane or helicopter.  He was adamant that it was a UFO and that it “WOULD NOT be swept under the rug this time.”  I was listening while getting ready for school during all this and left home just after sunrise. I lived in Bonham, Texas, about 80 miles nne of Dallas. As I walked out the door, I say a LARGE, very WIDE – what I would describe as a contrail, stretching north to south basically directly over my home.  To put in perspective, if you would consider your perception of a typical contrail as looking 3-4mm wide, this one appeared to be 5-6 inches wide.  North Texas is a fairly flat landscape, and I could see this trail stretch from horizon to horizon. To the east – just a little to the left of the sunrise and at about 55-65°up – completely separate from the contrail - was an unusual formation.  It was VERY similar to the Challenger explosion.  Had 3 short trails jetting out from a central point.  It was stationary and did not change shape or location in the 15 or so minutes I watched it.  It was a still windless morning. The calls kept coming in the duration of my drive to school – about 45 minutes.  I went to my classes, got out around 2pm, went to my job, and got home about 9PM. NEVER heard another thing about it.  Nothing on the news.  Nothing on the radio.  No more word from the police officer.  Can’t even find other reports of it online.  Nothing.

It was a station based in Dallas/Ft Worth and a pop station that had mainly morning talk geared to teens/early 20s cried typical of those stations ya know - celebrity news, lots of jokes, prank calls, etc. Sorry I don't remember. I haven't lived in Dallas in a long time and googling current stations there doesn't ring any bells  It would've been a station with a strong enough signal to be clear 80+ miles out if that helps at all.

It was mostly white but was red at one end.  It hovered for several seconds.   Then, in about a 1/4 second, it flew east across the mountains and disappeared out of sight.  My wife and I discussed what we saw and agreed upon what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They didn't move from this position for approximately 30 seconds, then one by one they flew off quickly to the northwest until they were quickly out of sight.

I sat on my front porch steps and lit a smoke. When you sit on my porch, you are looking South.  About a 1/2 mile away there is a hill that's pretty high. On the hill there are numerous oak trees, most of which are old and stand about 40 to 50 feet high. I was sitting on my porch for about 4-5 minutes, and from behind the hill, a large object rose up to about a 1/4 mile above the hill.  It had a ring of colored lights around it: red, green, blue, purple, orange and yellow.  I could not see the craft as it was night, but I saw these lights. It took me a few seconds to try and figure out what it was (UFO was the last thing on my mind), but all of a sudden, all the lights started flashing on and off at random around this thing.  At this point, the lights lit the body of the object, it was approximately 50 feet across and I can see it was silver and metallic and that it was shaped like a flying suacer. I immediately stood up and said, ""Holy ((deleted))! That's a ((deleted)) UFO!""  I then walked to my driveway, which was about 20 feet from my porch, to move into a clearing between the trees to get a clearer view of it. About the time I reached my driveway, it went back down behind the hill.  After about 5 seconds, it rose back up to where it was before with the lights still flashing.  And soon after, the lights went out and it was dark.  Then a few seconds later, the lights came on 1 by 1 around this object and it moved in a SW direction.  At this point it stopped and it had moved only about 2 seconds and it was about half the size that it was before it had moved.  I figured it had to have moved pretty far, pretty fast to reduce the size to about 25 feet across. It then kind of wobbled and shot up at a 45 degree angle, uber fast, and stopped.  Then the lights started flashing again, and again I could see the silver metallic look and it took off so fast, it look like it stretched and vanished.  Through this whole ordeal, this thing never made a sound at all. Sound carries out here as it is a rural area. I saw nothing else like that before nor since that night.  This whole experience lasted about 1 minute from when I first saw it, until it vanished. At first, I questioned if I was hallucinating, or just plain out of it and was imagining it.  I went back in the house, and my daughter called me.  She lived about an hour east of me in a town in the mountains called Pine Grove.  As soon as i answered the phone, she said ""Holy ((word deleted)) Dad, I just saw a UFO!"".  I told her that I had just seen one too.  We both talked about what we had seen, and it turned out, she had just watched the same thing I did.  That made my whole night knowing that she saw it too from an hour away from me.  So I wasn't crazy!  It is so etched into my brain, that it seems like it just happened yesterday.  I would love to see that again, only next time, I would like to meet the occupants!",2017-09-28T00:00:00,,

There were actually 2 other events that proceeded this one which I will explain later.  I was out walking my dog on a bright starlit night with a few high level clouds.  I was stargazing when I noticed a visual distortion about 60 feet above me.  It was similar to a ripple in a smooth clear pond except it had a distinct 'V' shape leading edge.  It was transparent and I could see the clouds above it but no stars until the 'V' moved about 40 feet when they would reappear.  I concluded that would be the trailing edge.  The 'V' angle was about 135* and 100+ feet wingtip to wingtip moving around 5 mph due north.  At first I thought maybe it was an illusion so, I turned away and focused on the house next to me and then returned my gaze back to the 'V'.  It continued its northerly flight with no sound or lights until my dog and I lost sight of it behind the tree line.  Early the next evening, two A10 (??) military jets traveled the same south to north route at tree top level shaking everything in the house.   I called the police to find out what was going on but they said no else had reported the flyover and had no information.   Two weeks prior to this sighting, while again walking my dog about 1 hour before sunset, a stationary bright orangish globe was in the south sky at maybe 2000 to 3000 feet.  It started to move slowly west toward the setting sun.  After about 30 seconds it moved almost vertical at a blazing speed and was beyond sight within 3 seconds.  At the time, I thought it was probably an effect of the sun getting low on the horizon.  But, the color was very different and somewhat similar to a sodium-vapor lamp.  Two days later, my wife and I were eating an early dinner around 4 PM at a nearby restaurant.   We were sitting next to a west facing window and I started to described the strange orangish globe to her.  We both casually turned to l! ook out the window and there was the globe I was describing at! some di stance away moving east toward us.  It's speed was fast but not unusual and we lost sight of it behind some buildings.  No other sightings have occurred since then.",2017-11-17T00:00:00,26.98100661157025,-82.11690661157024

Orange light motionless in the sky. We watched it for a while as we tried to determine if it was a planet or an airplane heading to Bradley airport. We dismissed the plane theory because it was not moving. Dismissed the planet theory because it was too big. At one point my wife said it’s a house on top of the mountain, to which I responded there is no mountain in Connecticut that high.  I made a left turn to go up a hill to get a better look. As the car rounded the corner at the top of the hill we saw the orange glow like a huge sodium lamp in the sky. I stopped the car and that’s when the bizarre behavior began.  The previously stationary light moved quickly to the right, faster than a helicopter or any other aircraft, but slower than a meteorite, made sweeping left turn and disappeared behind the trees.

We both were completely sober at this time.  We were traveling in a westerly direction through the Park Avenue area of Rochester on the 490 North freeway.  It was already completely dark outside, except for some ambient streetlight/city light.  The UFO was traveling in a Northeasterly direction at approximately 25mph and we were traveling about 65mph. I first noticed the UFO as we were driving along listening to music.  At first I said nothing as I noticed the object had no flashing lights, which I've never seen before on any type of flying craft.  As soon as I realized this, I said to my friend half jokingly ""look a UFO"".  I pointed it out to him and then turned down the music.  Just as I did this the bottom lights came more into view, and I could clearly see 4 large in diameter lights mounted on the bottom of the UFO making a perfect square.  The 2 lights leading the way were red, and the 2 lights following were blue.  They were very close to the color of red and blue police lights, however they were large solid lights (not beams or spotlights) that did not blink. The UFO flew just about directly over us as I continued to stare and make as many detailed mental notes as possible while my friend looked as often as he could (he was driving).  My friend immediately agreed that it was very strange and that he had never seen anything like it. We tried to go over what it could possibly be, but since there were no blinking lights (which are required by law on all aircraft) and since the speed was so slow, the only possibility I thought would be a police helicopter, except several things didn't fit.  We heard no helicopter sounds at all, and this UFO only appeared to be about 200-300ft above the ground.  I also researched heavily into what this might be, and nothing matched, including the police helicopters used in the area. I  later asked my friend to describe exactly what he saw so that I could get an independent description of the object.  He immediately said it was ""box-shaped"" with 2 red lights and 2 blue lights on the bottom.  I personally couldn't make out anything other than the lights and the square shape surrounding the lights, however I was only focused on the lights, whereas he saw a box shaped object with lights underneath.  Some other information:  the UFO appeared to be about 30ft x 30ft squared on the bottom.  The 4 lights took up all of the space on the bottom of the UFO, which would mean each light had a diameter of about 15ft x 15ft.",2017-10-05T00:00:00,43.1550415206858,-77.61785896384644

I thought I was seeing a star explode.  I located the Big Dipper and the North Star in the sky.  This object was down to the right of the North Star and almost level to the second star that points the way to the North Star.  It was the length of my index finger away from the North Star.  It stayed in the same location for about two to three minutes, then slowly dimmed away to nothing over about 20 seconds.  I continued to watch, but could not see anything in the sky close to that spot afterwards. I have seen airplanes that shine a bright light as they are coming toward you that appear to be stationary.  But they eventually move and you can tell it’s a plane.  If it were a helicopter, I did not hear any noise.  Would a helicopter light take 20 seconds to dim?  This was the brightest light that I have ever seen. I have also watched satellites and the ISS fly overhead.  Sometimes they catch the sun and shine brighter for a bit, but you can see that they are moving and can still follow them when they dim.

Large cylindrical shaped matte green lights were similar to doughnut shaped circles that were phosphorescent but did not emit any light pollution outside of the light itself or within the center.  I believe this was caused due to a magnetic field as the light would normally have emitted a void within the center.

I was awestruck at the magnificence and engineering that went into it.  I could see the louver like body on the craft and the design was like plates were set similar to a red clay roof as if the heat was dispersed by the space behind each plate.  The sound may be in the video however my ac unit could have caused that.  I would pass any lie detector test on this I am 100% certain of what I saw. I am going to do my best to have an image rendered.  I could pass a lie detector test on this. I was not open minded on this and grew up in Bermuda.

In the eastern/northeastern sky as I was just about a mile northwest of town driving into it on US Highway 117, I saw two bright white flashes out of the corner of my eye.  It looked almost like a strobe from a cell phone tower, but there isn’t a tower near where I saw this.  And unfortunately, I only saw this in my peripheral vision, but I could tell it came from my left, from the east.  It was too bright to be a cell tower anyhow; it immediately grabbed my attention. I kept staring off to the east while trying to keep my eyes on the road at the same time.  I got a good look at what happened next.  This was in a slightly different area of the sky; the strobe lights looked maybe a little north of east, but this was due east.  It looked like a firework, the white ball type that explode into orange sparks and aren’t really pretty but just make a lot of noise.  I saw one just above the treeline, but I could tell it was distant, not coming from town, which I was approaching.  There was no sound and my window was partway down; the radio was on Coast To Coast but it wasn’t too loud.  A firework surely would have made sound and this was a ways away.  It was just barely above the treeline, sort of like seeing lightning in a thunderhead miles away.  There were no storms on the radar and not a cloud in the sky, though, nor did this look like any kind of storm.  My thought was that if this were a firework, I shouldn’t have been able to see it for as ! far away as I appeared to be from it.  Also, as I stated, it was in a different part of the sky from the first flashes. The oddest part of what I saw was that the sparks that were left upon the disappearance of the white ball seemed to form some type of ring, not a solid cloud of orange sparks.  There was some type of object obscuring the cloud of sparks leaving the outer fringes visible.  The obstruction looked like a thunderhead, but far too low in the sky.  It was shaped kind of like the crown of a diamond, again just barely above the trees.  It disappeared rapidly when the sparks faded, and my town was quiet when I came home, and I saw nothing else amiss. I have never seen anything like it in my life and was never really a deep believer in UFOs.  I really want to learn if anyone else saw this late Tuesday night/very early Wednesday morning, or has ever seen anything like this before.  The best description would be those ugly loud fireworks, but so much of it doesn’t make sense.  It was quiet and too far away, so what I saw had to be good-sized.  And who really shoots off fireworks at two in the morning?  In my small town, that will draw out the cops! Seymour Johnson Air Force Base is about twenty miles south of me; was this some kind of elaborate war game or something?  I just know it scared me a bit.

When I went out she was already outside looking up with a shocked dumbfounded look on her face.  I could even see cars pulled over on the main highway staring up.  I looked up and saw a large black aircraft with 3 lights shaped into a triangle hovering less than 20 ft from our roof.  It stayed there around 2-3 minutes before flying off.  It made no noise at all and was about the size of 2 jets.  Still checking the news in our area to see of anyone reported it.,2017-11-03T00:00:00,35.6455391941392,-88.77842673992674

Then suddenly as I looked back at Orion’s belt a solid white light appeared near the Alnilam star, moving north, north west approximately 5 degree off due north.  It moved fairly slowly and appeared to be very high in the sky. To confirm my suspicions a plane with blinking lights came from the northwest moving to the southeast.  They intersected (from my view) and the UFO continued to move in a straight line finally disappearing from view after a full minute of viewing. I turned to view Castor and Pollux, and almost immediately witnessed yet another solid white light moving slowly in the sky coming from I believe to be the Gomeisa and Procyon area moving slowly towards Castor and Pollox.  I observed this movement for about 20-30 seconds. Needless to say, a meteor was joyful enough, but to observe two UFOs within minutes.  I was charged up all day. 10/26/17 06:55 So naturally, I went back out this morning.  Looking towards Orion of course hoping to see another meteor or anything moving I began scanning the sky and again looked towards Castor and Pollux and suddenly in the direction of the M44 cluster a solid white light, larger than the one’s observed yesterday, appeared. Its movement was much different. Initially, it moved to the northwest slowly like the others and then began to turn due north and rapidly increase speed around zenith.  The light began to fade yet I was able to continue observing its speed and direction. It continued arching north for a few more seconds then seemed to completely stop but immediately picked up it’s prior speed along what seemed to be the same arch yet at this point it was arching towards the east and I lost sight. The original speed seemed much like a plane but the increase and higher speeds were not speeds at which normal aircraft could maneuver, moving across an elbow to finger tips worth of (zenith) sky in mere seconds.",2017-11-03T00:00:00,33.78827457142857,-84.170558

Movement to my left (west) caught my eye. I looked over to see something with green and blue flames engulfing the back end of the object. I was looking at it from its side.  The front of the object looked something like the nose section from the side of a C-130 plane.  There were no wings or elongated fuselage or tail section and it was much too short to be an airplane.  The front half of the object was lit by the bright green and blue flames coming out of the back section.  The back section was completely engulfed in flames.  Then the flames stopped suddenly when the object was about 200 feet above the ground.  For a second I saw a dark object, but I couldn't make out what it was or its general shape and then it was completely lost in the dark.  Other than the blue and green flames, the object was not lit up in any way.  It was heading mostly north with a little easterly direction too and moving at a 30 degree angle towards the ground.  estimate its speed at around 130-150mph.  In my opinion, considering the length of the object and the quick glimpse I had as the flames were extinguished, that I was looking at a saucer shaped craft from the side. I have checked multiple times tonight and there have been no reports of a crash site.  I also drove around the area where it would have crashed and there were no wrecked buildings or police or fire trucks anywhere to be seen. I saw no fires or smoke.  My guess is that there was not an actual crash despite the steep angle towards the ground and the 200 feet or so until impact.  No airplane could have navigated away without impacting the ground.

On Friday night, at approximately 8 PM CST, my sister and I witnessed 13 large (presumably military) aircraft flying in what I would describe as an offset straight line.  They were flying one after the other, but not directly behind each other.  One would be on the right, the next would be flying just off the former's left wing, and so forth.  Each plane had a blinking red light on the end of each wing and a single static white light in the center of the plane.  The planes seemed much quieter than usual.  Although they were flying relatively low, we could only hear a slight drone or slight humming noise.  Once they were no longer directly overhead, they were silent.  When they were far enough away that someone could no longer see they were actually planes, they just looked like a large number of blinking red lights in the sky and it was EERIE and STRANGE.  I have NO DOUBT these were at least some of the red lights you all have been sent reports of from wit! nesses all over the country. While I believe these conventional craft triggered the mass sighting, the sheer number of them, the pattern in which they were flying and their relative quietness were definitely strange and should be investigated in my opinion.  I live close to a large military base and witness maneuvers year-round and at all hours of the day and night.  I have NEVER seen anything like what I say Friday night.  It was NOT normal in any way.

I drove to the head of our lane about ½ the distance to the object and stopped to watch it about 5 minutes.  I watched it go into our field and move down towards the house.

It looked to be about in the middle of our field 800 ft away from us. I saw a lot (didn’t count) of dim, rectangular, flashing red lights with an occasional white flash going around the middle of what appeared to be a very large object moving very slowly across our field.

Fiquei em choque, não consegui me mover, senti a respiração parando.

Via maldita bola voltando e pousou na planta que fica rente ao muro da casa vizinha, no jardim do prédio ao lado da casa vizinha (essa casa fica entre 2 prédios na lateral, e outro prédio nos fundos, próximo à duas palmeiras bem altas! no quintal da vizinha, onde papagaios vem se alimentar).  A noite estava clara, céu limpo, não tinha vento.  Mas o galho da planta sacolejava bastante, onde a bola havia pousado.  Peguei minha máquina e comecei a filmar.  Fiquei com medo, desliguei a máquina e telefonei para a policia, pra saber se eles estavam usando algum drone.  A policial que atendeu parece que não gostou do meu telefonema.  Aí liguei para uma amiga que mora algumas quadras do meu prédio. No dia seguinte, chamei a faxineira do meu prédio e fomos ver o galho da planta.  Ele estava meio destruído, parecendo que foi queimado ou que alguém arrancou as folhas, o galho estava pendurado. Minha amiga falou que, se for ovni, eles estavam pesquisando a plantinha. Foi muito assustador, meu coração dispara quando lembro disso e quero esquecer.

Around 8:30 or 9:00 p.m., I walked outside onto my 3rd story balcony, and it wasn't long before something in the sky captured my attention.  Flying from west to north, I believed it was a satellite.  Then, I noticed as the object abruptly changed direction going east. Now, this is when I began watching it more closely.  It seemed as if it was in the atmosphere, it was flying at a slower speed than an airplane would be, and I could see in the distance the object had red and white lights.  Suddenly, I see another object just like the first one, coming from the same direction, west.  The first object, still flying east at this time, then turns around and goes toward the second flying object!  The two flying objects are now coming towards each other.  When they cross paths, the two objects STOP completely in mid flight!  They lined up perfectly(one on top of the other) and each emitted a bright, red-orange light that looked like two huge balls of light.  Only for about two or three seconds did that last, and they continued flying in the opposite direction.  The first one flew southwest, and out of my view (behind my apartment building), and I continued to watch the second object fly east, along the moutian tops in the distance and then began flying directly north, away from my view. This is when the first object ended up flying directly overhead and I could get a look at it. Like I said, it was flying in the atmosphere, so it was as low as a plane or a helicopter might be. But, all I could see were lights, no aircraft.  As if it were invisible.  On what would be the underside of the craft had red lights in the shape of two rectangles overlapping and fading in and out with the white circular lights on the sides. I watched the two mysterious flying objects until they were totally out of sight. This ran the course of about 15 to 20 minutes.  My assessment of the situation is they were maybe on some sort of ""scouting"" mission, because of the way they flew in opposite directions. Then they ""linked up"", as to share data, and continued in different ways. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

To be honest, I’m not exactly sure of the time, but I’m guessing it was between 7:00pm–8:00pm because the sun was starting to set. Most of the people at the party were in the backyard listening to music and getting ready to eat some BBQ, while a few others were inside watching a college football game.  When the BBQ chef loaded up the platter of meat from the grill, pretty much everyone moved inside to eat as the wind picked up a bit.  But I stayed outside with the birthday girl because I just lit up a smoke.   Anyway, I was looking up at the sky and telling my friend how much clearer the sky was in Parker as opposed to Denver because of all the light pollution we get living in the city. Just as I said that, I spotted a satellite moving from East to West.  I pointed it out to my buddy and told her something along the lines of, “see, you can see satellites on clear nights like this.”  She agreed and that was that. About 2 minutes later, I was still sky gazing and I see what I think is another satellite coming from the same direction and heading in the same direction as the first one.  I again pointed it out to her, but just as I did, I immediately realized that this light was much brighter, larger (3x’s the size as the first one) and much faster.  I said, “Whoa, that’s no satellite!  That thing is moving way too bright and way too fast to be a satellite.”  She immediately said, “Yeah, that’s completely different from we what we just saw!”  We talked about it for a couple more minutes and then we jumped to talking about her new house.  We saw no other UFOs that night. Here’s where things get REALLY weird and make no sense. On evening 10/30/17, I was watching MNF and something told me to pick up my phone and view the photo gallery (I’ve only had this phone since August and I didn’t have many pictures on it.  But I recently saved a throwback photo that my best friend texted to me on 10/23/17, and I immediately saved it to the gallery.  At the time I saved the photo I knew what exactly what was on my phone as there weren’t many pictures saved on it), and so I did.  I discovered a photo that wasn’t there when I last looked on 10/23/17, so I immediately opened it up.  It was a strange picture of a man that I’ve never seen before.  Not knowing who he was and not knowing where this picture came from, I went to the gallery data on the phone and it said that the picture was taken on 9/9/17 at 7:13pm. I didn’t remember taking any pictures at the party, and I only remember taking my phone out 2 xs’s to check the time, but I did not take any pictures, nor had I seen this man at the party.  There were around 20 people at the party and I knew almost everyone there, but the guy in the picture was not someone I remembered seeing there that night. I sent the picture to my friend who owns the house and I asked her if he was at the party that night. She said that she had no idea who he was and then asked me, “And what is that light??”  There’s a weird light in the center of the picture that looks like a small orb flying through the air.  The weird guy is at the bottom of the photo and you can only see his face, which is scary looking!  My buddy and I thought maybe he was in front of a window, but we were merely guessing because the photo doesn’t offer much detail to explain where it was actually taken.  I have shared it with a few co-workers, but two of the people I showed it to said that it looked like it had been taken outside and not inside.  Those two people are a sheriff’s deputy and a probation officer.  Interestingly enough, I think they’re right.",2017-11-17T00:00:00,39.49737606837607,-104.76592193732195

I was alone, focusing on a star, when a single, small, orange light began to move horizontally. With the movement, I could tell that the light was somewhat close and thought it may be a reflection on a spider's web.  This was until the light started moving up and down, left and right, very erratically, but not all over the sky.  It stayed within a small area in the sky.  I then thought it may be a drone. I watched it intently, by myself, for about 10 mins., move around.  It never blinked or flickered once.  The orange-ish light looked similar to fire, not electrical or gassy.  It almost had a little haze around the orb.  The size was small, comparable to the size of a large star. My friend then comes out to leave, I tell her to watch, and she sees it, too.  It lasted a couple of more minutes until vanishing.  It just dissipated, like the fire had gone out. I did feel an overwhelming sense, it brought me to tears, and I was covered in chills.

I noticed a very bright orange light over the ocean.  It was silent, did not move, and was pretty far out.   It's also worth noting that it was high above the horizon, nowhere near the offshore boats that we could see.  It stayed lit up for about 10 seconds, then faded out.  I thought to myself, ""Hmmm... that was weird... whatever.""  It was very out of place and did not look natural and was definitely not a plane or helicopter (which we had seen many of that night). The bright orange light returned a few minutes later, in the same area.  This time (sure that my mind was not playing tricks on me) I pointed it out my brother.  His response was, ""What is that?""  And I said, ""I have no idea... this is the second time I've seen it.""  It did the same thing as before, fading out after about 10 seconds. We were still standing in the surf with our fishing pole, but we were looking at that area now and not fishing.  Neither of us had our phone (because we didn't want it to get wet or get fish guts on it), but I wish we had been ready to video what happened next.  About 5-10 minutes later, the bright light appeared again, but this time it either split up into 4 distinct lights, or it faded to a smaller size and three other lights appeared in the same area.  They faded in one by one and seemed to be coming from the same source.   So now there was a stationary cluster of 4 independent orange lights where there was previously just one brighter light.  What really blew us away was that as soon as all 4 were visible, they immediately arranged themselves into a perfectly straight diagonal line formation.  The space between them was precise and orderly, and the line just absolutely straight.  The line of lights remained visible for only several seconds, then it faded out. My brother and I were stunned and excited, and were especially amazed that we had both seen this.  We kept watching the sky over the ocean, and about 20-30 minutes later, we saw two orange lights moving rapidly to the north from a more southern position than we had seen the lights before.  They were moving about the same speed, and there were no blinking lights.  Just two solid orange balls of light flying silently through the sky at an altitude that was probably less than a mile above the ocean.  At one point, one seemed to jump up what could have been been hundreds of feet in the blink of an eye.  It was hard tell distances without having anything to reference it with in the dark, but it moved like no aircraft we'd ever seen.  They continued toward the area we had seen the lights earlier (but at about half as high in the sky as the previous lights) and faded out after about 15 seconds or so.  This all happened between the hours of 9-10pm.  We kept watching for another hour didn't s! ee anything, plus the bugs were biting pretty bad, so we called it a night. We came back the next night hoping to catch a glimpse of something again, and we were prepared this time.  We had chairs to sit in, fresh coffee, and our phones were fully charged. I even brought my son along.  This time we didn't see any sign of strange lights in the 2+ hours we looked.  It could be nothing, but the second night (when we saw nothing) we did see fighter jet patrols on the coast in pairs of two (loud noise, blinking red/green/white lights on wingtips, and we could see their silhouette in the moonlight when directly overhead).   They probably flew out of the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort, SC.  In all honesty, this may just have been a coincidence, but they were deployed right around 9pm and the last pair returned close to 10pm... the same time we had seen the lights the night before.  It's also worth noting that a pair flew right through the same general area that we had seen the lights the night before, and then turned in toward land and headed inland toward Beaufort. Once we got back it was really interesting to find quite a few similar sightings with orange lights off the SC coast with videos on youtube from over the years.  Whatever we saw, it was extremely strange, and it was really exciting to see something that was unexplainable.

We actually saw this on Sept. 26th…not Aug. 26th. This is significant because someone up the coast at Folly Beach reported seeing orange lights the same night less than an hour before we saw the lights I described.

Not unusual to see inbound or outbound air traffic for BWI or Dulles, I didn't think much of it. I am aware the eye sometimes plays tricks on us, when it comes to airliners; sometimes they seem to be just floating in the air, while they're actually flying typically between 180 knots and 240 knots inbound or outbound.  That's what these were doing, seemingly hanging still in the sky. Plain white lights.  If I had to guess an altitude and distance, I would say 10-15 miles away at about 6,000 to 10,000 feet.

We are Not exactly sure of its shape, because of the intensity of the glow. It remained a steady bright green and was moving slowly toward the East.  It then increased speed somewhat and took a course of a more ENE direction.  After it was finishing the course change, we immediately noticed that as its speed was accelerating, it began to change color from brilliant green to a brilliant white. It continued to fly of to the ENE until it was out of sight.  It made no sound and flew beneath the overcast. We Could only give a guess it its size.  Somewhat like holding a pea out at arms length.  We estimated it was a fairly large object about 7 miles away. Altitude about 3000 ft. silently crossing a large field of view from our vantage point.   I am a 59 yr old aviation industry veteran with 40 yrs of experience.  I am intimately familiar with almost everything that we have operating in our skies.  This was one airborne object that I could not identify, which is baffling to me. I did not see any navigation recognition lights, red lights or any strobes, and there was no sound at all.  It did not exhibit any strange, gyrations or excessive speed changes.  The overall flight characteristics were very fluid.  It appeared to be intelligently controlled, flying a straight horizontal  heading, until the course change, altitude remained steady while making very smooth course corrections.  If there was a crew in there, hand flying, I would say they are well skilled, but more likely on some version of a flight management system.

I had seen three meteors earlier in the evening, including two immediately before the sighting, and thought maybe we were having a meteor shower.  I noticed something very faint, but large, moving across the sky.  At first I wasn't sure if I was seeing my own smoke reflecting in the patio lights, but as it crossed overhead it became obvious that it was some sort of object. The object came from the north crossed directly over my head, and continued southbound. It was extremely hard to see, and was just a slightly lighter shade then the surrounding sky.  I have the impression that it was tan in color, though I can't say for certain that I saw a color.   It was boomerang shaped, and the thought of a large v formation of birds did enter my mind.  However, as it flew over, and my eyes became more adjusted to it, it was easier to see it was a large solid mass. It made no sounds, had no lights, and silently glided across the sky from my 11 o'clock, over my head, to me losing view of it behind my house at about my 3 o'clock position.  It did this in about 10 to 15 seconds.  It was moving about the speed of a conventional jet flying at low altitude.  From my perspective, its size was roughly similar to standing at the end of a runway and watching the wings of a DC9 fly over.  I have nothing to reference for altitude other then it appeared to be below the scattered cloud cover.  According to Weather Underground, the current cloud conditions are Scattered 1300 to 3100 feet.   My dog was outside with me, and though I was too busy watching the object to check to see if she visually noticed it, she didn't bark or act out.  I could have moved to look around the side of the house and observe the object for a longer period, but to be honest, my gut instinct was that I needed to get back inside rapidly. I am an ex-aviation professional, and have experience with nighttime aircraft identification. I have observed many astronomical and meteorological anomalies, and I have never seen anything like this.  USCENTCOM is nearby, as well as Avon Park bombing range, so its not uncommon to see a wide variety of aircraft in this area at both day and night.  I have no idea if this was something military, but I do suspect from its stealth that it was not something that was meant to be seen.  Something about the way that it moved, its silence, and the surrealism of the situation was eerie, and still has me upset hours later.",2017-10-19T00:00:00,27.927325837320573,-82.23285933014354

After Echo I was launched on August 12, 1960, many people subsequently enjoyed watching it pass overhead at night.  The newspapers in Austin, Texas, reported good times to see it locally, so my parents and I went out to our back yard to watch it about 9pm, one night later that month.  I was eight years old at the time. Less than five minutes before Echo I was scheduled to appear, we all saw a medium-dull glowing “orange” pass silently across the sky.  The object’s apparent size resembled that of a pencil eraser at a distance of about six feet.  Its angular velocity across the sky was several times faster than that of Echo I, which appeared on schedule perhaps three or four minutes later; the object crossed the entire sky in a few seconds (circa four seconds, as I recall).  Its path through the sky was quite close to the path that Echo I followed a few minutes later, and both objects were traveling in roughly the same direction (SE to NW).  Its appearance (including color, brightness, size, and shape) never changed until it disappeared from sight behind some trees.  There were no sparks, tail, visible structure, or other details. We phoned the weather bureau at the Austin Municipal Airport to report the sighting, and were told that many other citizens were also phoning in their reports.  The local newspaper ran a small story on it the next day (on the front page, as I recall), and reported that hundreds of citizens had phoned in their observations to the police department, the local Bergstrom Air Force Base (SAC, subsequently closed), etc.  The object was thus high enough to be seen all across the city.  I always guessed it was a meteor, except it was slower, redder, and duller in appearance than any other meteor I have ever seen or heard of, and did not change color, shape, or brightness throughout its flight.  No explanation was ever reported. Note:  The Austin Statesman was the evening newspaper to which we subscribed.  This was, as I recall, before it merged with the local morning newspaper to become the Austin American-Statesman. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a well-educated academician.

More of a bump and two small holes without nostrils.  It walked along the wall to my right and was looking down at my brother.  The ET was within arms reach, staring down at him.  I was scared but not so scared that I couldn't react or move.  Instead it was hard to move, as if something was done to keep me in place. It then noticed that I was conscious and looking at it. When it did it snapped its head up and stared into my eyes for a few seconds.  It then leaned a bit to the right and reached up and over the bedside at me with its left hand.  My arm was laying out beside me with my hand hanging over the edge.  I managed to ball up a fist and try to punch it.  I managed more of a tap.

It flew silently right over my head in up into the mountains. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2017-08-04T00:00:00,,

There were about 14 of us in 3 different vehicles.  I'm not from the area, so couldn't say what road we were on, but coming from that college driving only about less than 10 minutes, when one of the girls says, ""Oh my God, what is that?""  The tone in her voice had us all leaning to look out the right windows of our van.  The round was curving around a very big hill.  It was dark.  But when I looked up into the sky what I saw shocked and amazed and scared me. What I saw was this:  A large, so large it took up most of the sky, diamond-shaped UFO hovering, not moving, over this big hill right next to us.  We were right beside it.  It had 4 perfect edges to it, and all were touching.  It's hard to explain, but think if you will a black diamond cut from paper and holding a light behind it in an otherwise dark room.  It was illuminated from above. We were stuck to that window, and you could feel the fear from all.  I thought, ""This is it.  We are having contact, invasion.""   It lasted only five minutes as we were still driving, and as we got further away, we couldn't pull over.  We were driving caravan with 2 other vehicles, and it was a busy road. When we got back to the hotel, the other two vehicles had seen it as well, and you can imagine the the excited conversation, so we all piled into one room and turned on the tv, only to wait until the very end of the segment for a 30 second blurb that it was space junk.  It was good enough for everyone I was with.  Coaches, too.  They all quickly dismissed it as space junk, while I was the ONLY one who quickly dismissed the space junk theory. Huge diamond shape object with 4 clearly distinguisable lines completely connected, and it looked like it had a orange fire above it.  It never moved.

My wife and I and our 3 children were leaving the movies.  My 11 year old son called attention to 5 red lights in the sky.  They were each evenly spaced and formed a perfect 45 degree angle.  They were very bright and much bigger than any star in the night sky.  I told him they could be flares.  Then I turned back to talk with my wife.  He said ""dad, can flares do that?""  I looked back up and could not believe what we were witnessing.  Let's say the red lights were numbered 1 through 5, with 1 being the one on top.  Number 2 was moving independently horizontally to the west and stopped exactly opposite of where it had been in relation to number 1.  Then number 3 moved up to where number 2 had been.  So now number 1, 2 and 3 have formed a perfect symmetrical triangle.  Numbers 4 and 5 never moved.  The triangle started slowly moving to the west.  We noticed that when it passed over a star that the light from the star disappeared.  And as it kept moving the star reappeared.  As if the triangle had mass or something was going on in the middle that masked the light.  It eventually stopped and all 3 lights went out at the same time.  We quickly looked back and 4 and 5 were still just sitting there.  I'm using the tree line, even though they were much higher, as a reference.  One of the lights reappeared way up high in the north west part of the sky. In a blink of the eye it went back to position 3.  Not like a red streak.  But it just went from one spot to another.  Then in the lower north west sky another light appeared.  It too in the blink of an eye went to number 2's position.  Now there are 4 red lights forming the 45 degree angle.  The 5th light never came back.  One by one in no particular order they went out.   My children were a little upset, thinking aliens were coming.  But I reassured them that we know God made our universe and everything in it.  And we should feel good that God let us see something so special that He made.

While on the asphalt path leading up to the park, we saw an orange colored glowing circle shoot up.  We had immediately assumed that it was a flare, and contemplated calling the police in case someone was lost in a forest, but the direction it was coming from was by a more populated area of our city.  The glow seemed to get bigger, then smaller.  We stood there, watching it out of curiosity.   Then, it started moving.

Okay, so, I was in my room (which is located on the second floor of my house) watching a UFO documentary on YouTube via my PS4, when outside of my window I saw an orange orb just still, not moving.  I was watching a UFO documentary because, back in May, I had creepy dreams about being abducted by ufos and kept waking up to my window glowing Green light, and feeling a sense of sleep paralysis.  My window would also sometimes containing a bunch of computerized 0s and 1s, so I was doing my own version of ""research"" haha.   At first I  got nervous, and tried to use deduction to figure out whether it was simply a plane, a rocket, a weather balloon, or something unidentified, but then it began to act strange.  It stayed still for a good amount of minutes, which I couldn't make sense of, but took the opportunity to take a picture anyways with my phone (my hands shook out of nervousness so it came out looking odd instead of orb shaped).   All of a sudden though I saw some blinking planes (I assume they were planes) heading towards it, about two of them at first, and the orange orb started moving DIRECTLY UPWARDS.  Not diagonal, just upwards, which made me think of a rocket for a second.  That's when I took my phone again and started recording it, but my hands kept moving and I was breathing hard out of nervousness so that also came out bad.   Eventually it passed the planes, went over my house and when I stood outdoors, I noticed it no longer looked orange, but instead, was hard to see and blinking.  Then it went over the trees and vanished, followed by 4 planes.   Once it went over my house I took like 7-10 secs to get outside so it could've vanished then and afterwards what I saw blinking was one of the now 4 planes following the same direction, but I don't know what to make of it.   The video I took had mysteriously ended up in my email trash bin, but maybe I hit something by accident and caused that bit.  I have further seen this orange orb 2 or 3 more times in July around the same general location each time, and someone else in my room witnessed the last time with me, but I haven't bothered to try and get more pictures.

On the night of June 9th, 2017 at around 11:30 PM,  I observed 3 bright white lights in a equilateral triangular shape, pass directly and silently overhead, and travel in straight line toward the South East at a very high rate of speed until out of sight. I was home and in bed when one of the dogs decided he needed to go outside, so I got up and took him out to the back yard. The sky was clear and so I paused to gaze at the stars.  I usually hope to see a meteor or a satellite drift by.  But that night, I looked straight up and immediately saw a very bright light moving what seemed to be just above a 60' tree behind me.  I wasn’t sure what it was, but as I watched, 3 lights in the shape of an equilateral triangle slowly came into full view directly above me. The lights were bright, white, and steady (not strobes), however, they seemed to have a shimmering, star-like quality to them.  My first thought was that someone was flying a drone over our house, but it seemed odd, since I’ve never seen any drones flying in our neighborhood, and it was a bit late at night. The second thing I noticed was the absence of any sound — it was totally silent.  I remember thinking that it all seemed very odd, and if a drone was flying possibly only 100 feet above me, I would have easily heard the buzzing sound of the motors/rotors. Watching it, I felt a sense of awe; although it was also slightly disorienting since it was hard to tell exactly how large the formation was, or what the true elevation was.  They seemed to be moving very fast, maintaining a uniform triangular formation, and moved at a consistent speed in a straight South-Easterly direction over the house and yard.  It took less than 15 seconds until they were out of sight — which would be several miles away. I live outside the city lights in a dark suburban area, on top of a hill so I can see well above the tree line to the South.  I had a clear view of the lights during the entire observation, they didn’t disappear behind trees or clouds and I watched them as far as the eye can see.  I’ve observed balloons, meteors, satellites, jets, helicopters and small airplanes, but this triangle of lights was unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Finally, about 4 days after my observation, I mentioned this to a friend who also lives in the neighborhood.  He remarked that around that time, he and his wife were out for a walk when a bright light went overhead (his first thought was that it was drone) followed by other lights that seemed to come from the side and “join up” with the lead lights. They said they looked like bright stars, but they moved very quickly through the sky as a group. About one month later, I asked him if he could remember exactly when and what he saw.  His response shocked me.  He said he would “check his phone” to look at the “date on the photos”.  Turns out he has about 7 photos and a very short (3 second) video.  I’ve reviewed the photos, and they show at least 2 groups of triangular lights, and perhaps a 3rd or 4th group further in the distance.  My friend prefers to remain anonymous, so unfortunately, I can’t attach the photos/video. I’ve never witnessed anything like this, and felt the need to report it.  Any help in understanding what was seen here would be greatly appreciated.  By the way, my friend and I are both employed as software developers.",2017-08-04T00:00:00,42.28027533875339,-83.73625456187895

I was driving east bound on the mass pike, maybe half a mile before mile marker 71, as you're cresting the top of a hill about to go down into a valley.  I saw weird looking object, as what appeared to have a rhombus shape.  With 2 inner circles that were emulating a whitish tan color.  It also had blue lights at the top and bottom, and teal lights on the side (which appeared to be lighting the circles I spoke of... possibly).  It also had 2 bight white flashing/pulsating lights in the middle. I've included a quick drawing,  https://i.imgur.com/chiUAqR.png  the 2 inner pulsating lights i just spoke of aren't shown.  But there would be in the very middle between to the circles. The reason it caught my eye so much is the rapid speed it was moving in the horizon (right to left going east bound, so I would assume/guess north to south).  I was going about 70MPH, and traveled only about .5 miles before it had traveled across my field of view.  I was able to get down to the valley floor on the pike(about 3-5 miles away from where i made visual.)  And looked to my right (south?), and I could still see its flashing lights off in the distance. I dont know what it was, my only two guesses where either a low flying twin prop plane, or a low flying Chinook (since its dual propeller, which could explain the 2 circles i saw).  Having seen these two possibilities many times in night and day, neither really satisfied me as an explanation.  However, both could appear as fast moving if they where close to the ground.  It just seemed faster than that though.   I have a decent knowledge of US military aircraft and civilian aircraft.

I live in Grand Forks, ND but work in a small community 30 miles away. I work the PM shift (2:30p - 11:00p) so am on the highway commuting frequently. There are 2 routes available, a Interstate roadway and a ""back road"" way on a county highway.  I often use the county road as there is less traffic and it is a more direct route to my residence.  One disadvantage of this route is the high number of deer that live in the woody areas that line this road.  I have been commuting this route for 2+ years and have seen deer on or next to the road 90% off the time on my drive home. There is an area about halfway through my drive where groups of deer seem to gather most frequently. I am familiar with this area and slow down to 30 mph as I pass through this section.  These deer are accustomed to traffic on the road as they usually just look at you as you drive through.   On 12/10/17 at approximately 23:45, I was driving through this area and noticed several strange and unexplained events:  1) I saw a group of approximately 20 deer on the East side of the road that were all standing and facing the West.  30 feet further down the road 3 deer were standing on the roadway and looking West.  I had slowed to a near stop and honked my horn to encourage the deer on the road to move on.  They jumped in fear when I honked and looked at me briefly, then looked West again.  I was close enough to the deer at this point to notice that they were in a state of panic.  I came to a complete stop and honked my horn for several seconds.  The deer did not move.  I looked in my rearview mirror to check that no traffic was coming up behind me, then opened my door and got out with the intention of yelling or approaching the deer to make them scatter. 2)  It was at this time that I heard a very low ""humming"" sound that to me seemed to originate in the sky directly above me.  I looked up to the sky and did not see anything. I then looked at the deer and yelled ""hey"" to scatter them.  They looked at me and then looked towards the West.  It was as if they acknowledged my presence but just did not care. I then walked toward the deer and yelled again, at which point the deer slowly exited to the East off the road but they continued to turn their heads to look West.  3) I looked towards the South to make sure traffic had not approached while I was focused on the deer. At this time the low ""hum"" quickly changed tone and seemed to gain bass frequency. There was a ""swooshing"" or ""hissing"" sound that was very brief, however, immediately following that sound the ""humming"" seemed to rapidly change in direction and no longer originated directly above me. It was now originating in the sky to the West. It sounded very close but I could not see anything. The ""humming"" became almost rhythmic in nature with a fast increase and decrease in intensity. I felt the need to get back in my car immediately. As I walked a step or two towards my car the ""humming"" abruptly stopped and the deer behind me ran across the road toward the West. Judging by the sound I heard the larger group of deer to my South were doing the same thing.  4) I was startled by the sudden movement of the deer close to me and quickly moved to my car door. As I was opening the door I happened to look up and to the East and saw many red circles of light in the sky. It appeared to me that they were quite high and in a basic straight line. I would estimate 70 individual lights. All red and completely solid, no flashing or flickering. I was kind of frozen in shock and probably fear and just stared. I would estimate that 10-20 seconds later the line of lights became off-set, with the majority of lights appearing to rise higher then the ones that did not move. It was not a uniform shift, by which I mean that it did not split evenly. The lights more to the North had the most concentration of what appeared to be a increase in height. There was a distinct noise that I immediately recognized as hearing before but I am unable to verbalize how it sounded. The closest I can get to a description would be the sound of a coin that is spinning on! a table top, but that is not quite right. The lights did not move again or appear to move, they just disappeared. Almost like they just turned off. All at once. I immediately got into my car and drove home as calmly as I could.  I do not know what it was that I saw or heard, but I am 100% positive the deer were reacting to it.",2017-12-14T00:00:00,47.898008,-97.164114

SW of the city of Skykomish on US Hwy2. I dug a snow cave in a clearing that has clear site line to Skykomish below.  It was dark by 5 PM so I was using a headlamp by the time I finished around 6:30 PM.  Then I began melting water, cooking and getting ready to sleep. It was completely dark and NO moon light. Around 7:45-8 PM I started noticing how clear and dark it was and how brite the stars were. Then I noticed 2 objects moving slowly toward me appx. 500-800 feet higher than my camp.  They were moving SW toward me from above Skykomish.  At first I thought brite stars then I thought Passenger Jet lights far off in distance. They were about 1/2 mile apart.  One seemed to be coming much closer and headed right toward my camp.  Now I could see many different small lights Red, Blue, Green which seemed to change colors sort of fading in and out (not flashing)  The shape was hard to make out.  Seemed to be round or multi pointed star shape.  The one coming closer was moving about the speed of a small helicopter but made no noise.  The other one seemed to drift south slightly and then stayed close to one spot roughly above Sobieski Mt. to East across the Miller River valley. Both objects appeared to have Aircraft Like ""White"" Strobe Lights that seemed to come from the top but not all the time.  Neither object made any noise at all. Since it was too slow to be an airplane and wasn't loud like a helicopter I began to think the one coming toward me must be a drone.  I estimate it came to within 600-900' from my camp but I still couldn't figure out the shape.  It did not seem to be shaped or marked like a small plane and did not move like one at all.  The lights seemed to shift around different ways which could be done by a drone rotating while also flying in a relative straight path.  I don't know how far away a 4-6 propeller drone could be and you still would not hear the familiar buzzing of its propellers?  These seemed larger than any drone I have seen.  Perhaps 6' Dia. or so. The object coming closest then turned slowly South and then SE toward the other and then circled over the wide valley area that is 2-3 miles West of Skykomish.  The object that moved much less over Sobieski Mt. slowly dropped altitude until it was blocked from sight by trees. The one that circled seemed to slow and hover off to the North across the valley for awhile then slowley moved on West until I lost sight of it.  It was about 15 minutes that these were visible. If someone was flying a drone from Skykomish it would need to have a range of 2-5 miles to not risk loosing very expensive equipment.  I have no idea why they would fly in the dark in winter.

I am a 34 year old male. Healthy.  We live in a valley located in between two mountain ranges, the tetons and the palisades.  It was a cold, very clear night. I was laying in bed watching tv when I noticed what looked like a chinese lantern on fire floating quickly through the sky.  Being able to see this at the angle, I could see out my window, led me to believe that it was fairly close and of low altitude.  In the day time, the object was lower on the horizon than the mountains. Once I saw it go by the mountains, I immediately jumped up, ran through the living room, and out the back door.  All the while screaming at my girlfriend and live in mother to come look.  As we all got out to the back deck it had moved further north.  It seemed as it was kinda bobbing around and then suddenly took a sharp linear move to the west.  At that point we all knew that it wasn't a flaming lantern, but something that was actual ly piloted.    At that point it stopped and hovered in the same spot for around 2 min.  While it was hovering, we could see that it was actually spinning and looked to be emitting what wasn't fire, but energy?  It was really eerie, as we all got a feeling that it saw us.   It stayed in this spot until, I physically watched it leave our atmosphere quicker than I could ever imagine.   We first thought it was a balloon or something that someone had set on fire.  However, we all quickly realized that it wasn't just floating, but moving in a determined path.

The picture I sent you only shows 4 of them.  I never saw them move and no sound. ((ADDENDUM #1)) Hi, It cycled 3 times in the 5 minutes I watched.  The lights were very bright, I would guess at an altitude of 10,000 feet or low flying small plane.  Much much brighter than the moon or a star because of their proximity.  When they turned off they went down the line, I wasn't sure if they moved when they started to turn back on but possible a short distance when they were dark.  I will resend the picture.  If you zoom in that is what I saw.   Thank you for your email ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) I was looking north west, because it was dark it was hard to see the ocean but I think parallel to the ocean.  I just can't say for certain because it was such a dark night.  The lights were very very bright and stopped me in my tracks.  I knew I was witnessing UFOs.  The picture unfortunately does not convey the brightness.  Sorry I am unable to help more.  I always enjoy it when you are on Coast.  I will look every night and try to get video for you.  One thing I forgot to mention is there was a small fishing vessel out that night which seemed directly under the UFOs.  He must of gotten an eyeful. ((END ADDENDUM #2)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #3)) It would be impossible to find the fishing boat as he was in open ocean approx 10 miles off shore I would guess.  I am sorry I am so ignorant about angles but I will try.  Last night you could not tell where the ocean left off and the sky began.  I think it was approx 90 degree angle from the ocean   They sat about half way between the ocean and where you could start seeing stars, in an area where a low flying small plane would fly.  Nothing so far this evening. ((END ADDENDUM #3)) ((ADDENDUM #4)) Hi  I just spoke to my neighbor she said someone in Primo Tapia, which is a little town about 10 miles south, saw it also.

I saw a golden-brown star-like-figure over 200-300 feet (maybe 600) in front of me.  At first, it looked like this  ((link deleted)) It slowly moved west and now, I saw that it was a black object inside a golden-blackish sphere-shaped force field, the force field then slowly opened, and LO!  It was a tetrahedral (somewhat) polished black aircraft or UFO, its base was flat while it had a somewhat pyramidal body.  I had not seen such a thing in my entire life; nowhere!  Not in movies, TV, the internet or real life!  Obviously, I immediately ran to the other flat and called everyone, but, suddenly, my brother said (when he saw it) 'it is just an airplane, you are hallucinating', but my mother saw it too, somewhat... I swear by the All-Maker, it was real, I saw it, it was not just any airplane, it had shape-shifted into looking like an airplane!

The object made a triangle, a circle, semi-circles, s and c patterns as well as move back and forth.  The object looked like it was communicating with a similar shaped object via these patterns.   The other object looked like it only had one color (light orange) but also blinked as it moved.  The second object only moved after the first one, it looked like the second one was acknowledging whatever the first object was trying to communicate.

My wife told me it was an airplane, so I showed her 3 airplanes moving in the night sky, I asked her to look again and after a few moments she reported seeing exactly what i was seeing, we watched for a few more minutes until she got too scared to continue looking at it.  I went back inside to get my father, he did not care and stayed in bed so i woke my mother and asked her to come outside with me and look at something.  My mother saw what my wife and i saw and was actually the one to point out the second object, she does not know what they are but pointed lo ut that they looked like they were both doing the same thing.  I called a ufo reporting hotline which ive never done in my life.  I was told to get wittnesses to the event,  which i did.  I was also told to identify stars and constellations using a smartphone astronomy app which i also did.  At this time the second object was no longer in The sky.

Where I live I see a lot of commercial airlines fly overhead at night, but the light that a commercial plane gives off pales in comparison to the light of this ufo.   I was astounded and my friend in the passenger seat saw it also, he said he was able to see a! shape within the light, but it went by so quickly, it was hard to make out an exact shape.

Both happened while we were travelling in a vehicle.  Only one of us spotted the UFO each time. 11/09/17 around 15:00.  My girlfriend and I were riding home in the car.  I regularly scan the sky for aircraft as we live near a military base as well as a DHS compound.  I have no military background but can easily spot the difference between a helicopter and a plane, of which we see and hear several every day.  I looked into the sky and saw two green lights side by side, as if they were the exhaust from an engine on a single craft.  It appeared as if it was not moving, or moving slowly, when I initally noticed it, however I pointed at it and told my girlfriend in the passenger seat to look and before she could raise her head it flew straight across the sky in half a second, leaving no trail or evidence it was ever there.  There was no noise.  This was my first UFO sighting, however I have always been a firm believer despite this being my first sighting.  Today, 11/13/17 at around 19:00, we were also on the road and she was gazing at the stars while I was driving. She said she saw a green circular light in the sky that appeared to be moving very fast. She turned her head around to make sure it was not a green light coming from the inside of the car, which there is not a green light in my car, and when she looked back out the window it was gone. I did not witness this, she just informed me right after she saw it. This happened within two seconds as well. This is not a joke.  These two things happening to us individually within just days of each other prompted me to Google “green light ufo” and I found this website.  I felt compelled to report what we saw.

Had wife come out and look too.   Invited neighbors out to look.  Tried to look at object with a telescope; however, cirrus clouds were beginning to block the field of view and sun was going down.  However, despite the sun going down, object appeared to be glowing in the sky.  Decided that object was approximately 70,000-80,000 feet based on clouds.   Object was slowly moving south.  Upper level winds were 270/80, so a weather balloon would not have been moving in that direction.   After about 90 minutes, too many clouds were obstructing the view and darkness set in.

Background:  I am an engineer and work for a defense contractor.  One of the ones that conspiracy people get really paranoid about, but I promise that I don't work on any spooky projects. My father was with me.  He works for the government.  Also, nothing too spooky in the conspiracy sense. I have a passing familiarity with military and commercial aircraft, he has a pretty detailed knowledge in being able to profile and identify aircraft.  He also has one of those augmented reality aircraft identification/tracking apps and makes plane-spotting (along with hawk-spotting and star watching) part of his hobbies. The area it was observed has a clear view of traffic routes flying into IAD, DCA, and BWI, plus some other private airfields in the area and Andrews AFB. Observation:  We had already seen 2 satellites pass over, 3 shooting stars (two parallel to the quite clearly visible milky way and one perpendicular), and probably a dozen aircraft. The night is super clear, probably the clearest we have had in a week. I was staring at the shocking amount of stars out but didn't immediately identify any planets I wanted to check out with a telescope or set of binos (silly, Saturn was right behind me). I walked around the truck and asked dad to turn off the garage lights, and when I turned around again there was a shockingly bright light in the sky that I hadn't noticed before. 'Not too strange, just didn't see it.'  And then it started moving, looking like it was dropping down in the sky. 'Well, okay, it's flying away from us not quite in the traffic lanes'.  It was moving pretty fast. Faster than the satellites, slower than some of the closer low flying planes that had red/white blinking lights.  Also was just one steady tone, a cream-white color. Very bright, brighter than any of the stars by far, brighter than Venus  or Mars.  Then it hooked a starting to a reverse J, then into an L turn to the right. Then it started... jigging?  Bouncing up and down, left and right.  At first I thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me just because it was so bright, so I steadied myself, set my head down on the truck bed, and kept watching.  Still jigging.  Then another aircraft passed below it in my view and it and the stars around it were rock steady, not moving strangely at all, but that light was still jigging around relative to all of it. Dad got the AR app out and it showed a couple aircraft in the sky kinda near it, but one of the craft was not identifiable on the app.  The other was a clearly visible commercial plane (the one I mentioned above). Then it started to fade.  Didn't change color, just rapidly went dark over the span of about 10 seconds and that was the last we saw of it. Speculation:  First guess was it was a flare because of how it faded out, its color, and how bright it was.  But, the flare explanation didn't cover the jigging.  It didn't look like any of the other aircraft in behavior or appearance, so I don't think it was one of the commercial craft. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thanks for the reply. I asked a group what they thought, and they suggested I check the ISS orbit.  NASA says I should have been able to see the ISS 65 degrees off the horizon for about 5 minutes, disappearing 19 degrees above ESE, at 19:28 pm.  That would have lined up exactly with what I saw. That's going to be my going explanation. Thanks again! ((END ADDENDUM))",2017-10-19T00:00:00,39.0255,-78.2696

Often, I sit to to take nature pictures, of any sort, at the back of my yard that overlooks a river and a beautiful woods on the other side.   This morning (10/15/17, 11:20 AM) I heard the whine of a large passenger airliner approaching from behind me.  This is not uncommon, as I am more or less on the flight path for planes landing at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  But because of the whine, I thought it to be quit low, it was unusually low due to the very overcast sky.  As it passed overhead, I thought I should have taken a picture of it, just to do it and then erase it, though I didn't.  Then off to my right I saw what I thought to be a small bird fluttering along in the wind, a distance away, maybe a leaf, it didn't drop at all, must have been a bird?  If I had tried to photograph it I'd of been able to zoom in on it and be able to tell. A few second later, looking now of to my left (which 3/4's of a mile away is the General Motor Tech Center) I see what might be another bird.  Well, I'll see if I can find it in the viewfinder when zoomed in on and get it focused and get a picture of it.  It, due to its distance, looked still quit small and a little strange, like its wings were drooped downward kind of low. I took the picture, quickly hit viewer to see how the picture looked, zoomed in on it and it look very strange, like an number 3.  I then quickly pointed the camera to the north, then finding it again, took 4 more pitures. It looked like Number 3. It's hard to tell how how big it is, how far it was away and how fast it was moving.  My guesses are it was ¾ to 1 ½ miles away.  If it was ½ to ¾ of a mile away. Because of the time between the first picture and the second picture being about 30 seconds it was traveling at 30 to 50 mph.  If it was a half mile away my guess is it was 10 to 12 feet long.",2017-10-19T00:00:00,42.494305741626796,-83.02442081339713

It was early evening, and she climbed on top of our sturdy solid wooden TV console that was about 5 feet tall. She was acting silly, curling up on her side with her hoodie pulled over her head and face.  As I was watching her, one of our cats was sitting on the floor about 3 feet from me just a little to the left in front of me. In my line of vision, while watching my daughter, a solid bright white ball of light appeared about 2 feet from the ceiling.  It proceeded to descend at a steady, but slow enough pace, to observe its size to be between a volleyball and a basketball.  The descent lasted about 3 feet before it disappeared about 2 feet from the floor.  My daughter never saw it because her head and face were covered, but her cat was staring where the ball disappeared about 2 feet above the floor. For years, I just assumed it was supernatural, but I've been reading more about these types of orbs possibly being extraterrestrial.  I live in Ohio where frequent UFO sightings have been reported.

I woke up to the sound of my mom leaving the house; I rolled over and went back to sleep.  That's when they entered my dream and proceeded to use it to connect with me telepathically.  The first thing I experienced was seeing one of these aliens (I had been guided telepathically by another one of his kind before this on a pretty regular basis).  I can't really pinpoint what triggers my encounters, but they always help me to do what I need to do to help them.  At first, I thought that I was just dreaming, until I was overcome with an intense feeling of this dream no longer being my own; it was my guide watching me from DIRECTLY above me, taking control of my dream, telepathically telling me that this was, beyond ANY doubt, NOT a dream!  This alarmed me, but it didn't terrify me.  I remember seeing other people, just shadows now as I try to recall their appearances, on this elevator that they had produced for me to see, it being a means of transporting me from my room to their ship.  I knew they were doing this; I was aware of it. But they put me in the frame of mind I needed in order for me to do my job by scaring me for the reason of my becoming submissive as a result of my fear.  Only when I was submissive (apparently (They know this about me!)) would I be able to comply with their requests in order for me to fulfill my duties.  They scared me by means of hearing the engine of the ship gearing up to leave.  Frankly, it mortified me, because the noise seemed to come alive by means of a tingling light that penetrated not only the elevator, but also passed through me front to back.  The tighter I shut my eyes, the more details of my surroundings I could see because the light that this noise produced got so bright that had my eyes been opened, I would have been blinded by the brightness.  With my eyes closed, it was easier to see details of my surroundings!  But then they comforted me milliseconds before I woke up.  When I did wake up, my guide stepped back until he regained his telepathic link to me.  I was then magnetically drawn into the ship by the ship where I then proceeded to tend to my first order of business, which was to try on different visualizations of different types of hands, faces, arms, legs, and feet for the purpose of deciding what would look most human, but more importantly, what would be most practical for their purpose. I then entered a hospital-like area.  The whole level was a hospital. I somehow knew that this ship had multiple levels.  During this visit, I was only needed on this level.  My guide told me to go get something from one of the receptionists. I walked past the receptionists, surveyed the patients, saw some scary looking tubes and bags containing hybrid blood.  These bags were apparently organic in nature because they seemed to be alive, protecting, enhancing, and providing nutrients to the hybrid blood.  These tubes were true red, because upon going to work later that day, (I work at a fast food place,), I remember surveying the floor to see where it was dirty, seeing the red tape covering pipes leading to the soda machine, and becoming extremely and noticeably uneasy upon seeing this red tape.

A few years ago, my wife and I were traveling north between Tecumseh, OK, and Shawnee, OK.  It was the middle of the day, 1 or 2 pm, and the sun was behind us.  It was bright and clear, with a few big low clouds.  We had the sun reflect off an object in the sky and glinted us in the eye, like a chrome bumper, or a car window on a sunny day.  It got our attention and we both looked up and saw a strange craft coming out in between a couple of clouds.  My wife said “what the heck is that?”  I just said WOW.  It was only a couple of hundred feet up, if that.  And maybe 100 to 200 feet in front of us.  First thought it was an airplane, but it looked like a big, long rectangular ship, with a little beak on the front.  It was headed up in a steep climb.  It glided between the clouds, with the leading edge disappearing into another cloud, with the rear of the vessel still in the first cloud.  It took a few second for the body of the ship to pass between the clouds before the trailing edge came out.  I sat watching to see an airplane wing or tail come out as it passed, but the trailing edge was identical to the leading edge, totally vertical with just a small angle on the lower part of the rectangle.  I saw like a shadow under the craft that looked like an upside down dinner plate.  The angles hanging down seemed to form a saucer shape on the bottom of the big rectangle.  From our viewpoint, I surmise, it was round, with a smaller saucer shape on the bottom.   We were looking straight at it and maybe a little angle from the bottom, as I faintly saw the shadow of the front and far side underneath..  It seemed to be perfectly straight across at the top and bottom.  We could not see what was on the top and bottom, but it appeared flat across from our viewpoint on the ground.  Looked like a bare metal container in the sky, no lights or windows or markings, and it looked all perfectly square and even.  I seem to remember it was made up of big panels.  The thing from the ground and passing through clouds and all seemed to me like to 15 or 20 or so feet high, and over one hundred feet long.  It amazed me the front and rear were so perfectly squared up, and had a little overhang right near the bottom, which I am guessing was the saucer shape.   It moved quickly and quietly and was gone in 5 seconds.   I did not look around or try to see other drivers.  We were both shook up by it and didn’t think to stop.  It looked like an Amtrak passenger car flying through the clouds.  Or a big ship.  Bigger than a 737.  I lived near Detroit Metro Airport in the landing path and delivered mail in Wayne, Mi, just a mile or two from the airport in the glide path.  We saw all types of planes down low inbound and outbound and are familiar with most aircraft.  This was nothing like a plane, and like I say it looked like only a couple of hundred feet away from us, as compared with what I saw landing and taking off in the past. I was kind of surprised almost let down that it was boxy.  I always laughed and said my Honda hybrid looks like a space ship. but this thing looked more like a boxcar than a sleek spaceship.  But like I say it was probably circular just looking at it straight on it was hard to tell. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.

On July 17, 2017, at approximately 7:00 PM Pacific Time, my wife and I were driving South on Lorane Hwy in Eugene, OR.  As we passed the Andrew Reasoner Wildlife Preserve, we observed to the North what appeared to be a commercial jetliner hovering over the hill, approximately one quarter mile from our position on the road, and maybe 500 feet off the ground.  My wife noticed it first and exclaimed, “Look at that.  That’s not moving at all.”  My wife was convinced it was tethered to the ground, like a dirigible.   As the driver, I was initially focused on the road, but was able to turn my head left and see the plane for about 15 seconds and it did not appear to be moving.  I tried to convince myself that it was, just flying very slowly, but I saw nothing to indicate it was changing position.   The plane was extremely low; from our vantage point, we could almost see the tops of the wing surface and we could easily see the color scheme on the side of the plane (a flash of orange writing on a white fuselage).  Considering the Eugene airport is miles away to the North, and the plane was traveling, or hanging, East to West, I find no rational explanation as to why a giant commercial jetliner would be frozen, or possibly moving at a speed slower than our car.   Although I’m relaying this as if we cognized everything immediately, it wasn’t until we rounded the next corner and the “plane” left our sight that we realized how incredibly odd what we had just witnessed was.   We immediately turned the car around and were back where we first saw the plane in less than 30 seconds.  It was gone and although we had a clear view all the way to the horizon--West, North and South--we could find no trace of the “plane” in our view.   We couldn’t see clearly to the East, but it would have been impossible for the plane to head in that direction from the position it was in when it left our view and no chance we wouldn’t have seen it if it was even possible for it to instantaneously turn around.   Considering the proximity of the “plane” to our car, we should have heard the sounds of the plane's engines, but there was only the noise of our tires on the road.  The plane made no sound and didn’t show any exhaust gases.   We both are well- familiar with the area and have never seen a commercial airliner flying so low, let alone at walking speed, if not completely frozen.

I downloaded multiple sky apps on my phone and the next day tried to go out at the exact same time, 3:10am in the morning to see if I saw anything similar happening again, which I didn't. However, what was interesting is on this particular app you could rewind the time to see if there were any flares, overhead  satellites, radio satellites or the ISS passing overhead during the specific time I recalled watching the unidentified lights. As far as I could research, nothing showed up as far as anything that would be linked to man-made light anomalies.  Our family has had several sightings over many lifetimes, and being that I grew up over 43 years in this city, I can say I've never witnessed lights in the sky such as this.

Around 5pm on a clear, sunny day, I spotted a slow moving craft about 500 feet above me.  I originally thought it was a small airplane and disregarded it further, but when I noticed the craft stopped and hovered I paid closer attention and realized that it was no plane.  Planes don’t hover.  And it was not shaped like a helicopter, it was cigar shaped. Indeed I could not see any wings or rotary blades on it, just a white cigar shaped craft with a lone slow, blinking light at the rear of the craft. The light was very interesting.  It wasn’t the normal cobalt blue you might see on a plane.  It was more of an aqua color, which would then become a lighter aqua after it blinked and then blink back to the darker aqua.  And it would blink more slowly than a typical craft light. Even more bizarre was after about every 10 blinks, a large square black object seemed to replace the light for about 3 seconds only to be replaced back by the blue blinking light.  This black door would take up about one third of the craft and then completely disappear whenever the blue light came back on.  I thought maybe a cargo door was opening and closing, that’s my best guess, but the switch happened too quickly.  In fact there was something that defied the laws of physics about that black square.  It was so densely black that it felt like a black hole had opened up, not just a cargo door.  Also, the white body of the craft seemed to have a white mist around it – its outline seemed blurred by the mist – which was odd because there were absolutely no clouds in the sky.  And there was no vapor trail tailing behind the craft.  By contrast the lines of the black square were extremely crisp, no mist, no blur. I pointed the object out to some passing neighbors and they too thought it was an odd craft.  We all agreed it couldn’t be a blimp and but instead seemed like a UFO.  After about 3 minutes the craft stopped hovering and proceeded eastbound at the same slow pace.  I looked away for about 15 seconds and when I returned my gaze the craft was gone.

I am an Architect. I experienced an event that I am unable to explain. My wife and I own a second home on Velvet Lake, a small quite and private lake on the north end of the Crow Wing State Forest located about 4 miles east of Crosslake, Minnesota.  We are at the end of the road. There are about thirty or so other cabins on the lake and because it is late in the season, with winter setting in, not many people were up at their cabins; not many lights on around the lake.  Our closest neighbors, about one hundred yards away to the north of us, were at their place but no one was out or down by the lake. On the evening of October 28, 2017, my wife and I were enjoying one last campfire for the year.  Our cabin is on the east-southeast side of the lake so sitting at the fire pit looking at the lake we are facing west-north west.  Our fire pit is set back about 15 yards from the edge of the water. At about 19:00 my wife decided to go up to the cabin and warm up, I stayed at the campfire.  When I got up to stir the logs I looked out across the lake and noticed what appeared to be 5 very bright stars off in the distance.  I'm a star gazer, usually looking for satellites and shooting stars, but I've never seen anything like this before.  I wasn't even looking for stars that night because the sky was too cloudy, only a few stars were visible directly above me with the half moon behind me shrouded in clouds; it wasn't worth the effort.  No other stars were view-able across the lake. Looking almost due north these stars or lights were all in a horizontal line and appeared to be stationary and separated almost equal distances apart.  The lights appeared to be a long way away, miles out in the distance and not just across the lake.  The lights were low to the horizon, maybe 10 to 15 degrees above  the horizon and appeared to be just a few degrees above the dark treeline in the distance. The lights were orange-red, like the color of a flame... almost lite rust in color.  The lights were bright and distinct, many times the brightness of any other star.  The lights were steady in intensity.  The lights were not large, maybe twice the size of what Mercury looks like, but a lot brighter.  No twinkling!  No blinking!  No changing of colors.  They were bright, steady and intense. My first thought was maybe they are hanging or lingering fireworks that I didn't hear.  They lights didn't fade away and just stayed there.  My thoughts then were  ""what the hell! What am I looking at? What is that!?""   I headed to the lake to get a better look.  I'm not a UFO person so as I walked to the lake I'm trying to justify it in my mind and I'm thinking that it must be a military line of aircraft in some kind of flying formation.  I had a quick thought of yelling up to my wife but she was long gone by then so I didn't call to her as I walked towards the lake. By the time I traversed the 15 or so yards to the lake the stars are now moving.  They appeared to go from a slight diagonal line slanting upwards from low on the right (north) to high on the left (west) side.  They formed the shape of a cup, like the big dipper, with two high lights further apart above the two lower lights.  I don't remember seeing the fifth light at this time.  I said to myself out loud, ""how can the big dipper be that close to the ground"".  And then the lights started moving upward and away from me in the same direction but different paths. This was not the Big Dipper!  I'm thinking that I should be taking photos of this with my phone and I'm thinking that I couldn't get my phone out fast enough and I wouldn't capture it anyway.  So I decided to watch instead of fumbling with a phone.  I'm regretting that decision because anything would have been better than not doing anything. The lights are still moving slow. I'm again thinking that they are military, they are moving like helicopters so I listened for any sounds of motors of any sort to coincide or explain what I'm seeing.  No engine sounds, no echos, no distant rumblings, nothing. The lights continue to move slowly and steadily upwards.  They seemed to have be moving at the same speed... not catching up to each other or getting further apart.  One by one they disappeared from view like flying into the clouds.  First the upper and lower lights on the right side disappear, seconds apart in the same direction but different paths and then the other two lights on the left side disappeared in the same fashion within seconds of each other. This all happened within two to three minutes. I was dumbfounded and headed back to the campfire.  I sat down and thought about it, trying to remember what I saw, and then I thought ""what time is it?""  I looked at my phone and it was 19:09. I'm writing this on 10-29-2017 at 15:00 the day after the experience, about 21 hours later.  This is what happened to the best of my recollection and memory. I'm unable to get my mind around this and I'm trying to find a reasonable explanation.  I saw what I saw!  Unfortunately I was by myself and didn't take any photos. Could they have been some of those Chinese lanterns that people release into the night sky?  If so it wasn't anyone on the lake because these where miles out in the distance.  Can you see those types of lanterns from miles away?  Do they rise up fast enough to disappear in minutes?  Any help will be appreciated.",2017-11-03T00:00:00,46.6608,-94.1036

Alien Visitation Premonition.,UK/England,,2016-11-17T00:00:00,formation,Not Known,"Occurred : 11/17/2016   (Entered as : 16/11/17) Reported: 11/18/2017 4:20:29 PM 16:20 Posted: 11/22/2017 Location: UK/England,  Shape: Formation Duration:Not Known",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/137/S137312.html,"Alien Visitation Premonition. I have recently experienced what I believe to be some sort of premonition of an alien visitation and I feel that I must report this to someone. I have known that I am psychic for a good number of years, but what I experienced recently has really given me cause for thought!  I am by no means a crank, I have held high ranking management positions in previous employments and have also self published a book on my speciality subject. I am currently self employed as a teacher and consider myself to be a trusted, well liked and respected member of the community. My premonition came to me by way of a dream which I experienced on the night of the 16th November 2017, a dream so vivid that I can still remember it now, as though it had just happened!  My home is quite close to a river, some 2 miles inland from the sea, I won't give any other detail for security reasons. I remember being stood next to the river and being amongst other people that were there, watching as the river lapped at the top of the river bank, slowly spilling over onto the walkway where I was standing. It was daytime. I heard someone comment that the river level shouldn't have been that high, and that there was no high tide expected. The weather was calm, yet here was the river quietly rising and bursting it's banks. I then heard the sound of a jet, and looking up I saw a Typhoon Eurofighter high in the sky. I know it was a Typhoon Eurofighter, (but again I will omit the information as to how I know for security purposes). But it wasn't moving, it was completely stationary, right above me. When I say it was stationary, I feel that I should elaborate. It wasn't flying through the sky is what I mean to say, it was moving, but it was just slowly spinning around on a central axis, as though held in mid air by some kind of forcefield!  I couldn't see whether or not the jet was armed. It only stayed in my vision for a matter of a couple of seconds, and then it was suddenly propelled away in a south easterly direction so fast that it appeared to leave a trail of propulsion fire behind it as it went. When I say it was fast, I mean it was as fast as you would see a shooting star fly across the sky, blink and you would miss it!  I don't think it was destroyed – I get the feeling that it was simply taken out of action. I then remember the sky beginning to turn dark, there were clouds in the sky, but everything just seemed to darken – as though there was a solar eclipse. Then the sky began to change colour, still in a darkened state, but different colours seemed to be hitting large areas of the sky from above. Greens, purples, yellows, oranges, pinks, all different shades and covering the whole darkened sky, it was as though the whole earth's atmosphere had been illuminated!  I just looked up mesmerised by the colours and thinking how strangely beautiful it looked, and then I saw a formation of alien craft. They were to the north of my position and were flying from west to east in formation, travelling at much the same speed as you would see a jet normally flying at (maybe slightly faster). These craft were square in shape (seen from the side) as they flew across the sky, (just higher than the horizon) and they appeared to be around 5mm square as I looked at them and around 25 – 30 miles away (40 – 50km) from my position. I have since sketched a drawing of the formation that I saw and would describe it as being close to square shaped, but with the top left hand corner missing. My sketch shows nine craft on the top row, 10 craft on the row below and then five rows of 11 craft below the top two rows - (74 craft in total). All of the craft were flying at the same speed and in perfect formation. I got no inclination as to where they were going. What I did feel though, and what I still feel today, is that these aliens were here on a peaceful mission. They were not here to harm us whatsoever – quite the opposite in fact. I have (and still have) an intense feeling that they were here to rid the world of evil, it's as simple as that!  It is now my true belief, that when this visitation takes place, the world will have all evil removed. All evil people and all weapons of mass destruction will be taken from the Earth. And when I say evil, I mean truly evil!  Dictators guilty of horrific war crimes, their foot soldiers, murderers, child killers, people who simply cannot live peacefully. Weapons would include nuclear bombs, chemical weapons, guns, grenades etc. It is my belief that we have been watched for many years by these aliens and that they (wherever they are coming from) are unhappy with the way our Earth is currently being treated. They wish to assist the good people of the Earth by ridding it of all evil and allowing those left behind to live a life of peace and love for one another. We will be left in a world without wars, without famine, without greed – I'm sure you get the picture. I understand that you are security conscious, but I don't mind coming forward and telling people about my premonition. In fact I believe that I have been chosen to do just that, in order to pave the way for this coming visitation. To let people know that when it happens, that these beings are here to help the good people of the planet Earth, not here to destroy us, but to make the world a better place for us to live in. I don't know where the evil will be taken to, I just know that it will be banished – removed!  I would be more than happy to sketch the view of the formation for you if you would like to see it and would love to hear of any similar stories being reported to you which are similar to mine. I'm not a fruit cake, I fully believe in what I have been shown and look forward to the day when the world is relieved of all evil – that day simply cannot come soon enough!  To end I would say this, it doesn't surprise me that rich governments are worried about alien visitations – because they are fully aware that any defense that they might have in their collective arsenals, (including nuclear weapons) will be completely worthless against the advanced technology of the alien visitors!  Thank-you for taking the trouble to read my report. Please remember that this report is of a premonition that I have experienced and not an actual eye witness report. Kindest regards.",2017-11-22T00:00:00,,

This was witnessed by multiple observers. 1)  A very bright white light flashed on the south horizon and proceeded to the north horizon, flashing irregularly, but frequent enough to track its trajectory easily.  It traveled faster than anyone present had ever previously observed.  The flashes were one to two seconds in duration.  It appeared to be in the upper atmosphere, substantially higher than the many aircraft nearly constantly present.  We also saw plenty of satellites, which moved at a fraction of the object.  I estimate it traveled from horizon to horizon in less than 15 seconds. 2)  Approximately 20 minutes later the light reappeared, but this time it was directly in the center of our field of view, around 35-40 degrees above the horizon.  It flashed with the same frequency, but remained near motionless in the sky.  I believe it did move, but so little some of us felt it was completely motionless.  It remained in position for approximately 5 minutes, and then stopped flashing. When it was not lit, the sky appeared empty at its location. I am an Air Force vet, trained weather observer, and this event was unique in my experience.  This was no meteor, of which we saw many. None of us had an explanation for what we saw beyond the possibility that we witnessed secret technologies of our military (our location was approximately 120 miles from the Groom Lake, NV area), or a UFO of extraterrestrial origin.  This was pure speculation, and the entire incident remains a puzzling mystery. I do note that this sounds very similar to the descriptions of others on this site.",2017-11-22T00:00:00,,

We saw what we first thought was lightning, but we discredited this after there was absolutely no thunder.  It was eerily silent.  This ""lightning"" became incredibly frequent and was honestly quite startling.  We couldn't see any bolts of lightning, but there were bright, bright flashes about every 2 seconds, in multiple parts of the sky.   At this point we were thinking it was just a lightning storm, but the flashes started to turn brighter, and instead of white, they were now green.  Freaked out at this point, we were going to the car to drive towards the direction of whatever this thing was.  As we were getting into the car, a plane passed overhead, but it made absolutely no noise. It was completely silent.  My commute to work every day takes me oast an airport, so I have seen many planes land up close, and I have NEVER seen a plane fly this low and this quietly.  As it passed over us, you could feel the force of this thing and it came close to knocking us over.  Scared and curious, we finally started driving towards these flashes.   After about 5 miles, we could see what looked like a giant cloud in the sky, almost like a hurricane you see on weather radar.  Some kind of hole where these flashes were coming from.  We park on the side of the road to look, and the plane comes back.  Whatever the hell this thing was, it came about 100 yards in front of us, and just hovered.  It just hovered and stared at us.  Incredibly scared now, we drive back home and went to bed.   I am really at a loss of words as to what I saw.  Just a side note, our dog was acting incredibly strange all day that day.  He hid under the bed which is not like him at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2017-11-22T00:00:00,44.0873,-92.7485

On Friday, November 10, 2017, at approximately 8:30 p.m., my sister and I were driving from Cleveland, Ohio to Conneaut, Ohio, to our parents’ home in the countryside. Each of us had traveled to Ohio from different states for a funeral service in Cleveland to be held on Saturday, November 11th.  I live in Texas and my sister lives in New Hampshire. It had been dark for several hours.  We were driving to our parents’ home on State Route 7 a few miles from the old Raceway 7.  The nearest city is Conneaut, Ohio.  It is a very rural area with only sporadic traffic. We had leased a Toyota Rav, I was driving, and my sister was in the passenger seat.  We were traveling about 50 mph. Over a period of a minute or so, I became aware of a bright light in the sky to my left and out the window.  Fairly low to the ground, my first thought was that it was a power transmission tower with lights.  However, as we grew closer to the brightness, I could see an outline of an object and realized that it was suspended in the sky – it was definitely not a transmission tower. We were still traveling approximately 50 mph and started moving underneath the object, which was either stopped or traveling much slower that we were.  At this point, it was hovering directly over the highway and our vehicle. Both of us realized that the object was of immense size – huge.  Seemingly triangular in shape with a flat underside, its lower surface, very dark and almost black, was completely covered in an array of different sized very bright lights, both large and small.  All of these lights were white. Very apprehensive, I asked my sister, “What is that thing?”  My sister, concerned at this point too, unbuckled her seat belt and instantly turned around in her seat to look up and out the rear window.  She screamed, “I think it is a UFO!”   The object was so immense that its outer edges seemingly spanned hundreds of feet outward in both directions on either side of our car. As we watched its outer edges, my sister stated that she thought it was following us. We continued driving, speeding up to try to get out from under it, and at this point saw that we were nearing our parents’ home.  My sister yelled, “Switch off the headlights, I think it is following us!”  I did turn off the headlights and we sped down the dirt driveway.  Thinking it was overhead, we and bolted into the house, terrified, without stopping to remove our personal items from the car. My sister stated that she felt we were in danger and we did not exit the house for fifteen minutes, hoping that the object had departed. We both believe that this object was as large as several football fields. We saw no wings (as with an aircraft) and heard no sound.  It was completely silent.  The object was not high in the sky, but flew very low, much lower than would be expected of a conventional aircraft. At no time could we see the top of the object.  The only visible part was the extremely expansive dark and very bottom of the craft, with numerous bright white lights. In short, this was one of the strangest events I have witnessed.  This was definitely not an airplane or jet, it was very low to the ground, it made no sound, it was larger than any aircraft I have ever seen, and it seemingly followed us for a short distance. My sister and I felt sense of panic – mainly because of the tremendous size of it – and the fact it was directly over us and seemed to be following our car. I have been a Pilates instructor and myofascial therapist for over twenty years, and my sister owns a lumber brokerage business.  We both have good jobs and are in our late 50’s, we had not consumed any alcohol, and to this date, we cannot furnish a rational explanation for what we witnessed that night.",2017-11-22T00:00:00,41.8909,-80.6164

Floating orbs of light—split and re-combined—circled/hovered near tent while camping,Gunnison National Forest,CO,2017-06-13T03:19:00,sphere,~3 hours,"Occurred : 6/13/2017 03:19  (Entered as : 06/13/17 03:19) Reported: 9/18/2017 1:27:46 PM 13:27 Posted: 9/21/2017 Location: Gunnison National Forest (Almost), CO Shape: Sphere Duration:~3 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/136/S136214.html,"Floating orbs of light—split and re-combined—circled/hovered near tent while camping Summary:  The event occurred on June 13, 2017, at the Lodgepole Campground in the Gunnison National Forest adjacent the Taylor River.   The event began at exactly 03:19 and continued until dawn.  During this time, an orb of light circled my tent, split into at least two separate orbs, re-combined while hovering over my tent, and rose into the aspens, as daylight broke.  The passage of time from the appearance until dawn (roughly 06:30 Mountain Time) felt as though it had been accelerated.  In other words, my biological clock did not account for the 3+ hours that passed during the event.  I did not fall asleep during the event.  The lights came within arm's reach of my tent door, but did not enter the tent/rainfly vestibule. Full Account:  NOTES:   1.  I made camp that night with a rain fly over my tent. 2.  All that can be perceived on the inside of the tent is diffused light and shadows. 3.  The tent was an REI Halfdome 2 with the orange rainfly. 4.  When approaching the campground from the south, it's accessed via a right turn off the road. 5.  My campsite was the penultimate site on the strip/loop (to the right upon entering the campground), the most isolated, and the furthest into the forest. I was awakened by light diffusing through my tent fly.  At first, I believed this was the result of a very bright moonrise or the breaking of dawn.  I turned on my GPS device to check the time (phone was charging on motorcycle); the time displayed was 03:19.  It was far too early for dawn, and moonlight isn't this bright. Slightly alarmed, I reclined with my eyes open and began to rationalize what the source of the light might be.  I told myself I believed the light to be that of a NFS ranger performing nightly rounds.  As I watched the light move in a circular pattern around my tent (estimated some 20 yards away, I noted a few things:   1.  The light moved slowly and steadily as though hovering on a stationary plain. 2.  The light didn't move like a flashlight or headlamp operated by a human — the motion was too smooth, too perfect. 3.  There were no footsteps associated with the light's movement. 4.  There was no other sound associated with the light's movement. 5.  The light was a cool blue/white — white at the center with a blue aura. Unable to sleep, I watched as this light split/manifested a twin.  They continued to circle my tent (between foot and hip level), occasionally approaching from behind and from the side before withdrawing and continuing their silent ""march.""  At one point, one of the lights came close enough my tent that its brilliance shone up underneath the fly. This was the first and only direct observation of their radiance without obfuscation by the tent fly. At this point, there was no more kidding myself: these things were real, wholly other, and I was terrified.  My only recourse was to pray silently while watching the event unfold.  I uttered no sound, sat motionless and upright in my sleeping bag, and watched as the energies moved about. Near the end of the event, one of the floating lights hovered directly above my tent and remained there for some time.  As day broke, it moved off/ascended into the aspens, re-combined with the other, and dimmed until it was no longer visible.  Un-nerved, exhausted, yet unable to return to sleep, I arose, took care of the morning necessities, and began preparing breakfast. I felt a deep need to discuss what I experienced.  When a fellow camper (some 50-70 yards away) began stirring, I approached him.  I must have appeared visibly shaken because the look on his face was that of concern.  Without volunteering anything specific, I simply asked him if he slept well and if he noticed anything during the dark hours.  His response was validating, but disturbing.  He said, ""I saw lights near your tent . . . but didn't think much of it.""  At that time, I told him everything.  His conclusion was that I was being ""scanned,"" but I can't know that for sure.  He clearly believed in the other-ness of my experience. Personal Conclusions:   1.  These weren't solid objects because as the two interacted, they would've cast shadows of each other. 2.  These objects originated from the wooded areas behind my tent because they cast distinct tree-trunk shadows while on initial approach. 3.  These objects were utterly silent and so couldn't have been drones in the recreational sense. 4.  These objects moved with such slow, methodical refinement that they couldn't have been drones in the recreational sense, nor could they have been mounted on humans (e.g., a flashlight or headlamp). 5.  These objects were definitely interested in ME.  The focus of their movement was my location and that didn't change throughout the entire encounter. 6.  My prayers had NO effect on their movement or position.  In fact, as I prayed for them to leave, they drew nearer.",2017-09-21T00:00:00,,

I was returning home from work and I stopped at the end of the driveway to get the mail.  As I was walking back to my vehicle a bright light caught my attention.  The light was stationary and straight east of me.  The only way I can describe the size of the orb is like a golf ball and the stars were pin pricks.  It’s like when the full moon is higher in sky instead of when it just comes up as it appears much more larger.  I was not scared so I stood and watched for a few moments.  It was a large white orb with a glowing halo around it. That night was a bit cloudy and the orb lit up the lowest clouds.  It was just barely above them. I could see the different shades of grey in them.  It finally dawned on me to get my phone. I tried to record it a couple of times but it would not work.  I don’t understand why it didn’t work. I have recorded eclipse’s of the moon before with good results.  Once I started trying to record, it began to move north.  There wasn’t any noise wha! t so ever.  I walked to the front of my pickup which is facing the north.  I didn’t realize how close it was to being above me because as I looked down the length of the road it almost was perfectly in line with me.  As I watched it get further away I heard a familiar sound.  The noise was coming from the northwest.  I turned to look and it was a jet.  I could see the red flashing light and it traveled at “normal” jet speed headed southeast.  I turned back to the north and just glimpsed the orb disappear over the tree line.  I wondered if anyone on the plane was seeing what I was seeing.  I calmly got into my pickup and drove up to my house.  I posted on Facebook asking if anyone else had seen it but no one said they did.  I tried to look up my post to see what time I posted it but it did not say.  It seemed later than it should have been but I can’t be certain.  That night my 2 dogs kept barking and growling all night.   Some of co-workers also said their animals were agitated that night.  The next day or so later I noticed a mark on my arm like I had blood drawn.  But that could have caused by a number of things I guess.  Of course this happened when my husband and son were out of town working which they very rarely ever do.  If they would have been home at least my experience maybe would have been validated by someone even if no one else believed us. The above paragraph is the second unexplained sighting I have had.  It was quite a long time ago so I don’t remember the exact details, time, or the year.  I could possibly find out the year as I was not alone. My step-father, my younger sister and myself were returning from a basketball game where my step-was a janitor.  My sister and I stayed after sometimes to help him clean up the gym. We turned on the road that brings us to our house and then we seen it.  It was the classic disc shaped UFO with lights that went blinking around the edge.  I don’t recall the color of the lights but I know they were colored.  My stepdad and I looked at each other and he asked me should we follow it.  I said of course. I remember being mesmerized and couldn’t take my eyes from it.  We followed it for about 3 miles. I remember my sister being scared, crying and telling us to turn around.  She was very upset.  All of a sudden it just zoomed away.  It was so fast that it was almost like it was there and then it wasn’t.  My best guess as to when this happened is around 1987.  It had to be early winter as it was basketball season.  It must have been about 11 p.m. because that would put us in the right time frame a! fter cleaning up the gym.  My stepdad told his co-workers about what happened and we received a lot of teasing.  But least we had each other and we knew it was real. Thank you for reading my story.

As I continued to travel northbound the object appeared larger.  It seemed to be sitting or hovering above Pizza Hut then father north above Walgreens.   As I approached the Keizer Walgreens, I continued to watch the object as it came into focus above ABBA auto body and Keizer Avamere.  It was here that I saw it clearly was a trangular black shape. The triangle appeared to be 1/4 mile above just the street, but definitely below the clouds.   Just above Keizer Avamere, I noted the triangle on one point appeared to be the front of the object with 2 “headlights” and a faint red blinking light in the middle - almost on the center of the triangulated side. The object continued to hover for about a minute in the same place directly above the apts behind Keizer UPS.   I then turned left around the block on Lockhaven to attempt a photo or stop to better identify this triangle shaped object.  As I pulled in front of the Keizer post office, I saw clearly the rear of the object as the flat side of the triangle, and it sped south as it was nearly directly above the new home of Waremart. This triangle was black and roughly the size of a Tesla automobile.  It traveled very quickly south and disappeared within about 20 seconds.  It appeared hazy before disappearing. I observed this unidentified triangle object for nearly 3 minutes, while driving.  It was hovering and made no sound when the window was down.

Another Lunar Fast Walker?  While observing the moon last night with a three inch (80 x 900 mm) refractor, I saw a black, star-shaped object transiting through the eyepiece field of view at approximately 17:57, EDT.  [Please see the attached diagram for more details.]  I was observing the Aristarchus - Herodotus area of the moon--near the lunar terminator at this time--with a star diagonal and a magnification of 144X .  The waxing gibbous moon was rising in deep twilight, and seeing was excellent.  At the time of the sighting, I had just switched to a 12 mm eyepiece with a 2X Barlow, and just as I was coming to focus with this combination I glimpsed a black, five-pointed, star-shaped object transiting from right to left through the eyepiece field of view (FOV). All of this happened very fast--probably in less than 1 second--and my impression is that when I first saw the object it had already begun to cross the FOV, and I was only able to observe it as it moved toward the left side of the image.  Again, please see the associated diagram for more details.  Note that since I was using a star diagonal which gives a mirror-reversed image, the object was actually moving from east to west--the opposite of what is shown in the eyepiece view. As a point of interest, this is actually the second of these objects that I have seen while observing the moon.  The earlier observation took place on June 23, 2016, and there is a report on file with NUFORC.  As memory serves--and going back to my earlier report to confirm my recollection--this is exactly the same type of object that I observed last year, and moving in the same east to west direction. As I am at best a ""casual"" (as opposed to a systematic) observer of the moon, I am wondering about the reported frequency of sightings of objects of this type.  Given that I have now seen two of these within the space of a year and a half, it would seem to me that others must also be seeing them.  But what is it, exactly, that I and presumably others are seeing?  ((name deleted)) Jacksonville, FL",2017-12-04T00:00:00,30.266904680969628,-81.6163728336584

Forgive the rushed nature of this sighting, I will submit a more extensive report soon. Beginning on December 11, and as recently as last night, December 13, a series of odd lights were observed to the west-southwest of our town’s high school. Just above the treeline, these lights varied in number from one to six, merging with each other and splitting apart at seemingly random intervals.  At times there was only a single light, at other times up to six lights, slowly bobbing around into different patterns.  My sightings occurred on December 12 and 13, after hearing about the occurrence from a family friend who had seen them on the 11th.  The lights appear at about 5 pm to 5:15, and stay for hours, the latest I have observed was still hovering at 8:15 p.m.. The lights themselves had the general appearance of large stars, but would bob around.  In a few instances, the lights multiplied into 5 or 6, and took on the shape of an obtuse angle, with one arm shorter than the other, as if a clock was reading the time 3:50.  These lights would take on seemingly intentional color schemes, with some appearing to strobe predominantly cool colors, others flashing warmer, bronze tones, and one that remained white-hot throughout. It should also be noted that over the past three nights, a large group of conventional aircraft, numbering from six to eleven, can be observed circling the area, never venturing too close to the lights.  Most appear to be airplanes, a few may be helicopters.  Apparently, both the lights and planes have been observed by citizens of the nearby town of Nome sporadically since the end of Hurricane Harvey, the devastation of which ravaged this area quite badly.   The area over which the lights seem to be hovering is seemingly inaccessible, and is most likely either rice farms of oilfields.  I plan to return tonight and every night until these lights cease.

These lights where moving from west to east in direction and passed one at a time for perhaps 45 minutes each taking perhaps 3 minutes to travel seemingly constant altitude arcing over from the eastern horizon (approx 10 miles to the tree line from our vantage point) to east of us, and then disappearing before reaching the trees to our eastern horizon.  We didn’t count the number of objects but to say 25 would be a good guess.  No sound was heard and the usual commercial air traffic was observed well above and out in the distance.  The objects speed  seemed the same for all  and it was hard to determine if the objects where big and very far away or smaller and close.  What we saw looked to be about 4 times the size of the stars in the sky and much, much brighter.  The only formation observed was that they where in single file.  Not evenly spaced either.

So I put the hose down and just stared into the clear patch of sky. Within about 1 minute, a pinpoint of light appeared out of nowhere, immediately expanded to about the size of a small dinner plate and then shrank back out to nothing.  I was completely floored.  I immediately texted my wife to come outside.  I turned on my phone video and pointed it in that direction and waited.  Within about a minute it happened again.  Once again I was completely floored.

There was a report of some type of problem at SNA airport—about 3-4 miles away.  I heard sirens outside and stepped out onto my patio.  The field of view from my patio is SSE to NNE. Immediately upon stepping onto the patio I noticed a large craft of some sort coming into the field of view from the SSE.  This was rather strange since I usually only see and hear helicopters in this direction. The craft initially appeared to be an aircraft which might have been in distress since it was flying very low-I’d say no higher that 3000-4000ft; and its direction of travel is not a normal approach pattern for SNA airport.  As I looked at it, I started to think that I better make mental notes about it, and I also reached into my pocket to get my phone to take a picture.  I had left my phone inside and decided that if I went in to get it the craft would be out of sight. As mentioned, the craft was flying very low and was approximately only about ½ Mile to the East of my location.  This position would put it right over Fashion Island—a local Mall.  The other very odd thing that hit me at that moment was that there was absolutely no sound coming from the craft, absolutely nothing!   I have a drawing of the craft I’d like to send.  The drwg was done on a CADD program and then converted to Pdf.  The drawing will help to describe my thoughts and feeling about the craft. I have been a business owner and engineering consultant for many years.  During the 1980s I have worked with many of the local aerospace companies including: Northup Grumman, TRW Aerospace, Rockwell, Mc Donnell Douglas, Hughes Aircraft, and Lockheed as they began to develop technology to manufacture stealth aircraft.  The craft I saw on 04/23 appeared to be of similar profile to stealth aircraft and it could possibly be a craft built on Earth but not in ‘Public’ circulation. I estimate that the craft was approximately 300ft by 150ft, triangle shaped, and totally black except for (6) portals on the bottom of the craft.  There were no apparent engine nacelles, and no visible or audible form of propulsion. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD))",2017-09-21T00:00:00,,

Moving between orange, red and at times a slight yellow.  As we started to move towards the two objects we were able to see a third.  All three sat there but then the started to move a little.  The one on the left began to move quickly to the left while the middle one stayed stationary.  Eventually the one on the right seemed to ""blip"" out.  We chased the one moving to the left and by the time we saw it again the other two were gone.  After deciding to try and get a better vantage point we ran around and eventually lost sight of the objects. I stood quietly and attempted to reach out mentally.  I remember saying, ""Show yourself to me one more time so I know I'm not seeing things.""  Shortly there after (approx two minutes) objects appeared in the sky again.  This time there was only two. We ran down streets trying to get better views of them.  During this time we observed the objects hovering, moving in a straight line, changing course during flight and eventually moving out of sight.  Overall the entire incident lasted about 15 mins before we lost sight or they disappeared.  Both of us were deeply impacted, myself particularly so. We also took a fair amount of video which I have uploaded to YouTube.  Here is a link to the main video with all footage edited together. I also included unedited raw footage in seven different clips, all available on the account.  I also have all the raw footage saved across multiple locations if you need the original files for anything.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTY4m2w0TI&t=12s  Here are GPS coordinates for the first three sightings: Sighting Spot 1: 45.5576506643974, 45.5576506643974  Sighting Spot 2: 45.5576641036159, 45.5576641036159  Sighting Spot 3: 45.557686085849, 45.557686085849",2017-09-21T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

I know the difference between enemy aircraft, satellites, commercial and private aircraft, helicopters, military flares, their designated flight paths, and their colored lights and flashing patterns.  While observing a low altitude airplane flying in a normal flight pattern at night, I noticed above it a glowing white satellite of unknown origin hovering at a high altitude, and then moving in unusual patterns never seen before in my life.  It was like it was standing post, as if guarding me, moving sideways because it seemed to be following me over the motel that I am staying at.   One of the best experiences I have had ever in my life.  No pictures yet, as I am confident there will be more to come in broad daylight.

The lights were exactly the same distance apart and looked liked they bowed near the end.  There was absolutely no sound and the object was moving very slowly. I called our neighbor and asked her to go out and look.  She saw and reported the exact same thing.  I also called the Jackson County Sheriff's office and they dispatched a deputy out.  The deputy reported to me that he had seen the exact same formation and really didn't know what it was.   He also said they had been getting reports from towns and counties in surrounding areas. We live a few miles from the regional airport and are very familiar with small planes and helicopters flying over.  This formation was flying at about the same height.  It was flying low. I did receive a call back from the Jackson County Sheriff's dispatcher, and she said Scott Air Force base had been contacted and they claimed they had planes flying in a formation over the region.

Our house was on the north side of the river, positioned up on the hill slope, with a view across the valley, looking at the Atalaya Mountains to the south.   We had an office room where the computer was, with large windows taking up almost the entire southern wall to afford this view of the valley.  The computer desk sat on the east wall at a right angle to these windows.   It was fully dark at the time of the sighting.  Since we were a little removed from town, you could see the night sky and stars pretty well at our house.   I was playing a computer game, sitting at a right angle to these big windows on my left.  I must have just looked over at the windows because I don't think any sound or light or anything would have prompted me to do so, and I saw a white spot of light, basically the same size as a star, moving slowly from east to west in a zig-zag pattern just above the mountains on the other side of the valley.  Not a very big or dramatic movement, but kind of like drawing the shape of the symbol for Aquarius (in a single line).   It moved at a slow enough rate across a wide enough space that I could watch it long enough to really take in what I was seeing.   I was interested in UFOs, and knew that this wasn't a normal flying pattern for any known craft.  As far as I can remember, the white point of light continued moving westward down the line of the mountain range at a steady rate until it just left view.

I witnessed a bright flash in the Northeastern sky, followed by a second bright flash a few seconds later.  I was watching for meteors directly above in the Milky Way, since it was a clear night.  The flash was so bright, I saw it out of the corner of my eye—a big ball of white light.  It immediately grabbed my attention.  I traced the object across the sky for over 10 minutes.  It moved in an irregular pathway at an inconsistent speed, flashing at irregular intervals.  Sometimes it appeared to stay in one place for a few seconds.  Some flashes were very bright—brighter than a satellite or planet, some flashes were very faint, and many of the flashes were brighter than the stars and comparable with a planet or satellite.  All the flashes were white light and of varying durations, the longest being about half a second.  The flashing object moved in an unpredictable, zig-zag pathway across the sky, moving from the Northeast towards the West/Northwest.  After about 10 to 15 minutes, I lost it through the trees. The object had to be very high in the atmosphere, if not outside the Earth’s atmosphere.  At one point, I witnessed a jet airliner fly directly under the object as it flashed, so it was much higher than an airplane.  It made no noise that I could discern, but the heavy amounts of background noise could have drowned it out (diesel generators).  Its irregular speed and pathway rules out the possibility of it being an orbiting satellite or high flying aircraft.  No civilian aircraft or space craft could fly like that.  I do not believe it was any space debris falling back down to earth, as it would have left a trail and been a consistent glow.  I suppose it could have been some piece of highly-reflective material being tossed around in the upper atmosphere (but what and how did it get there?).  There’s no way it was a coincidental set of meteors. Something that is also possibly related.  Around 9:30 PM, my cat went completely nuts.  Chasing none existent beings around the room like she went crazy.  As soon as I opened the door to go outside and look for meteors, she abruptly burst outside and ran around the yard.  A few minutes after I had lost sight of the object, she ran up to the door perfectly normal again. I am a person of science, but I cannot logically explain what I saw to any degree of certainty.  The entire event freaked me out, along with two other co-witnesses.  None of my colleagues have believed my account of what I saw.  I know what I saw, and I know it was not normal or something that will be easy to throw aside.  I know that this was in the most literal sense:  an Unidentified Flying Object.

But I'll write the details and you decide. 10:30 on august 20th. 2017. Lone point, Lake Shelbyville.  Campsite 64.  My wife, daughter and son retire to bed.  Night before the eclipse.  My oldest son and I decided it was a cool night with a light breeze.  No bugs.  Stars were phenomenal.  We set up chairs facing west northwest.  Beautiful unobstructed view of the stars.  A hint of the Milky Way.  No clouds.  Fire dying out to glowing coals.  Sitting and talking about the Perseids we saw two weeks ago up in Wisconsin, hoping we could catch a few shooting stars.  We catch a few faint ones and then set up our iPhones on the Nightcap app.  Within the app there is a shooting star setting.  It takes a five second open aperture shot on loop.  It keeps clicking off shots until you stop it or it hits 290 shots.  Then it computes how many to save that had light events or movements.  You have to position your phone against a stable object to keep any stars from blurring.  It takes ok shots of meteors, but they stand out against the points of light that are planets and stars.  So my son and I are talking.  We start to see a few faint meteors followed by a few real fire balls.  A good show seeing 1 or 2 about every 20 minutes or so.  Then we see the strangest thing.  A meteor shoot up from the horizon.  Never seen that before.  But figuring the earth is round, sure.  About three minutes later (the whole time the iPhone clicking away) we see a almost horizontal fireball shoot across the sky.  But instead of a straight trajectory it shoots in a strange curved almost ""u"" shape.  But instead of the common burn out on most meteors it just blinks out.  We give each other a high five excited we both saw it.  It was very bright.  High altitude.  Faster then anything I have ever seen in the night sky.  But unusual in its trajectory.  We talk about it.  Stay out till 1 am and collect our phones and go to bed.  As I'm laying in bed, I see I caught a series from one fireball.  I note the first three captures at 12:01.  Progressive fireball. Again.  There was no other light source near us to reflect anything.  This was all high altitude. And we never noticed the object.  However we were getting up and moving around and there were moments we were not staring at the sky. I tried zooming on the object.  Unable to identify.  And although it was pitch black except for the stars I can't explain it.  If you notice.  The stars in the background are crisp.  If it were an image of a blurred star all of the stars would be blurred. The biggest hangup was the speed at which the previous ""meteor"" was traveling, and its obvious altitude.  And how it traveled in almost a cursive u course.  How bright it was and the way its ""tail"" hung in the sky, as if it were almost drawn with a white glowing pen. I'm not sure we were meant to see this. I'm not even sure what it is. However, I do feel people fail to notice these things because they don't take the time to sit three hours staring at the sky.  Any thoughts?",2017-09-05T00:00:00,,

I went and took your advice and uploaded a bunch of videos and made a youtube page so here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzXmN_nmfoPcmPrqw38QN4A   So on the morning of aug 21st i was awoke around 430am and thought it was to early to let the dogs out (i usually wake up around 630am to do this)  and the next think i knew i was at my front window peeping out and my phone starts ringing from a strange number and kept making my phone light up.  i did not answer given the time but then when i checked my phone later after i remembered (it was all a blur) the numbers were no longer in my missed calls.  So after the call thing the next thing i remember is standing at my back door about to let the dos out. I noticed the light across the lake doing things it I’ve never noticed (I’ve lived here for 4 years) and when i asked my buddy who lives next door to him he said the guy doesn’t even have a light and that it is a reflector.  Anyways, i took my camera out and you will be able to see the light across the lake start acting crazy. after a while i noticed something in the sky that looked like a triangle inside of some kind of bubble jumping all over the place.  When i looked around i noticed another bright light in the sky to the left of this object that would get bright as well and when i filmed it, it was a circle with a bright light around the edge all the way around.  i knoticed the reflection in the lake start to get bigger and smaller and it was pitch black out.  i got closer to the lake and at first i thought the lake was being drained cause it looked like there were walk ways throughout the lake and sounded like there was something or someone in there.  i focused back on the reflection and thought i saw things heading into the light.  then when i looked back up at the spinning triangle i noticed what looked like a space ship rising straight up toward the spinning triangle, come to a complete stop for a few seconds and then precede toward the other bright light (with the light around the whole circle) and stop just under it.  when the sun came up i looked in the lake and all the grass on the inside of t! he lake was matted down like a crop circle would look. it was not like that the day before.  the grass looks really clean and like you would see on a golf course green but on the inside of the lake.  i also noticed what looked to be some kind of chemical on the surface that wasn’t there before either. Im not sure what any of this is or means but in the moment it felt like there was something being hidden in the lake and possibly some kind of moving objects going into the light but not coming back out. A transport of some kind maybe or just nothing at all.  yesterday 8-27-17 we had a storm rolling through. i know clouds change shapes and all that but i don’t know if i was just seeing things or making my mind believe i was seeing things but i had the thought that there was things being trasported like machines, planes, sips etc behind these dark clouds. it looked like at one point some kind of sea creatures up there. again this could be nothing at all but would like some feedback on my first part of this email. Also feel free to share my youtube page and videos. thanks again.",2017-09-05T00:00:00,29.303494827586206,-81.18193620689655

When we turned right to head South onto Hoyt St. it turned right as well and headed South at the same altitude.  We were then alarmed and started eliminating options like aircraft, helicopter, perceived distance, etc.  After eliminating all known possibilities, with the object continuing to follow we became concerned, started to walk towards it, yell at it, and threw snow balls at it.  The altitude was too high to hit the object.  The object was not deterred.  We gave up attempting to scare it off and continued to proceed South on Hoyt St.  The Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) proceeded to follow us.  At approximately E 6th Ave. the object shot off, heading West, at a visually trackable but incredible rate of speed, just ! to the South of downtown Anchorage and disappeared over the horizon as it appeared to cross the Cook Inlet.  - IMPORTANT NOTES - The Bright White Orb approached behind us from the West and followed adjacent or parallel to our right or South at a distance of approximately 60 feet (altitude 75-150 feet). WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT? It occurred to me just yesterday (08/03/2017), after 35 years, that this object was most likely intelligently operated. WHY? If the object would have approached us at, or near, that altitude from any other side it could have dangerously interfered with the ""take-off"" and ""landing"" Flight Corridor of not only the military, at Elmendorf Air Force Base, but also the civilian, at Merrill Field Airport.  The object followed us just a few hundred feet to the West of the Elmendorf AFB Flight Corridor and departed silently at instant mach speeds just a few hundred feet North of the Merrill Field Flight Corridor, heading West past and parallel to Merrill Field. HUMAN CRAFT OR PLANE(?): Not a traditionally recognizable human flight vehicle, it was silent, it hovered, it could stay aloft at walking speed, it made two perfect 90 degree turns, it instantly accelerated to greater than mach speeds with no jet type visual exhaust and no sonic boom(s).  It specifically followed us and stayed just outside the two Flight Corridors (military & civilian) by just a few hundred feet.  If it was a human plane, it could not have performed in such a manner and its flight path would have been ""in"" one of the Flight Corridors.  I grew up in the cross section of the military and civilian Flight Corridors.  I watched literally hundreds of very low altitude civilian and military aircraft, landing and taking off, day and night (Cessna's, C-130's, F-15s, Visiting Blue Angels, etc.).  My reasonable assessment, then and now, is that this was not a traditionally recognizable human flight vehicle.  - DISCLAIMER - I am only relaying the facts as I recall them.  I make no claims as to the objects origin or purpose.  It could be the false recollection of a youthful imagination.  Nonetheless, with due diligence and intellectual integrity, I have considered and reasonably dismissed all normal or likely origins to account for this object.  Simply put, the object ""appeared"" to be an Unidentifiable Flying Object with uncharacteristic flight behaviors.

When the government was shut down between October 1 to 16, 2013, my wife & I went to far West Texas.  One night we visited the Marfa Lights Viewing Area, a first class TDOT facility for viewing the Marfa Lights.  (We've seen the lights in the past, but not this night.) There were a couple of college science professors there.  One guy, who I think was a college professor, shouted out,  ""The Space Station is overhead.""  A very large object is seen above,  Maneuvering all around.  You could easily see details of the object.  It looked very similar to photos of the space station taken through powerful telescopes.   It turned, went north for a bit and seemed to be repositioning itself.  It could certainly maneuver some rather than just fly in orbit.  This object did not appear to be over 8-10 miles up, but who knows.  It appeared to be white.  I do not know exactly how long it was in sight.  My questions are.  From ground level, how much detail can one see of the ISS, even in very clear skies like are usually found in far West Texas?  Does ISS move into much lower orbits from time to time?  Does it stay in a perfect orbit?  I'm asking this now because I recently viewed several photos taken from the ground w/o a telephoto lens.  In those photos the ISS looks much more like a satellite than the huge object we saw in detail. The time was just after dark.  I am not sure of the exact date but feel it was possibly a Friday or Saturday.",2017-08-11T00:00:00,30.1828,-104.38849999999998

It looked like there was a huge object that was hovering around Venus, sometimes blocking it from view.  I could see the outline of a huge oval gem or a marquis diamond which almost appeared opaque or camouflaged, like it blended in with the sky behind it...it's hard to explain.  It was also shimmering blue, purple, green, and red around the edges.  The flight pattern was like nothing I've ever seen...it was not human.

This sighting happened on Xmas evening Dec 25, 2016.  Our family had gone to Xmas dinner at a hotel in downtown Vancouver.  At approximately 10:30 pm we returned home and were in our family room, when my son said hey dad look at the bright red light outside.  I thought he was kidding around, but when I looked out the window sure enough there was a large red orb sitting stationary over Blaine, Washington.  We live in White Rock, BC, overlooking Semiahmoo Bay which faces Blaine.   I quickly grabbed my high power spotting scope to see if I could get a better look to see if there was a definitive shape or hard edges to the object, as it just looked like a red ball.  Even with the scope, that is all it looked like zoomed in.   As I watched, the orb start to ascend,  I noticed another one a bit lower down and to the left appear and was ascending towards the higher one.  After watching for about a minute or so, a 3rd one appeared coming from the Canadian side of the border and it looked like it flew right over the customs border checkpoint at about 300 feet or so off the ground.  As I watched this unfold the first one began to go into a fairly large cloud over Blaine, and as it disappeared, the second had caught up a bit and went into the cloud nearby.  The third started to ascend after I watched it fly level for about half a mile or so and followed the other two into the same approximate area of the cloud.  I watched for quite awhile after they went into the cloud, but they didn’t return.  One thing I noticed was that the sky was totally clear out toward the south except for this cloud over Blaine which I would guess was approx. 1000-1500 feet in altitude.  In hindsight, I regret not videoing instead of looking at them thru the scope.  The whole sighting lasted about 4 or 5 minutes from the time we first saw the orbs.",2017-08-11T00:00:00,49.028774999999996,-122.811825

I turned the engine off and got out so I could get a closer look and take some pictures. I'm not sure exactly how high they were hovering, but if it would have been drones, I would have heard them.  We've had drones fly in this area and I can hear them when they fly at distances a lot further than these objects. It was totally silent, there was no humming or any kind of noise coming from that direction.   The two objects hovered there until I got back in my vehicle.  My husband was with me and he said he didn't hear any noise either. As we proceeded in a southerly direction on Spillway Road, the two objects slowly started to move apart from each other, but they were moving in the same direction as I was moving.  The two objects basically stayed directly over the bayou that Spillway Road runs next to. As the objects kept a small distance behind us, but still moving apart from each other, they disappeared in the blink of an eye. We were about 1/2 a mile from our house when they disappeared.  When I got home, I told my son and his friend what we saw and they said they had seen the two objects hovering in that same exact spot just about five minutes before us, when they were riding the fourwheeler.  They confirmed this again when I showed them the pictures I took. It wasn't until I looked over the pictures and zoomed in for a closer look that I realized there were several lights on each object.",2017-08-11T00:00:00,30.558,-91.9266

No reference as to size, it could have been a half-mile or more away.  I was concerned because commercial aircraft regularly fly over around 20-30k feet on one leg of the instrument approach to San Francisco Bay area airports.   I continued to watch and noticed a couple of black bands around the balloon at angles to each other that I thought was odd but at the distance it now was any detail was lost.  The balloon continued it's assent and I noticed a few small wispy clouds in a clear sky above where it looked like it was heading.  It reached the clouds and stopped it's ascent and appeared to move back and forth horizontally in short movements.  (In hindsight what appeared to be horizontal was probably a small circular ""holding"" pattern). Directly above the balloon appeared what looked like a fuselage, cylindrical in shape, military gray/silver, like cold-war aircraft.  However just the bottom of a cylinder, no wings or tail and the clouds obscured the ends of the cylinder.  Then the balloon disappeared as well as the cylinder. So a craft ascending to the rendezvous marker clouds to meet a cloaked ship that had to become visible for a few seconds so the spherical craft could see to dock to the cylindrical ship....

Not quite sure what to make of this, but here goes... I was taking a little break from work (I work from home) in the afternoon, sitting in my backyard enjoying the sun and watching the dragonflies.  We live about 5 miles north of Gibsons, BC, in a rural area on the shores of Howe Sound.  The sky was completely cloudless, gorgeous blue, with only a sliver of the rising crescent moon in the western sky.  I was sitting in a lawn chair, watching the dragonflies, and observing a small dual prop plane traverse the standard flight path to YVR behind where I was sitting (northwest to southeast).   I glanced back at the crescent moon to my left, when I noticed a strange moving 'object' to the right, in the sky above the house between two trees. Hard to tell the altitude, but it seemed to be minimum of airliner cruising altitude (30K feet-ish), but really hard to tell.  What it looked like was this: imagine the crescent moon, flattened out as if it was a disc on the horizontal plane, with the reflected curved surface facing towards the sun, and the other half, like the moon in daylight, not really visible.  It was moving at a speed normally seen with passenger planes, but it definitely wasn't a passenger plane (WAY too big... and not the right shape). No sound at all (whic! h is why it surprised me, outside of the way it looked), and the large curved shape just didn't fit.  Wasn't a contrail either (not that I've ever seen a 'curved' contrail like that from an airliner, but I did ponder that possibility...  it's the only other thing that MIGHT look like that, in very strange circumstances I can't quite even imagine). I called my son (he was in the house) and hopped out of the chair to run to the front of the building to catch another glimpse of it, as it had gone 'behind' the big tree in our front yard so I couldn't see it from the back any longer.  And of course, it was no longer visible.  Sadly, I didn't have my phone with me to take a photo - though I don't think I would have been quick enough to catch it anyway. So strange. Never seen anything like that before.  We're pretty observant (I love planes and helicopters, so always looking skyward) and I saw interesting lights one night over Pemberton, BC, a number of years ago, but I've never witnessed anything like what I saw last week.

I Saw Something Different. The Phoenix Sighting March 13th, 1997, I Saw Something Different.  This is my story.  It was March in North Phoenix, Arizona.  The Mulberry tree was bare of its leaves, and the weather was chilly.  My residence at the time was at twenty Fourth Avenue just south of Union Hills Road.  This is near the I-17 freeway, and just east of it. It was a cool, clear and quiet night with no clouds.  It was eight fifteen in the evening mountain standard time.  I decided to go outside in my backyard.  I brought my book and book light.  I was sitting in my folding chair in the middle of the lawn facing southwest.   As I was reading, something caught my attention.  To the north, my right peripheral vision alerted me to huge bright lights approaching low and coming right at me!  It was very low.  Immediately, I thought something was going to crash.  Get down!  I dropped my book and lamp.  The chair fell over.  I found  myself lying on my back, my face up, looking directly up at the sight. My view was unobstructed.  It was not a plane.  It was five very large round soft lights, that did not shine down; that glided along silently, in a v formation.  There was absolutely no wings.  There was absolutely no fuselage or body.  I saw clearly the black sky and stars between each large light.  Of this, I am absolutely certain. The five lights were moving together very slow and low.  Each light was distinctly separate and detached from one another.  Silence. The mulberry tree was near the west end of the yard near the wall.  I was in the center of the yard.  The v formation extended directly over top of me; and over the neighbors' yard on the other side west of the property wall.  I could see the entire formation. There were no flashing lights.  There were no colored lights.  All five large round lights were white.  The lights were not shining down.  The lights were soft and white.  It was silent. It was amazing to see such a spectacular sight.  I even waved at the lights.  There were no windows or portals, and there was no body or wings.  The five large lights were gliding together in formation; but they were separate and independent of one another.  The formation was gliding very slow.  I thought that if it moved any slower that it would come to a stop right there in the air.  The silent formation continued on its way south toward downtown Phoenix.  I stood up and watched it until it was out of view. I went inside and recorded in writing my incredible experience in my journal.  That night I thought I was the only one who saw this amazing sight.  I went to bed.  The next morning it was all over the news. The news said there was a report of the Lights called in by a eighteen wheeler truck driver who was heading south on highway I-17.  This was just before the Lights arrived at my location. The news videos showed what happened when the five large round lights in v-formation arrived over downtown Phoenix.  There they were, stationary in the air, at a complete stop.  They presented themselves this way.  Once they had everyone's attention, suddenly they all blinked out. Then after a few moments they blinked on, one at a time until there were twelve lights.  They were in an arch formation with a single light behind and alone a short distance down from the inside of the arch.  It reminded me of a stingray formation with the single light representing the tail. The Phoenix lights remained like this for quite some time.  Clearly, who ever or whatever they were certainly wanted the people to notice them.  It was visibly observed by hundreds of folks downtown.  The twelve lights remained stationary in mid air for quite some time. When the five lights arrived in the skies over downtown Phoenix, they were much higher and appeared much smaller, like tennis ball size.  There was filmed news coverage and many civilian reports.  Small aircraft were flying under them.  Large jets were landing and taking off at the Phoenix International Airport.  News and police helicopters flew around.  Luke Air force base sent out jets to investigate.  Air Traffic control was inundated with calls.  People were out and about downtown and saw it all.  Calls were flooded in to the police and sheriff’s departments.  Nobody had any answers. The stingray formation remained stationary in place above the Phoenix sky downtown for quite a while.  When they were ready, all the twelve circular lights suddenly blinked out together.  Then they reappeared again as five large circular lights in a chevron formation. This was exactly the way the lights were as I originally witnessed them at very close range. Silently, they moved together in the Chevron formation to the west and flew slowly and silently turning north again near the 101 freeway; and continuing north and out of sight. After this, for days and weeks talk and speculations abounded.  There was a town meeting called to discuss what the people saw.  Jim Dilettoso of Village Labs in Tempe, Arizona, digitally examined the video and film data.  It was scientifically determined the lights were not flares.  All lighting was compared with the different types of lighting in Phoenix.There were no matches.  It was determined there were no known lights of this kind, and considered it an unknown. I want to say that what I saw was different and closer than what many others saw. I saw it up close. It was close enough that it was a stone’s throw away. I am a credible witness, educated and I hold a doctorate. I have not heard any witness reports of this sighting as close as I witnessed it. For example, Scottsdale is quite a ways east of Phoenix and the I-17.  There was a woman in north Scottsdale that saw the formation but it was very tiny at that distance that was nearly microscopic.  She took pictures.  All that was in the picture were very tiny dots of light.  This witness and others who were not anywhere close to the sighting claimed there was a fuselage and wings between the lights.  Some said there were windows and beings looking out the windows.  I beg to disagree.  I can assure you this is nonsense. I saw what I saw and I don’t deny it.  This is my story.  This is the absolute truth. Respectfully submitted. PS.  I have remained silent until now because at the time I was in practice and was employed by a corporation.  If I spoke of such things, I would have risked my job.  So I kept silent until now.  Today, I am retired, and I am relieved to at last tell the truth of my Phoenix Lights experience.",2017-12-08T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

The light farthest to the left then seemed to fade like it was going away from me.  I lost sight of the lights just before Mile Marker 77 because there is a big heavily wooded hill that blocks the view of the sky just briefly, but after I passed the hill and regained view of the skyline, all 3 lights were gone.

As we walked towards her building I pointed out how perfect the night sky was, there was not a cloud to be seen and all the stars were shining brilliantly. We took a minute to gaze in wonder at some of the constellations. It was at that moment I noticed a dark mass speed into my field view from my left to right. There was no aura around the object, no blinking lights, no emitting beam, and no sound being made.  I could hear only the night. As the object flew across the sky in front of us, it was briefly illuminated by either the moon light above it, or light from the ground. But again, there was no light emitting from the object in question. I was able to make out more detail within the few seconds dim light was cast upon the object. It was without a doubt triangle shaped. It was just dark as the night sky surrounding it. There were numerous white/opaque circles that dotted the inside perimeter of the triangle shaped object. But again, there was no light being emitted.  Or at least it seemed. To me, it looked like the surrounding light made it possible to see the circles.  It was very dim but you could see the contrast within the triangle shape. Seeing it move away from us, it appeared to be a rather flat triangle. It did not stop or make any change in direction, but appeared to stay on a straight path the entire time. It looked to be at an altitude a small plane would at if it were coming into land.

I was hoping to make it to the bridge over the chowan river, hiway 17, to get a clearer view but it had disappeared, all I saw were some jet contrails which were white as the sunset colors were leaving the sky.

I was at my old house (I just moved three days ago)  Setting up My cameras and Tripod facing south in the sky.  I was preparing for my fifth skywatch that evening of September 4th, 2017, at 12:34 AM.  Since I was have been seeing this Blinking orb (What looked like to my naked eyes) I got my best camera with a night time setting to capture the object. I first noticed the object four nights ago.  It has been moving and hovering around the same section in the sky for the past few nights and I finally got the chance to see what it was. At first, I thought this object was a star, but it was moving too quickly and blinking/flashing rapidly.  Until I finally got a closer look. All it was doing was stopping at times, then moving to the right. It was not a straight line either. It would occasionally, as it moved to the right, move a little upward or downward.  It did this for two hours straight, I recorded it for 33 minutes with my cannon camera. I felt no fear.  If anything I was rather excited to see this.  I was filled with shock and awe looking at it move across the screen of the camera.  At times I could feel my body vibrating and burning from the inside.  A warm feeling throughout the whole body.  A bit of adrenaline, heart racing. I even actually lost sight of the object when I started to grow paranoid being outside by myself with no other people.  I did not know why, but after I felt this I packed my gear and headed inside to view the results.  I write Times and such in a record in my skywatch sessions.  I will paste my written session below.

Might as well do a Skywatch tonight. 12:39 AM Just set up, spotted Blinky in the same sections of the sky the previous night. I'm naming the orb Blinky. 12:58 AM Filmed Blinky.  It moved behind the tree though.  It's in the usual spot, circling the sky miles away from my house.  Maybe just one mile.  The burning feeling is back.  Everything went silent.  I can hear the street cleaners.  Or this wubbing noise.  Freaked me out for a second there.  It's pretty loud. Feeling allot of adrenaline pumping through me.  I feel dizzy, hearts racing for some odd reason.  I'm not afraid though that's the thing.  I hear this machine hum in the sky above me. Someone said ""film"" and it was not me.  I feel calm suddenly after that voice. Blinky moved from behind the tree. 1:14 AM. Filming again, but I switched cameras. My video camera can pick up many flashing lights after I zoomed in in my video editor. All I do is crop it and I see the flashing lights. I cannot wait to see the picture/video results later. 3 minutes in of recording. We have some visible to my human eyes blinking flashing again.  Hmm... 1:41 AM Still stalking Blinky.  I got good footage of them. Still moving. I'm going to head inside now. 1:49 AM I'm inside now. I feel pretty joyful tonite.

Was weird. Dogs were barking... stepdad called me outside to check with him.  He is an army vet of many years and knows the difference between stars, airplane lights and helicopter lights--etc.  These were not any of the things listed.  We counted six crafts at first (either red-white or green-white but NEVER red-green) shaking/hovering erratically...  After abut ten or so minutes one moved to the left of the crafts and seemed to get closer but also fly away... it got clearer but it was flying off.  It looked like airplane lights blinking on the video I took, but as I said, it clearly was not.  There was a distinct triangle-shaped look of the object flying off in real life. This happened again about ten minutes after the first craft flying off.  Then two other crafts, ten minutes apart, flew off in the other direction. THE WAY THEY WERE HOVERING WAS NOT POSSIBLE BY AN AIRCRAFT WE KNOW OF.  It was shaky but stable.  Moving back and forth but then being totally stationary.  Totally unwavering.  Literally not a SINGLE MOTION. Two crafts remained.  We busted out the binoculars to look at them.  They both had an odd 3D look to them--if that makes sense, but I will also add it might've been light refraction because they also appeared a white-ish color from a distance. This was also the night of a meteor shower.  I know this. However these were not meteor-like in nature at all. It was very cold out and we were losing interest.  We went inside.

It also made a loud noise, which I heard for a few minutes after I couldn’t see it anymore.  It must have flew above my apartment, but it was so close, I thought it would hit our building. I was honestly pretty freaked and  didn’t want to be a lone so I crawled into bed where my sleeping husband was.  I was too scared to go to sleep, so I check Facebook.  The first post I saw was a friend posting about a meteor shower in my area.  I think well maybe it was a meteor I saw. Then I get up to my bedroom window and look for meteors and I do see about 5 falling meteors.  That’s when I see the second unidentified flying object, or maybe the same one.  This time I couldn’t see a shape, I saw a red light and a blue light almost on top of each other, and I didn’t hear a noise.  It looked smaller and was flying a distance a way.  It looked like It was flying through the middle of the tree line.  It stayed in a straight line for a few minutes then disappeared.  It was now about 11:00 pm, so the whole experience lasted around 10 minutes.

Around Glendale area before heading into Eagle Rock or so, I noticed on the left hand side up above the horizon above hills an object in the air that struck me as strange.  At first it was going in and out behind things.  The lights were strange, and movement strange.   Nothing like that has ever caught my attention before.  I watched it intently as best I could while driving on the freeway.  It then began following along the freeway the entire way I was going in a basically straight line, perhaps 10 miles?  At times I thought maybe it could be a blimp.  But it moved very unusually, not at all like a blimp moves -- gliding easily at high speed.  It kept pace in a straight firm line gliding along the freeway way too fast for a blimp, and somewhat farther down (lower) than you would expect on the horizon, for several miles.  It seemed almost like it was partially sh! rouded or camaflouged, like it was intentionally trying to be non-descript in its appearance/color, deflecting light. For some reason I had an instinct or sense like the object usually has camaflouge not expecting to be seen, but that wasn't fully working at that moment for some reason. It struck me that if I was a UFO, I would not want to be seen and would want to be camaflouged rather than flashy and conspicuous, so the non-descript quality seemed reasonable to me. I wanted to take a picture or video, but I could not safely do so while driving on the freeway. I kept watching it as a drove the whole way.  I then exited LAKE avenue off the 134/210 freeway into Pasadena, turning left and heading north. The object appeared to change directions almost like it was following me.  It too turned left and started heading north parallel to the direction of my car, just as it had been heading in a straight line along the freeway east before I exited and turned.  I know this sounds od! d and strange, but it almost felt like it could somehow sense ! that it knew I saw it and was intent and curious about that.  It caught my attention because it definitely did not seem normal or quite like anything I had seen before, and I could not explain what it was.  It did not move like any aircraft I know about.  Too smooth and fast, not a typical flight path, speed or positioning vis-a-vis the horizon. It seemed almost casual, like it was observing and didn't think it could be seen, and then somehow noticed I noticed it (though I don't know how that could be the case). I'm thinking possible Jacques Vallée resonant, a subjective, different order component to it.  I then pulled over on the road on Lake Blvd. in Pasadena so I could try to photograph it, and took the pictures attached here with my phone.  The first pic is a ZOOM IN on the second pic so you can see it better/closer up.  You can see where it is in the sky in the second because the perspective is stepped/angled back.  In the first zoomed in pic, the object looks like a shaded circle/orb shape titled partly 3/4 back with 3 round glowing lights on the bottom.  It continued to ""follow"" along side on the horizon up Lake Blvd. parallel to my car for a couple of miles.  I then turned off right to a side street going toward a residence and lost sight of it.  It held my attention as something strange I observed for around 15 minutes in total, a pretty long duration.  This is the first time I have ever felt like I might have seen a UFO.  It did feel instinctively like it was something unusual, and was something I could not explain or recognize.  I would like to know if there were other sightings reported at this same time and area. This is reported anonymously, to add discovery and investigation.  You can feel free to freely contact me with questions, information, or follow up, however.",2017-11-17T00:00:00,34.1593126984127,-118.25281964285715

It was again changing colors (red, blue, green, & white) while hovering stationary SSE of my location, not making any sound, and at an altitude about the same as that of a commercial airliner. I go out to my car almost every night around 12:00 AM to 1:00 AM to remove my radar detector from my car so it doesn't get stolen, and I have looked every time I go out there since my previous report on 10/24/17 to see if this light was there.

So, this story takes place when I was in around 8th to 9th grade, in a little neighborhood near Claremore, Oklahoma.  My neighborhood was awesome, situated in a wooded area, near a field with a few cows.  It had friendly neighbors, great scenery, and an easy road for taking walks. Anyway...  The neighborhood road was shaped like a figure 8 with a little snippet of road leading to the highway.  The houses were tucked in the squares of the figure 8 and on the outside of the figure.  My house was located on the ""cross-section"" of the figure 8, so I could see the road behind my house, to the side of the house, and in front of me (of course.)   One evening, as dusk was approaching, I happened to look out of my window of the living room, and my gaze fixed on the road behind my house (between my neighbor behind me, I could see bits of that road.)  I continued to look out of the window, and I happened to see a peculiar, purple light travelling down the road.   At first, I thought this must have been someone on a bicycle.  Now, this cross section road had a hill toward the end of it.  As I watched this light, I could tell it wasn't a person, because the light didn't bob up and down to match a person's gait.  As the light traveled down the hill, I thought it odd that it wouldn't increase in speed.  I would say it was probably traveling at a consistent pace of around 5-7 miles per hour.  So essentially, the same pace of a person running. As the light rounded the corner toward my street, I continued to watch it from my living room window until I could no longer view it from there.  When I couldn't view it, I went to my office window and watched it though the blinds, as it made the final bend onto my street. The feeling from watching this light must have felt similar to a fish entranced by an angler fish light.  It was small, and the light was a mix of bright purple and white light.  For whatever reason (being older, I feel like this was stupid of me) I decided it would be a great idea to go outside.  So I did.  My house had its own sidewalk, and the exterior wall of the office shielded the entry way and small portion of the sidewalk from view.  By this point, the light was about to make its final bend onto my street, and I was watching from my sidewalk. As it made the turn to go onto my street, I moved to the driveway (it had a huge slope) and thought it would be best to hide behind the pine tree next to my driveway. (this was a baby pine tree, by the way.)  So I'm watching this light from my vantage point, and although I can't exactly remember what all my thoughts were at the time,  I remember clearly thinking about what the light was attached to.  As it got closer, it was more apparent that the light wasn't attached to a bike at all, much less anything else. Now, this is the part that gives me chills.  So, the ditches by the edges of each yard are pretty deep.  My brother, friends, and I would often jump these ditches with our bikes, and even on foot, a person would need to take a pretty big step to get across it.  So the light approached my yard, and went over the ditch...  I was pretty freaked out at this point, because 1.  clearly there was no one attached to this light, as it smoothly glided over the ditch, and 2. its approach toward my vantage point meant that whatever this was knew my location.  As the light started to cross the driveway, towards myself, my flight or fight response kicked in, and I ran! We had a chain link fence around the backyard for my dogs to play in, and it was around 5 feet high. I guess I had so much adrenaline that I did this Mario-esque wall jump right over the fence, and high-tailed it inside. When I got inside, my parents were a little alarmed that I seemed so shaken up, but when we went back outside to search for the light, there was no trace of it. To this day, I have no idea about what it was.  Sometimes I wonder how I would react if I encountered it again.  I also wonder if anyone else has encountered something similar?",2017-11-09T00:00:00,36.33805714285714,-95.60826703296703

I pulled into my driveway at around 6:30 p.m. on 10 Sep 2014.  I saw an object just to the right of my home and seemed to be hovering slightly above and behind my next door neighbor's home.  The object reflected the late afternoon orange glow. The sky was clear that evening.  At first I thought it may be a globe commonly seen hanging on power lines, but then realized there were no power lines in that area.  I could see no means of flight and there was absolutely no sound coming from the object.  I thought it was about 500 ft above the ground and I could see some details.  It appeared to be a small object about 4-6 ft in diameter.  The object appeared to gently sway as if impacted by a breeze, of which there was very little.  It eventually drifted away to the Southwest and out of sight. I went inside and got my camera and took almost 3 dz photos.  Also during the observation, I picked up my video camera and took about 12 min of video of the object toward the end of my sighting.  I observed the object for about 45 min in total (according to the time and date stamps on my photos).  I had to move my position to a different part of my backyard in order to continue to track the object as it drifted away. Finally it became too dark to track.  Also I forgot to take my video camera out of auto focus, so as it got darker and the leaves of the trees moved, the object appears to go in and out of focus.  That was my error. The first 2-3 min were observed without equipment.  Then I secured my camera(s) for the remainder of the time.  When I put the photos on my computer I could see more detail and noted 3 antenna or rods attached to the object.  There is an airport a few miles away and airplanes were flying in the background, but none came near or even close to the object.",2017-11-09T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

Various and odd light orbs in woods and low sky   I am a married 59 year-old woman with a college education. I spend part of my time in a home surrounded with thick woods, at least 400 acres, near Bloomington, Indiana. There are a couple of neighbors about one acre of wooded area away from me on one side. The landscape is hilly with ravines and trees up to 100 feet tall. Since October 2016 I have witnessed countless observations of strange lights from all sides of my home. I have become addicted to “orb gazing” every single night I visit this country home. In a nutshell here are the types of lights I have seen over the year:  Singular, stationary, white light orbs in various parts of the woods, usually from one to five feet high. I’m guessing they occur anywhere from 25 to 250 feet away from me. I have shined a flashlight on them and sometimes I can see a glowing “orb.” It’s hard to gauge their sizes, but from where I stand at the edge of the woods they are anywhere from 1-7 inches. (I’m just guessing. I’m not good with measurement.)  Orbs that grow bigger and seem to shine right at me like a very bright flashlight.  This scares me a bit.  (I’m alone out there.)  I get the sense the orbs know I’m there. The last night of observation a “flashlight” glared at me as I stood transfixed in my long driveway, then suddenly just went out!  I scurried away fast and stayed on my porch. Lights that literally move as though they were eyes and are peering around.  They also wobble and will sneakily move position so that I have to keep moving my head to see where they went. Morphing orbs. I swear they sometimes divide into two or more lights and then sometimes back to one.  They sometimes change color from white to yellow, gold, orange or red. Mostly they are white. Sometimes the orbs present themselves as “headlights,” but their lights are closer together.  I get a bit spooked by these types of lights, as it appears to me that they are gawking around. Lately I’ve observed bright flashes of light that appear like “flashlights” that move around. It’s difficult to explain how they move because they seem to be controlled by “someone” or “something,” but I am absolutely certain no human is out there.  I open my windows to listen and I hear nothing. Large reflected areas in the tree tops. I have no idea what these are.  I have only been seeing them recently. 8. “Fake Stars.” I call them that because they used to fool me into thinking they were real stars. I will be looking out the upstairs windows at the trees and see sneaky little lights that first appear as stars suddenly disappear and move to another spot near, on top, or in front of the tall trees.  I’ve noticed these fake stars only come out if there are real stars out. Last night I saw one on the same night as a full moon.  It seemed to twinkle at me and when I watched it, it disappeared.  I found it moments later in a lower segment of the tree.  Then it disappeared again. I have been able to sometimes catch the lights with my smart phone.  I wish I had a really good night time video cam.  It frustrates me not to be able to show what I see to others.  A friend and my son have both seen at least one orb each. I used to be such a skeptic and never believed in ufos or ghosts, but I have opened my mind to many possibilities. I go from thinking these lights are mystical, spirits, ghosts, entities from another dimension, and ufos.  Because I am observing more “flashlight” movement and am getting the feeling that some of these lights are being controlled by some hidden force I am actually getting scared (again, like when I first started seeing these crazy things) and feel the need to share this information with others who are interested.  Why is no one I know interested?  This is phenomenal stuff happening and everyone I know doesn’t care. My god, something’s going on and we need to pay attention.  At the very least it seems scientists would be all over this.  They know everything about glow worms and fireflies and planets, but they are mute about the light orbs in the woods and fake stars in the sky. So in conclusion of this long-winded essay,  I just want to know what these lights are.  UFOs?  Should I be concerned?

I called ODOT, department of transportation and there was no work being done in our immediate area or near by that the sound could travel. A few years ago, I had a UFO fly over me in the back yard early in the morning and reported it to Mufon.  It was triangular and had white lights.

I saw the “craft” and it didn’t look like the usual plane with trails.  It had a look of red to it and I started to think maybe meteor.

I have seen rockets take off from Wallops Island and this was a different coarse, across the sky, south to north about.

On October 17th, 2017, at 7:30 PM, I saw a bright object, about the size of a planet, sitting low in the western sky with multiple circular lights of red, green, blue and white in the center, pulsating at different speeds.  The object would zigzag, move up and down, then side to side in small increments, while essentially remaining in the same area.  The animals (dogs, coyotes, cows and birds) in the wooded countryside where I reside, seemed to be very upset about something, making a lot of noise.  As I looked up overhead, there were a few more of the same colored lights only smaller in size, a little larger than the surrounding stars moving very slowly (much slower than an airplane).  Then there was a flood of these objects, approximately 50.  With the exception of the animal noises, there was no sound.  At times they were so close together, I thought they would collide. I went to the front yard to get a larger scope of the sky and noticed they were coming from two different directions.  Some from the North and others from the East.  But all were converging and gravitating towards the larger, stationary object in the western horizon.  Some would disappear quickly, while others continued to circle and zigzag. Occasionally some would emit a large grayish-white beam of light in the southerly direction for a few seconds. This continued until I finally came inside after midnight. I am very thankful to be validated by no less than nine other people who experienced the same phenomenon. ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from that area.

At 4:30 a.m., I went outside and began to smoke, and as usual, I face north and star gaze and it was very clear, a little fire smoke haze but nothing bad.  An airliner was crossing the sky from W-NW  to  E-SE  and was north of my location, I enjoyed the stars as it headed to the Eastern horizon and I turned my head to look toward the western part of the sky for several seconds and turned my head back facing northerly again and saw a very bright satellite slightly north east of my location and headed the same path as the airliner, but the opposite direction.  It surprised me I hadn’t seen the hint of the satellite before I turned my head away, it was very bright and I watched it for ~ 10 seconds, and it began to fade in brightness, as is typical. I took my eye’s off of it to smoke and quickly decided it might flare up again, so I decided to attempt to quickly find it again, so I followed the path I had just seen, and saw a very dim satellite, slightly more north of the assumed path.  Here my brain is thinking how the satellite jumped off the straight line path if it was the same satellite, but very quickly, I notice this satellite is in a medium size turn, and not traveling straight.  I thought that this thing was going to head north now in view of this turn, (the turn can be best described as less then ¼ the circumference of a dinner plate at arm's length), and then the most fascinating thing happened, this very dim satellite brightened up and did what athletes call  “the button hook“ maneuver…  it accelerated rapidly in a very tight turn and shot back the direction in which it had come from.  I wondered if it was going to trail that airliner. This was no jet or satellite, this craft was moving at an astonishing speed at the end, and I will surely keep a closer watch on satellites from now on.  Are ufo’s now mimicking satellites so as to be less noticeable, it sure seems like it to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
