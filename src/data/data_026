As I approached the beginning of the hill which peaks at a traffic light just ahead of 109th ave NE, I saw a GIGANTIC jet black triangle, with lights, come very slowly twords me (it was heading west) over the trees just to the north of Jaunita High School.  Traffic was non-existent and it was about 11 PM on a Sunday night.  Upon seeing this thing, I pulled my truck over to the side of the road approximately 1/4 mile west of the entrance to the high school.  It appeared to be no higher than perhaps 75 to 100 feet, and it was IMMENSE.   I watched it slowly move from the tree tops I mentioned, twords me for what I'm guessing was a good 30 seconds.  The distance it would have covered in that time was less than 1000 feet.  I rolled down my right passenger window.  There was no sound at all.  Then, it STOPPED and just ""hung"" there.  There was a slightly yellowish white ""spot-light"" at the very tip, and this was moving around, up and down and side to side.  Then ALL the lights on the crafted shut off for perhaps 4 seconds.  When the lights came back on, it was moving again and it moved past me, then behind me, and out of my sight. I told my wife about it.  I don't think she really believed me.    I brought it up again with her several times over the next week.  I went to my computer 4 days after seeing it, and did the attached rendering in photoshop to show her exactly what I saw as best I could remember.  My wife did a search on the internet several days later and said that someone else from here had also seen it and described exactly what I had described.  I wasn't around when she did this, so I have not read the account, she didn't bookmark it (she said it was on a message board) and I have been searching for it online.

There was no noise and it was moving at a very slow steady pace just right above the tree lines. It was a very very dark night the shape was hard to depict but we got the impression of a triangle shaped craft that was inspecting our vehicle from above. Just as the sighting in Carlise Pa, this craft appeared to have it's lights dimmed but one light look as if it was slightly dimmer, it wasn't the frontal light, it was the back right light. We watched it roll over the hill line and follow the trees/road. As it rolled down the hillside was when we could depict it's shape a little better, A very dark flat triangular shaped craft with 3 lights on the very bottom indented within in the material and dim as if behind a VERY thick glass. It didn't give off the impression as light from a light bulb, but of a sort of light like a butane lighter.  There was another car that was about 200 yards ahead of us but as I slowed down they got further ahead, I am assuming this car had seen it also because the craft had followed the road. I tried to keep up with it but when the trees down at the bottom of the hill got fuller we lost it in the night. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-05-02T00:00:00,,

Alla rapporterna talade tämligen samstämmigt om en kulört lysande avlång kropp som efter en färd över himlavalvet tycktes upplösas i en vit, ljudlös explosion. Några säkra uppgifter om vad det kunde röra sig om föreligger ännu inte.  Translated into English the report is as follows: A light phenomena in the sky above Uppsala created excitement during Tuesday evening.  Observation was reported from different places in Uppsala, in Artsa area and in the Orsundsbro. Both the local newspaper and the rescue service in Uppsala got calls and e-mails about the incident, and the observation was transmitted to the rescue service and air rescue. All reports talked about a multicolored luminescent oblong body moving over the sky which seemed to be dissolved into a white, soundless explosion. Any reliable information on what it could have been does not exist at the current time.",2003-04-22T00:00:00,,

I was meeting my sister for lunch at 12:15 PM.  I was driving south on S. Hardy Drive towards Baseline.  The day was sunny, the sky was blue, and there was no haze or clouds in the sky. Just as I was coming up to the Hwy 60 overpass I glanced up and saw what I first thought was a jet airplane.  It was right above the center of my steering wheel moving slowly to the right within the frame of my windshield.  Unfortunately, the ""sighting"" didn't appear out of the ordinary at first and occurred so quickly that I didn't think to try and take a measurement.  However, from my position in the driver's seat, I would estimate that if I pointed my thumb up, with my arm straight out in front resting on the steering wheel, the aircraft would have been as wide as my thumb.  As I continued to drive, I switched my gaze back & forth being mindful of the road while checking out the object as well.  It appeared to be elongated like a passenger jet would be, but I couldn't make out the specific features due to the bright, silvery glint that was reflecting off of it.  My first thought was that the sun was reflecting off the aircraft at just the right angle for it to create such a glare.  As I continued to look up at it I noticed that the glare began to diminish, and along with it, the aircraft slowly faded from view.  Completely.  I kind of shook my head and thought if the glare slowly faded because the angle had changed due to the forward movement of the aircraft, shouldn't I have had a clearer view of it rather than no view of it?  I searched the sky briefly in the direction it had been flying, but there was nothing there.  Then from the view on the right side of my windshield, traveling to the left, I could see the narrow contrail of another jet (but not the jet itself) high in the sky, as one normally sees contrails when a jet flys high over a city.  (30,000 feet perhaps?)  At that point I realized that the craft I first saw must have been flying much lower because I could definitely see that it was some! type of aircraft, long and shining brightly, however it did not have a contrail…and it dissolved away from view.",2003-04-22T00:00:00,33.414035671514114,-111.92091958939265

It was early sping and I remember this because the trees were just starting to bud and the nights were finally begining to warm up. My cousin and I were doing what we usually did at 15 on a weekend night by riding our bikes to the next street off of Main street to sit by the railroad tracks to watch the frieght trains go by. It was a cloudless night with no wind. We were sitting on a concrete foundation connected to a warehouse just off the road about 60 or 70 feet from the railroad crossing watching cars slowly go across the double rail lines. We were hoping for a slow moving train to come by so we could throw rocks at the rail cars and see the sparks fly. That happened a time or two and we found ourselves sitting there as it got later looking at the sky. We were talking and I noticed in the sothwest a blinking out of stars as I gazed at the sky. I didn't think anything about it at first because I was looking at the sky through a tree in the distance. I just thought the limbs of the tree might be moving because of a slight breeze that I could not feel from where I was sitting. A few more minutes passed as I watched the ""blinking out"" continue above the tree. Then I realized something was strange and I asked my cousin if he could see it. I had to point in the direction and he saw what I was talking about. We just watched as it approached about 30 degrees above the horizon and that was when we realized it was a moving solid object. It had no lights at all and actually was darker than the moonless sky. I remember saying to my cousin at that point, ""what is that""? He said ""I don't know"". It was almost overhead by now and was being underlit to some extent by the lights on Main street. It was a perfect triangle and looked to be fairly low in altitude. Maybe 600 to 800 hundred feet and about about 3 inches between the forefinger and thumb at arms lenght.  I ran out to the rai! lroad tracks to get a look at it as it passed over the two story warehouse and I lost it in the city lights. At that point I don't remember us saying a word but we both jumped on our bikes and sped to my parent's house about a 1/4 mile away where my cousin spent the night. There was no noise and the speed of the object was constant, very slow and linear. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-04-27T00:00:00,35.79657604790419,-80.25426766467066

Followed by weather phenomenon. My friends and I were vacationing in a farm in the state of São Paulo Brazil. The farm was located in a valley between two hills that were approximately 3 miles apart. The hills were covered with tall grass, shrubbery and a few scattered trees. the closest town was 15 miles away and the closest large city about 100 miles away. It was a clear, moonless night with very bright stars. We had a small pit fire burning and the a light in the living room inside the house. Otherwise there was no other light pollution. I was appreciating the clear sky and the quantity and clearness of the stars when I noticed a ""yo-yo"" shaped object appear from behind the hill to my right. I say ""yo-yo"" becuse it was disk shaped and I could see an indentation (as where the string in a yo-yo would go) mid-ship. The edge of the indentation and the edges of the disk were smooth (no right angles). I do not know how deep the indentation went because of the darkeness. The starlight accentuated the edges and flat surfaces of the craft. The bottom side of the craft had a depression (seen as a darker area from the rest of the craft, about 80% of the total size of the circumference). In this depression there were 3 red half-globes. These globes emitted a soft red glow (not like an incandescent lamp, but more like a soft phosphorescent luminesence). They light half-globes were not spinning or blinking. The top of the craft (I cannot say if it was placed in a similar depression as the red half-globes) had a single, larger milky white luminescent dome (it flattened, not a half-globe). This dome was evenly lit just like the red half-globes. There were no other markings or characteristics to be seen. The whole craft was about 30 feet across and about 10 high (not considering the white dome on top. The red lights did not sem to extend past the depression where they were placed). The craft was smooth and the best explanation as to its texture would be that of brushed aluminum, but without the bright shine. It was dark grey (if it was colored). The craft came from behind the hill on my right. That was about 100 to 200 feet high. It traversed the Valley in about 5 minutes and, at the closest point, it was about 2 football fields away from our position. There was no wind and it flew a straight path at an even pace. There was no noise or any other type of disturbance. Had we not seen it, it could have flown by wihtout any of us noticing it. Unlike in the movies, we did not loose any power in the house or experienced any kind of strange sensations. The only extraordinary phenomena (besides the sighting) was the fog that followed the craft after its passage. The craft took about 5 minutes to travel the distance between the two hills. About 2 minutes after it had disappeared a ""wave"" of fog came from the hill were the craft had originally come from. The fog covered the valley within 10 minutes. Although the conditions seem to be right for that kind of weather (cool, clear nights after sunny warm days), that was the only time in our 4-day stay when we had fog.

I pulled in to a supermarket parking lot to view it better, and to my amazement it was moving or ""drifting"" at maybe 1000 feet off the ground, with an amazing span that nearly crossed the sky North to South. It was moving (drifting) West to East, and made almost no sound. It was moving much slower than any conventional aircraft, and seemed to ""fade off"" behind the treeline at a certain point, at which the lights that had been small and piercing white became orange, then red as it got behind the trees. The altitude may have been less than I first thought on account of how quickly it became obscured in the trees at such a slow speed...almost ""setting"" into the forest line. I jumped in the car and followed it for a few miles to a resevoir where it eventually faded off behing the surrounding hills. I had nobody with me at the time, but in the parking lot I was going to point it out to others who were there, only to notice them already standing around and pointing to it. I didn't talk to them, as I thought it would be more interesting to ""chase"" it. Months later, I saw a similar phenomenon near Lake Peekskill, NY while driving, but it was further away. The second one had two small airplanes chasing after it. This one, too disappeared (floated) behind trees and hills. There was an article in the local paper around that time explaining that many had seen it; and they left a phone number for reports.

It was about 7:30PM and heavily overcast with a ceiling of about 1000 feet with a strange orange color to the clouds, which I assume came from the Low Pressure Sodium lighting around the city. I happened to glance up at about a 45 degree angle and noticed a very strange shaped object just sitting there, stationary in the sky just below the cloud ceiling.  It was two equilateral triangles, connected at the tips in the shape of an hour glass.  Your choices of descriptions of the object above didn't include hourglass shape.  I've always been interested in the subject of UFO's but hadn't seen one previously and so was immediately intrigued.  I watched it for about 10 minutes and noticed that it appeared to be two FLAT equiliateral triangles made of transparent glass which seemed to either reflect the clouds around it or project the clouds behind it, through the solid-appearing object.  I ran inside and got the phone to call the city desk at the local newspaper to report it and find out if anyone else had seen it.  They said that yes, others had seen it, about 8 calls had already come in.  The guy said someone surmised that it was some kind of reflection from a petrochemical flair at the ship channel.  True, the color of the object, a strange orangish color that was very similar to the surrounding clouds, was very similar to the color of the bright orange flairs I've seen at petrochemical plants.  However, clouds are constantly moving and changing shape and this object was not only stationary, but fixed in its shape with very sharp and straight edges so their explanation did not even come close to holding water!

I presumed it was another goose and didn't look directly at it at first.  When I finally looked up, I saw a slightly elongated Stop-Sign shaped object (octagon?) with a hole in the middle.  I was a bit stunned and attempted to discern if it was cardboard or paper...perhaps a large kite.  It was definitely not either.  It was black and looked approximately 30 feet in diameter.  The hole in the center was 3-5 feet in diameter.  About 100 feet in the air, it traveled Eastward approxmately 25 mph on it's edge and then made an amazing 90 degree turn moving away from me.  It then appeared to be 2-3 feet thick.  It traveled about 2-3 seconds and then again made a 90 degree turn; resuming it's original course.  I looked around briefly to see if anyone else was around me and of course, no one was.  I looked at it again and it began to make a slight parabolic turn and disappeared behind some hills in the park. The object made no noise during the entire incident.  I told no one of this incident.  About 60 days later, I was going to Seattle (from McChord AFB) with my boss who began to recant a story when she and her family went to Seattle Lake for the 4th of July.  She began to explain that she saw something in the air.  Before she could finish, I described the object to her.  We were both amazed that we saw the same thing.

The object was in the north and it was flying in the eastward direction.  The object was moving to fast to be a civilian plane or a commercial plane at the altitude that I was looking at. I would have seen some type of wings, the rate at which the object was flying was extremely fast which is what got my attention other wise I would have just dismissed it as a plane that was going to land at the airport given the time of day.  The object came across the sky and then stop for about 5 seconds from the angle that I was view the object would have put it just south of the Lancaster airport but still in the airspace of the airport. The object was stationary for about five seconds then started to move east again slowly and then just took off out of my view to fast for my eyes to follow.

I was coming home from a very rainy Puyallup the day before.  (Driving back to Selah, WA) The night my friend and I saw this, it was cold but not extremely cold and not raining. One other thing I observed, was that the object was not a perfect orb. The brightness of it from a distance seemed to be a circular glow, but as we drove closer it seemed to come to a bit of a point at the bottom of it.  But maybe it seemed that way because it was dripping whatever it was...?   Sorry I can't offer more info.     I admire your research.

Our tent was a three person tent. our car was parked about  8 feet away from the door of out tent and our two dogs were in the car that night. The tent door was facing the small hill away from the view. The stars were out and the moon was almost half and located to the back of the tent away from the door side. We were sleeping with our heads to the back of the tent. I was on my back. I happened to wake up as i normally do. As soon as i opened my eyes there was a round bright white light on the centered part of the door to the tent. The light was perfectly round with fine edges and solid white.  It was there about 10 secounds, and went out. I layed there about 20 secounds and it came on again, same location and intencity. It stayed on about the time it took me to just out my bag, about 4 secounds.  I open the tent door and stuck my head out and looked all over, the hill the sky and saw nothing. I didn`t look behind the tent toward the valley, because it was cold and i already had chills going up my spine.  I ruled out the moon reflecting off the mirror of my car and my flash light in the tent was positioned not to shine on that area.  As far as time lost i don`t know. I was asleep and woke up that.  Dogs did not make any sounds at all. The wife slept right through it all.  We came back the next year same weekend and did not have any sightings.

(I was waiting for my husband to come home from work, and after that, he was going to stop at the grocery store. He worked until 11:00 PM.)I saw something move in the sky.(Which was not too unusual, there seemed to be a lot of what must have been satellites moving around everywhere, last night.) I saw what looked to be one craft, high in the sky, moving down directly South. It appeared to be three white lights formed in a triangle, moving together perfectly.  It moved really fast, faster than the airplanes that I see coming in from a far distance, and the lights stayed steady, no blinking or changing colors. I heard no sound, but it was pretty far away. (We are about a mile away from the airport, and see a lot of planes coming and going.) My dog was outside with me, and did not act any different than usual.  It slowed down a lot when it came down further from the sky, and started heading North-East. I was not looking through a telescope or binoculars or anything, I just had my glasses on. It seemed at one point, that maybe there were actually three lights, as one or more would move a little, but it was very hard to tell.  I have no idea what this was, but it was so different from the lights I normally see. If it was indeed one craft, it must have been pretty big.  I was still watching when my husband came home, and was knocking at the front door. (I was on the back steps, with the back door open.) I had to leave to go open and un-lock the front door for him, and when I came back, I could not find them. I just kept thinking about them (Or it..) today, and thought maybe I should report it in case someone else saw what I did. I saw a jet today, and thought of how slow it was moving compared to what I saw last night. I asked my husband how fast he thought it was going,(The jet today.) and he said about 600 MPH.( I think that is what he said.)  ---> (If you publish my report, please do not post this next part, thanks.)I have sent you a report before, and never sent you the picture, as the picture showed nothing of significance, sorry, and I felt foolish at that point.

It sounds from your report as though you are quite certain of the time, is that correct?   Also, where were the lights, relative to your position, please?  Were they to the north of your position, to the south, or overhead, please?   At first, I was suspicious that you might have seen the International Space Station passing overhead, but on Friday night, May 23rd, it would have been directly overhead your town, and it flew over at 10:44 p.m., not 11:35 p.m..  To see its ground track over Havre, MT, please see the following website: http://www.heavens-above.com/gtrack.asp?date=37765.1999230397&lat=48.550&lng=-109.683&alt=762&loc=Havre&TZ=MST&satid=25544 If the object you witnessed was not the ISS, I do not know what you witnessed.  Thank you again for sharing the information with our Center!!  Cordially,  Peter  ((RESPONSE)) Peter, Thank you for responding. Yes, I am very certain of the time. I looked at the clock when I came through the kitchen, to unlock the front door for my husband. The lights started out directly overhead my back steps, up high in the sky.  The back of my house, where I was on the steps, faces South.  They gradually started to curve slightly to the east. The back steps are facing south. I will scan a drawing of its movement. I actually had to lay down on the top of the back steps, to watch them better as they descended down. (It was hard to crane my neck at that position sitting upright, until they came down much farther.) I am unsure of how to tell you position coordinates. I live approximately four miles west of Havre. The night was very clear. I saw no clouds at all. Also, it was not a perfect triangle, it was more of an isosceles triangle.  It was sideways, with the top point of it facing left. Also, I would say the size of one of the lights, was about the size of the airplanes I see from a far distance. I drove to Fort Assinaboine, thinking that maybe that would help in directions for you. It is 4.3 miles almost directly south of us. Thank you for the link. The picture will not load for me, but I am glad to be able to know about this site. I had no idea how many satellites there were! Please let me know if I can answer any more questions you may have. I hope the drawing comes up okay. ~Thanks again~ ((END CORRESPONDENCE))",2003-05-27T00:00:00,48.5666,-109.7389

At the time of this writing, we have observed the sighting for about 35 minutes.  I did call the police to see if they had any idea what was going on.  They had not had any other reports.  We still have no idea what it was.  If you do find out, please email us back and let us know.  thank you",2003-05-27T00:00:00,35.6455391941392,-88.77842673992674
Oregon UFO Review Case:  Bright lights illuminate daughters bedroom window.,Rural,OR,2003-05-25T01:45:00,light,"30 seconds, maybe more.","Occurred : 5/25/2003 01:45  (Entered as : 05/25/03 01:45) Reported: 5/25/2003 9:37:50 AM 09:37 Posted: 5/27/2003 Location: Rural/Unknown, OR Shape: Light Duration:30 seconds, maybe more.",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28930.html,"Bright lights illuminate daughters bedroom window. In the early hours of Sunday morning the phone rang at the OUFOR hotline.  As I put the phone to my ear to say hello, I could hear a young girl crying in the back ground and a women speaking to her.  I said hello...there was a short pause and the women on the other end said, ""Is this the UFO place?"" I replied, ""This is Oregon UFO Research mam, is there something wrong?""  I could still hear the girl crying in the background and the sound in the womens voice was very sharp and semi-frantic.  I began taking notes. She said, in a very matter of fact way, ""Are UFOs real or not?"" The way she said this, rather insistent on an answer with her daughter still crying in the back ground made me think something had just happened at her home. ""Yes mam we at Oregon UFO Research believe there is something to the UFO phenomenon. I hear your daughter crying. Did something happen at your home this evening?"" There was a pause and the women began to cry herself.  ""Yes.""  I asked, ""Is this something you have called the police about?"" After another pause she said, ""we have no police here to call. It would mean one coming from miles away...besides, I'm not sure what they could do anyway.""  I asked her how she got a hold of my number and she said from a quick search on the internet for 'UFO Oregon'. I then asked her what had happened and she explained that about 45 minutes earlier (which would have been around 1:45 am) she was awoke by a scream from her daughters room down the hall. She leaped from her bed and, running down the hall towards her daughters room, noticed a glow of light coming from under the door. As she turned the knob and opened the door the hallway was bathed in brilliant light coming from the room but originating from outside the girls window which was closed and covered by blinds. Her daughter was sitting up in her bed with her blanket up around her body and face, only her eyes showing as she screamed. I interrupted her at that point and said, ""someone was outside your daughters window pointing a bright light into it?""  She explained that the light was from above somewhere outside and slowly dropping to window level and described the brightness as being ""sharp"" like really bright flood lights that left lines through the room as it penetrated the cracks in the closed blinds...the lines of light running from the floor upward where she stood and from the top of the window down. She said the light was so brilliant that you could make out dust particles floating in the air caught in the light. She explained that she ran to the bed and picked up her daughter and began to rush from the room when the light went out and the room went dark. They then turned on all the lights in the house and called her husband at work to come home. As I asked where exactly she was I realized that she had pulled away from the phone for a moment and was speaking to her crying daughter. When she returned she began speaking quickly and in a whisper that her husband had just pulled up and that she would talk about this with him and to please not call her back if I had the number until she had a chance to talk with him about it. She then hung up. I checked the caller ID on my phone but it only said ""out of area"" with no number available to give any indication of where this event took place.  As of this posting at 9:45 am there has been no return calls but if there is and the witness is cooperative an investigation will be initiated. At this time there is nothing to validate whether this event is real or not but it is the opinion of this investigator that the phone call was either real or was the product of Oscar caliber acting on the part of both the older and younger females heard over the phone.  It is my opinion that the event happened, whatever that event may have been.  Eric Byler - Assistant Director, Oregon UFO Research.

There were clouds in the north and I assume it went behind those clouds.  I also assumed that the lights had merged when I caught sight of the light after clearing the trees although I did not see that take place.  The light covered about 15 degrees as it streaked across the sky before it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time above to 20:50 hrs..

Just east of Beloit, the light became larger and seemed to be moving from the distant south toward us. The light gradually became larger and started paralleling us as we traveled eastbound.  As the light approached, I saw a saucer shaped object with what appeared to be ""light showers"" coming from the object.  I then pointed out the object to my husband (who was driving)and my daughter and we all observed the same scene.  The object was still very distant, but had gradually become more visible.  As we continued to travel, the object continued to parallel us, while gradually becoming larger in size.  As it became larger, we could see more and more light showers coming from the top and bottom.  The light showers coming from the top of the object were white light colored and projected from the top in a spraying pattern similar to dotted lines or machine gun tracers.  However, the lights were abbreviated in length and did not project a great distance. From the bottom of the object, similar lights projected at 45 to 75 degree angles, but were red, green, and purple  or ""tracer"" lights.  As we watched the object, we could gradually begin to see a shape.  It looked like an oblong saucer shape with a lighted dome above it.  For a while it traveled horizontally in the same direction we were traveling and we could see what appeared to be flashing light patterns criss-crossing the body of the object similar to static electricity experiments.  The lights were flashing in diagonals criss-crossing from both directions.  The object appeared to stop and hover (paralleling us, but still far south of us) and drop behind our position as we continued traveling eastbound.  However, on several occasions, the object appeared to suddenly move eastbound to a! positio n ahead of our direction, and then hover for awhile.  On a couple of occasions, the object seemed to turn.  On one of these occasions, it appeared to look like a full saucer-shape, and we saw it out-lined completely as red and green lights lit up across the saucer-shape, blinking on and off as they came across the saucer.  We watched this phenonenon for over a hour.  As we came into Milwaukee, the object was still paralleling us.  We saw a plane circling from the northeast, taking off from the airport and believe that someone from that plane surely had to see this object also.

"Blueish-white light during the night over the city of Trondheim, Norway.",Trondheim (Norway),,2003-02-09T02:15:00,light,5 minutes,"Occurred : 2/9/2003 02:15  (Entered as : 09/02/03 02:15) Reported: 2/24/2003 5:16:10 PM 17:16 Posted: 3/4/2003 Location: Trondheim (Norway),  Shape: Light Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27864.html,"Blueish-white light during the night over the city of Trondheim, Norway. Walking home from the student community house I had a break at a busstop to smoke a cigarette and reply to a SMS message on my cell-phone. After I had sent the message a looked up at the sky to see if there was possibillity for snow, I then noticed a light. The light was blueish white, sort of like xenon car-headlights.  It moved rather slowly from southeast to northwest, approx. 3-4 km. to the south of me.  (A guess based on the angel to the light and the apparent cailing of the clouds.) There was no sound, and the route is not an approach channel to the Vaernes-airport, which anyway have no night flights. (The airport are about 40 km north of the city, and aircraft come from the west or directly form the south.)  The light was neither on an apparent course towards the Oerlandet air force base about 60 km north-north east of the city.  The light did not have the characteristics of posistioning lights on any form of aircraft I've ever seen.  The hospital often get ambulance helicopters landing, but these make a lot of noice and extremely rare this late. The light kept a steady pace, and I remember being puzzled that the light did not seem to be reflected from the few clouds,as it seemed to be bright enough to illuminate them.  The properties of the light was ""cold""  like a neon-lamp as opposed to the ""warm"" light of an ordinary lightbulb. It did not seem to have any special shape, more like a radiant pinprik or singularity, if you understand me.  When it seemed to reach the ""Graakallen"" hills (where there's a military radar station) I looked down as my cell-phone suddenly beeped, when I looked up again a half-second later the light was gone. This seemed to have neccesitated an significant acceleration. The time of the observation, 5 minutes, is based on the fact that my cigarette was just a stubb at this time and I usually use about 5-7 minutes on a smoke.  I waited for about 5 minutes, but when the light failed to appear again I went home. I didn't think to much about it when there was no other reports in newspapers etc.  I had only had 1 beer that evening as I had been lending a hand during a tv-recording at the student community, and had to get up early the next morning. Had it not been for the fact that the light was clearly visible below clouds I'd probably guessed it to be a satelite or high flying plane reflecting the sun or something like that, but it was undoubtably not that high.  (The cloud probably being at about 3000 feet.. (measured in regards to the Graakallen.)  The weather at the time was quite crisp, about 5 degrees centigrade below freezing. Trondheim being a quite large city, with the accompanying light pollution the light was obviously quite bright, since it was brighter that for instance the road illumination on the opposite side of the river valley.  (Trondheim being situated along the Nidelven river, where this exits a glacial valley into the sea)  I was located at the lower part of the eastern side of the valley.  Hope the sighting might be of interest to you. I've seen lights i couldn't identify before, but this somehow seemed different. And I must beg your apology, feeling that the report might have been more precise had I made a written record of it the same evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  We will invite him to attempt to confirm the date, since it was so recent a sighting.  PD))",2003-03-04T00:00:00,,

I was traveling home for the evening with my husband down a road less than a half mile from my house that runs East/West in Chico.  It is a road that we travel frequently, if not daily, morning and night. We were traveling approximately 20-25 mph in a Toyota Rav4. While looking ahead (East) down the road and into the sky visible through the trees along the roadway, I saw a large ball of light appear in the upper left of my field of vision.  The ball was larger than I have ever seen in the sky.  I would estimate it to be approximately 1/2 - 2/3 the size of the full moon. My husband and I had just 5 minutes earlier been admiring the full moon and the moisture ring around it. As I watched the ball with a tail travel from the left of my field of vision to the right it appeared to fall or descend to the right lower corner of the field (approx. a 60 degree angle).  As the ball fell it appeared to change in color starting as a dark color (green/blue)with a small falling star like tail to mid frame/center adding a bright yellow back end/tail and a lighter blue/green body, and disappearing with much these same colors. I was so astonished by what I saw, I looked down at the clock in the car right then to note the specific time; 20:22. My husband and I then began to talk about what we saw, and who or if we should report the information to.  I wish I knew what it was and where if at all it landed.

You have a very interesting and tremendously challenging job! I have a whole new awareness and appreciation of the job sorting out UFO's etc. It definitely requires a certain personality, intelligence and integrity.   Our experience has definitely changed our life.  I always thought it was OTHER people who saw those types of things (i.e. comets and things flying in the sky).   It felt really good to know that there are people that we could call after having that kind of experience. So you might pass it on to the powers that be that the arrangement that you have with the local authorities in our experience was a highly effective one from our perspective.   Best Wishes to you. Until next time?????   ((name deleted))",2003-03-11T00:00:00,39.77638902439024,-121.82759634146342

While observing M-44 (an open star cluster in Cancer) earlier this evening with a 60 mm refractor, I noticed a triangular grouping of lights that moved directly across this large cluster, from west to east, as I watched.  Luckily, I was able to sweep the telescope across the sky so as to follow this group for several minutes until it moved into trees to the east.  At the time, I was using a wide-field, low power ocular [25 X, approx. two degree field of view] on a telescope with an altazimuth mounting, so it was realtively easy to observe and track the object(s) as they moved across the sky.  I live in an urban location (Jacksonville) with a good bit of background sky glow.  In addition, this evening there was a waxing crescent moon in the sky, and some light haze and clouds, so that there is no chance that I would have noticed this phenomenon had I not been using a telescope.  What I observed appeared to be three, point-like lights, perhaps no brighter than fourth magnitude stars, moving together in a tight pattern that resembled a foreshortened isosceles triangle.  The long axis of the group was approximatley three quarters of a degree.  While watching the grouping of lights move across the sky in the telescope, I was impressed by the fact they seemed to move in perfect fromation, keeping the same visual aspect and reminding me of nothing so much as the three illuminated corners (running lights) of a solid, trinagualr object seen from an oblique perspective.  Curiously, as I followed this group of three lights in the telescope, there was no observed occultation of stars as it passed in front of them, despite the very strong visual impression (illusion?) that I was watching a dark, solid object move across the sky.  As for direction and duration, the group was moving from west to east, and traversed the distance from Cancer to the vicinity of Ursa Major (obscured by trees) in less than two minutes.  [These are actual compass directions; in a telescope's star diagonal, east and west are, of course, reversed.]  If I had to guess, I'd say that I was observing a cluster (?) of satellites.  I an pretty well used to seeing individual satellites in binoculars and -- ocasionally -- in a telescope, and these objects had all of the characteristis of such.  Also, depending on their height (if they were indeed satellites), the timing of their passage relative to the location of the day-night line for my location seems to indicate that they should have been visible.  Pretty darned impressive, whatever they were! ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have witnessed the three U. S. Navy NOSS satellites, but we have not been able to confirm that fact, yet.

A fellow stopped me while I was heading out the door of our local grocery store here in Houston, B.C. today (April 14, 2003). He said to me that he had his first UFO sighting the other night. There were four witnesses to this sighting. On April 11, 2003 at 8:00 p.m., which was a Friday evening 4 witnesses were just west of Houston in an area called the Houston Estates. There are a number of homes in the area. One of the witnesses saw something funny and told everyone else to look.  Looking south towards the Morice River, from the Houston Estates they noticed the strangest set of lights. It was very low in altitude, and sitting above the Morice Valley Road. I was told the only  thing which could be seen on it were the three colored lights. The witness said it was as if the object was rotating, as the lights kept changing position. The color of the lights were, yellow, blue and red. The strange thing about this sighting is that I was told that the object was witnessed for approx: 10 minutes. Also if one would picture someone making a drawing of a Christmas Tree, (just a simple sketch) this would have been how this object moved. So starting say from the top of a tree, it zipped down and out to it's left, then moved quickly straight back in. ( say  towards the trunk of the tree). Then dropped a bit and continued doing this until in was noted to have dropped a good distance in height. He told me whatever it was moved extremely fast, then would come to a complete stop. Then once again continuing to move at a high rate of speed making the same maneuvers over and over again. The object would have been approx: 2 miles away from the peoples location. Binoculars were brought out so they could get a better look at it,  I was told all that could be seen was the lights, no shape or body to the object. The object/lights vanished instantly after the 10 minutes of viewing.

We frequently see things in the sky around our home, so we stopped and watched it as we drove into the driveway.  It appeared as a bright star (larger than other stars in the sky), and it was emitting multicolored bursts of light (blue, green, red, and yellow).  It also appeared to be rotating.  We decided to go inside and get the binoculars and the digital camcorder.  The binoculars were no good, but the camcorder proved to be amazing.  I was able to zoom in on the object to get a better view.  Originally, it appeared as a bright light with a pulsating pink light in the center which would occasionally emit bursts of light in various directions.  For some reason, I got the idea to turn on the ""nightshot"" on the camera (which allows you to see in the dark).  When I did, the bright light changed, and I could see more detail.  It appeared as a rotating disk at first, and then it morphed into what appeard to be a jack (like you would see in a game of ball and jacks).  After morphing into the jack, the arms of the jack came together to make a sphere.  I got some very vivid video of the image ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to forward some stills from the video, but we are suspicious that the witnesses may have been looking at the star, Sirius.

Only my mom and the dog heard it. Well, getting ack to the tringular objects.... All three of them at the same time flew away from eachother super fast. My mom said it was so fast that the light was still there a couple of seconds after they dissappeard. The reason my mom knew that they all went in different directions is cause they made streaks of light in the sky when the flew off. The next morning in the newspaper. My mom saw that there was an article of an alien sighting that night around her area.

Above the stack, and I believe some distance behind it, I saw two or three red lights. At first I thought it was an airport antenna, but then realized I had never seen one in that area, and I looked again, and noticed the position of the lights had changed, and they appeared to be coming toward my direction. I then saw about 4 more behind them, in a straight line, and still moving toward me. I tried hard to listen for the sound of an engine, or helicopter blades, but there was none. I ran to the intercom of the building, and yelled at my friends to get onto their balcony and look up in the sky toward the foundry. I then ran around the back of the building, below their balcony and pointed up to where the lights were. There were 7 or 8 red balls, moving silently, and quite slowly, (perhaps 2 or 3 miles per hour), some were moving up and down, some would ""fall back"" and the one behind would move ahead. They were not blinking, and again, I cannot stress enough, they were ABSOLUTELY SILENT. By now they were directly in front of us, and steadily moving past us in the sky.I have no idea how high up they were, but from a layman's visual standpoint, they looked a little smaller than a soccer ball (if I were to hold one in front of me). They proceeded toward a nearby lake and conservation area, and we jumped in the car and tried to ""follow"" them, however, they continued travelling (south west to north east), and disappeared over the horizon. We went back to my friend's apt. and called the radio station, and when we finally got through, the person answering the phone said ""Are you reporting the red lights in the sky?"" They  said their phone lines were ""lit up"" with people reporting them. I believe it was the following day on the local 6pm news (Kitchener Ont.) that the anchorman reported the lights had been reported from the southern US to northern Quebec. Also,  he ! said tha t a Regional Police Officer, or an OPP, had stopped his car and got out to look at them, but he claimed they were the Snowbird Jet Team, flying to some air show. However, they did not appear to be attatched together on any surface, but were definitely separate, and while ""interchanging"" their positions, almost touched each other. A couple of them would go up and seemingly wait (hover) until the ones below moved ahead far enough until they could drop into the middle of the formation, or at the back. Some of them seemed to ""circle"" backwards to change positions with each other. I have never reported these lights before, have never seen anything remotely similar (or anything disk shaped or otherwise unidentifiable in the skies), but when I looked at some of the reports listed on your site, I saw a pic or illustration of the red balls I saw, except the ones on your site are in a ""V"" formation, and these ones were not. I'm certain the year was 1976, as I was borrowing my friend's car every evening so that I could attend trade school. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was long and seemingly sausage shaped or cylidrical. The Twilight made the object barely visible against the horizon.  I quickly rolled down my window to listen for any sounds like helicopters or airplanes since there is an USAF refueling base within 25 miles south of location of sighting. There is also an airport in Old Town for local flyers. The three of us observed there was no sound at all. The object then started to move away and up in to the sky with an extreme acceleration leaving a small vapor trail that quickly diminished within seconds. It was no more then a second or two before it was completely out of sight. The whole occurence was maybe a little over a minute long. My son expressed an urgency to know what it was since it had no sound and moved at such a high speed. He also pointed out that there were no blinking or strobing lights like the small planes and helicopters that we see regularly around this area all hours of the day and night.

My 22 Year-old son and I were on a camping vacation, and were staying at a KOA campground a few miles south of Grants Pass, OR on the highway to Crescent City, CA It was a totally clear night, and dark enough to plainly see the Milky Way.  My son turned the northwest and said, ""Look at that light!""  I turned to look, and I saw a oval-shaped cream or beige colored light moving from the northwest to the southwest. It was about 20 degrees to the left of being directly overhead.  It also appeared to be the size of 5 to 10 average stars, and as bright as Venus at a close approach to earth. It was moving in a straight line and moving much faster than a satellite.  We saw it coming toward us, pass us and move away from us, and there was no tail or trail whatsoever.  During the time we watched it, its outline remained highly defined. After it passed us and traveled some distance away from us, it suddenly accellerated and moved rapidly forward and to the side at the same time.  It made a scallop-shaped trajectory somewhat like tracing the fingers of a glove.  At the top of the third ""finger"" it instantaneously disappeared. My son and I sat down and compared impressions of what we had just seen, and they were almost exactly the same.  While we were talking, and approximately 5 to 10 minutes after the sighting, several (5 to 10) jets flying without navagation lights, but with afterburners on came from the northwest along the same path the light had traveled.  When they reached the approximate spot where the object had accellerated and began the strange sideways movements.  They broke and buzzed the general area for a short time, then left. The incident left me with several impressions, but no facts to back them up.  I believe the object was very high in the upper atmosphere.  I also believe that a human being could not have lived through the movements this object made just before it disappear, and the speed was so great that the pursuit jets had no chance of even keeping with with this object.

NUFORC was contacted by an employee of the Federal Aviation Administration, inquiring whether we had received any reports from sources in California, describing a peculiar, metallic-looking, disc-shaped object in the morning skies in the vicinity of Santa Barbara.  The employee provided us with the name and telephone number of the individual with whom the FAA had spoken, a CHP Officer, who had described to them his alleged sighting earlier in the morning.   We spoke with the officer at length (25 minutes), and he described having witnessed a very bizarre-looking, disc-shaped object in the skies above ""the freeway"" in the vicinity of Goleta, CA.  The officer that he had witnessed the object for an estimated 30 minutes, and that he had reason to believe that several of his family members had also witnessed the same object from a different location in Santa Barbara.   The officer stated that he first thought the object might be some type of kite, but then abandoned that notion, as he continued to watch it.  The object was circular in appearance, and it was ""tumbling, end over end.""   He was facing north, and the object was moving to the north, away from his location, probably passing over the Santa Barbara beach.  He assumed that other reports might have been submitted to the Santa Barbara Police or Sheriff, although those two offices reported that, to the best of their knowledge, no reports had been submitted to them. Please see sighting report from Laguna Niguell, CA, located south of Los Angeles, for same time and date.

We had observed vultures and small birds soaring earlier when we noticed a distant object overhead inland. A short time later we noticed it made a reflection from the sun that made us curious.  From a distance it was speculated to be a glider, balloon, helicopter, or bird with shiny black feathers.  Curiousity caused us to bet a pair of small 10 X 25 binoculars, and then determined it was a disclike craft ""soaring"" in the morning sky slowy floating toward the ocean from inland in a general Northward path. We all took turns looking, and it slowly drifted over our location. As it swooped and floated much like a bird in a thermal, we could determine the top was a dark refective shiny surface, much like a lense in a refective pair of sungalsses. As it turned, it was very thin, almost flat, becoming almost invisible from the side. the bottom side looked a lot like the turbine blades in a jet engine, but they were moving slow enough to see. The underbelly was either translucent, or reflected the light from the ground on the surface beyond the ""turbine like"" blades appearing on the underside. I was able to get several shots with a digital camera but at that distance the quality was less than marginal. We attempted to get a video but the camera had a low battery and by the time we got it charged the object was out of sight. It was difficult to determine the size. As a lay person I felt it could be some unknown kind of domestic unmanned survielance craft.  We are visiting friends here and will return to N. Carolina on 05/16/03.  I will try to download the images I have when I return.

Then the ""plane"" stopped in between those stars and suddenly it changed or ""rotated"". I actually had the impression the object rotated on its axis and show other view of it. What I saw where three lights rotating (yellow like) in a triangular shape the lights were round and they seemed to be rotating.The object remained stationary for a few seconds and then flew away like sinking in the sky at a tremendous speed until it couldnot be seen anylonger.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,33.93964338565022,-117.4001158071749

I was bored so I was stargazing and noticed a star and it looked strange along the bottom.  It was pretty far away but the light it was giving off looked like a beard along the bottom.  I asked my son to look at the star and tell me what he saw and he said, ""It's moving"".  I thought he was just playing or seeing things but when I took a closer look, it was in fact moving.  It would go rapidly to the left, then the right, and sometimes up and down.  Then it started fluttering in small circles like a butterfly.  I said to my son, who was amazed at what he was seeing, I wonder if this is the only one.  As I started focusing on what looked like stars, I noticed that they were moving too.  I counted more than 20 of them all around.  The closest ones were in the eastern sky and they would get really close and bright and then pull back and fade away and disappear completely, only to reappear a few seconds later.  Some gentleman stopped to try and help us and I asked them if they saw the light moving and they did, but I don't know who they were.  I snapped a picture of it with my camera.  It had black and white film and I'm not sure how it turned out.  When I develop the film, I will mail it in if it turns out.

There were multiple lights on the object that increased in intensity. The object then moved closer to the house so I went outside and I could not hear an engine or anything. The object conitnued to move in strange directions and would go from hovering to moving very fast across the sky and stopping again. I called a friend over who was working the midnight shift that night. This friend is very skeptical about these things but he also is a flight enthusiast and an experimental aircraft pilot. He agreed that no plane could move light that and no helicopter was that fast. He left and drove several miles towards the object out into the country and later reported that it hovered for about an hour then drove off.

Whilst on annual leave staying in a holiday chalet in a small town in the South West of Western Australia I went outside for a cigarette. As there was little light pollution and it was a perfectly clear sky I stayed outside for a while gazing at the stars when a flash caught my eye. This flash had the appearance of a torchlight being flicked on and then off as it was white and round and comparable in size and brightness to the largest star visible. I thought that it may have been the flash of a shooting star and so watched the same patch of sky (at approximately 60 degrees height from horizon with 90 degrees being overhead and looking in an Easterly direction) to see if there were any more. I saw the same flash again but in more detail and could make out that the light got brighter and then dimmed much the same as a lighthouse or revolving light seen from a stationary source with the duration of the light being approximately 1 second. There was no trail left as for a shooting star and no noise, nor any beam as from a searchlight, the light being in exactly the same portion of sky as first observed. I continued to watch the same area and over the next 15 - 20 mins saw around 4 more identical ""flashes"", unfortunately I didn't time the frequency but it did not appear to be regular. The light source appeared to be at high altitude similar to orbitting satellites I have seen before but stationary and not a constant light. Becoming bored standing outside I went back in to the chalet where several members of my family were watching television and when they asked me what I had been doing I replied that I was stargazing as it was such a beautiful night. Around 15 minutes later my wife asked if I wanted to go for a walk to the beach ""just to see what the stars looked light like at night"". We walked around 80 metres and stood on the beach looking up at the stars when my wife asked me whether I had seen that. I said ""seen what"" and my wife replied ""that flashing light"" and pointed to the exact same area of sky. I still didn't mention I had seen anything earlier wishing not to biase my wifes thoughts and as we were looking we saw another two ""flashes"" over about two minutes. It was obvious that my wife was seeing the same thing as I was and that she had no explanation for a stationary flashing light source at that height with no noise. I then mentioned that I had seen it earlier and had no idea what it was and we watched for around another 10 minutes seeing one more ""flash"" before my wife grew too cold and tired to continue watching. Once back at the chalet and now convinced I was seeing something out of the ordinary I stood outside for a further 30 minutes but gave up after only seeing one more ""flash"". We are both professionals in our mid thirties and whilst I am interested in the edge science and ufo / extra-terrestrial fields I believe I have rationally discounted all possible sources of this light known to me.

During this incident, which lasted for approximately 45 seconds, an airplane flew overhead in a northeastern direction  The airplane was clearly visible and could be heard easily.  I believe that there were three different craft involved and not one for two reasons:  1.  The relative brightness of the lights did not change while the craft turned or rotated.

On Saturday night, April 12, 2003 between the hours of 8:30 PM and 9:00 PM, I was on the (Pensacola side) fishing bay bridge at pillar marker 44 just before the so called ""hump"".  I was facing directly due East with the half to almost 3/4 moon brilliantly shining at an angle between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock in the sky, and looking due south, the moon was brilliantly shining at an angle slightly beyond 12 o'clock.  While looking directly due east, I noticed a large star like object between 22 degrees to 30 degrees above the eastern horizon, and the object appeared to be located near Navare or Fort Walton.  It was flickering like a star changing to different colors of red, green, and blue.  My first thoughts was UFO because the lights were changing in a timely color pattern.  I was wondering if I was the only person out of about a hundred people who were fishing on the bridge that night who may have seen what I saw, so I decided to briefly of less than one second to shined my flood spot light directly towards the object so people might notice the flood beam and gazes towards the direction I saw the object in the sky.  The floodlight's beam could not reach the object I saw in the sky.  Since the object didn't move and it appeared to be stationary, I decided that the object I was seeing was just a large star or planet since some stars or planets do flicker and shine similar in ways of the object I saw.  But the object just described is not the main reason why I wrote this account.  It is what happened briefly two to three minutes after shining the flood light at the object (star).  Still facing directly east, I notice another object coming directly from either the north or northeast at an angle of 45 degrees above the eastern horizon heading south.  This object appeared to be only 3 miles or less away from my position or 1/8 the distant from the fishing bridge to the midway bridge.  This object was also moving at the speed of a satellite and as bright as of the brightest of all satellites, bu! t this object seem very low in orbit for I seen satellite traversing the skies in the past.  But still this is not the main reason why I wrote this account.  What really caught my attention was the fact while I was watching what I thought was a satellite traversing the sky, the object's (satellite?) light just turned off like somebody flick the light switch to the off position once it past my two o'clock angle.  The object's light just didn't dim and fade away like other satellites I seen in my past.  Just about 1 mile before entering Gulf Breeze area, this object just instantly stopped shining its lights.  I seen meteorite's in my past, and those meteorites had always  left behind what I call a trailing light.  The second object I saw didn't have this trailing light for like I said, it originally look like a satellite.  What occurred about 5 to 10 minutes after that event seems interesting too.  I saw three aircraft in the sky.  One aircraft was a passenger airliner landing at Pensacola's airport which seem to have zillions of lights on it.  The other two aircraft might have been military, and I know they were aircrafts because they had their identification lights flicking off and on.  Those two other aircrafts were zigzagging all over the skies as thou searching for something, but they never ventured into the area where I saw that second object where it just disappear in a blink of an eye after viewing it for at least 30 second to a minute.  Is it possible for satellites just to blink out or what I saw that night was truly a UFO cloaked as a satellite?  I don't look for UFO's, and I am somewhat skeptical about UFO's and of most reports of them, but the night I saw this event got me somewhat thinking of what type of object it was that I saw traversing the night skies.  Was it just a fluke incident of nature?  I guess I'll never know, and what I wrote is exactly what I saw on the night of April 12, 2003.",2003-04-22T00:00:00,30.462935377358487,-87.26545408805032

They went back to a straight formation but a few seconds later maneuvered again. It was amazing and we needed to share this but unfortunately we had no camera. There was no sound nor contrails.

Tuesday, April 15, 2003 8:11:46 PM:   As per requested of the National UFO Reporting Center, the following sumation reflects (to the best of my memory and preceptions) the events that happened to me (the writer), my brother and his wife on Sunday, April 13, 2003 @ 9:15 PM. I live in the North Georgia area.  My brother and his wife live in Greenville, GA, located in West GA.  I picked them up at their home early Sunday AM to make a day trip to Albany, GA, to visit with our sister and her family.  The day was beautiful and we all had a delightful visit with them.   Around 6:30 PM we started our journey back to our homes.  We were riding in my Ford Explorer.  I was driving, my brother was next to me in  the front passenger side and sister-in-law was in the back seat behind my brother. We decided to take a different way back home than what we took on the journey down  for our visit.  We took a  road that is labeled HWY 41, a 2 lane road that is very isolative and very rural. The radio was turned off in the car as the the three of us were enjoying our own conversation and dialogue.  Night feel around 8:00 PM to 8:30 PM, as we are on day-light savings time.  There was only scant traffic on the road, since turning onto HWY 41.  We traveled through the town of Warm Springs, GA., Meriwether County and left the city limits headed North West (still on HWY 41)  to Greenville were my brother lives.  I saw no other cars, houses, or signs of activity while on this jaunt, until the event!! This is the account of the event to the best of my memory and through my preceptions. At the ""blink of an eye""and without in audio - visual or other sensory warning, a hoard of bright red lights manifested inside my SUV.  I panic initially for a second or two, then began slowing my speed  to around 30 miles/hour. I, at least felt some sense of security as I had 2 passengers with me.  MY sister-in-law yelled out to me calling my name, ""pull over, are those police lights?""  I looked into the rear-view mirror and there was no police car and no other activity that I could see.  I looked at the clock in the car, it was 9:15 PM.  I could not count the lights as they were many, extremely eradic, strobbing, all apeared to be relatively small, I noticed some had short laser-like beam qualities as might be seen in some high-end disco club,  in short; they were ever where inside the car, except the trunk (I will comment on this very shortly).   By this time all three of us had vocally announced to one another that we were experiencing this event.  I felt totally out of control and knew that I would not have a say-so as to the outcome of this event.  In awe, I knew what was happening was not of this World!!  I looked in the re-view mirror to check on my sisiter-in-law and saw her in a panaroma of bright red lights .  I turned my head briefly (as the car was still moving) to look at her and I noticed that there was none of these eradic, red lights in the trunk area of my SUV.  The red lights seem to be  focused on the front and back seats.  As my head was turned looking at her I noticed the same lights at her feet and legs, the floor board was a hue of red probably from the reflection from the briliant  display.  I noticed the same type pattern of red lights and activity ongoing with my brother as well. The floor board again was red hue as it was in the back seat.  I looked out the window and over the dash board onto the hood and did not see any activity as was being awesomely and eradically displayed in the front and back seat.  This event lasted about 15 - 25 seconds to long.  The event ceased, as quick as the onset, when a car or  motorcycle appeared in the distance approaching the opposite direction. I asked my brother, as he knows the demographics of that area very well, where exactly was our location.  He replyed in slang type verbage the name of the general area,  that was know to him and others in his small community. In closing,  police lights are not red!!   How does red-strobbing and some laser-like lights travel with you in a moving car?  How could they be inside and not outside?  Could this all be a gimmick or circus trick??  I don't think so!!~~~~~I know what the red lights were doing!! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at considerable length, and we found him to be an exceptional witness.  We have spoken with one of the other two witnesses to this event, and she, too, sounded to us to be both sober-minded and eloquent, in her description of the event.

She told me that the red light was flying just over the top of China Nose Mountain. Actually a one point from her location, she watched the light fly over the tops of the mountains, but she claims that when it almost reached China Nose Mountain it rose up rather quickly to get over the peak and continued on at the same altitude after rising up to get over China Nose until she lost sight of it. This sighting lasted approx: 5 to 6 seconds. Just a dot of red light.  (HBCC UFO Note: I know exactly where she was when she observed the light, and you overlook the valley below and have great view of the mountains across the valley from Highway #16. The Bulkley River and a lot of farm land is below in the valley. I did some quick checking and as far as I know, no flights would have been around that area at that time. If it was a small personal aircraft the person flying it would have been crazy to fly in that area, or  to be honest any other area around here at this time of night and flying so low. So what this was, is anyone's guess. Mind you I have had a number of reports just like this coming from local residents over the past years. One other comment I will make on this report. Due to the view she would have had when she first saw it, the light had to have moving at a extremly fast rate of speed. The view of the mountains she was looking toward, you can see for miles and miles from her location on the highway. I would certainly rule out a small aircraft in this case.

Father and son witness V-shaped formation of lights move quickly overhead.,New Orleans,LA,1977-06-15T20:00:00,,,"Occurred : 6/15/1977 20:00 Reported: 2/3/2003 20:05 Posted: 2/5/2003 Location: New Orleans, LA Shape:  Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27512.html,"E-mailed Report:  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness alludes to an illustration on the NUFORC homepage, a V-shaped formation of large, yellow lights.  PD)) I noticed the attached photo on the index page of your site.  About 25 or so years ago I saw a remarkably similar sight over my house near the Mississippi River in New Orleans.  I had a small telescope set up for observation of a total eclipse of the moon that was occurring that early evening.  My father was visiting, and I called him to come see these mysterious lights that were moving over us apparently very fast in a wedge-shape or V shape formation.  But they were out of sight before my father could see them.  About 10 years later, when I was leaving work on Canal Street in New Orleans, I saw a similar sight.  I was alone again, and it was just after sunset.  But this time just before the ""lights"" disappeared from view I saw that they were actually high-flying birds of some kind - probably geese.  I had been convinced for years I had witnessed a ""real"" UFO and would have dismissed as impossible any attempt by anyone to tell me these lights could be birds who were flying high enough to reflect the light of the sun even though to us in darkness at ground level the sun had already set.  But I saw with my own eyes these mysterious lights resolve into something not so mysterious at all - or at least not any more mysterious than everything is all the time.   I'm not trying to convince anyone that the lights in the attached photo are birds.  I don't know.  I can only say that what I saw looked exactly  like that.  I have several relatives who are solid people with their feet firmly on the ground who have told me of things they have seen for which I see no ordinary explanation - things that certainly were NOT high flying birds - a star, e.g., that is very bright and suddenly breaks into several smaller stars that shoot out in different directions and then return to form a single star again!  One of my relatives swears he saw such a sight one night many years ago in the deep woods and swamps of central Louisiana - and I believe he did.  So I know there are things happening that we can't explain in any ordinary way.  I wouldn't at all be surprised to find in the near future that we are able to confirm in some way acceptable to most people that some of these phenomena are in fact extraterrestrial in origin.  But I think we owe it to each other to be as accurate as possible in our observations and to exhaust all ordinary explanations before entertaining thoughts of any extraordinary ones.   Much thanks for your wonderful web site.   ((name deleted))",2003-02-05T00:00:00,29.96590338078292,-90.0784456405694

But after looking at it for a few moments, i realized it wasn't a jet, it was a dark craft with large windows on the front & sides, shaped rectangle like a pack of cigarrets, as big as a football feild or a little bigger. It was flying very low & slow about 250- 400 feet above the ground and it was comming right at us. The closer it came the more confused and puzzeled i became. what was it, i thought, as i watched it. I had no answers to my question just more questions. The windows were brightly lighted and i could see movement inside the craft as it flew over us. It had bright beems of light focused downward to the ground and the under side of it was'nt smooth like i thought it should be, but it looked like pipes & gurters like the underside of a steal bridge, and it had a lot of lights under it. The speed of the craft was maybe 60-80 mph & it made no noise that we could hear in the car.

I was sitting in the passenger seat of my parents' van, along with my Mother and my cousin. I glanced out my window (to the right) and noticed lights flashing in the night sky. I asked my mom to pull off the road so we could see what the lights were. I opened my door and stood on the running board to get a good look at the lights. There were at least 20-30 square shaped white lights all in a row, and each one would light up one right after the other, and move from left to right and then move back from the right to left. My Mom, my cousin and I just stood outside the van and watched this object move right over top of us. It was moving at a speed approximately 5-10 km/h. The object had no other lights on it besides the ones flashing on the front of it. As the object flew over top of us, I noticed that it was round in shape. It cast a dark shadow against the starlit night sky. I also noticed there was absolutely no sound coming from the object as it flew over top. I live in a mountainous area, and this object was flying from the north part of the mountainous area, and moving southward to the open waters. I would estimate the object was flying about 100 feet above the trees. My Mom, cousin and I watched the object's shadow until it was no longer visible (due to the trees across the road). There were no lights behind the object, it was a dark shadow gliding through the night sky, not making a sound. As my Mom, cousin and I got back into the van, we all looked at eachother in disbelief to what we had just witnessed seeing. There is no other explanation in my opinion, except to say that we had just witnessed seeing a U.F.O. Approximately 8 years later, there was a write up in my local paper asking for people to come forward in regard to U.F.O. sightings in our area. I feel that we seem to live in silence with information such as this, but now I would like for my story to be shared with other's who may have found themself to be a disbeliever.

My mom and I continued to watch it for 5-6 hours. The date was January 8, 1996.  I was nine years old at the time.  It was a Monday... the Monday that I was supposed to go back for the first day of school after the Christmas holidays.  However, there was so much snow that the buses couldn't run so school was cancelled for the day.  I had been working on building an igloo an our side deck and was almost finished.  At around 5:00 (this is just a guess... it was dusk) I was kneeling inside the igloo when I heard what sounded like an airplane.  Living nearby to a small airport, I thought it was no big deal.  I then thought I heard a helicopter.  Not knowing what exactly was flying nearby, I backed out of the igloo and looked up expecting to see both a helicopter and an airplane, but to my surprise I saw neither.  However, I did notice something dark behind some trees that were located across the street in my neighbour's side/backyard.  It was hovering a little below the tops of the trees when I first glanced at it.  It then began to move up above the treeline at a very slow pace.  Once it emerged from behind the trees I could distinguish the dark shape of a disk against the slightly lighter sky.  It then started heading straight towards me and as soon as it had gone past the tallest trees it sank back down to it's original height.  It continued in my direction at an extremely slow pace.  As it began to fly directly over me, I remember thinking, from a nine-year-old's perspective, that it was strange that there wasn't a beam of light coming out from the bottom lifting me up off my feet.  I did, however, see three small lights that formed an equilateral triangle on the underside of the disk.  One was red, one white, and one blue.  After careful thought, I have realized (and I'm fairly certain this is accurate) that the lights had some peculiar characteristics.  First of all, their brightness was constant and unchanging.  It wasn't as though someone was holding a flashlight that was blinding at one point when shone directly into my eyes... these lights were ! bright c ontinuously.  And secondly, despite the intensity of the lights I don't recall them illuminating anything else around me.  The disk flew past me and over the fence into my backyard.  Then one side dipped down, like the wing of an airplane, and it swung around behind the house and out of view.  Although it was a noise that initially caused me to look up, I don't recall the object making sound as it flew over me.  A few minutes later I went into the house and told my mom what I'd seen.  My mom ran to the back of the house and looked out the sliding glass doors and saw that it was still in the backyard.  It'd raised up to the height of our 2nd story windows and was gradually moving away.  My mom went upstairs as I started taking off my snowgear.  She clearly saw a row of windows lit up around the rim of the disk.  We continued to watch it for hours as it very slowly raised higher as it moved away from our house.  It wasn't until after 10:00 that we stopped watching it.",2003-02-05T00:00:00,,

The three Sandusky police officers seen a green/blueish object off shore, and it seemed to be hovering or sitting on top on the lake. To say the least, these three officers were shaken, and radio to the station franticly about what they were seeing off shore, right now. I said to my wife, who was still in some sort of ( I can't beleive it's true ) type of demeanor,what happened next. She said the officers got the hell out of there quick! She said it shook up the three officers so much, when they told there watch commander, they were up set with what they had seen, their watch commander, or the chief of police made all take 3 day's off from work. I couldn't beleive what I was hearing. My wife a church going ( non-beleiver, of the paranormal and ufo stuff ) was acting like the world was going to end. I said I wanted to talk with her freiends husband, I had known him for years, and ask him about what he and the other officers had seen that night. My wife with no hesitation said no, he was scared and told his wife "" I just want to forget it"". I ask my wife, what does your friend at the office say about her husbands incident? She said her friend was scared, and had never seen her husband act like that, and that what those officers had seen was real. With an incident like that, and credible wittness like these 4 people, I must admit, something must of had happen that night… ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had a local call today from a Houston resident who asked if I was free and if I would be able to drop by his home. I jumped into the car and drove the 2 kilometers east from Houston to his home, where they have a large farm. When I arrived I was greeted by the fellow who asked if I would come in and listen to a story of a strange event that took place April 21, 2003, at 11:45 p.m..  We sat down and he explained that he was walking home from his bothers place, (which runs along highway #16). As he got to where their driveway meets the highway, he saw a large blackened object (craft) flying very low over top the tree line and across the highway heading in an easterly direction coming from the west (?). He told me what caught his attention to the object was that being a completely clear night and gazing up at the stars there was a large part of the sky in which no stars were visible, but only the outline of something huge and dark in color. As we watched it a number of rolls of lights came on, which scared him darn near out of his pants. He told me he ran the short distance to their home and yelled to his mother to come out and look at what he was watching. Both of them stood looking at this massive object ""slowly"" fly by. All of a sudden the lights that were visible which had just came on, went out. Due to the farm having a great deal of trees around it, they soon started to lose sight of what ever it was that was flying by. (HBCC UFO Note: I asked if they could give me a rough idea what the shape of this object looked like. Both said it looked as if it might have been triangular in shape. How they came to this idea was due to the lights which came on. The witnesses said the rolls of lights on the underside of the craft seemed to sweep back from a point on an angle. (direction the craft was heading - so the front of it) Or to give a better idea may be if one was looking at a flight of geese in a V formation. The main colors of the lights were white, with some green/red also in the mix. They also reported that it looked as if there were three large rolls of the lights on the underside. I also asked if they could tell me the rough size of it. They both said it was ""massive"", then looked at one another hoping, I guess one would come up with a better description of just how big this was. They said it had to have been close to the size of a large jet airliner, or a bit larger.  The sighting lasted approx: for 10 to 12 seconds before they lost sighting of it, after looking around the area where they live I figured that would have been a long time to view this due to so many trees which would have started to block their view of the object. ""No"" sound was heard what so ever. They also have a large dog in which seemed to be disturbed as the craft flew on by so they said. The fellow said the object  was approximately 400 to 500 feet above the tree tops, which was pretty darn low. (HBCC UFO Note: I wondered if the object had made some kind of change in it's flight path before the witness caught sight of it. These folks live right below Mount Harry Davis, so if it came from over top the mountain it would have had to drop approx: 1500 feet to arrive at the height the people reported seeing it at. Or I wondered if  the object had flown from the south, which would have taken it over, or close to the town of Houston, B.C. and then made it's turn easterly. Another strange thing they mentioned. (a little sketchy here), but their impression of it was that it had a large body  to it. Meaning it wasn't so much flat, but more raised at the top of it. ( Bulging at the top, but curved if one had blown up a balloon - They could not be completely sure of this, but as I mentioned, it was their impression of how they saw it).  The Mom said she hardly slept that night just thinking about it, the fellow didn't seem to have a problem with it after it was all done and over with. But I could certainly hear the excitmentment in their voices when they spoke about this event.  (HBCC UFO Note: Last year for all of 2002, as many of you know I dealt with a large amount of reported sightings. But I did not have many, or any come to think of it, these triangle sighting. This year, 2003 I have had a number of reports of these types of objects flying around my area here in the north, plus sightings from the lower mainland. I am starting to scratch what hair I have left on this bald head wondering what the heck is going on up here. I still am getting reported sightings from local residents, from Houston, Telkwa and Smithers of military vehicles which were running around the area after the July 29, 2002 sighting. Actually the first week in August 2002 when everything started showing up. Also what is interesting is, that more folks are coming forward telling me of all the flights that took place in the first week of August 2002 around these areas. Unmarked aircraft, both fixed wing and helicopters. And folks I can confirm a lot of this as I saw many of these aircraft myself. And they all were flying right over the tree tops, just as if they were looking for something. If that the case or not, I don't really know. But I have no doubt in my mind something major has, and still is taking place around the pacific northwest here in British Columbia.The witnesses, or most of them I can say are good reliable folks. Matter of fact even a few of the reports have come from people in positions of authority of different kinds. I also know I am only receiving a small fraction of the reports, as every week I hear of another sighting coming from a second or third party member. I don't bother to report these as I want the actual witness to step forward to give their account of what they saw. But there are still so many who are not wanting to come forward.  There has been a few other strange things that have taken place along Highway #16 throughout all the communities and I am working on an article on this as well. Why this area is anyone's guess. I know one thing for sure, there has been a ""ton"" of lights/objects seen flying south up over and through the Morice River Valley (or road). Now this may be reaching for the stars, but I am trying to think of everything I can to give me a clue to why so many sightings. Why so many being seen heading in the Morice area. Someone brought up an idea to me, saying that the government had closed a part of the Telkwa mountain range down because they transplanted some Caribou a few years ago to the area. Made me ""think"". It may be just that, not wanting the snowmobiles frightening the animals which I certainly can understand, but then again is there possibly another reason.

I have lived in this house for two months. The view is spectacular, and numerous times daily I take in this view. Last night I glanced up while making bottles for my 7 month old, and there were two bright lights above the forest hills. One of the lights was much smaller than the other one. So, I walked from the kitchen and went out on our deck. Indeed something was odd! So, I went to wake up my husband who was sleeping on the couch. By the time I got back the small light had vanished.  I got a much better look at the bigger light. Let me state that in all of my hill gazing in the past there are a couple houses on the upper portion of the forest, and a small pin-size light. There is (and never has been) a light like this. The light was so bright! It was a bright white light that sometimes looked red. It had huge blue green rays that came off the craft that were very defined. The light was a diamond shape, and brighter than any light (minus the sun) that I've ever seen. My husband would not wake up! I finally got him up and he went out and looked and said ""yeah, I'm going to bed"". He was half asleep, and even though I pleaded that ""you know there are no lights there"" his overtime ridden body had taken the helm.  I couldn't find our digital camera, so I woke my husband up 10 minutes later, and he said it was out in the car, but I couldn't find it. He must have left it at work. I even have a 10X zoom, so I might have been able to get a good shot. This is the part that frustrates me the most! I was amazed that I had time to call my Mom on the east coast (twice to wake her up) and talk on the phone for about 10 minutes, wake my husband up twice, look for the camera in the car and upstairs and downstairs before the light went away.  My Mom and Grandma had a UFO experience when my Mom was about 4 years old in Florida.  I had only heard the story once, but they were both so adamant that it had happened that I knew my Mom would believe me! Ironically, my Grandfather had been sleeping at the time and wouldn't wake up. If only my baby were older and could share this with me (like my Mom had)!  I had expected the light to zip away as others had described, but it didn't. It turned off like a light switch. I was looking at the craft when it happened. Let me reiterate that there are NO LIGHTS on the forest top brighter than a pin light. The only thing I kept thinking was that if  this was an american aircraft why was it not moving? No helicopter could have lights like this and still fly, and no plane could hover in the same spot for 15 minutes.  I searched the local paper this morning to see if anything had been reported. I didn't find anything about it. That's when I saw this website. I was tempted to phone the police last night, but what was I going to say...""I saw a UFO""? I haven't even told any of my friends at work. I continued to watch after the light went out, but the only thing I saw was a number of cars driving on the road at the bottom of the forest hills. It seemed like the numbers of cars traveling that road had increased significantly, but I can't be sure. I'm not normally looking and counting the cars. I do usually notice 3/4 cars a night and there were atleast 10 last night.  I was hoping that it was because numerous people had seen the lights and it would be reported in the paper. I was never frightened during this experience until my Mom said ""if you get a visit tell them whatever they want to know"". This, of course, scared the crap out of me! At 10:45pm my baby started screaming and I was scared something had happened. Perhaps I had seen too much? Maybe I was lucky because I couldn't find the camera?  I think the screaming stemmed from a first tooth being born, not aliens poking and prodding my baby. I slept at the foot of my bed so that I could look out our sliding glass window in our bedroom. My protection: a pillow, a golf club, and some water. Yeah, I know, Hollywood is always right! I am totally freaked out about the whole situation, and will keep my eyes looking in that direction for quite some time. Whether I will actually tell any of my friends...will remain a mystery. I hope that others will report to this website the same sight and I can atleast share the experience with someone.",2003-04-27T00:00:00,47.03031595092024,-122.89693098159509

My son and I were coming home from town when we noticed another of the burnt orange lights/fireballs in the sky.  We turned off the main road and sat with our car facing it.  It came toward our car before it stopped (about 1/2 mile away).  It then got very bright and separated into 3 fireballs (all looked like flares - all hovered).  One of the lights began to slowly descend toward the ground, one began to slowly go higher into the air, and one of the fireballs stayed in the same spot.  I decided to go toward it so we could get a closer look.  As I headed down the road, the light that was higher than the other two shot up into the sky and disappeared, the one that was hovering and not moving quickly blinked out, and the other one descending rapidly descended to the ground and disappeared.  My son got scared, so we stopped and looked a little longer.  We saw no evidence of anything, so we went home. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness has offered to forward a VHS copy of his tape.

There wasn't a breeze or any noice other than the dogs collar from walking around.  It smelled very fresh out.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye what I thought was a bird flying overhead. I looked directly at the object and thought that's not a bird...""How the heck is that guy hang-gliding around here?"" I thought it was a hangglider because of it's altitude, shape, and lack of noise.  Then I said,"" Oh my God, what the heck is that?""

I followed the path of the object hoping it would hold it's course and come out the other end. It didn't...I thought I saw it circle tightly and turn towards the East.  When then all heck broke loose. 4 planes came out of no where and converged on some mountains East of my house; where the object headed. Not sure what kind of planes they were. Then what I thought were two jets (F-16?) off in the north headed over towrds my direction in a sort of glide speed. They made very little noise, but I could still hear the jets.  I ran in to tell my wife what had just happened. Grabbed the binoculars and ran back outside, she came outside for a second to look, but went back in because it was cold for her.  I watched the sky intensly for awhile (1 to 2 minutes) and watched for the craft.  , ran into the garage, grabbed the ladder and climbed onto the roof. There were alot of aircraft over new the mountain range.  Two passenger jets went over head slightly west of me (their flight for SFO) Another jet (F-16?) came into view, southwest of where the object first glided over head.

Being out in the country, the only lights there were were my headlights and mere lights in distant parts of the country that provided no real light on the road, simply dots amongst the horizon. I had never driven this road at night before out of fear that I would hit a deer, but left Houston (my hometown) from Christmas break a little later in the day.  So, I was driving with my body leaned forward, slumped over the wheel, watching the road intensely for any deer or other ""wildlife"" on the side of the road.  Suddenly, around 7 pm Central time (19:00 hrs), I saw this silver, metallic oval hovering above the road.  I do not remember seeing any lights on the craft, but I did observing what seemed to be a two-part craft with a small part in between the two parts (see diagram).  And then, I drove right under the craft, and I remember looking up, seeing this craft disappear from the view provided from my windshield.  The craft appeared to be the same width as my truck (a little over three feet).  I am not sure whether the craft simply hovered as I drove underneath it, but I do remember thinking about how close it was to my vehicle -- appearing to be a few feet above my truck when I passed it. I tried to look in my rear-view and side windows, but, it was so dark out there that I couldn't see anything when I looked back.  I drove back to San Angelo and wrote everything down.  I believe in the possibility of UFOs, but I have been hesitant to report this because I wouldn't normally do anything like this.  But, I do believe that I saw what I saw.  I do have 20/20 vision and my windshield was clean from all obstructions and smears/dirt.  I do not suffer from any mental or physical disorders.  I work for a student newspaper back at my university, and have been trained to detail and observe events, which I think has helped in this report.   At any rate, that is my story. ((FOLLOW-UP #1 FROM WITNESS)) Mr.Davenport,     Thank you for your response.  To answer your questions, the trip usually takes seven hours from Houston to San Angelo, and my arrival to San Angelo 30 minutes after the event took place put my in town at about seven hours. However, it is funny you should mention the operation of the truck after the event, because when I got back into town, several days later, the alternator went out on me suddenly.  The alternator was changed out over the holiday, so, the job was less than a month old.  The new battery I had put in over the holiday was also totally ""un-charged"" and I had to get a new one.  I check to make sure I didn't leave any lights on or what have you, but I did think it was strange that my vehicle began having some problems. I did not experience any flashbacks however, but emotionally, I was a little tense at the moment I saw the object and for a few minutes shortly after, only because I can tell you that my overactive imagination and viewing of one too many sci-fi movies sort of scared me into thinking I might be abducted out there in the dark countryside and no one would ever know. But, this isn't the first time I have experienced a UFO before.  My grandparents have a beach house in Galveston, Texas, and some nights during the spring and summer when I am there, I get on the roof of the beach house and peer into space, just looking.  On one occasion, I saw three triangular shaped space craft, grey-silver in appearance, flying in a triangular pattern maybe 30 feet above me.  They had faint white lights on them, but were totally silent.  Then, a second time, I saw another triangle-shaped craft that had brighter white lights on it.  I had taken a police flashlight that my Dad has in his boat and was pointing it into the great dark sky, and soon after, I noticed the craft zoom around in the distance and just disappear. I really don't have any accurate dates on these, but, they were quite a  sight. I hope I have been able to help. ((END #1)) ((FOLLOW-UP #2)) Mr.Davenport, I was absolutly certain that there was no reflection, and I give you permission to include the followup message with the report.  Thank you for taking the time to investigate my case -- I really appreciate it. ((END #2))",2003-02-25T00:00:00,31.2379,-99.8895

It was necessary to focus intermittently on traffic until the vehicle could be stopped in a supermarket parking lot.  At that point, while still visible, the object simply disappeared, leaving nothing but a small and dim point of white light that continued to fade until it too disappeared.  Elapsed time from the initial glimpse until the light faded completely out was less than two minutes. The observer is a 59 year old former police detective who has extensive experience in microwave and RF engineering, and in uplink satellite telecommunications.  He is also very familiar with most types of aircraft including military.  The observer has had no prior sighting experience. The object appeared as a black dot, initially about 1/8 inch in size at arms length.  It was at altitude; although it's impossible to say how high without a frame of reference for size.  From the observation point it appeared at a heading of about 080 degrees and at an elevation angle of around 40 degrees. In the busy airways of the Dallas/Ft. Worth area it would have gone completely unnoticed except that it was showing a brilliant white light similar to that of the landing lights of jetliners but much brighter.  The light was many times the magnitude of the brightest star at night, and was very clearly visible in the daylight.  The object was not moving.  There was absolutely no cloud cover in the entire area. A departing jetliner was in the outbound pattern about 25 degrees to the south of the object appearing to be at around 5-7 thousand feet; but it was not close enough to gain a comparative perspective.  A good guess would be that the object was at at least the same altitude or higher.  There were no other objects aloft that were visible to the observer at that time. The observer initially thought that the light was a reflection from the sun on the side of an aircraft until he realized that the object was not moving, was much higher than local helicopter traffic, and that the color and brightness of the light seemed inconsistent with the sun's reflection.  Within 90 seconds after it was seen, and as the observer gained a stationary vantage point, the object disappeared.  There was a residual point of fading white light clearly visible at the point where the object was located.  This residual light gradually faded completely out. The observer was in the area for about five more minutes.  The object did not return or appear elsewhere within visibility.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,32.96712791164659,-96.71630301204819

It sometimes had red, orange and green lights spinning around the top. A steady bright white light was at the base.  The light was dancing in the sky, making deep drops, and steep climbs, other times staying motionless.  When it appeared the light turned to the other side, we could see the outline shape of a saucer.  At times the object appeared to send rays of reddish light downward to earth.  The light at time seemed bright and focused in our direction, at other times dim and focused away. It was mostly in  the southwest sky, out toward Puntarenas and then south over Panama.  Once the light disappeared, the dogs all quieted down. ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the witness that the object was not a star, if in fact it was moving across the night sky as described.

What attracted my attention was the intensity of the light and the flashes, not twinkling like a star as seen through the atmoshpere. It was about 30 degrees above the horizon and did not move and there was no sound.  When I looked at the object through my binoculars, red and blue or blue/green flashes could be clearly seen. At about 2330, the object seemed to move away as it got smaller in size and the intensity deminished until it could not be seen. This process happened slowly over a period of about 5 minutes and as it moved away, it only dropped in elevation by 1 or 2 degrees. The night was clear and cold with stars readily visible and just a hint of fog above the water of Hood Canal. At 2345, the object again became visible but was further south and west of its prior position at about 25 degrees above the horizon. The object very slowly moved west as if the Earth was rotating under it, but the change in position was faster than the Earths rotation. The flashing lights were still clearly visible. I referenced other stars visible from my location but none had the flashing lights. At 2353 and at about 20 degrees above the horizon, the object again slowly started moving away until about 0012 at about 15 degrees above the horizon it finally faded from sight.

PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter:        I met you once when you came to Bremerton years ago for lunch. I was the person that gave you the article about Bob Dribble ((sic--Gribble, founder of NUFORC)).  As for the object I saw, it was back the next night at about the same time but not as intense.  It was also further to the East and at about 35 to 40 degrees in elevation. I don't know if I was looking at a star or not.  All I can say is that I don't think stars fade out and then return, I.E., appears to move lower in the sky, fades out, moves west and higher in the sky and fades back in.  I do know the sky around here are crowded. In 1984 when the wife and I first moved into out newly erected mobile home, we were out on what was to become out lawn, sitting in lawn chairs just looking up at the beautiful starlit sky when 2 of the stars moved off to the NW (I don't know if it was one ship of 2 moving together) followed about 5 minutes later by 2 more to the NW which was followed about 10 minutes later by 2 more exiting to the SW.        Take care my friend and keep up the good work, hopefully some monetary gain will eventually come of your efforts. As with Billy Meier, it is day to day when it comes to funding.

At the time I am writting this (2150), the craft is still in its location about 2 to 3 airmiles from me and appears to be hoovering above or near castorville, texas. There is a large radio antenna in the vicinity of the craft and from its hight, it appears that the craft is about 200 feet to 300 feet off the ground. The row of 4 lights seem to be pulsating and changeing sync every few minutes. The lights of the city, that usually blink as trees and such obscure their lights, at this time appear to be almost in sync with the pulsating of the lights on the craft. The lights are a off whiteish color and they dim and brighten as the pulsating occurs. After telling my relative about the last sighting, I decided to get them to come and witness.  They saw the lights and had no idea was is causeing them. I contemplated that it may be stadium lights, but, the lights I am seeing do not occur for example, on any regular schedule as with games that would be held on weekends. The hieght of the lights is also to high from this distance to be stadium lights. The size of the lights is too big from this distance to be stadium lights. During the daytime, a telescope sighting of the area where I have seen the lights, shows no type of stadium light stands or any structure. So I have to rule this possibility out. I can not make out any shape of the object holding the lights, no outline or shape of any kind. I attempted to take three pictures of the sighting with a polariod (only camera I have).

Suddenly, there appeared this strange craft, (I swear it had the appearance of  NCG-1701 'Star Trek'). I say suddenly because 'poof' - there it was where there had just been empty night sky. The ship's forward area (the round construction) was glowing a fuzzy lime green, while the rest of the ship seemed dark - that is, no lights were noticed on the periphery. I would estimate that the size of this thing was very large, in that if  I held my hand at arm's length, the object would almost have filled in the space of 4 fingers (thumb tucked). Unfortunately, the sighting lasted for less than 5 seconds because it just as suddenly disappeared -- 'poof'-- again. The craft flew in a northerly direction (direction San Francisco) extremely fast, faster than a normal jet on approach to SFO. I would estimate that this craft was approximately 6-8 miles away, and flying between 3,000 to 5,000 feet over the baylands or Bay. I have a good feel for this as we live on the flight path into SFO, on what the controllers call the ""Peninsula"" approach. That is, jets are vectored over the Peninsula from the SW, flying over Palo Alto at between 3K-5K feet. However, after 11:00 pm, jets usually vector out over the Bay, staying away from the Peninsula area.  (See http://www.uproar.org/cached/SFChron.8.6.98.html for the whole article.) I thought later that the green I saw on the craft might have been regular starboard/port side lights, but that made no sense as the side that was facing me was the left of the craft (I assume) and therefore the light should have been red. But in any case, the fuzzy greenish light enveloped the whole front section of the craft's construction - the round part. Career wise, I am a professional secretary and hobby wise, a percussionist. I am trained to observe and memorize details. I hope that other people on the Peninsula saw this brief passing of the strange greenish glowing craft and will report it as well. No need to contact me.

I looked up and said something like ""What the hell is that?"" A triangular craft was moving across the sky above us at an altitude similar to airplanes in this part of the city (near Boeing field, not far from SeaTac Airport). It had a light at each of the points that was a dim orange and the lights seemed striped rather than solid. The craft was completely silent. We watched it fly in a northeasterly direction until it encountered the city light reflection in the sky and we could no longer see it. Our dog had been in our front yard while we were away for about four hours. When we got inside, we realized that he was trembling and then he became lethargic and lost his balance. He seems to have regained his balance and some of his energy this next morning after the sighting.

Please see other report for the same time and date over the area of West Seattle, which also apparently involves the restlessness of a dog.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter, My husband got home late and is already gone this morning back to work. He hasn't filled out a report yet. I have done an MS Paint document of his recollection of the wing that I am attaching. Again, it is my re-draw of a small sketch he made as he was running out the door. I recall big, round lights, while he recalls trapezium-shaped lights and wings. I recall the round lights, as I said, and drew the wings as round, although I'm not sure they too were. They were definitely not pointed, we both recall (the corners were blunt or rounded). There were no lights on the aircraft other than the three point lights. We think the aircraft was black, but the sky was very dark. We could see the outline of the aircraft clearly. It appeared to be much lower than cruising altitude and appeared large compared to the stars, but not noticeably larger than any aircraft I am aware of (in other words, its size did not stand out). We live close to Boeing field and somewhat near the approach to SeaTac, so we have become accustomed to the altitudes planes are typically at as they pass by our home, whether taking off or landing.  Thank you. -((name deleted)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) Regarding the lights, they were not blinking. They were a dim orange. The stars were white and extremely bright compared to the three lights on the aircraft. They were noticeably dimmer and more matte, if that word makes sense in this context. It was kind of a glow, but without illumination. ((END ADDENDA))",2003-05-02T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

It was flashing consistently and sitting in one spot. I told my mother to stop the car as we were on a back road that had little traffic. I rolled down my window and looked the red light. We noticed that it would move south horizontally in little spurts, but mostly stayed in one spot. We drove home and I walked out into the road to see if we could see it from there. I could just see it over the roof of a house, and my mom was standing a bit farther over and she was watching it as well with no obstruction. I noticed the light drop down a bit, beyond my view, and I thought I had slouched or something, so I stood up a bit straighter, but the light dropped down again. I moved over to where my mom was standing, and we observed it clearly. It was staying in one place again. My mother went to go unlock the door of the house, so I was left alone to watch it. Suddenly a bright flash of light came from about the same place I'd initially seen the red light when we were driving. My mom had noticed the flash, and she said it looked like a plane, but it didn't happen again until a few seconds later, closer to the (then)current location of the red light. The white flash didn't happen again while I was observing the sky. I looked back at the red light and I saw that it had faded a bit, and the flashing wasn't as brilliant.

After a few mintues I looked to the southwest sky and it looked like a really bright satellite moving across like they normally would. after a few seconds I noticed that it really didn't have a geo-synchronous orbit like a Satellite. For about 10 seconds it went behind the clouds, at which point I thought I had lost it but my friend pointed it out when it came out from behind the clouds. As it came out from behind the clouds, it started to drop in the sky, somewhat zig-zagging and moved toward the horizon at which point it was moving too fast and was too bright to be a satellite. Just as it was due south fairly high above the horizon,  we noticed two very faint lights moving towards the main big light at the same time. Right after they started to move together the lights suddenly disappeared, sort of like a fading effect. Didn't see anything else after that.",2003-04-22T00:00:00,33.42771333333334,-88.82782666666667

After putting the kids to sleep in the tent around 11:30 my girlfriend, Gail and I returned to the campfire and sat together talking, and watching the fire. After a few hours we noticed just how clear a night it was and decided to move away from the fire in order to look at the stars. We walked to a nearby shoddy bridge about 30 ft. from our tent and looked towards the heavens. The sky full of stars, galaxies, and planets and the occational jet or satelite streaked across the sky. We knew morning was comming because in the east you could see the sky starting to brighten. The loons started to sing, a sure sign of daybreak. In the eatly morning hours just before day break things started getting weird. I noticed a strange looking light far off in the distance unlike anything eles I ever had seen it seemed to be zig-zaging, so I pointed it out to Gail. It seemed very far away but as we focused on it, we noticed it was comming towards us. It seemed unbelivable it was heading straight for us. I even made a half-hearted joke to Gail about it being a U.F.O but soon we realized it was no joke. I never belived it posible but as we watched suddenly it was 200-300 ft. away it was large and super reflective with lights all around its outer edge that change colors from a deep red to a light yellow in a circular patern and a bright glowing ball on the center of its bottom. It made no noise. It lit the sky around it. I put my hand to my face and could not belive my eyes. Myself and Gail were terified, We were afraid to run and by the size of it, running seemed pointless. Then we noticed futher off on the right and left of the first ship further of there were two more. the sky was yellowish red and you could see the outline of the trees they were behind. We just sat there and looked at it not really knowing what to do. So we did nothing. Next thing we know they are gone, it is no longer daybreak. The sky is dark the loons are no longer singing it is 1:00 A.M. again. We return to the tent and sit by the fire and try and figure out what had happened but for some unknown reason we are not frighted and want to leave we decided to wait until morning. We start to drift of to sleep near the fire and are suddenly awakend by a loud growl/hiss and the ground trembled under us. I awake and grab my shot-gun and take a shot in the darkness. Whatever it was was gone, it made no noise leaving. It may of been bear but a bear makes noise when running in deep wood. Needless to say we left, the Osburn Depot and the John Bull Creek never to return again. we may never know what we say or heard that night but one thing i know there are more thing out there than I will ever know,,,or want to.",2003-02-11T00:00:00,,

Each globe was approximately 1-2 feet in diameter and spaced about 10 feet apart. It took around 15 globes to make the shape.

We used to live 5 miles from a major Air Base in Scotland (Lossiemouth) with a great view as we had the last place on the outskirts of town, so no streets lights or roads. To the point, a huge, bright light hovered above the tree line next to the base and moved horizontally so fast that I knew it was no coventional craft. I got such a scare that I shook my fiancee up (as she was asleep) and she saw it too... (It stayed in the area for about 1/2 hour) A Tornado (fighter aircraft) squadron is based there and we used to watch them take off - what we saw was no conventional aircraft or helicopter taking off... I also called the base the next morning to report it and got a bit of a ""We didn't see anything, thanks for calling anyway..."" I told a couple of friends about it - they thought it was a big joke which is why I don't talk about it anymore. As far as I can see, the military are either testing a secret new form of travel, or we've had a couple of visitors... If you want any more info, give me a shout.

Behind the highschool is a small mountain towards the east of the school it has a single tower with a red light on it and a road that goes up the mountain but the road is in the tree's and is not visible from town. At about 2 in the morning we were walking and I happened to glance up above the hill(mountain but pretty small) and saw two lights that were small but bright and easily visible. At first I thought that they were headlights from a car on the mountain but saw they were much too high to be the headlights and they appeared to be moving around in a manner that looked like they were circling eachother, I said to my friends hey look at that and we all looked at it. We said to eachother could that be headlights? but we all decided no definetely not because of the way they were moving , how high they were etc. after about 20-30 secs. the lights branched off into 3 in a triangular pattern and turned in a circle a couple of times before merging into one and vanishing. All four of us saw this, only one of us saw the a little bit of it because he was blabbering on after I was repeatedly telling him to look! look you idiot! finally he looked right at the end when the lights merged into one and vanished to this day I am pissed off at him becuase all he had to do was listen to us and look but he kept saying whatever you guys your full of shit but how was he supposed to know when he wouldn't even look right? anyway the other three of us saw the whole thing perfectly and this account is exactly what we saw, they made no sound and the way they were moving couldn't have been a plane, and a helicopter couldn't have made those light manouvers.

After a few minutes I caught the familiar sight of a satalite, looking just like a normal star with the exception that this was moving. It seemed like any other satalite I've ever seen. It was moving at a typical speed, it's color was solid white and it was moving straight line in a south easterly direction. After watching it for about 30 seconds it began to cross through the constellation of Orion. It was approaching Orion's belt and should have passed just above it, but not through it. As it passed above the third star in the belt it began to change course and slow down. It made a clean 180 degree arc through the belt and actually stopped just under the center star in the belt. I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me. Then it began to move again, this time in a straight line to the north. After about 5 seconds it slowed and stopped again. I was in total disbelief of what I was seeing. It started to move again, this time slowly arcing from a westward heading to an easterly heading before stopping. Once more it began to move, only this time very slowly in a straight line going south. Then it stopped once more. After a few seconds it seemed to get brighter before it just vanished. I have told this story to a few people who all tell me it was just a satelite, but this was no satelite. Though I may not know lots about satelite design and propulsion I can tell you this. No satelite can make such extreem changes in it's heading. It is impossible. Though some can change heading it is only minor changes, not tight arcs and course reversals. It is also impossible for a satelite to stop dead in it's tracks. There are two reasons for this. First, it needs to maintain a minimum of about 18,000 MPH to stay in orbit, otherwise it will fall back to Earth. Second, the ""g"" forces that were inflicted on this craft are enormous. To go from about 18,000 MPH to a dead stop in seconds would flatten our fragile satelites and liquify any astronauts if it were piloted by a human. Though I can't say it was not of this earth, it did break all the rules that govern it. Whatever it was or was not, I found it beautiful to watch! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Grandfather and grandson report seeing bright green light approaching Space Shuttle from the southeast.,Atkins,TX,2003-02-01T08:00:00,,,"Occurred : 2/1/2003 08:00 Reported: 2/1/2003 08:25 Posted: 2/25/2003 Location: Atkins (near), TX Shape:  Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27534.html,"Telephoned Report:  A man called from the vicinity of Atkins, TX, to report that both he and his grandchildren had witnessed a green, self-luminous object move toward the Space Shuttle very quickly, seemingly from the southwest, as the Shuttle streaked across the Texas sky.  He estimated that the witnesses first noticed the object an estimated two seconds after they had first witnessed the Shuttle in the sky to the northwest.  The grandfather reported that, at first, he did not trust his eyes, and said nothing.  However, a second or two later, his grandson asked what the ""green thing"" in the sky was.  NUFORC hasn't received their written report, yet, but we include below the grandfather's e-mail, which we received February 4th, 2003.  ((BEGIN FOLLOW-UP E-MAIL #1 FROM WITNESS)) Peter,  I spoke with you just minutes after the shuttle disaster on Saturday. You were kind enough to listen  ((to me)) regarding the bright green light I saw running parallel with the shuttle prior to the shuttle's explosion.   I was there with my grandchildren watching for Columbia's re-entry....we watched it from horizon to horizon and I can't imagine having a better overall vantage point than the spot where we stood.  I told you that I would send a detailed description of what I saw...green light, explosion, sonic boom, etc.  But before I do that I ask that you ""hear me out"" so to speak. It'll take about a paragraph and then, if you still want me to, I'll send the detailed story. Actually I suppose that I'm asking what you would do if you were in my position: On May 23rd, 1959, I had a very ""up close and personal"" encounter with two UFOs.  Since that time I've had sort of a ""been there, done that"" attitude regarding UFO's.  I don't try to convince anyone one way or the other, but I'm always very irritated when, through someone's stupidity, the idea that we are being visited by extarestrals is ""debunked.""   Which brings me to the green light and the shuttle. We now know that pieces of tile were being ripped off Columbia over the west coast, and of course that would be most people's explanation for the green light.  I wish I could rationalize the light away with the tile theory.  I've tried. But I can't get my mind around this thing for several reasons. Why was it at such a great distance from Columbia?   Why was it closing the gap between itself and the shuttle?   What could have come off Columbia at that point that would burn such a bright, unremitting green?   And most importantly, why wasn't the green object leaving a smoke trail?   My eight year old grandson said it all when he asked, ""Grandpa what's that green light following the shuttle?""   In any case, you probably see where I'm going with this.  This is a terrible tragedy for a lot of people and the world as a whole.  People are not in the mood for, what they would no doubt consider a quack, coming out of the woodwork.  So my question to you, Peter, is...do we say a whole lot about this now?  Or anything at all for that matter?  It could cause emotional pain to many people and badly damage ufology. It occurs to me at this exact moment that you yourself might think I'm a nut case. So for the ""unofficial"" record I'll tell you this:  Although I don't have a clue what the green object was, I don't believe for a second that it was anything from the shuttle.   With that little bit of bravado I'll close. Let me know what you want me to do now. Let me know too if anyone else has reported anything similar to what I've told you. Misery likes company you know.  God bless you and yours.  ((name deleted)) ((END FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) ((BEGIN FOLLOW-UP #2)) Peter...    If I'm not mistaken I told you in our phone conversation on the 1'st that the green light approached Columbia from the south. That was an oversight on my part...it came in from the north as stated in the following report.     I hope the report will be of use to you. Feel free to edit it for brevity if you like. Let me take a moment now to thank you for the wonderful work you do. I often wonder where individuals like yourself get the time and energy to work their miracles. I am in awe of you.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    In making this report on what I saw Saturday, February 1, 2003 I'm well aware that it will be offensive to a great many people. The loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven has left, to countless millions, deep sorrow, great pain, and confusion. The wounds will be slow in healing. It is not my intention to cause additional pain or hinder the healing process for any human being on this planet. What I saw may have had nothing to do with Columbia's demise...yet it may have had everything to do with it. I'm able to rationalize away much of what I saw, but in the end I'm stuck with questions that I simply can't get my mind around:    On the morning of the shuttle disaster I walked with three of my grandchildren to the front yard of my home for the purpose of watching the shuttle's re-entry. It was 7:45 a.m. central time, the sky was perfectly clear, and we were 35 miles north of what would turn out to be Columbia's ill-fated path. We stood looking to our west, the sun to our backs. When the shuttle first appeared it was quite visible in the clear, blue sky and was, of course, a great distance away. For the first few seconds I saw nothing that looked out of the ordinary. If the shuttle's tiles were indeed breaking away as we are now told I saw no sign of it. I expect we were too far away at the time and the tiles were in too close proximity with Columbia.  However, as the craft came closer to us I saw, far to the north of Columbia, what can best be described as a bright, invariant, green light. It appeared to be moving at a greater speed than was the shuttle, and was clearly closing the gap between itself and Columbia from the prospective of latitude. It did not vary in intensity, traveled a straight line, and more importantly, did not leave a trail of smoke. All of which prompted my eight year old grandson to ask, ""Grandpa what's that green light following the shuttle?""     At a point still to out west, though much closer, the green light passed behind the shuttle and did not reappear.  The shuttle was, of course, giving off quite a lot of smoke at the time although the craft was still, to my untrained eye, doing quite well. But a few short seconds later I saw what appeared to be small pieces of material breaking away from Columbia, giving off a lot of smoke as they slowly dropped behind. In a very short time Columbia was directly to our south. At that point it appeared to explode""...there was a flash of light and large pieces broke away, leaving the trails of smoke filmed by so many people.  I felt sick to my stomach as we stood for several more minutes watching everything disappear to the east. Then came the sonic booms.    I don't know what else to say. Many people besides us had to have seen the green light, although in the beginning it was too far away from Columbia, I think, to appear on the videotapes. The primary questions I am left with are as follows: If the green object was something from the shuttle why was it initially so far away from Columbia?  Why was the light traveling on a path that intersected that of Columbia? And why, when everything else was leaving a smoke trail...why wasn't the green object  smoking?    This is what I saw. I have made my report and now I can start trying to forget the horrible sight of seven good people dying. Through the whole ordeal a lot of stuff was flying through the skies that Saturday morning. Feel free to rationalize away everything I've said. I only wish that I could. God bless those who lost family and friends and God bless America.

(a suburb of Seattle), and on the early evening (dusk) of Feb. 07th, 2003, I was wating for the sky to get dark enough so I could do some star gazing with my binocs and telescope.  At about 18:20 I went out side to check the sky's darkness.  We had clear weather that day, so the sky was cloudless. I could see several major planets like Jupiter and Saturn shinning through the darkening blue skys, but no stars were visible yet.  From the back yard I looked over the top of my house and a bright object was flying at a high declination in the sky over my house.  It looked like the ISS (International Space Station) flying by Seattle, which it was scheduled to due on Feb. 7th.  So I got my binocs and followed it across the sky until it set in the east.  It approached from the west.  But when I checked the NASA ISS sightings web site, it said that the ISS Seattle flyover was scheduled for 19:24 that night, an hour and 15 mnutes later.  The only other thing I can think that it was, was the Russian Supply Ship Progress, which had been docked with the ISS since the Tuesday before, or it was something unexplained.  I sent an e-mail inquiry to NASA about went the supply ship was due to return to earth, but have not yet received a response.   Another possibilty is that the posted times on the ISS Sightings web site was in error, but I never found that to be the case in terms of the times ISS flies over Seattle..  Just was wondering if any one had any infomation on this in terms of whether this was the Russian Supply Ship Progress or the ISS, and whether anyone may have seen what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness witnessed, but the Heavens-above.com website states that it does not indicate those events which occur during daylight hours, or close to daylight hours.  Hence, the object may have been the ISS, and the flyover was not shown as being ""visible"" during the earlier pass.  We saw the ISS on the same night.

A witness called this evening using the new Toll Free Hotline from Duncan, B.C. to report he was walking his dog in the park when he observed a circular object with what he described as a ring of fire around it. He reported his dog was going completely nuts has this event was going on. I asked the witness approx: how far away was the object to his location, he said maybe 4 to 6 blocks away up in the sky. He also said the ring which surrounded the object would twirl around the main body of the it. The fellow also mentioned there were a number of colors coming from it, such as blue, green, etc.. He also told me it would move up and down, when it got close to the cloud cover it would change to all the different colors, but when it dropped back down at a lower level the color changed to a orange. The chap also said the object seemed to take it's time moving up and down, watching the ring still circling the main body of whatever this was. The witnesses dog at this time actually took a bite at his owners foot, as it was frightened of what was going on. The witness was phoning from a friends home and the dog was still acting up. There was no sound heard from the object. I also asked if he could give me a rough idea of how big this thing was, he replied that it was approx: the size of a dinner plate from the distance of 4 to 6 blocks from his location. The sighting lasted for about 5 minutes, before it disappeared. But while I was still chatting to the fellow on the phone he gave out a loud cry and said there was a bright white streak of light from where the object has been observed. He also said a short trail of some of the colors I mentioned above was coming off it as it disappeared. (If this had anything to do with the object or not, hard to say).

I was headed north on I-5, and had just passed the North Wilsonville exit.  I was travelling at approx. 70 mph.  Just past the exit, the highway inclines for a ways, then flattens, and then descends down into a valley.  The Tualatin exit is at the bottom of the valley.  As I began to level out after the incline, I noticed a greenish glowing object streaking across the sky.  The object was also headed north, but was travelling faster than me, and appeared to be on a downward path.  I don't know how high up in the sky it was...maybe 200-300 feet?  I don't really have any reference point to provide a good estimate.  It was fairly large, however, and for a moment (because of the whole terrorist scares around the world) wondered if this were a missile about to hit.  It was somewhat spherical, or ovular, almost reminiscent of a comet, but I didn't think to pay very close attention to the shape.  The object's speed was constant, and it descended down into the valley (mentioned above).  I fully expected to see/hear an explosion of some sort, as it was descending very quickly, but nothing happened.  I was still too far back to see down into the valley, so I lost sight of it once it went below the top of the hill.  When I began heading down towards the Tualatin exit, I couldn't find the object anywhere in the sky.  And there didn't appear to be a crash of some sort (no burning buildings, etc.).  So, I have no idea what happened to it, or what it was.  The duration of time wasn't any longer than 5 seconds or so from the time I noticed it and the time it vanished.  I didn't see anything mentioned on the late night news, nor in the newspaper this morning, so I searched the web to see if something was posted about it .  I couldn't find anything, but I found this site.  So, I'm now just wondering if anyone else saw it and possibly what happened to it once it reached Tualatin.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,45.3084,-122.7799

The lights were under the craft and exceedingly bright.  They were very clearly round, evenly spaced and on continuously.  They did not blink intermittently or change color and they were of a very brilliant and intense.  The size was immense.  I saw an plane flying in the distance and even taking into account the distance I was from the plane, the size of the plane was about the size of a fly in comparison.

Several people from Farmville to the southern tip of Pitt County reported an odd light racing across the night sky.  J.K. Butler, a former Grifton volunteer firefighter, was sitting in the old Red and White parking lot about 11 p.m. Friday. He was there with three fire department friends when the sky around them lighted up, coloring everything from the ground to the trees to themselves a strange shade of green and blue.  The light passed over them, he said. And when they looked up, it was so blinding they couldn't identify the object.  ""We all just looked at each other like, 'What in the world was that?'"" Butler said. ""I've seen meteors and space junk and satellites. I ain't never seen anything that color.  ""It had some good size to it, too, and it was up in the air pretty good,"" he said.  His first thought: the light had come from a UFO. His second: another country was firing missiles in the direction of Pitt County.  ""Maybe it was government-related. If it was, we'll never know,"" he said.  Over the fire-rescue scanners mounted in the volunteers' trucks, calls came in from Ayden and the Pitt County Sheriff's Office. Butler heard patrol cars being dispatched to check for something that had fallen from the sky in the area of Jolly and Abbott Farm roads.  Sgt. Marty Burroughs sent three of his deputies to survey for damage, or possibly, a spacecraft between the Ayden Police Department and the two rural roads. They didn't find a thing, not even a small piece of space tin.  ""The main thing we checked were houses to make sure nobody had been hit by anything,"" he said.  Deputies found the houses to be safe and left the area.  Burroughs had a dispatcher contact Lenoir and Greene county sheriff's departments to see if a craft had crashed beyond the county line. But nothing was reported.  A deputy in Ayden and several Greenville officers reported seeing the peculiar light near Pitt Community College at Fire Tower Road and N.C. 11  ""They just said it was moving and it appeared to be descending,"" he said.  Asked if he thought the light was a UFO, Burroughs said, ""It could have been. I don't know. I can't explain it.  Sheriff Mac Manning jokingly chalked the sighting up to the work of a shiny red sled and nine flying reindeer.  ""I thought it was maybe Santa Claus making an early run, but we ruled that out pretty quick,"" Manning said.  Apparently, he said, the light was bright enough and big enough to attract quite a bit of attention.  Manning said the sighting of whatever-it-was isn't a big deal. Deputies patrolling remote areas of the county report seeing things in the sky all of the time, he said.  Whatever it was, it scared J.K. Butler — and his buddies. For two hours they watched the night sky, looking for something, anything that could help complete the puzzle to what they had seen; whether that be little green men or a plane with similar lights.  He was asked if he'd recently been watching the Sci-Fi channels series on UFOs called ""Taken."" He said he'd never heard of it, and after being informed of the show's angle on alien abductions, he said there's no way he's watching it now.

The sighting lasted for 90 seconds.  I am unable to send the video footage, since I have engaged in UFO research for quite some time, and I value such video.  If you are prepared to purchase the footage, I am prepared to sell.  I have three other videos.  If we are agreed, then I am prepared to work only with you.  Sincerely,   ((name deleted)) P. S.-- Please respond to ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  A still clip is provided by the witness.  We wonder whether he photographed the three U. S. Navy ""NOSS"" satellites, but that is only a guess.  PD))",2003-02-11T00:00:00,,

Approximately 7:30 PM. East hill of Kent, WA. I had just been on the phone with my girlfriend ( approx 7:15 ) who was driving north on 405 near Renton and she had told me of three lights she saw in sky which she thought was peculiar. Moments later I'd left my apartment and was walking to the laundry room with my laundry. The skies were very clear. I heard a sound which was like a high pitch whirr mixed with a low resonating hum...I thought the sound was coming from the laundry room. Just then I watched a large black triangle gliding above the trees just to the east of me and maybe a 1000 ft up or so. It was as big or bigger than a 747 but moving half as fast as one that close might be moving. It was only a couple blocks to the east but still pretty much overhead and I clearly saw the dome shaped white lights on each corner and a red light in the middle. The red light may have been rotating or maybe a smokey half dome shape was over it rotating. I could tell the sound was coming from it but was weird, kind of resonating. Not a very loud sound either, and not one I've heard before. I watched it gliding north behind the trees and staying smooth and steady. As it moved away I could discern the thickness of the craft. Gliding overhead took about 5 or 6 seconds I'd guess, but I continued to watch it through the trees for maybe 20 seconds. After putting my laundry in, I went back to my car and drove around up on the hill a little but it was gone from sight by then. I don't see how hundreds of people didn't see that. I believe the triangle was equilateral in shape. I observed many airplanes after that, not even the same. The white lights on the corners were steady and bright, but not necessarily ""unearthly"". The object didn't seem to be affected by gravity, I had no impression it had weight. I attached a photoshop rendering of what I saw against the type of night sky that evening. I also attached a map showing it's approximate location and direction. My girlfriend's sighting put the lights north of my location about ten minutes earlier, yet I saw the objec! t headin g north towards her location. Either it had gone south and turned around or there may have been more than one out that night. Earlier in the evening, the freeway had been blocked by police activity (south of this location in Federal Way) involving a car chase and then the search for two suspects which had escaped on foot. By this time of the evening, the search had just been called off, the suspects had escaped. This might be relevant to the assumption that the black triangle is a surveillance craft.",2003-02-11T00:00:00,47.38164504608295,-122.19678513824886

The lower group consisted of six lights more tightly grouped at about 15 degrees above the horizon.  The general location of all the lights was 70 degrees east of magnetic north.  All the lights were were moving slowly in random directions.  All the lights were identical in color and the color was orange-yellow.  The lights looked like bright stars in appearance.  Not as bright as some of the brighter planets on a clear night, but nearly so.  Also, all nine lights were identical in brightness. The lights twinkled in appearance as stars do, and they had no discernable shape other than a point of light.  I looked at the lights with a set of binoculars to try to determine a shape and found no change other than being slightly brighter in appearance with less twinkling.  Twice I saw other fainter lights dropping from the larger-brighter lights.  As the viewing period progressed the two groups of lights moved together as one group oriented somewhat vertically on the horizon.  One by one each light vanished toward the end of the viewing period. None of these lights behaved like an aircraft or meteor.  They appeared to be hovering and moving up, down, and sideways in a random fashion.  All nine lights behaved independantly of one another. Witnesses:  Three adults and four children.

PD)) ((COPIED TEXT FROM http://anomalies.bravepages.com)) Written Report of UFO Sighting by Rod Brock I was sitting out on my patio, smoking my pipe. The weather was clear and cold. The atmosphere was very stable and the starlight was very steady ( the ""seeing"" was ""good""). I had gotten into that sort of meditative state that some pipe smokers may be able to relate to, puffing away on a Christmas present of ""Sweet Killarney"" tobacco from Ireland. I wasn't thinking anything in particular - just relaxing, periodically looking up at the stars. I heard the faint rumble of a jet airliner above, which is common around here, as I live beneath the flight path of airliners on their way into the Vancouver, B.C. International Airport, about 50 miles distant. Absently mindedly, I looked up... I saw the airliner, with its landing lights on, traveling the same course that airlines always travel over my house - towards the northwest. But -- and from this point on it is difficult to describe my feelings -- there was something else there, moving in an almost due-west direction. The immediate feeling was a sense of unreality, and a kind of boggled amazement, at what I saw. My brain took a few seconds to process what I was seeing. It was a brilliant, vivid orange light on a westerly heading, moving at a tangent to the airliner's northwesterly heading. The object was several orders of brightness greater than Venus at her brightest (Venus =~-4.0), but it is difficult for me to assign a visual magnitude to this, as I have no basis for estimating point sources of brightness greater than Venus, since Venus is the singly most brilliant (apparent) point source in the night sky. ""Brighter than -4.0"" is the best I can do.  On first sighting, the apparent separation of the anomaly and the airliner was perhaps 5 degrees, with steadily increasing separation thereafter...however, I did not focus on the airliner...  I jumped up, and stood stock still staring at the object. It was like my brain was trying to make sense of it...because, in addition to the brilliant orange light, there was something above it, moving with it - attached, unattached...? I can't say. This ""something"" moving with the light had a startling appearance - cigar shaped, fully 1/2 degree in length, and it was rotating slowly in a clockwise direction, so that I was looking at its axis of rotation, around its center, like looking head on at a slowly rotating airplane propeller. This rotating object was sort of...ghostly in appearance...it had a faint orange luminosity, yet parts of it seemed dark, and the orange luminosity seemed to shift around as it rotated. It was situated a couple of degrees above the bright orange light, but the two anomalies were moving perfectly in tandem, as if connected. My mind, almost unbidden, started flashing through possibilities. The first thing that flashed through my mind was reentering space debris. But that was not it - I have seen the reentry of a spent Russian booster, which, while spectacular, was nothing like this...with the solitary bright light, and the rotating object above that, this was just too ""mechanical"" seeming. Not chaotic and fragmenting like a reentering piece of space junk. Furthermore, it was traveling on a due- west course (as opposed to the characteristic due-east path of man-made spacecraft ). The second thought that raced through my mind was that it might be an aircraft, at altitude, which had experienced a catastrophic failure of some sort. For a moment, I thought this was what I was seeing: a fuselage in pieces, burning, tumbling down out of the night sky. The immediate gut level reaction was curious - a brief feeling of relief that it was finally identified, followed by the sick feeling that would accompany the viewing of an aircraft falling out of the sky on fire. Momentarily, however, both my impromptu hypotheses were banished because, about 3 degrees directly above Alpha Pegasi, the bright light abruptly stopped [30 seconds from first sighting], and when it stopped I could no longer see the rotating object, but the brilliant light remained, orange in color, and sharp (not diffuse, but rather, starlike). It remained stationary for [approximately 15 seconds], and then it began to backtrack along its original course, moving very slowly. The rotating object was no longer visible - only the light. However, as I continued to observe it in this ascending course, I saw that it was manifesting a left-to-right, right-to-left swaying motion, perhaps a degree or two in either direction, that called to mind the image of a LEAF FALLING UPWARDS. I began to feel very strange -- almost fearful -- as I realized that the left-to-right, right-to-left stops and starts were very precise and mechanical...zip-zip-zip. It reminded me of the way a hummingbird flies. At this point I realized I was trembling (not from the cold) and I heard my voice say ""Jesus Christ..."" [ falling leaf motion manifested for 15-20 seconds] [~1 minute into sighting] Suddenly the object began to move in a more conventional manner, slowly following an arcing course towards Cassiopeia. Briefly the object passed behind the top of a tall fir tree, where I could see it off and on through the branches. At this point, I suddenly decided to run (literally RAN) for my binoculars. It took about [20 seconds] to get them and get back outside. [~1 minute 20 seconds into sighting] When I returned, the object was still there, moving along towards Cassiopeia. I raised the binoculars (10 x 50mm) to my eyes and got the object into focus. Now, it appeared to be a solitary, cigar shaped object, I would estimate between .25 deg<[length]<.50 deg, and inclined so that the bright light, which was on the left end, was lower than the diffusely glowing right end. The object was still in motion, and as I watched it through binoculars, the right end swung further upwards, so that the ""cigar"" was now perpendicular with respect to the horizon. As in the case of the rotating object that had previously been visible, the diffuse light seemed to shift around on the object as it changed its orientation. At this point, the object was located about 10-12 degrees beneath Beta Casseiopeia, and still moving, slowly.[25 seconds of binocular observation]. [~1 minute 45 seconds into sighting] Abruptly, I decided to call my girlfriend and tell her what I was seeing - I popped through the patio door into the kitchen, grabbed the handset, and hopped back out onto the patio. This only took a few seconds, and I did not dial immediately, but continued watching the object move (without binoculars, now, although they were hanging around my neck). The object had reached, roughly, the center of the constellation of Cepheus when suddenly, in a downwards direction, perpendicular to the horizon, it emitted, very rapidly, a solitary white starlike object of about 2nd magnitude that descended about 10 degrees and winked out. As it emitted this starlike object the bright ""mother"" appeared to fade slightly, and then it brightened once again to its former luminosity. A few seconds passed, and it suddenly emitted another starlike object, identical to the first, which also descended about 10 degrees and winked out. As it emitted this object, the light seemed to flicker (it reminded me of the way a fluorescent lamp flutters when you first turn it on)and then it simply disappeared from view. It was simply gone. [final phase of observation 30-45 seconds] [~2 minutes 30 seconds, total observing time, ± 15 seconds] I called my girlfriend, immediately got a time check from her, and yammered excitedly to her about it. She was very interested, but calm, and, knowing my involvement with ufology, told me I should write a report immediately (which I was going to do, anyway).  So, I carefully reconstructed what had happened, judging various elements of the account by recreating where I had been standing at various points throughout the observation, which stars the object had passed in front of, and testing that against where the object had been situated above/behind the sillhouettes of nearby trees. I timed how long it took me to run in the house and grab the binoculars from a drawer in my bedroom, and run back outside, discarding the lens-caps willy-nilly as I went. And so on. In this manner, I worked out the approximate lengths of different phases of the account, and then established a range for the duration of the account, to allow for errors in my estimation of how long the total time of the observation was (3 min.>[duration]>2 min.) After doing this, I stepped outside for a moment, found my abandoned pipe, and relit it, looking up at the sky. A minute or two had passed, when at zenith I saw a ""star"" of second magnitude blink into existence for about 2 seconds, and blink back out. No movement was apparent. It occured to me this might have been an iridium flare, but I have no such certainty - I will need to look into that possibility. I found it strange enough after the earlier event to once again call my girlfriend and tell her about it. I have created ""snapshot"" starmaps, showing the direction I was looking, my long./lat., and the appropriate date and time. For this purpose I utilized ""Your Sky"" online software. I also created computer graphical ""sketches"" utilizing Adobe Photostudio and MS Paint. BACK",2003-02-11T00:00:00,48.74688634868421,-122.44462006578947

I said a tower.  He said, no they are moving but very slowly.  There were three at the time.  As we passed two, the third was hovering above a house and I still said it was a tower.  So he pulled the car to the side of I71 north and we sat there.  We then witnessed this aircraft turn and fly away slowly and then circle back around.  Then we saw more come from a distance. They started out looking like a bright light.  Once they got closer, we could clearly see two big white lights that were close together.  We watched as they just circled around very slowly in about a 2 mile radius.  We could see smaller lights as they turned around and a red non-flashing light in the back.  Some would hover for several minutes.  They could turn 180 degrees in the hovering position.  Then one came towards our car as it circled this area.  I rolled down my window, it was only 800-1000 feet up, I could hear it.  It sounded like a very quiet slow moving jet.  Although, to low and to slow for a jet.  My contacts are not clear enough to get a good view of the details, it just looked like the main body part of the aircraft was also slightly illuminated.  However, my husband has 20/15 vision.  After a total of 15 minutes, we drove on and continued to se another 6 aircrafts (?)in the next 10 miles.  All were slowly flying south.  Towards the area where we were watching the others.  One of the six flew right above our car.  This time, I held the wheel while my husband was watching out the window.  I got a totally clear view of the bottom of one.  Again, it was only about 800 feet above.  It's hard to describe the picture he drew.  It is triangular with delta like wings.  There were three lights accross the bottom with a red one in the middle.  ( this is looking straight up from underneath)He also said the main part of the body was kind of lit up.  I called my local Meteorologist and he called the national weather servic! e in Wil limington (which is real close by).  They said that Wright Patterson airforce base does alot of flight patterns around there.  And also Airbourne Express has a terminal nearby.  These were not jets.

We walked into his breezeway and heard the sound of a low flying airplane so we went out and looked up. We saw what appeared to be an airplane except it had a light sitting on something about 10 feet from the fuslage.It had three lights one in the front and back also they were red white and blue. You may think so what you saw a plane with its landing gear down and if I would have looked down right after I saw it I would have agreed but I kept looking. The plane was flying toward me when it stopped hovered went a little higher and BACKED UP!!!!. It di this numerous times and we got my friends mom and she saw it too. After it did it a lot it was rather high and then it dropped sudenly and hovered where it started then it flew away. I thought I was crazy but the next day I was at school and aI told a friend I saw something weird (thats all I said) and he gave me the same description saying he saw it too! along with his dad. I am 15 and am not crazy but could this really be an alien space craft? I need more information.,2003-02-05T00:00:00,39.0863,-84.017

Altitude; Approx; 20,000 to 30,000 feet estimated Weather; Partly cloudy, temp 48 degrees. Distance; Approx. 2 miles Witnesses; 2//sighted from N. Portland Rd and Haysville Rd. Salem, or. (((Object Video Taped for abt 45 sec.)))) Witness description of the object was cylintrical shape, round and long, brightly lit colors of orange/yellow. Object emitted a flame out the rear of the craft unlike any normal commercial a/c would do, to the extent of 6-7 times the length of the object itself. Again witness described the object as rounded cylinder tube shape, dark grey, which was noticed through his Canon Video cam, which had a zoom of 800X power. Witness also claims that object was moving across the horizon faster than a normal commercial a/c would fly, going from the North to the South abt 20 degrees off the horizon at a very high rate of speed. Witness called several law enforcement agencies, and some news stations, KPTV Fox News aired the tape abt 6 am on the 23rd of Jan. 2003, they still have the original tape, which will be returned to witness soon. I have asked the witness for a copy of the video which will be availible soon. Witness also stated showing the video tape of this strange object to local Military Reserve troops, and their claims were that they could not identify what kind or if the object was any a/c they could identify, and they were as curious as to what it was as the witness.

black equilateral triangle with 3 glowing white dome lights at tips... directly above my car,Kingston,ON,2003-01-24T18:13:00,triangle,approx. 2 min.,"Occurred : 1/24/2003 18:13  (Entered as : 01/24/03 18:13) Reported: 1/31/2003 9:27:20 AM 09:27 Posted: 2/5/2003 Location: Kingston (Canada), ON Shape: Triangle Duration:approx. 2 min.",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27412.html,"black equilateral triangle with 3 glowing white dome lights at tips... directly above my car On Friday evening, January 24, 2003, I was driving north on Hwy. #15 near Kingston Mills Road. It was a cold still night, and I was singing along to a cassette of the ""Mamas and the Papas"" on my car stereo. I just passed over""Stephentown Creek Road,"" when something in the sky caught my eye. Ahead of me and to the right, just above the tree line, I saw two round white lights. They were much bigger than any stars and they appeared to be coming towards me in a south-west direction. I checked my car mirrors to see if any other vehicles were on the highway. There weren't any, and I immediately slowed my car down to about 10-15 km/hr. As the two lights approached it looked like big bus headlights in the sky.  I thought to myself,  ""What kind of a plane or helicopter has two white lights like that?""  I'm not too knowledgeable about aircraft, but I'd never heard of anything with two big white lights. Then I noticed that there was a smaller red light blinking between the two white lights. It started on the inside of the left light and ""blinked"" its way to the right light, and continued this pattern back and forth. At closer look, I realized that there was also one small red light that stayed consistently lit next to the right white light. The object was flying slowly and just over the treeline (approximately 2-3 telephone poles high). I quickly checked for traffic again, and then flicked on the high beams of my car, because I thought it might help me get a better look at this thing. I didn't stop the car, but I was driving so slowly I was barely moving. I couldn't believe my eyes; it was a black equilateral triangle right ahead of me above the road. The triangle was exactly even and equal in length on all three sides and each of the three angles. There was a large white dome light steadily 'glowing' at each of the three points. Each of these round dome lights were about the size of a half-volleyball. None of the lights were actually shining a beam of light on anything, or even casting a radiant light for that matter. I could no longer see the red blinking lights at all, and I wasn't sure if these glowing dome-lights were the same lights as the headlights or not. I quickly put my window down and stuck my head out. As it passed over my car I got a very good look at the bottom of the craft. It was flying point-first towards the Kingston Mills Locks area. The black triangle was actually very dark grey and almost shadow like above a very distinct 3-Dimensional black shape directly attached to and under the triangle. It looked like something out of a Star Trek movie! It actually had arrow-like points at each of the three corners. After the point, the shape made something like a small inward rectangle, then outward to a larger rectangle shape, back to a small inward rectangle, and then to the next point. Each side was exactly symmetrical to itself and to each other side. It struck me how slowly it was moving (maybe 40 km/hr), how low it was, and how small it was... it would easily fit in a school gymnasium. The next thing that crossed my mind was that perhaps it was some sort of military stealth-like plane. I thought whoever that is, is so close they can probably hear ""Dream a little Dream"" playing on my stereo. I considered turning the radio off, but I didn't bother. Maybe it would draw their attention to me; then another thought crossed my mind; would that be a good thing or a bad thing? What about a real UFO; and possible abduction? I didn't feel scared, though, especially since none of those ""stereotypical"" things happened to my car. No stalling, or dimming of lights, or weird radio noise. I noticed two sets of car headlights coming towards me from around the next corner of the highway. I thought, ""Good, those people have got to be able to see this thing too!""  I felt better that I probably wasn't alone in the ""sighting"" and I just continued around the corner. The strange craft never stopped or hovered, just continued slowly on its course towards the area of Kingston Mills Locks. I did not see the craft from behind. I looked at the clock in my car, and it read 6:21. Since my clock is set exactly 8 minutes fast, it would actually have been 6:13 pm. I noticed the next street sign that read ""Isle of Man Road"". The whole incident probably lasted less than two minutes. I was very excited about what I had seen, so I explained it and sketched it out for friends immediately. They asked me what it sounded like. Sound had never crossed my mind. I told them that I did have my stereo on, but I didn't notice any sound at all coming from the aircraft.  I also made note that I hadn't noticed any sort of big wind or anything like that. It was certainly a bizarre experience, and I will certainly never forget it. This account was written on Monday, January 27th, 2003 (3 days after sighting) and  the diagrams were computer drawn on Tuesday, January 28th, 2003 from memory and from the sketches I made immediately after sighting. Please note that drawings are approximate renditions only. Stars in sky are not accurate, just representation of stars. The third diagram is a drawing of the craft from directly underneath. (I am aware that the perspective of this drawing is a little off.) The pattern of the black underneath of the craft is as similar as I could make it, but I'm sure it is definitely not exact.

I knew it could'nt be a plane because first of all planes arent supposed to be that close to the city and after watching the planes that go around here everyday I ve almost memorized their paths. second of all the lights in this craft werent flickering or blinking or anything they were just constantly beaming a hazy sort of wierd whitish/yellowish light.

At first I didn't see the 3 lights on the corners of this triangular craft until it very very slowly and I stress SILENTLY without the smallest sound just hovered towards my building. I mean anything made by man that flys only 500 meters away has to make a sound. by now I had called my brother cause I thought my eyes were fooling me. As the craft got closer we realized that it was no plane but some sort of triangular craft because it passed exactly a couple stories over my building and we were looking at the bottom of the craft and saw it's structure and there was a red light in the middle of it (the sterotypical red light, I know) I was just astonished and ran for my camera I kep searching for the damn thing in my messy house and eventually found it and took one lousy picture which I have no idea on how it will turn out. My brother is my witness and all those who know me know how much of a skeptic  and disbeliever I am. I then ran downstairs yelling that there's a UFO outside and nobody believed me i ran and saw the craft. suddenly instead  of going on it's horizontal path it went vertically straght to the skies and turned into a star and stayed their for a while and then left. Some other people saw this downstairs and they didn't care they said it's no big deal probably some governmental plane. But what would a governmental plane be doing in downtown vancouver?",2003-02-25T00:00:00,49.26892572695909,-123.11223982257269

I figured It was probably a news helicopter because of rush hour traffic ""logicaly"" Still I have never seen a plane or heli. do a steady SLOW beat, like a large search light going off and on. I got to my house In lynnwood washington, and saw two close yellow lights just over the trees behind our house, looked like a 747 when they are faced at you flying twards you so at that time it wasnt to odd to see because of our location ""airports ect. , but the craft never crested over those trees, it actually went down like either moving away or dropping in alt. Soo.. after I changed to go play HALO at a friends house I witnessed the last part of the sighting.  My brother was with me and I was about to get into my car when I saw the same two yellowish white lights coming from the right of the trees this time I watched it for about 10 seconds then noticed no sound and told my brother to get out of the car and look at this, he did and by the time he got out of the car it was over head and had three yellowish white lights in a perfect triangle , as it went over head I couldnt hear anything, but as it was past us to the North we started to hear what sounded like a low frequancy jet type sound but very quite and very low.I was exstatic because I have witnessed a triangle craft that to me was a UFO.  After we calmed down we started to drive the two miles to our friends house and on the way about halfway, we both witnessed another strobe search lite craft, I was alot closer this time it and thought it might have been the tail guy saying OK your through everything back to normal in the sky?? After I started thinking about it for a day I got to thinking the first strobe object we saw might have been the clear craft to clear the way for this huge triangle craft and the last strobe craft was to close the line so to speak or bring up the rear. Kind of like an over sized load on the freeway with the start car and the back car maybe, now if that is true then what we saw was probably human craft but MAN was it kewl and ill tell you alot kewler then the old stealth bombers!! ohh one last thing I forget to say at the time the triangle craft was over our heads my cat jumped into my car and refused to come out of the back, I was starting to get weirded out because I had to drag him from the back and hold him, he was shaking and apeared scared? maybe someone has some insite on what is REALLY going on contact me at ((e-address deleted))",2003-02-11T00:00:00,47.82361835051547,-122.29480474226804

At first we thought they were maybe northern lights but they didn't move or change colors like northern lights do. So being curious we drove towards the lights in the foothills of Mt. Spokane. We took Biglow Gulch Rd. and drove a bit to get to a area to pull over in the flats that are farming lands to get a clear view. We pulled down a dirt service road next to the power lines and watched the beams lights in back of the foothills of the mountain. There was 5 beams pointing to the night skys and they seems to be pointing to different stars some beams were straight up and down and others where angled. The light beams changed intensity fading from bright to dim and did this slowly. We got back into the van to leave to drive closer to the lights when we both noticed a huge outline of a saucer shape hovering over one of the foothills. The angles on the shape where too sharp on every side to be a cloud and it would have been too low to be a cloud. The saucer shape that was hovering over the foothill was wider then the foothill. This thing was huge. And were miles from the foothill at that moment.  We turned the van around and got on the main road again to head towards the foothills. Then we took a another dirt road next to a church and drove down it a bit and passed a small white toyoto truck with a canopy on the bed of the truck with it's running lights on. We didn't think to much about it because it being the weekend and teenagers out parking. So we pulled up about a block in front of them and got out of the van to watch the lights more and to see the craft. But the craft was no longer visable just the strange light were still moving around the foothills of the mountain. Then I got a strange feeling and told me husband we better get out of there. We turned around and were heading to get back in the van when I noticed that the small pickup's parking lights were off now. So we turned th! e van ar ound and headed for the pickup and our headlight hit their licence plate and it said U.S. Government on the plate.

Lights. This was an exceptionally clear night, and I was out doing time-exposure photography of star trails and the northern lights, which were unusually visible due to the clarity of the sky.  As I was looking through the viewfinder of my Canon EOS-3, I noticed something strange in the upper right corner of the view finder...I removed my eye from the viewfinder and tried to get a better view as to what I was seeing.  It was a VERY large (2-3 times the size of a 747) disk, that was black, or at least looked black due to the absence of light.  It was honest-to-God saucer shaped.  I would have NEVER believed it was anything out of the ordinary..until I saw it move eastward in the sky.  There was absolutely no noise at all...not even crickets.  It was moving very slowly...in my very rough estimation, maybe 20 knots at the most.  It stopped periodically and hovered in its location before continuing on the way.  I attempted to take pictures, but it remains to be seen if anything will appear on film, due to the fact that I was shaking very much, and there was little light.  Exposure times were in the 20-30 second range that I had set to record the northern lights.  This is not any sort of a joke that I am playing.

It appeared to be located approximately in the direction of Mount Bachelor.  We watched it for 15 minutes until it dropped below the rooftop line of our neighbors house. There was one single disc/saucer type object observed that was stationary for the fifteen minutes we watched it. Skies were clear.  It was staionary although it was dropping some in altitude to eventually dropped below our neighbor's roof top which was our viewing area and certainly moving away from us as the vision got smaller in that fifteen minute period.  It was as if it was going sideways as it did get smaller and did drop in altitude a little, but appeared stationary at the same time. It was fairly large as seen at a distance,(hard to determine how far away it was) had a rotating outter circle of lights all the way around the saucer and the lights would change colors from green, to all red, to all blue and to all white.  Most of time, I observed more all red, or all green and these light rotated the whole time.  I was thinking to myself, just like they make it seem in real life or in the movies. We had time to get our glasses and also binoculars to take a better look.  With the binoculars it was strange to only to be able to see a white undefined mass.  Kind of like a thin white mass/cloud-like in the darness.  I thought that was strange. Obviously you could see it with the naked eye, but there was some sort of field that made it unobservable while trying to use another type of viewing apparatus. Thought about taking a picture of it, but didn't.  Glad there were two of us that viewed it, so there is no question that we saw what we saw. After it dropped below the rooftop line of our neighbor's house, we didn't pursure it any more.  As far as backgrounds of the observers - I am 49 years old and a professional by occupation.  The other observer is a 20 yead old college student who was home from school for a few days, and had been studying late.  He originally spooted the thing and brought it to my attention.  Interesting, yet kind of scary. I never believed in those things before, but I certainly have to change my stance on them now.  Either that, or our own government is experimenting with some type of contraption in the wee hours of the morning when they knew most people would be asleep. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  The object seems inconsistent with a celestial body, since a star or planet in the southwest sky would appear to ""rise"" as the Earth rotates to the east.

It looked like a boomerang formation of 7 or 9 round lights.  It was higher and less clear than the plane and had a halo around it, as if it was in some thin clouds (perhaps it was).  The V was moving much faster than the airplane - maybe 5 times faster (not accounting for differences in distance from me).  Shortly after I caught sight of it, the V turned right (south).  It did so abruptly and without much of a curve through the turn.  When it changed direction, several of the lights seemed to rearrange themselves - as though they were discreet objects in a formation, not fixed to one single object.  They did so very quickly - spontaneously - to go from a eastbound V to a southbound V.  The wedge flew south into a part of the sky that was bright from city lights, and I lost it.

This is my first known sighting.  I was on the oceanside of the beach club checking the club's beach access boardwalk.  I routinely look up and down the beach for small boats or boats out in the ocean because there is a lot of drug smuggling along what is know as the Treasure Coast of FL.  It was clear and the sky was full of stars.  In fact, I believe that night there was an alignment of planets, the moon, and earth going on.  I saw a light on the horizon of the ocean, almost due east.  I at first thought it was a fishing boat out on the gulf stream.  However, I noticed the light seemed a little high off the horizon for the mast of a fishing boat.  It was pitch black out there and all of a sudden, the light shot up into the sky going very high.  It looked like an amber star, a small star or one that is very far away.  I of course was astonished and began observing it.  It appeared to be stationary in the sky then all of a sudden it would move right, then left, and made loops like a helicopter.  This went on for awhile so I went back to my cruiser and got out the binoculars, 10X and focused them as best as I could looking into the black background.  I could tell this object emitted it's own source of light and had red areas on it's surface.  Sometime, when it would move I thought I could tell it was oval in shape, but I can't be sure.  I went to the beach gate house and had another officer go out on the beach and observe the object.  He came back stating, ""that thing is dancing.""  I observed it later while locking up the building, standing on the second floor balcony of the beach club.  I locked my arms in a bi-pod position holding the binoculars in one position.  The object would move out of my field of view and come back.  I went on with my duties and at 0230 I looked for the object again but it was gone.  The next two nights I saw the object in the sky, almos! t due ea st, about 45 degrees from the horizon.  The third night I also noticed one, maybe two more objects at the same altitude that looked like the first object.  They were spread out going south down the coast.  The reason I am reporting this is because I believe my sighting is almost the same as two others on this board, Mokena, Il and McKinleyville, Ca.  I will say this, if I hadn't seen the object shoot up from the horizon into the sky, I could tell myself that these objects were stars and their movements could be optical illusions.  I'm a believer now that there is something unknown going on.",2003-02-05T00:00:00,,

It is bright white, then changes orange - Yellow. It never has a sound and is around 100 feet in the air. It never takes off from land. You just watch in the sky at 10:00pm and it just appears out of no where! Then it is just in the sky not moving for 15-20 minutes and starts to go about 1 kilometer east, and then turns around and goes 1 Kilometer west. But this night Febuary 20 2003 really took are attention. It was 10:00pm. Me and my friend were at the beach. I told my friend about this light me and my father watch every night from 10 to 11. So we decided to go at the beach and wait for this light to appear. Around 10:15pm the light appeared once again. I showed my friend so we watched it for 2 or 3 minutes then went home. I told my father the light was out again. So we watched it from 10:15pm to 10:35pm. It did not move. Then around 10:36pm it started to move quickly toward east, then turned and went west the stoped. It then became very bright. And then out of no were a second same bright light appeared. Now there was two bright lights in the sky. Then we saw a plane going towards these lights. The lights were not moving at this time. The air jet passed bettwen these two bright lights and went toward Moncton. After a few minutes the two lights were moving around east to west.  Then out of no where, a third REALLY brighter light appeared. Now we were watching three really bright lights flying in the sky with no sound. We had never ever saw three  bright lights flying around the sky before like this night. We were really freaked out. We watched them till around 11:15pm. Then they just dissapeared in the air with no trace. We talked to other people in our area, and they recall seeing that bright light before, but never took much attention to it. But me and my father took alot of attention into it and are very puzzled, on what this could be. It can't be a plane. Planes just don't sit 100 feet in the air not moving for 15 minutes then start to move back and forward on top of the water for and hour, almost every nigh of the week. Especially not three of them!!!  Plus,  we would be able to hear the engines if it was a plane. It can't be a hellicopter because, what would a hellicopter be doing out on top of the water (Northumberland Strait) every night flying around back and foward for 1 hour with no hellicopter noise. And it is for SURE not a weather ballon!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the location of the alleged incidents is Canada, although the witness does not indicate that fact directly.

After going out side i noticed several more spread across the whole horizon. They where noticably larger than stars. I watched them outside for a while and walked over to a neighbor who was up early preparing for a hunting trip to bring it to his attention as well. I observed sudden and fluid movments - darting, changing direction suddenly and circulare, and also moments of no movment. Also observed was one light that was considerably closer and lower elevation just off the horizon. The light from this was considerably more bright than the others, however movment from this one was limited. Additionally there seemed to be secondary lights of much higher elevation than all the others which had a redish hue to them, these lights seemed to be comparable in size and intensity to ambient stars and little movment was noticed of these.

My husband and I left Jeffersonville OH. on our way to Chillicothe around 9 pm on Feb.6th,2003. Between Jeffersonville and Washington Court House a large, orange light appeared in front of us. I asked if that was a plane and the light disappeared. We laughed it off as strange and continued. On the other side of Court House on East 35 the same light appeared at the 41 exit. This time it lit up for about 3-4 seconds,faded, then another to the right quickly blinked then went out and the light on the left lit up again. This got our attention and I rolled down the window to see if I could see anything. The sky was clear and cloudless. Nothing could be seen flying or moving. We discussed what these lights couldve been for the next 3-4 miles when we saw another of these lights again. This time we pulled over to the side of the highway. My husband pointed out 4 flying blinking lights on what we thought were planes. We continued driving to Chillicothe as I watched these lights. From the speed I first thought they were jets. I rolled my window down and could not make any shape out or hear any sound. The lights were a single, strobe-like light on each one. The lights didnt blink in a pattern but would blink quickly, then would go off, then blink slow. This happened with all of them. My husband noticed one going left, then stall, and change direction quickly going back to the right. They moved into pairs moving around in the sky going different speeds. The lights were small and if it wasnt for the large, glowing orange light I wouldve never have noticed these lights. Im not sure of the distance. They seemed very far away which would make the speed they were going even stranger. Ive never seen any plane or jet move like these moved, or change direction, or speed like these did. At the Frankfort exit we got off rte 35 to get a better look. Two of the lights lined up, one on the left and one on the right. The other two came in and joined the line in the middle of these. Their lights then rarely blinked and the two on the outside began a patterned blink. As they flew away at one point all the lights in this row blinked and it looked like 8-10 separate lights in this row. As they went back towards the west the two lights continued to blink on the outside and every now and then two lights between them would blink. If I had to make a rough guess I would say the distance between the craft on the left and the one one the right would be around 1-2 miles. This was the strangest thing Ive seen in the sky. I dont know if anyone else noticed these smaller lights but Im sure many people had to see these large round orange lights.",2003-02-11T00:00:00,39.5372,-83.4343

The individual lights were round in shape, evenly spaced, on the front of what looked like a delta-wing object.  I had the impression that it was extremely large, the exact shape and dimensions of it were tough to see due to the brightness of the lights.  There were no strobes, no colored lights, no landing lights, etc...it wasn't like any aircraft I had ever seen.

The object at that time would be spinning. This can be observed and appears to be obvious on our video tape.

Then, the object would again reduce in size back to it's original appearance. The smaller object did not come out on any of our video, yet was obvious without the aid of any magnification.

Around 40th Street I noticed several block south there were three more objects like the one I had seen earlier in the day, about as high up.  They were quite small in the distance but I could see the same slowly blinking lights on the bottom.  The three moved, variously, horizontally and vertically over the avenue, and then grouped together and moved downwards a few floors in altitude.  then they stopped their downward motion and moved horizontally (no downward movement) towards a building on the east side of the street and proceeded, next to it, to move out of sight down whichever side street they were over (somewhere in the mid-thirties). In no case could I make out any details on the objects beyond the lights on the bottom, which appeared red or orange.

At approximately 3 AM, 12/21/02, I walked out on the front porch to smoke a Cigarette, and, glanced up toward the NW to check the sky. My attention was instantly drawn to a brightly lit object travelling toward the NE at about the speed of a private plane, approximately over the Houston Ship Channel, about 2 miles away. It had just passed a yard light slightly above my neighbors house, and, I watched as it travelled the full length of the roof ridgeline (about 150 feet distant, and, possibly 50 feet of roof). Casually wondering why I was looking into what might have been a Landing Light, if the craft were travelling toward me, I was startled to see it make a 180 degree Que-ball turn, without dimenishing its speed. It retraced its flight path back to the point where I originally noticed it, made another Que-ball turn, and, continued on its original path, but, descending below the ridgeline and out of sight at about the point where it made the initial turn. It was simply a large, bright light, larger than a pinpoint, with red and blue lights flashing around the perimeter, yet, the light always seemed to be pointed straight at me, indicating that it was radiating in all directions, as opposed to being a beam that pointed toward the line of flight. This is not the first time I have seen lights in the Sky that seemed to be shining directly at me, while travelling in directions at physical odds with Landing Lights.

There were no unusual movements.  The craft got smaller and smaller but it was not possible to tell whether it was getting further away or getting smaller.  I'm assuming that it was getting further away.  It seemed therefore to be moving horizontally and further away at the same time, so it's direction was more NNW to SSE from my vantage point.  I was walking exactly SE according to the map I just consulted. There was nothing on the craft that didn't glow, and the color of the light was uniformly orange, glowing orange (though not blinding).  Due to this fact I felt compelled to report it, as I'm convinced that it wasn't 'one of ours'.  The orange light wasn't a 'running light' or anything.  The entire craft was glowing orange.  It was shaped a bit oblong, like an ellipse with a very large major axis, almost to the point of not being an ellipse anymore, but a cigar.  Its size was such that if you held up your pinky (little finger) you could hide it from view (possibly requiring you to close one eye, although I didn't try this).  The glow was slightly larger near the front I suppose indicating more volume or mass in the front of the craft.   And, this was definitely NOT Mars.  Although the craft wasn't moving at any 'fantastic' speed, it was still moving quite a bit too much to be mistaken for a planet.",2003-10-07T00:00:00,35.20580084001527,-80.82639156166476

Yukon, Oklahoma  Date:  September 30, 2003 Time:  11:45 to 12:30 p.m.  Hi Brian  I recently was out in my back yard with a cup of coffee, and noticed something moving then stopped and hovered for about 30 seconds, so I went back in and grabbed our Sony cybershot digital cam and got a picture of it (lower right) UFO? My wife thinks it's a plane but I told her you should have seen it's movement, It flew off really FAST and was out of sight!  I was home from work this last Tuesday , 9-30-03, the time was about 11:45 to 12:30 p.m., not quite sure. When I first noticed it, it was just hovering and slowly moving sideways a bit, just west of our house, maybe about 5-8 miles,and  I would say somewhere between 2000 to 5000 ft ?? Not sure, when I rushed back outside with my cam, it flew off after 10 or so seconds, in a north, northeast direction ( there is also a small airport in that direction too) VERY high velocity also, in a few seconds it was gone!  This is the second time I have captured something strange on film, the other time, I caught on film what looked like a B1b bomber at high altitude. but I never saved it though. If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have put the cam on record, it takes short 30 sec videos, oh well.  Thank you to the witness for allowing me to post the report and pictures.

The lights we witnessed were first spotted coming over the Palo Verde Nuclear plant coming in from the west around 20;00. At this time the two lights were glowing a deep reddish orange (very scary). The lights would turn on and off silently. No other identifiable lights and behavior ruled out airplanes and baloons.  These objects  continued on an easternly path directly toward Phoenix.  As we drove through Phoenix on I-10 the lights again reappeared south of Phoenix, as we headed towards Tucson. Now the lights changed to a bright solid yellow, in formation,and turning off and on. As we approached a small town or suburb, to the east these two objects hung in the sky, over the town and this time they were metallic gold and round in shape. They reflected light and appeared to be metallic.  They also lit up the entire sky around them and you could see the clouds above (high ceiling) and were certainly very visible from the ground. You could not miss them.  We had been traveling 70 mph or better on the interstate and the lights not only kept up the pace but were ahead of us and waiting?  The lights then turned again to bright yellow and continued their turning off and on wobbly manuevers as we headed towards Tucson. Then just as we were about to reach the first lights north of Tucson (suburb) the lights turned towards the southwest and disappeared out over the Papago indian reservation and towards the Kitt Peak area. My husband is the second witness.  We were on our way from Seattle,Wa. to a place in New Mexico with a device involved with new technology.  The lights were a bit un-nerving as well as the length of time.  I am estimating it to be four hours or so. I wish I had reported this at the time but I could not do so.

I am the pastor and director of a Christian outreach ministry. My wife is an administrator, my mother is a retired nursing supervisor, my four children range in age from 20 to fourteen. We witnessed first one light in the sky, from our perspective, to the right of the moon, high over the ocean horizon. It started as a small light and continued to increase in intensity until it appeared as a very bright, directional light. Yet it had know strobe or movement. The lumination continued for approximately 10 sec. and then slowly faded at the same point in the sky. It was a clear night. Almost immediately, another light, in another point of the sky to our east slowly came on and increased in intensity in the exact same manner without movement. Then, two lights, simultainously came on in different parts of the sky, then, together, they went out after approximately 10 sec. Then six lights came on in a pattern, one after another, again, no strobe, no movement, all over the ocean horizon, high enough to be considered air born. They all stayed on for approximatlely 10 sec. and then together, slowly faded out. This continue for one and a half hours and was witnessed by the entire family.  I did not report the experience to officials. Others walking on the beach were noted to stop and point.  The exact same thing happened again the following night, at the same time and in the same manner.  One more very odd thing, I took my three sons kyaking on Friday of that week. We went out in the intercoastal waterway and made our way out to the ocean. We headed north, across the inlet from Cherry Grove, SC. The island we were alongside is deserted. We were going to explore the island. We saw a large group of people approximately 1/2 mile up the beach, walking around as if to be looking for beach treasures. An odd note, from our perspective, they were all wearing long sleeve dark shirts and long pants. Strange for that time of year. We decided we would continue toward them to see what they were looking for. As we continued to approach, we witnessed the large group form a circle, as if they were looking at something that had washed up on the beach. We continued to paddle against the surf to reach them. We looked at each other long enough to consider what the group must be doing. When we looked back in the direction of the group on the beach, they were gone. No sign of anyone. We continued to paddle until we reached the supposed area of the beach combers. We beached our kyaks and began looking for evidence of the group. There were no footprints or trace of anyone, much less a group of fifty. We checked the dunes and looked for boats on the other side, which we could see from the dunes. Everyone was gone. Then, I saw one man walking toward us from the north. He was aproximately 2/10 mile away. I walked toward him to ask if he had seen anyone. He approached and was an old man wearing only underwear. He was carrying a metal bucket which I did not look in. I asked if he had seen anyone else. He said he thought we were with the group. He said he they were part of a group of people that own the private island and that they were doing scientific expiriments. Now answering any more or my questions, he continued to walk south and we never saw him again.

I was taking things to the curb when I looked up to the north, the house faces east, and saw a small round silver colored dot, like the head of a pin held at arms length, sitting stationary in a clear blue sky.  I watched it for some time remembering how some groups used flashlights and other methods to contact ufo's.

I swung my arm inviting what ever it was down.  It didn't move.  I walked into the house for more things to take to the curb and when I walked out front again I looked north and the small silver dot was gone.

It was thick like a Mylar balloon but had no edges. One half was shiny, reflective, and smooth the other side had a four pointed black star covering most of it.  I wanted to run inside for my video camera but didn't want to miss a second of what I was watching so I just stood there.

I do not remeber the exact date or time and some of the finer details of this event however it took place in early January, I believe in 1998. A more accurate report was filed with the Ventura/Santa Barbara MUFON chapter.  I was sitting in the car parking lot of Albertsons in Camarillo. It was the early evening and the sun had just set. The sky was sufficiently dark to see stars and it was clear exept for maybe a few cirrus clouds. I was facing NW and had just reached forward to change the radio station when out of the corner of my eye, to the right, I saw what I had first thought to be firework embers falling down from the sky. There were about 12 to 20 whight lights, about the magnitude of polaris, falling down in a ring formation. Suddenly these ""firework"" embers did something rather unusual. They stopped dead in the sky. This ring was suspended at what I estimate to be an altitude of maybe 1500 feet though I am not good at estimating altitude and they maye have been much higher.  After about 1.5 second pause, these lights suddenly started swarming around eachother erradically. If I recall correctly some were ""glittering"". This swarm moved almost right overhead me and some of the lights left the swarm and flew around the sky while others appeared to join the swarm from higher altitudes.  Two of the lights in this swarm started to become brighter and most of the lights in the swarm merged with these two brighter lights while the remaining ones flew out of the swarm and faded from few. These two bright lights now moved closer to eachother and then started blinking on and off in sequence. One would blink on while the other would blink off. At this point in the event, the object(s) would easly pass for a cessna. The blinking lights slowly began to move NW, parallel with the hill that runs behind Camarillo where I eventually lost sight of them behind the houses on the horizon.  I ran inside the market to tell my mom what I had just saw. A few minutes later on the way home we saw three or four fighter jets, in formation, flying from the direction the lights disappeared from. I imagine the jets were dispatched from Vandeberg AFB. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-01-17T00:00:00,34.219553525641025,-119.03310224358974

In the summer of 1977, I was living in Auburn, California. My wife-to-be (let’s call her Jan) and myself were out taking an evening walk by Lincoln High School (on Lincoln Way).  We both sighted a UFO within 150 feet of our position.  These are the details.  Environmental conditions: The evening was clear with very few, if any clouds.  The sun had set about 15 minutes previously.  Only the brightest stars were beginning to show.  There was no wind that I can recall; it was very still.  The story: Jan and I walked by the high school and noticed that it had a fountain in the center of the group of buildings which were in a ""U"" shape, open to the street.  We went to the fountain and were looking into it.  I was saying something to Jan and she interrupted me by simultaneously nudging me in the ribs with her elbow and saying ""look at this.""  I looked up and saw a large white triangular shape shoot over the roof of the west wing of the building traveling at a slightly upward angle (the ship was travelling southeast, almost parallel to Lincoln Way).  Almost immediately the ship nosed downward at about a 20 degree angle and looked like it was going to dive into the street.  As it passed the corner of the High School’s west wing, a very large ""spark"" shot out of the back and almost immediately dissipated, the way plasma dissipates.  The ship left a light (perhaps even slightly bright) well-defined vaporous trail as it moved through the air which dissipated almost immediately as it came out the back.  At it’s lowest point I estimate that the craft was flying about 40 to 50 feet above street.  As the ship continued to move on its path, I could see the back side of it. There was a diamond-shaped opening from where the vapor trail was coming and it was brilliant.  A moment later and the ship dissappeared behind a large tree. With the sky dark enough to see a few stars, I knew that I would be able to see anything bright.  I ran quickly to a place where I could get an unobstructed view of the horizon or at least as unobstructed as I could manage, and I still saw nothing moving in the sky. The ship had vanished.  See diagrams below.  Final details. ·The ""fly-by"" of the ship took about 2 to 3 seconds. ·The ship was white but not glowing. ·It flew in a ""wobbley"" manner as if it was almost out of control ·This craft was TOTALLY silent. ·I was vaguely aware of seeing small details on the hull; my impression was that it was like the lines formed by plates fitting together on the fuselage of an aircraft but I could be wrong on that description.

I knew all of the flight patterns of planes going into & out of this airport from watching them every night.  I used to come home from work & relax & have a couple of beers on my back patio, looking across the salt-pond lake & at the planes leaving the airport & looking at the Winter birds migrating from up North down to Cuba, & all that. And familiar with watching all of the Air Force planes from up a few miles North at the Boca Chica air-base.  I never believed in UFO's or ever imagined I'd ever see anything like that-It wasn't even in the realm of my mind. I was the harshest critic of UFO's in the world.  But, one nite, I was out on my patio on a moonless nite, having my cocktail, & just happened to glance up & see 3 oval/egg-shaped lights rapidly passing overhead, without a sound.  They did not shine light out from them, but had a sort of self-contained light.  One light in front, with another light behind & outward from the the lead light, so as to make a triangular configuration.  Never a sound made. Because the nite was moonless, I was hampered in getting any perspective or depth-conception about how high this thing/these things were, but I could not ascertain any signs that these lights were part of a larger craft or crafts, but I could not swear otherwise.  I was instantly stricken with the notion that this thing was completely unlike anything I'd ever seen in my life.  It had to be at least a couple hundred feet high, but probably a least a couple thousand feet high, & it streaked off, in this formation or whatever, right across the salt-ponds & I could see it heading straight off the coast of Key West, heading in the direction of Cuba.  I sat down in my chair & uttered a couple of ugly oaths, because I knew I'd seen something I didn't want to see & I didn't want to be lumped with those trailer rednecks who see UFO crap down in their pastures. I sat there & poured myself another drink & tried to run down the litany of everything I could think of to convince myself that I hadn't seen what I'd seen, but I just couldn't con myself that way. Naturally, it had no red or green or white running lights that aircraft have, that was one of the first things that I had subconsciencouly looked for but failed to see, that & the fact that the sucker was as silent as a ghost. I still see it in my mind to this day & could paint it, it's so branded in my head. ((NUFORC Note:  No date provided by witness, who also provides no contact information.

My parents were visiting my aunt and uncle and playing cards inside the house. They lived in a little four corners community about 20 miles northwest of Lansing, Michigan. It’s too small to be listed on maps or have its own zipcode  I was out in the back yard laying on my back looking at the stars, trying to make them into pictures. As for the exact time, it was dark so was some time after 9:00 pm and before 11:00 pm, which was when we left to drive home.  As I was watching the stars, one of them moved. It quickly went from one place in the sky to another and then stopped. The route it traveled was like a large U. There were no flames, no noise, no brightening or dimming of its light, no blinking. It just moved.  It was definitely not a plane, helicopter or other type of aircraft. Even at 9 years old, I was very familiar with and had ridden in most types of aircraft, I spent many Saturday afternoons at the airport just watching and bugging the private pilots for a ride.  I've seen shooting stars and it was definitely not one of those. It was definitely not a meteor, they do not make U turns.  The movement only took one or two seconds. The object had not moved before then and did not move a second time. It looked like just a star that moved.  Remember, this is 1952. There were no satellites, space vehicles, space stations or space junk for years after I saw what I saw.  For some reason I could not bring myself to tell my parents that night and have never mentioned it since that night. I have not seen any other unidentified flying objects since then, although I know several people who have and I have no reason to doubt them.  I just thought that I should put this on the record before it's too late. ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the interesting report!  The date above is approximate.

My mother and I were lying on a blanket, looking at the stars.  My mother was pointing out various constellations to me when I noticed a small green, disc-shaped object circling in a tight oval path.  It seemed to me very small and far away.  I asked my parents what it was.  They had no idea, but they became quite interested in it.  My mother eventually went into the house and phoned someone to report what we were seeing.  I don't kinow who she phoned--police, media, or whatever.  The following morning, our newspapers (Washington Post, Washington Daily News, etc.) were full of front page reports of UFOs over DC.  The photos that appeared in our newspapers in no way resembled what my parents and I had observed.  With 50-some years of hindsight, I now wonder if I witnessed a ""mother ship"" to the objects that were photographed over DC that night.

Now as you know after operating a machine like this all day, when it is shut down,the stillness you can cut with a knife. We were in an area that was clear of any objects, only low willows and rolling hills. The evening sky was clear as a bell, not a cloud to be seen, a typical fall evening. The time was about 17.00 hours, the month was late sept or early oct. I cannot be sure. there was no oil rigs working in the area that we were at nor was there any flare pits burning anywhere near us. As we started back down the right of way that we had cut through,to get back to the half ton truck to go back to camp, this is what we saw. We were walking east and out of the north and going south came these 2 objects, they were cylinder in shape with one just above and ahead of the other. they both glowed like the red ember of coal but the out line of the cylinder was sharp,not fuzzy. they did not appear to be that high, not traveling all that fast. we both had a good look at them as they went by.

It was cloudy so we did not see the Jet. (We are both Air Force Vets and know their sound which were few in number in 54.) We saw what appeared to be free falling disks. They had the motion of free falling paper plates (powerless). They then stopped decending and slowly got in a V formation. The Jet, which they appeared to be avoiding, was out of hearing range at that time. Then they started moving in a southerly direction. The Jet plane was going north. They flickered as they moved and turned to the East toward a large Black rain cloud. They quickly accelerated to a very high speed still in V formation. Estimated speed was about 450 MPH. They were unstable and took turns shooting up or down (90 deg.turns) and then returning to their position in the fast moving V formation. These dull metallic colored disks then disappeared into the dark rain cloud. No lights or sounds were noted. They were at approx. 4000 ft elevation and appeared to me to be about 4 to 6 ft. in diameter. I have seen no more UFOs in the last 49 years.

Red Fireball Over Califonia,California,CA,,fireball,5 seconds,"Occurred : 8/14/1957 21:00  (Entered as : 08/14/1957 21:00) Reported: 12/27/2003 7:00:39 AM 07:00 Posted: 1/17/2004 Location: California (above, northern part of), CA Shape: Fireball Duration:5 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34151.html,"Red Fireball Over Califonia From 1954-58 I was a flight engineer (mechanic) on USAF C-46  twin engine cargo aircraft. I was assigned to the 2343rd Air Force Reserve Flying Center (AFRFC) at Portland Oregon . Even though we were regular Air Force , we had to go to Chico, California with the reserve unit for two weeks summer encampment during the first part of August each year . I do not remember the exact time, date or year, of this event, as we went to Chico for 4-5 years.  I was in the cockpit of a C-46 in a four plane formation that had been out over the Pacific Ocean for night time navigation training.  (Long before GPS) The navigators used a sextant through the astrodome (glass bubble) on top of the aircraft to determine our location. We had completed the over water training and were headed southeast back toward Chico  which was  35-50 miles distance, when we noticed a bright cherry red fireball coming from the south at a very high rate of speed. It had a vibrating ,quivering motion as it headed north. We were flying at 8,000-9,000 ft. and the fireball passed across in front of us from the 12:00 o'clock to the 9:00  o'clock positions.  It was level to slightly below our altitude. It was about the size of a dime at arms length  at its closest point. As the fireball got in our 10:00 o'clock position it split into 3-4 pieces. These pieces all continued north , more or less parallel to each other.  When we landed at the base in Chico most of the ground crew that were waiting to  park and service the aircraft after we landed had seen the fire ball pass at about a 30 degree angle to the west of them. Over the next few days we heard that the fireball was first seen over southern California. After it passed in front of us , the pieces supposedly  joined back together over Klamath Falls, Oregon where it hovered for a short while. Then flew off to the north.  About  that time we had a C-46 transporting  another flight engineer ,who had injured his back , to our home base at Portland ,Oregon.  The injured man and the flight engineer of the aircraft were both close friends of mine.   As they were on the final approach to the base , the control tower called them and told them to make a ""go-around,"" as a UFO was following them in for landing. They applied power, raised the landing gear and the flaps and made a  ""go -around""  to the left.  The UFO followed them down across the runway, then it also headed north.  From what I remember the UFO was last seen near the Canadian border.  Total elapsed time from  Southern California to the Canadian Border was  about 5 minutes.  I have tried (to no avail) to go into the archives of  some of the newspapers  in that area to find and record of this incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, although we have invited the witness to investigate whether he can determine the date unambiguously, as well as contact other members of the flight and have them submit independent reports about their recollections of the event.

It was about 1963 and my husband and I were walking home from a trip to the neighborhood drug store.  Half way home and at a corner, something made me look up into the sky.  Right overhead and no higher than the planes coming into O'Hare airport was a flying saucer, hovering in place.  It was aluminum colored, had a huge white light in the bottom of the vehicle and around the middle a band of portholes.  There was a light behind the portholes and they seemed to be rotating very slowly.  We watched in awe and even waved at it.  Soon a one engine plane appeared and approached it.  It had no problem avoiding it.  Up, down, sideways, it never let the plane get too close to it. The plane finally left.  Then we thought it was leaving only to realize it was going out towards one of the passenger planes coming in for a landing.  The pilot saw it and for one moment veered off its path to look at it and then right back to its landing pattern.  The UFO then returned to where we were and hovered over us until it starting getting dark.  It then headed for downtown Chicago.  We could see its light for a long time before it disappeared.  The UFO made no noise at any time. There were lots of people watching but no one had a camera and we were too far from home to get ours.  Besides I wasn't about to leave.  We reported it and I am sure many others did too, because the morning paper printed a small article about it saying it was an advertisement pulled by a small plane.  Sure it was, right in the midst of the flight pattern being used at the time by O'Hare for all its flights.  My husband, a skeptic and a mechanical engineer would only comment that it was not like anything he had seen before.  I will never forget it and have been a complete believer in UFO's ever since.

This is looking in the southeast direction.The orbs were not close and I would say they were at a distance of a few miles. They were very bright and stationary in the sky seperated but close. I called my mother and also our neighbor who was a high school science teacher.We all saw these bright orbs and the science teacher had no clue as to what they were.After awhile they started to move away from each other in opposite directions. One moved very slowly while the other was gone in a few secs. The teacher could not explaine what we had seen. He had 5 yrs of college under his belt in many sciences to be a teacher and had no clue. I might add at this point that the orbs were in the direction of the location of a US Navy Atomic Sub training site at West Milton NY. It was run by G.E.and had atomic ractors on this site to train navy crews for the subs. G.E. also tested ractors their. Admiral Richover father of our Nuclear Navy was always their. The site is still used today for the same purpose and is a secret base. I can`t be sure the orbs were over the site but it came to mind and was in the gereral direction. What was strange is what happened latter. I was in our home when we heard jets flying very low over our area. I ran outside and thier were jets flying low in sort of a search pattern. They flew over the house and i could see that they had streight wings not swept back wings. It was very odd and no orbs were seen at this time. The next few nights the same thing happened the. Low flying jets flying like they were looking for something. Again we saw no more orbs just the jets. As I said I have had a very strong passion for aircraft and this whole thing got me thinking and wondering. I was taken to an air force base open house at Griffiss AFB in Rome NY a while latter. It was about 65 miles Sout! hwest of Broadalbin.While their I saw RB-57`s which were based at the R&D center at the base to do research in radars and electronic equipment. they have streight wings. Also there were T-33`s and F-89 Scorpians. All straight winged jets. I started thinking that some of these aircraft were the ones i saw those nights,but what they were doing or looking for is a mystary. They were not the orbs because jets don`t hang in the air motionless for ten mins. The orbs were not helos either because back then in the early 60`s there were none to be seen in upstate NY. Now we see them everyday but in the early 60`s helocopters were just not seen in the Albany Saratoga region.Ever since that sighting I have had not just a love for aircraft but started my interest in UFO`s.I know aircraft and those orbs were not aircraft as we know them and I think the Air Force was chaseing them those nights. I soloed in only 7 hrs back in 69 and as I said worked around all types of aircraft. When something strange landed at ALB people would ask me what the aircraft was.I always knew.I also worked on the flight line for 20 yrs on the night shift so I know what aircraft lites look like at night. Those orbs again were no aircraft. I have done aerobatics recently in WW-II AT-6`s and I bring up this point only because scientist like Seth Shostac saw there is no evidence. I say people like myself that have been in aviation know more about what is seen in the air to be an aircraft or an unknown. A pilot flying a 747 that sees something odd is not crasy.They don`t put crasy people in charge of airliners. When they speak up its to be heard not to be passed off. I have an example that will prove my point. I told this to Seth in an E-mail to prove that pilots say what they see as the truth. This is a true story and you might wantto bring this up on C.to C.  Its a true story. Back at Murak Dry Lake know Edward AFB in the 40`s the air force was testing the P-39 AeroComet. Our first jet aircraft. Above top secret. the plane had a fake prop put o! n it while on the ground so everyone would think that it was a propeller driven aircraft. The test pilot of the Bell AeroComet loved to play jokes so he would put a Gorilla Head on and a Top hat on this head and he would be flying this aircraft. He was seen close up in the air by other pilots flying the P-51 Mustang which was the top of the line fighter at that time. when they landed they would tell of seeing a aircraft with no propeller and being flown by a Gorilla in a Top Hat. The pilots discribed exactly what thet had seen but were not believed and sent to sick bay. This happened time and again with the same results. Its sort of proves a point that what a pilot sees and is brave enough to tell about should be taken as evidence and proof.They are up in the sky everyday and know when they see a flying object if its real or not. Just like myself. I know a star from a landing light on a plane. ((name deleted)) in Halfmoon NY   e-mail  ((e-mail address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had just finished setting up the tent when my dad and I looked up into the sky.  It was a very clear night and very dark so you could see thousands of stars in the sky.  Just about one minute after we started looking at the sky, I saw two objects the size of the stars seem to separate from one location.  They slowly made a huge circle in the sky and came back together again.  I could not believe what I was seeing so without looking away from them (I did not want to lose track of the objects), about half way into the circle I asked my dad if he was seeing what I was seeing.  He said he was.  When they came back together the object was one again. It began to slowly move in one direction and then picked up speed quickly and within a second was gone.  I continued to look for a while, but it was over.  I turned to my dad and asked him what he thought it was.  He said he was not sure.  I said could that have been a UFO and again playing it safe he said he was not sure.  But I know what I saw, and my dad verified the fact that I was not seeing things.  The USA or the rest of the world did not have anything that could have made that circle and disappeared that fast.  I am convinced this was a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,,

I had my bedroom shades down about 3/4 of the way, and the two windows in my room opened to meet the bottom of the shades.  We lived on the second floor of a two family house that was set back off the street about 100 yards and on a hill.  My bedroom was in the front of the house and the windows overlooked the front yard, driveway, and the street.  There was also a street light on the other side of the street. I was woken up around 2:30 in the morning because of a loud rustling in the trees.  When I opened my eyes, I noticed blinking red lights outside my window.  At first I thought it was a fire engine out on the street, but realized that I didn't hear the loud idleing engine that a fire engine has.  So, I got up out of bed to look out the window.  When I got to the window, I wasn't able to see the street, the street light, or the houses across the street.  I was met with a row of lights that were slowly blinking red then changing to white and red again, on the side of a gray object, that was level with the window.  I saw what seemed to be the bottom edge of the object, and it appeard to be oval.  The object just hovered there for a few minutes without making a sound.  There was no movement in the trees; and the silence was deafening. I backed away from the window, scared, and went back to my bed; never taking my eyes off the window.  When I was back in bed, I noticed that the lights were also visable in my other bedroom window which was on the same wall and approxiimately five or six feet right of the first window.  After a few minutes, the lights stopped, and I noticed the glow of the street light coming in the window again.  There was no noise of any kind when the lights stopped. I never went back to sleep that night, and as soon as it was light outside, I went out into the yard and street to look around.  Nothing seemed disturbed or out of place.  I asked my parents and neighbors if anyone heard or saw anything during the night, noone did.  I explained to my parents what I saw, and they brushed it off as just being a fire engine; but I know that it wasn't. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-01-17T00:00:00,42.1512,-71.2569

We had a large picture window and as I watched out of it, I saw two orange (not red) lights leave from the vicinity of the runway and rise in a very shallow takeoff. Halfway up, they made a sharp lateral 45 degree jag (not the usual banked turn but a true 45 degree right hand veer in their horizontal course) and immediately made a return to their original horizantal position (that is made a similar but counter 45 degree jag to the left). They then promptly changed attitudes so that their climb was about 60-70 degrees and left the area. There is a road 1 house down from ours that could have casued car tailights to reflect on the glass with a gust of wind making it appear as if they deveated from their path. However, again, the lights were orange, not red as expected on tailights or position lights of aircraft. Additionally, I did not see any vehicles on the second road before or after I saw these lights. I was watching out the window as I listened to albums so was not distracted.

We asked him what it was. He looked up and was as amazed as we were. He said, ""I think it's a UFO"". As children, my brother and I had no idea what that meant.

We both saw the craft; it was the typical ""saucer"" shape, aluminum color.  I had always thought for about 2 hours.  Recently I underwent hypnosis, and it seems the time frame was probably around 4-5 hours.  Our final destination was Salinas to visit relatives.  We had planned on taking an inland scenic route on the way up (from the Los Angeles area), then come home the coastal route.  Shortly after leaving the campsite we started seeing the craft, it was like it was magnetized to the car.  No matter how fast or slow we went, or what direction we went, or how fast or slow we changed directions.  It stayed exactly the same place in my field of vision.  At one point he stopped the car and cleaned off the windshield, thinking, “maybe it’s just a reflection.”  Needless to say it made no difference.

Young kids walking to school. This occurred when we were in grade school. I don't recall the exact year or month. Sometime, I think during the early 1970's, when the government decided to save fuel by having us go to school in the dark. We would walk to the school and it felt like the middle of the night. All of the stars were out and even a satelite once in a while would go across the sky, in a straight line. That is when we were surprised to be watching a satelite going straight but it turned and went different with no noticable change of pace. South to north, steady, and then make an absoulte right angle and go east. South to North and then an immeadiate right hand turn to the East. We just looked at each other and did not know any words to describe what we witnessed. We got to school and other kids were talking about the same thing. A satelite going as normal and then turning 90 degrees. Without changing speed or anything. Just going and turning and then gone when out of our range of vision. No sound. No colored lights. Just like a star in the sky, like our satelites. Moving like a satelite. But turning to a right angle just like that. We never knew what it was. We were just kids walking to school in the dark.

I got up to get a drink of water in the kitchen.  I did not turn any lights on in the rest of the house just the light from the TV set.  The drapes in the family room were closed so it was hard to see just the light from the TV screen.  I got to the kitchen sink and looked up and there it was right over our back yard.  It was just a few feet from our kitchen window over the back yard.  I was just paralyzed for a shor time and stood in awe of it.  It was pulsating light and I could see figures inside but couldn't tell what they quite liiked like.  I finally made my body move and I ran in the bedroom to get my husband up.  By the time he got going and we got back out to the kitchen it was gone but not completely.  It hovered around out about a half mile.  I watched as it dove and spun and glided so gracefully.  My husband never did see what I was pointing out to him and to this day I think he thinks I lost my mind but I know what I saw and I know how close it was to me and I know how frightened I was at the time.  Now I wish I had called the police to report it but my husband said no way he didn't want anyone to think his wife was a fruit cake, but I know what I saw and I know I watched the thing fly around for almost 15 minutes.  We are directly across from the Greater Peoria Airport and I wanted to call the tower and ask them if they saw it but I didn't do it and now I regret that decision also.  I have talked with several other people who have also had an experience that was of an out of this world kind and I want to record it so that others know they are not alone when they say they saw a U.F.O.

In 1973 I would have been 10 years old.  To give some idea of my ability as a witness, I point out that as a child I was very well informed of then-current and past aircraft, both military and civilian, and kept my eyes to the skies eagerly watching the planes flying out of Hamilton Field using Richmond as a flight corridor.  My dad took me to airshows and airports, and we even had a private tour of Moffett Field at one point.  During the course of two evenings, probably within a year or so of each other, I saw a total of three UFOs.  All three were shaped differently, and one event included two of them close together.  Unfortunately I cannot recall which two of the three described below were paired.  Both sitings were at dusk with enough light to illuminate the craft for visual observation.  All aircraft were northbound and on the same path used by airliners northbound out of Oakland Airport.  It is my impression that these may have been lower in altitude than the airliners typically flew, and that they may have had approximately the same maximum dimensions as airliners.  None displayed lights in my recollection, and none were audible.  In the case of the two which were paired, one UFO trailed the other rather closely - within a few craft lengths.  Velocity of all three was similar to that of the airliners I often watched going the same direction.  UFO #1 was shaped like a hockey puck and reminded me of one of the circular ice cream sandwiches I used to eat as a kid.  The outer edge exhibited some sort of framework or other features.  Come to think of it, for those who may be familiar, it looked a bit like the Oakland Coliseum (the covered structure, not the adjacent ballfield stadium).  UFO #2 appeared simply as a pair of swept wings and was devoid of visible equipment or detail.  I don't believe either of the prior ""flying wing"" bombers operated by the USAF was still active, and the B-2 was still a gleam in some engineer's eye.  UFO #3 gave the impression of a cigar or banana with an aft dorsal appendage.  My thought, then and now, is that it was much like the fuselage of a conventional airliner - missing the wings and horizontal stabilizers. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was riding my bike on our street when I looked at our house and noticed green smoke above our house. I told my cousin who was 6 and in the front yard. I went in the house and told my mother about it. I remember she was frying chicken and at first did not believe me but she finally came outside with me and saw the same thing. The smoke had almost all faded away when this object apeared out of nowhere above our house. It looked close enough you could have thrown a rock up at it and hit it. I assume we were looking up at the bottom of it, it was round and glowing like a full moon, the color was sort of a white or gray, it looked metalic. I remember there were several neighbors around  that saw it. My father came home and he saw it, I remember him saying ""come on down here"" and my mother telling him to shutup. It suddenly disapeared before our eyes, I don't think it vanished but it just moved away very fast. After it vanished the green smoke apeared again and then slowly faded away. It repeated this again later, maybe an hour, im not sure, my mother had called the police, but it had vanished again by the time they got there. She even called Keesler Air Force Base to see if there was any weather balloons out or anything and they said no. I remember later the same night the door bell started ringing rappidly and it was 2 teenage girls very scared saying that they had seen a ufo but it was not above our house like we had seen it was a little distance from them and they could see the side of it, I remember them saying it had blinking lights around the side, I dont remember what colors and they said it was moving and an airplane was moving toward it and it suddenly disapeared. Later after the girls left, we were looking up in the air in the front yard and we saw a a orange colored streak in the air above us but this looked a great distance in the air, high or higher than an airplane, the object making the streak was round and also looked orange and then it looked like it made a couple of small circles and the object got smaller and smaller and disapeared.The object never made a sound any of the times we saw it. I was only 7 at the time but it seemed like it was a couple days later when the Pascagoula ufo incident occured where the 2 men where abducted by aliens. I sometimes tell people what I saw, some believe me and others get a laugh out of it, but I don't get mad at them because if I hadn't seen it I might be sceptical about ufo's and life on other planets..

I went absolutly nutz for two days tring to figure out how and where I lost 2 hours, to the point of my head really hurting me.  At this point I felt (somehow) that if I stoped thinking about it, the pain would stop, and it did.  It was years before I could recall this without pain.  Between the 2 foot steps, I nearly stumbled and caught myself from falling at that point a drop of blood fell on my right hand, I reached to my forhead and felt a small indentation (I've often wondered about an implant). AND one night while watching TV, a very high pitched sound filled the room and the 1/4 inch plate glass over the picture tube...shattered, I was then that I realised/wondered if it came from me as I felt a strange sensation over my right eye.

Our parents ""pooh-poohed"" this of course, but changed their minds a couple of days later when the Coloorado Springs paper carried reports of sightings that same night around the same time (tho' describing green, blue, etc. in addition to orange) from the Colo. Springs area, east of Woodland Park, and further east of Colo. Springs. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS, DATED MAY 29, 2017)) I want to amend a report: Colorado 8/15/55 Woodland Park.  I neglected to mention it was night, I thought around 20:00.  However, the report above mine, Colorado 8/15/56 Colorado Springs, was probably the same sighting.  That reporter said he saw no reports about it, though there were report in the Colo. Springs Gazette the next day.   I probably saw the object in Woodland Park, which is 20 miles west of Colo. Springs, around 21:15--21:30 and they saw it (and apparently other objects), travelling east, shortly thereafter.  I was probably wrong about the date, August, but 1956 not 1955.  I heard you mention the Colo. Springs report on Coast to Coast about three weeks ago.  That's what prompted me to look at my report.

This was when you can still see the stars in the S.W. burbs of Chicago. I can't remember the exact date or year. I was 6, 7, or 8 years old. It was hot out so it was in the summer and it was pretty dark out by 21:00 hrs. We were all facing N. and looking straight up. Out of the corner of my eye I seen a flash or streak of light come in from my left. Immediately I thought it was a meteor because of the speed and distance it was in the sky. Then the really amazing part was when it changed directions twice without slowing down and zipped away just as fast as it arrived. My Father didn't see it and my Brother said He did but I don't remember exactly what He said at the time. There was no dout that thing was not from this planet.  The details again: Streak of light from S.W. to N.E. Very high altitude,upper atmosphere at least. Zig Zag pattern at the tail end of streak. destinct triangular shape at each point it changed direction (reminded me of the little ship in the video game ""Asteroids"" by Atari.) The speed of the thing was what you would expect a meteor to be travaling at. The size was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length. With the altitude it was at it must have been very large if it were at ground level. It was just an outline of a triangle really, I don't know if it had its own light source or it was glowing due to the speed and the atmosphere itself, but all three sides were very distinct as it changed directions both times. First and only sighting so far but it was the real thing so i'm very satisfied. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-01-17T00:00:00,41.7398,-87.8095

As the smaller unlit disc entered into the are where the larger disc was, they disappeared from light also. We wouold also see disc shaped clouds over our heads while working on our ranch. It would often be windy and the disc shaped cloud was often close - about the height you to throw a ball - and wouold sit stationary, while the clouds were flying by.

We then came back.......and so dit it! Just out of high school four of us friends went to a undeveloped area high on a hill, just south of gresham Or. We liked this place because of the view of the valley, and the fact that we could recieve our favorite radio stations (because of the elevation) much better. On this particular night we were just talking & happy it was a weekend night & that we could stay out late etc. (back then ""kid's had a curfew). All of a sudden the ""atmosphere"" changed. I dont know how to explain it other than to recall how all of a sudden we were all quiet and uncomfortable....about something. After a minute or two I saw a dim white light shinning towards us (or at least visible to us) coming from a ridge about 150-200 yards away, and probably 200 feet higher in elevation than where our car (a 1968 Chrysler 300 2 door) was parked. This light slowly started moving from the east to the south on somewhat of a semi-circular path. All 4 of us were discusing, as this was happening, how there were no road's or path's in the area that this light (if it were a person w/flashlight, or motor vehicle)could of been traversing. It(the light) seemed to be demanding all of our attention, and we were all (as I learned later) experiencing a sense of ""fear"" about this thing. We were in a place which we knew extremely well, with regard to the terain, and the proximity of this moving light, and there was no explination we could contrive in our mind's, either individually or collectively, that could explain it's movement. The ""light"" continued on it's path moving from where it started (in full view of the passenger side of our car) to a point south, almost directly behind our car (about 200-300 yard's) Everyone in the car had to turn totally around and now view this thing out of the large rear window of the car. The light started to fade out and disappeared all together for about 10 seconds. When it reappeared it was much closer to our position than it had been before. It started to fade again, then went out all together (aga! in) After a few seconds it reappeared and it was much closer to the car (again) and probably only 50 yards away. It started to fade again, and I yelled at the driver to start the car and get the *$%#& out of there NOW! I just knew that when it reappeared again, it'd be right on top of us! We shot down the very steep gravel road at probably 50 m.p.h., and had to stop at the bottom to make a turn and go back to ""Downtown"" Gresham. We did go back and told a couple other people we knew about what happened, and they wanted to go back up there right away! Two of the people on the first trip had to go home, but My next door neighbor (who was there with me the first time....about 30 minutes earlier now), and myself, rode back up with ""Duane & Jim"" in Duanes 1963 corvair. On the way up to the hill we told them in detail what we saw, and instead of questioning us or expressing any doubt, they seemed to be uncharacteristically quiet & apprehensive. When we got near to the base of the gravel road, after about a 10 minute ride, there were Two police car's parked face to face in the middle of the little country road that intersected with the road that went up the hill.They were about 50 feet from where we had to turn. The strangest thing happened. both of their dome lights were on, as were the red flashing lights on top of their car's (no blue lights back then!) The policemen, one in each car, were simply staring straight ahead, & not even moving, or looking at our car which literely had to slow to about one mile per hour, and pass within 3-4 inches of their car's to avoid going off in the ditch on our side! Why didnt the police move? Why didnt they even look at us? Sitting in the corvair, passing them, we were only 4-5 feet from where they sat in their own car's! We could see their expressions! Nothing!! We turned and went back up the hill & talked for maybe a half hour about what the police could of been doing and exactly where we had seen the lights earlier that night. Everything seemed ""normal"" there, and maybe du! e to the fact that ""Duane & Jim"" hadnt been there earlier, they were starting to joke around & talk about other thing's. After another 10-15 minutes, I got what I can only describe as a terrible feeling of ""being watched"" Things were immediately different, because before I said a word Duane (the driver) said ""let's go"", and ""Larry"" (my neighbor) who was there before, looked at me with a ""really bad look"" in his eyes. I remember saying out loud ""Wait"" ""It is back"". After only a few seconds a large bluish white ""orb"" with an orangish colored ""fog"" around it flew from down the hill closer to where the police car's were, to directly above the corvair! I remember in detail looking at it above the car (maybe 25-50 ft.) with my head out the passenger window! We all saw it! After what seemed like only a couple seconds it was just gone! I dont know where or what direction it went, it was just out of there. We went down the hill, found that the police cars had left, and drove back into downtown Gresham. It was very strange how none of us were scared, we just seemed to accept what we saw, and decided that we had a special experience of some sort, and wouldnt mention it to the police or newspapers etc. Not even to other people we knew. The experience seemed like it affected us all on some sort of energy level. I guess I have had many thoughts, since that time that MUCH MORE than a couple seconds were spent underneath that thing, but have never persued any sort of hypnosis or regression therapy to try & find out what really occured. I just ""know"" in my mind (as do the others that were there) that much more happened that night than we are able to report. Maybe someday I will remember those missing part's! These thing's are very real! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-01-17T00:00:00,45.49032888888889,-122.40389111111111

It had the brightness of a street lamp, but just looked strange to me. To my surprise, the object rose straight up, appeared to pause, then slowly started to move toward us, across the lake. As it approached, we could hear a distant whistling sound, followed by a whirring engine sound, then a faint low rumble. As it came even closer, we noticed that it was actually a dark rectangle with a  colored light at each corner. I recall seeing at least one red light, and a green light. It moved VERY slowly, and was not more than 100-150 ft overhead. It was VERY loud, also. There were many houses just behind us, but we didn't see anyone come out to look, which has always baffled us. My dad had previously been in the Air Force, and he noticed what he called ""super-structure"" underneath the craft. He described seeing 'girders' underneath the craft, as well. He said that it was moving too slowly to make that much noise. The craft moved directly over our heads, and disappeared behind some trees.  As a strange addendum, when we got back to the cottage, we told my mom, and she came outside. We immediately saw the same craft (I assume) in the sky, much higher up, with no sound audible this time. Even stranger, the very next year, we stayed at a different cottage on the same lake, and I was half-expecting to see the object again. I had a different friend with me this time, and early in the AM of July 4th (Exactly one year later), we were sleeping, and I was awakened by my dog's whining. I heard the same faint whistling and whirring sounds outside, woke everyone up, and I was actually shouting ""It's here!!"" We went outside to find the same type of craft moving overhead, a bit higher up than the previous year. My parents were flabbergasted, and I was giddy.

When the boys reached me again, the lights moved, hesitated, and then flew at incredible speed toward the late afternoon sun until it quickly disappeared as a star into the sky. There had been no sound and no turbulence.  Moreover, as I think back, the most amazing aspect of this experience was that I accepted it. ! I muttered, ""imagine that,"" to myself and walked the dog home.  I made no effort to talk to the boys about it, nor did they say anything to me.  I forgot all about it until I went to the movie ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" In the scene where the three small triangular light crafts fly through the toll gates of the freeway setting off the alarm, I pointed at the screen and cried out: ""That's what I saw!""  Then I was embarrassed,but my memory of the event had returned. I do remember seeing posted on a bulletin board at the Northern Illinois University student union a notice from a professor at a university in Chicago who was collecting reports of UFO sightings, but I made no effort to contact him, or to report my experience to anyone else.

I had to have been 3-4years old! But the memory stayed with me all these years.In 1997 living in Los Angeles I went home to visit my mom who is still living and 78yrs young. My conversation started out one day as Mom I know Im not dreaming this but do you remember...before I could finish she said I know what youre going to say and yes you did see it. So, I went on to describe what I remembered seeing which was a silver cigar shaped object flying above this old school building in the background. She said talk to your aunt she remembers it too.At that time I didnt have the opportunity to do so.  But in March of 2002 I was visiting my mother again after her stroke.And at that time my aunt was there too. So we talked about it and she verified the same thing my mom had said yes we did see it. The lights around it and everything.  It scared everyone so bad it wasnt talked about except between the two of them.It wasnt discussed even with my uncle nor my father.  They checked the papers to see if anyone had reported it because this happened in broad daylight. They listened to the radio but nothing reported.At that time they didnt want to appear ""nuts"" so they just kept it to themselves.  They felt that being it was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and since we saw it others had to have seen it.At that point my mother said no one said a word the adults had been sitting on my aunts front porch and we kids were playing on the sidewalk running in and out of the gate.They just gathered up  and we got in the car and were taken home. Now, thats where our memories differ. I remembered everything they described.  But I also remember more. What I can add to the memory is that the object came down and hit hovered above the ground in the field next to the school.  It had to bemaybe 4-5 feet above the ground. Given the fact that I was just a child and not tall. I remember looking at the star ship and the lights around it was pulsating around the middle of it like a neon light goes around in a circle. The windows were rectangular panels but their were no seams. It all looked like one piece. it wasnt a shiny metal craft but it was a silver color.  For whatever reason I wasnt afraid.  Next, I remember being on the sidewalk across the street from it and in one of the rectangular panels was a little being about my size.This little person was in proportion in size. He appeared to have large eyes and tho his dress was like part of him it was as if we communicated through telepathy and he was saying goodbye and he raised his hand as if to wave at me.  This is the even more strange part...Nothing was moving but me and as I ran back to the gate opening at my aunts house all of a sudden motion started, I felt a slight jolt as things started moving again.  Everyone was jumping up gathering us up and getting home in a hurry without saying a word as to what had just happened. I had buried it in my mind til my own son had turned about the same age I was at the time and began to show me he had some special ""gifts"" from God. It triggered that memory in my mind.

It appeared to be 1/2 - 3/4 mile to our west 50-100 ft above the ground. Suddenly from our South-East a bright white light crossed a great expanse of the sky in an arcing path at an unbeleivable rate of speed and came to a stop next to the light we had first observed.They remained this way motionless,altrenating colors for several minutes.Then just as quickly as it appeared the second light left in the same path it had taken to join the first light.The first light then left in a path that took it due west and arcing up at a high rate of travel.Even though this happened some 45 years ago, and I was only 5 years old, I rember it like it was yesterday. I don`t remember it because of the sighting, I will always rember it because of what happened to a five year old boy later that very night and again the following winter of the same year! After 45 years of trying to explain what happened to me later that night and again about two months later,( to myself)I beleive I may have had two encounters with the source of those lights. There are only two logical explinations for what I experienced. Either the sighting caused nightmares, or I was abducted by them twice for approximately 2 hours each time. I sincerely think I was abducted because of several things that point to me not being asleep, before , during,or after the encounters. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,,

This time I had one or two friends with me.  On the third night, I gathered a group of the other members in my dorm (perhaps 8-15 others), and we all watched it do the same exact thing.

I got the impression someone was looking down on us, I was 15 years of age at that time. After about 5 min. it first moved off slowly traveling in a north easterly direction heading out over lake Michigan then it suddenly speeded up in a flash and was out of sight in a matter of a couple of seconds.

Everyone went back to what ever it was they were doing as if it never happened. My father still lives in Chicago at this time at the age of 83 and my two brother's are now in their fifties, I am 57.

PD)) My brother. At a family gathering in the early 1960s when my brother, who served in a special part of the armed forces, revealed that the military was fully aware of the existence of UFOS. My brother, now deceased, had worked in what he described as ""missile guidance systems"" He told us, as part of the schooling, he and about 30 others received special training in reading radar and being able to identify UFOs from other aircraft.  He said the military did not want an accidental nuclear exchange as a result of confusing UFOs with possible missile launchings from the People’s Republic of China or the Soviet Union. He told also told us that during Cuban missile crisis he spent 2 weeks in a deep underground missile complex waiting for orders that might lead to world war 3. The army, he said, not only revealed UFO existence but also trained him and the others of his crew in how recognize their peculiar movements and characteristics on radar. The military, he told us revealed nothing more other then they were just here. My secretary. In 1978 I hired a 70-year-old woman named ((namd deleted)), as my secretary. I was director of an organization that planned and created activities for older Americans. ((name deleted)) told me when she was a young woman in her early 20s (around 1928) and living in the state of Wyoming, she used to get up early in the morning 2 or 3 times a week and play golf. She recounted one very early summer morning just after 4:30 am she walked about a quarter of a mile to the golf course. When she reached the top off a small hill overlooking the playing area, she said she was stunned to see a greenish glowing sphere-like object setting about 10 feet off the ground. She told me she was so shocked that had she could not move. She described it as being approximately 50 feet in diameter with oval shaped windows around the top third area.  She said she knew instinctively it was not from our world.  After nearly 10 minutes of just staring at this most unusual sight she said the object rose slowly from its position and began making a faint humming noise. Then quite suddenly it just streaked away and was gone with in a few seconds. She never told anyone about this for 25 years for fear people would think she was crazy. I believed this ((name deleted))’s story because she always told me the truth. If she did not like how I was running the Agency she would tell me about it and not always pleasantly.  She was a no-nonsense person who believed neither in God, nor honest politicians. The airline pilot: For a few months in 1980 I worked at a car rental agency. One of my duties was to go to the Seattle International airport and pick up airline flight crew and bring them back for a car rental. Every time I picked up a pilot I would always find some way of asking them if they had ever seen a UFO. Every pilot but two replied no. I felt some were even irritated with the question but most were good sports and gave me their opinion (usually negative) on the subject. A few told me while they did not believe in them, other airline pilot friends did report seeing them on occasion. One evening I picked up an airline pilot captain whose name was Frank. When I asked Frank if he had ever seen anything strange like a UFO, he was very silent for a few minutes. I thought maybe he was insulted by the question. I was worried he would tell my boss. However, to my surprise he opened up and told a very interesting story. During the Carter administration, I was flying out of Washington DC with not only the regulars (passengers) but I had the Secretary of Transportation, and his staff on board.  We were about 20 miles out when three green globes or spheres appeared in front of my plane.  He said they appeared to be about 50 feet or better in diameter and were flying formation.  We not only had visual, but they were being tracked from ground radar.  He told me; because these objects were in front of the plane none of the passengers were aware of what was going on. I called the Secretary of transportation to my cockpit. I wanted a witness and I thought he would want to know. I thought this would be the biggest news story of the century. I asked him if they might have been experimental craft. He said flatly; ""No"" He said there were oval shaped windows or what appeared to be windows around the top third of the sphere. ""Not one of my flight crew nor did the secretary of transportation think they were other then what they appeared to be, some kind of space craft from another world. I found it remarkable that the type of craft described by both ((name deleted)) and the Airline pilot were identical even thought the two events took place more then 30 years apart. I wrote this report becuase I thought it was my public duty. If you care to print it or just keep it on record is fine either way with me. Thank you.

I was recently scanning thru old sightings on your websight and came across one of  great interest to me.  It concerned a woman who spotted a flying object over the 605 freeway in 1977 or 1978 (she couldn't remember exact date).  This sighting was actually posted in 2000, since the woman was new to the web.  Well, back in 1978, my neighbor told me of a VERY SIMILAR sighting that she had the night before.  She was driving home travelling south on the 605 Freeway (Southeast Los Angeles County) at 2:30 AM (the woman was driving north on 605 fwy), when she saw a bright light that she first thought to be a helicopter spotlight.  She estimated the object to be a couple of miles away.  As she drove south, the object was slowly flying north towards her.  To this day, it is a desolate stretch of freeway.  My neighbor slowed to a crawl as it approached, since it was hugh and obviously not a helicopted or airplane of any type she had ever seen.  She did not stop as it slowly flew directly over her at what she estimated to be 100 feet or so- VERY LOW.  She said it was dark in color and possibly triangle in shape and looked like some sort of ""hugh flying machine with lights.""  She was uncomfortable telling the story and had NO reason to lie and only told me after repeated questioning of the slight sunburn on ONE side of her face- which she admitted she thought was caused by object.  I  am guessing my neighbor probably saw the same object that this woman saw.  I travel the same freeway about a dozen times per week and have never seen anything unusual.

It was the summer of 1978, the month and day are approximate to my best recollection, as this happened over 20 yrs. ago. The event took place on Dell Road in the town of Heath, Mass, approximately halfway up the road. I owned property on the left side of the road at that time and a friend and me were basically just camping out on the properyt and parking alongside the road. The location of the event is fairly close to the Rowe Nuclear Power Plant and sightings at that time were very common around that nuclear power plant, unfortunately at the time there was no way to report such encounters. My friend and I had come back from Greenfield a little before 10PM after getting dinner and had parked in the location described (right side of road facing uphill). We were sitting in the vehicle (I was in the driver's seat) listening to the radio and relaxing when we suddenly noticed swirling lights all around us. It kind of startled us, we thought maybe a police car had pulled up behind us and was wondering what we were doing parked in such an isolated location. At least that was my first thought and my first comment. We were facing uphill and know there was no vehicle in front of us. I thought it had to be behind us, I rolled down my window and looked to the rear of the vehicle and there were no other vehicles on the road. I then looked up and there was a huge, very huge, object just above the treetops covering us and both sides of the road with lights underneath, the only way I can describe the lights are flashing and swirling. The exact size of the object had to be at least 40 feet in diameter and absolutely silent, it made not one bit of noise! At that point, I rolled up my window, started up the vehicle and slammed it into gear and took the uphill road with the pedal to the floor and did not look back. When we got to the top of the hill we parked at Heath Center, just past the town hall. At that point we weren't quite sure what happened. We just watched up through the windshield up into the sky! We felt a little safer being in the proximity of several houses rather than an isolated road. That was the first experience I had there, but there were more to come, which I will also post on here.

Coming around a country corner that lined around a field my brother and I saw this disk shaped silver air craft that hovered with no sound.  A window, if you will, dome to a flatter verses round shape, seemed to be the front top 1/2 to a 1/4 of craft.  It appeared that two human forms where in this window with like a panel in front of them, like a desk or control board?  I say human forms because they seem to have a round shape for a head, shoulders with arms, a body-trunk.  I could not see faces, clothing, skin, nor hair.  Just the shape of a human form, two I believe, in this window area of the craft.  This craft was that close!  Just above the tree tops.  I'm not sure if it was adrenalin from fear but my lips rolled on my teeth!  Not a drop of saliva was in my mouth.  I slowed for only moments, I'm sure, and drove away very fast with my heart pounding!  My brother and I never uttered a word at the time.  I was 17 years old he was 12 years old.  I lived on my own in a cabin on the Chocolay River that feeds into Lake Superior not far down stream.  This was very close to KI Sawyer Air Force Base, which was active at this time.  I called the air base and reported the sighting.  I'm not sure with whom I spoke but I was told there was nothing on the radar, as if they'd tell me if there was, and that if it was just above the tree tops they wouldn't see it on radar.  Still so frightened my little brother slept with me that night, one bedroom cabin but he could of slept on the couch.  I had lace curtains on the two pain (one on top of the other) slide up windows. Close to the ground, if you where outside the bottom of the window would be at waist level.  I had no way to totally close the outside form inside.  This craft, I swear, hovered over my cabin about two miles from the incident not long after I had arrived home and called the Air Force Base with report.  My little brother and I just clung to one another with fear, light from this craft shown through the windows of the bedroom.  Now I wa! s use to B-52 flying over constantly and never had this happen before or after this incident.  From that day on until about 4 years ago, I've moved out of the area, i.e. state, I had dreams, which is nightmares of UFO’s in the sky there down by the Chocolay River and by my home on Silver Creek Road, all in close proximity of incident.  My brother and I didn't and don't speak of this incident.  I'm now 42 years old and he's 37.  We both have families of our own now and have not experienced some thing like this since.  Of course as time has gone on I'm sure he has as well as my self, talked ourselves into believing it didn't happen.  Yeah know what?  Some thing did happen and we couldn't explain it and still can't.  So for what it's worth this is my UFO story.  Every one doesn't have one, I do. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was either the night of Nov. 18, 1978 or Nov. 27, 1978...the 18th was the day of the Jim Jones People's Temple killings and the 27th the day of the Mayor Moscone/Harvey Milk killings in SF. I had been listing to news of Jim Jones on the radio all week, then of the Moscone/Milk murders, so I am a little mixed up as to which night it was, but am pretty sure it was the 27th, because it was the 2nd huge event in a week. (The sighting was reported in the Ukiah Daily Journal on the front page the next day, after being reported by others). I was driving south on Hwy. 101 just south of town...1/2 mile, after dark listening to the radio. Then I noticed that the top of my windshield was lit up a little. I looked up and there was a cloud which seemed to glow. I pulled over to get a better look at it and noticed a hitchhiker up the road from me about 300'. He was looking up too. I got out of the car and this huge cloud looked as if the moon was behind it, but the moon was behind the mountains to the south east and hadn't risen over them yet. As I watched, a sphere began to show inside the cloud. There was no sound at all. Then beams of light came out from it like a Star of David over Bethlehem. At first it seemed more like a religious experience. I felt this overwhelming feeling of awe. Then I looked into my car at my camera on the seat thinking that I should take pictures. But, amazingly i didn't. I have no idea why i didn't and after I thought to get the camera, I have no recollection of thinking about the camera again. The cloud seemed to clear and I could see this ball of light. Then the beams went back inside the sphere and the clouds went around it again and it moved west and back around the mountains. I was so amazed and jumped in the car to go home. I was thinking, ""Wait till I tell ((name deleted)) (my sister) about this. I also thought I would pick up the hitch hiker and ask him about what he saw. I don't remember driving past him or seeing him, or don't remember anything about the 5 minute drive home until I pulled up to my mailbox. I went into the house with NO memory of the saucer!!! I never called my sister about it. I didn't think of it or remember anything about it. I just turned on TV and that was that!  But, the next day when I got the paper, here was the story. Other people had seen the same thing. Then, when I saw that story I though, ""What? I saw something too, why didn't I remember that?"" I was dumbfounded! It took about an hour for me to get the details to come back to me. At first I just knew I saw the cloud with some shape and it took the hour for it all to come back. Then I couldn't believe I had forgot it and didn't pick up the hitchhikier, didn't take a photo and didn't call my sister and didn't even remember this...one of th emost amazing experiences of my life! So, they must have done something to block my memory. I have no idea if I lost any time either. I also saw a UFO when I was a little boy north of Buffalo in Niagara County, at night. Then my sister and neighbor saw it again over the woods the next day. But, the article may still be on file on microfilm at the Ukiah library or at the daily journal. I have seen photos of the same thing from Mexico City and Montreal.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,39.1266,-123.2805

As an amateur astronomer, I did volunteer work for the US Naval Observatory back in the late 60's.  This was in the early days of satellite before many precise measurements could be made from orbit.  My groups function, as ground based telescope observers, was to precisely time star occultation's, for the most part as they disappeared and reappeared behind the moon.  Just some background on my 'observing' experience. My sighting was not during these exercises but during an outing to a drive-in theater.  It was still light out and I was biding time waiting for it to be dark enough for the movies to begin.  Above and to the left of the screen I noticed an object (I would place it as North, North - West, to the left of the Mt. Lemmon/Catalina range as you face it from north/west Tucson and about 30 deg. above the horizon) I can best describe as blimp shaped but somewhat narrower, pointed ends, silver in color but I don't recall it as being reflective, NO protrusions such as the cabin or fins that a blimp would have.  I first thought that it was some kind of experimental weather balloon but I noticed two other factors that didn't fit that profile. The first was a cloud looking trail, long and snake like but detached from the object as if the object had stopped or stalled where it now was.  The observance of the trail (white/gray colored) lead me to the second observation of the object, neither the trail or the object were moving much if at all.  Now I'm starting to realize how distant in height and large this object is.  My estimate is maybe three football fields in length although it is very difficult to estimate since there weren't any nearby objects to compare it to.  The object and the trail seemed to stay pretty much in the same position for the next 15 minutes of so. There was a noticeable but slow drift and change in the trail during this time. During that time, I took advantage of other witnesses in the car next to me.  I remember there being at least three people in that vehicle, a convertible.  I asked them what they thought the object was.  I still remember the reply clearly, a fellow sitting in the front seat starred again at the object and said ""I'll tell you what, I'm in the Air Force and it's nothing that I have ever seen"" (Tucson as you know is the home of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base).  This was great confirmation that my imagination wasn't playing tricks on me. I hated to loose sight of the object but before it was totally dark, I wanted to make my way the snack bar and use the pay phone to call the newspaper and ask if there were any reports coming in.  They didn't even seem to comprehend my question so I didn't get very far in that direction.  It really made me wonder if they were playing dumb!  Here this object was in plain sight, dozens of people just at the drive-in could observe it, surely you would think the newspaper would have some reports.  Maybe I just called too soon or just got the wrong individual.  As I went back to read your archives to see if there were any related sightings, another report brought back something I had observed some years earlier although not really a UFO sighting.  as a preteen/teenager in Tucson , I use to make an almost daily trek from my home to the nearby drugstore.  The route took me through a small area of undeveloped property (desert vegetation), a route I knew with my eyes closed.  On one trip to the store (1959-61?) I couldn't help noticing a round area where all the cactus and shrubs had been smashed to the ground, a perfectly round area.  Not a very large area maybe 10ft.  I also noticed some tracks, each track mark had three indentations as if a foot with three pads or toes.  I'm fuzzy on the space between the tracks, could have been two feet or more apart but I'm not sure I remember the actual spacing.  Could be rabbit tracks or... well I'm not much for recognizing animal tracks, I'll leave that to someone else.  End report. ((NUFORC Note:  Dates of two incidents are approximate.

One followed by three followed by two followed by one and so on.  The craft stayed in one place for maybe three minutes and then began moving at a constant speed. It traveled at a speed that allowed it to remain just as clear as it appeared when not moving.  It traveled some distance but I can not make a sound judgement as to that amount.  It returned to the near vicinity of the first sighting and then turned ninety degrees and went over the houses and out of sight.   Entire viewing was somewhere around five minutes.

I had never then or now seen aircraft fly at this rate of speed. An airplane would take at least a couple minutes or longer to cross from horizon to horizon depending on altitude. I had the impression that their altitude was very high because there was absolutely no engine sound what so ever, although I have no way of knowing this for sure. They did not have the appearance of stars or meteorites, as they were not distinct points of light. They rather had a sort of oval or round shape but it was hard to tell because they had the appearance of diffused white light. We, as kids would, knew they were ""space ships"". There was no other explaination. We had spent much time sleeping out in the backyard on hot summer nights counting shooting stars.

We have amended the date above.  PD)) I Saw The Kecksberg UFO!  It was a warm December night in 1965.  I was 14 years old and my cousin John was 12 years old as we left my house to sneak a few cigarettes down the alley.  We lived in the suburban community of Bridgeville; 12 miles southwest of downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  We came to this lithographic building which had a loading dock in the back.  It was the perfect place to sit and smoke in secret.  We knew we had to leave soon.  The time was getting late into the evening.  But, before we made our way back to my house:  Something pierced the night's sky over my left shoulder.  Our heads turned to the left and our eyes could not help but notice a bright ball of light!  Both John and I were stunned.  Our mouths dropped.  The object was about the size of a full moon and it trailed sparks or little bits of light.  The odd thing about it was the thing did not fall straight down.  The UFO went laterally; sideways; almost up!  Whatever this was...it could not have been a meteor.  A shooting star (or space debris) falls down.  A natural object does not move horizontally.  Meteors do not go up.  There was no sound.  We could not tell its distance from us since the object appeared just like a big dot of light.  This was no saucer with lights or any kind of features.  The entire sighting lasted for approximately 5 seconds.  Then, the object passed over the southern hill; behind the trees of what was called Cook School hill.  John and I immediately reacted.  We ran to my house very excited.  My father, an old skeptic, thought we were crazy.  UFOs were not a part of his belief-system.  Nevertheless, I convinced him to drive us up to the top of the hill and check to see if anything came down there.  At the time, my cousin and I thought the thing could have hit somewhere around Cook School.  My father humored us and drove us around.  We saw nothing strange.  This convinced my dad that there was nothing to this UFO business.  'Ah, UFOs' he would say and had a good laugh at my expense.  Thirty-eight years had passed.  I don't smoke cigarettes anymore.  I had seen a number of UFOs in my life.  When looking back at the past, I almost did not put this experience in with those other unexplainables.  Probably, the reason was it did resemble a close meteor fall.  I assumed this was merely a natural event and was nothing extraterrestrial.  Very recently, on television's Sci-Fi Channel, they showed previews of 'Kecksberg Exposed.'  This was a 2-hour special hosted by Bryan Gumball. I looked forward to this because they were calling it the 'new Roswell' and it happened in the Pittsburgh area; my home town.  Minutes into the show, my mouth dropped (as it did 38 years ago) and I said 'Oh, my freaking God.'  I saw the Kecksberg UFO!  I certainly should have heard of this event and I'm a little ashamed that I'm not that up on UFO history.  Actually, I'm glad that I didn't put 2 and 2 together before this point because that would have lessened the revelation that occurred during the documentary.  The most compelling factors in the show that led me to conclude I saw it was:  1) This was the time I had my sighting; late one warm December night in 1965.  2)  Kecksberg is 25 miles southwest of Pittsburgh; Bridgeville is 12 miles southwest of Pittsburgh.  The object moved south and it appeared to us to pass over the southern hill.  3) The UFO, according to all reports, did look similar to a meteor.  In an old newsreel film, an interviewer asked a very young Kecksberg resident:  'What did it look like?'  The boy answered:  'A star on fire.'  A street in the small farming town of Kecksberg was named METEOR Street because of this encounter with the object.  People who were able to get a good look at it said that it was acorn-shaped.  An acorn monument was erected in the town and stands to this day.  The first reports came out of Canada and the thing in the night's sky continued southward.  The UFO buzzed the Pittsburgh area and turned...which, of course, indicates that it was not a natural phenomena.  Thousands of reports flooded into news agencies.  KDKA received hundreds of calls alone.  If I was only mature enough, I would have searched through newspapers the next day.  This would have told me that my cousin and I were not alone in our observation.  Kecksberg was another Roswell because the military was dispatched.  Oncemore...government agents, soldiers, Men in Black converged on a small American town.  Guns were pointed at citizens; people's lives were threatened; there were 'radiation' scares; and authorities told people to lie.  People witnessed that federal 'suits' seemed to give orders to the military.  This convergence of government officials does not happen when a meteor falls to Earth.  Of course, there are those that will say the Kecksberg UFO was a piece of Soviet intelligence...and that was the reason for military intervention.  The same was said about Roswell.  A large, flatbed truck was seen entering the wooded area where the thing seemed to come to a soft landing.  The truck was empty when it went in and covered when it left.  To this day, the Kecksberg controversy rages on as townspeople are divided as to what really occurred.  Some deny the fallen object and that feds made any appearance at all.  Others claim to have had been in direct contact with government intimidation.  This writer is very pleased that something did happen at Kecksberg.  I wish my father was alive so I could tell him that I was not crazy.  Or...look dad; there are many others that are just as crazy as I am.

My husband and I were newly married and lived at ((address deleted)) NW 56th, Seattle, in the Ballard neighborhood, one block up from Market St. and just above the Hiram Chittenden Locks.  One late afternoon we were out and decided to drive by his Mother's house.  When we arrived, we spotted a telescope on her front porch aimed toward the sky.  Since she was a bit off the wall, my husband said, ""I don't even want to know what that's about"" and kept on driving.  A couple of days later his mother and sister who lived with the Mother came by for a visit. During the conversation they mentioned that they had been watching flying saucers and one was above our house.  They lived further up from us on Sunset Hill about a mile.  I told them that if they ever see these flying saucers again to please let us know because we want to see them also.  A couple of nights later at about 10:30 pm there was a terrible banging on our back door.  It was the Mother and sister saying that the flying saucer was out in front of our house.  So we all four ran out to see and sure enough, off toward the Magnolia neighborhood we could see something in the sky and it was coming our way.  It was round with a dome on top and had two or three different colored lights around the area where the dome met the saucer - it is hard after all this time to recall the color of the lights but to guess I'd say they were red, green and white.  When it got closer and we could see the bottom the lights were all one color and maybe whitish or off white color.  This thing came over by us and hovered above us about 200' or 250' and possibly less.  It just stayed in that spot and did not move for a long time -- maybe 10 or 15 minutes.  In that circumstance, one does not think about time.   Eventually, the saucer/dome moved toward the locks and out toward Shilshole Bay and out of our sight.  I don't remember hearing any type of engine or other noise.  My husband and I only say this the one time but my Mother-in-law and her daughter saw it many times durin! g that Summer.  There was never anything in the papers or news about anyone else seeing this thing.  I was careful who I told this story to but it did get out a little and a few other people came up to me at work and said they too had seen such things but none were in the Seattle area.

All of the lights on the car went out also except the idiot lights on the dash.  I put the flashlight togather and it would not work.  I took out my lighter and got out to check the engine.  My mother was helping look for loose wire ect. and was right next to me.  Being late at night and next/ between wood and a swampy area you hear a lot of frogs, owls,dos and other night dwellers calling.  When the noise stopped my mom started looking around to see why.  I was still under the hood trying to see what was wrong with the car.  When mom asked me what that thing was I didn't really understand what she was talking about until she pointed out the craft.  As there was no moon its a little hard to tell the size but I think that it was about as big as a football field long and twenty to thirty feet high.  It had lights around the edge.  These lights flashed in an altrenating pattern of red, white, yellow and blue or green.  There was no noise at all and it was moving very slowly following the power lines down the river.  I guess that we watched this object for three to five minutes.  In all this time there wasn't a sound from any animal in the area, but the minute that it went out of sight all the frog, owls ect. started back up.  Mom and I got back in the car and were trying to figure out what to do whent I noticed that the headlamps were back on.  I looked at Mom and said maybe the car would start.  Sure enough it started just like a new car and we drove on to Lone Rock and the first bar.  That was the only time I have ever had a drink before going to work. Mom and I only talke to each other about this for years.  No one else.  After she died in 1981 I did talk to a few other people but they seem to think that I was having fun at their expense.

I cannot remember the exact date or time but I just discovered your site and want to tell you what happen about 1980. My wife, (infant)child and I just returned home to our rural farm house from an out of town trip. It was dark, cold out and very clear. As we rushed the sleeping child in the house from the car she took him upstairs and I went to kitchen sink to get a drink of water.To my right we have a pantry about ten feet deep and a window at the end facing the east and a flat corn field that rises about two hundred yards out. I noticed out of the corner of my eye a star outside the window, it seemed very bright but it was clear out so I assumed it was still a star.Then it occurd to me it could be a planet so I grabbed the binoculars we kept on the pantry shelf and walked up to the window to look at it. Just as I raise the binoculars up my wife stepped in the dark pantry and asked what I was doing. I asked her to look at the bright star it could be a planet. She did as I looked throught the glasses. She commented on how bright it was just as I got focused. I could actually see two lights that appeared as one with the naked eye. between the lights you could make out a silver looking saucer shaped body. I was sceptical of what I saw and asked my wife to look through the glasses and tell me what she saw. As she focused she discribed exactly what I saw.We stood there for a couple minutes and exchanged the binoculars a couple times when all of a sudden as I was viewing  it took off away from us at a rate of speed you could not immagine. I know it was going away from us because it didn't leave in a straight line, it swept off in an arc. She thought it disappeared with the naked eye but I could actually see it leaving. I estimate it was over the corn field about 200 yard from the house maybe a little further. It appeared to be maybe 25-30 feet long and about 5-6 feet thick at the center and the lights where white as bright as a car light. It appeared to be stationary at 150 to 200 feet high until it left.

That evening I was listening to activity on a local northern California ham repeater. One of the guys came up and announced that there was a station on the air from a rare african country. I was interested in working that station, so I needed to go out to the back yard to crank up my tower all the way to the 50 foot level. When not being used, I normally left my tower cranked all the way down to the 20 foot level. That is because if strong winds came, I wouldn't have to worry about the possibility of the tower and antennas coming down on my roof- or the neighbors. When I got outside, I cranked the tower all the way up. It took a couple of minutes to do it. As I had finished the cranking, I stood there with my hand on the crank, catching my breath and looking up at the antenna and sky. One thing I noticed was that for an April night, it was unusually warm outside; it seemed like it wasn't that early in the year, it was so warm. Also I noticed how clear the sky was, it was a completely clear and starry night and it was calm. As I was looking up at the antenna and sky, suddenly I saw from the corner of my left eye a very bright light up in the sky approach from a northerly direction. (I was standing there facing in an easterly direction.) It came so fast, in a fraction of a second, that I didn't know what was happening. The best way that I can describe it, from the brief instant that it was there, was that it was an extremely bright flash of white light, coming from the north. The next thing I knew, I was looking straight up again, now shocked and in awe with what I was seeing. Above my antenna at an unknown height, there was a hovering object! It was difficult to judge the altitude of the object. It could have been at least several hundred feet above the ground or much more, because I could see the whole object including the aura around it between the space of two of the aluminum elements which my antenna was made of, without being blocked by the antenna elements- the view of it was completely unobstructed by the antenna elements. The object was a crisscross grid of 8 or 10 bars that were glowing an intense, extremely dark red color. I tried to look between the red bars of the grid to see more, the area looked opaque and was a less dark red. The light that emanated from this object was not blinding- I could look up and see it very clearly. Around the outside edge of the dark red grid there was a shimmering orange aura, of which I also took note. The orange aura around the grid was fairly narrow, maybe one fifth or so the size of the grid itself. The hazy aura shimmered in waves, akin to the way you see heat waves on the highway ahead when driving on a very hot day. The waves of the aura were shimmering at a slow, uniform rate. After I looked up at this thing for about 10 seconds, I closed my eyes tightly, faced down to the ground and shook my head in disbelief. Then I opened my eyes and looked up again. It was still there! Around this time, the thought crossed my mind- ""I wonder what the expression on my face looked like to them if something up there was in fact watching, if they saw the look of dread that must have been on my face"".I studied it some more, and after 15 seconds or so, it suddenly vanished. I looked all around the sky above, but it was in vain. It left no trace of what had become of it, where it had gone, that I could see. During the time that this all happened, I detected no sounds at all. It is my assumption that this all came about because of the fact that I was quickly cranking up my tower with antenna from the 20 foot nested level to the 50 foot fully extended level and the activity and movement called its attention to this location. However, I get the impression that it was possibly not of any consequence to it whether or not I was standing by the base of the tower to see its approach. I only happened to be standing there, still catching my breath. It seems to me that the focus of attention was most likely directed at the antenna and tower and their movement upwards. Possibly the deep red-colored grid was the mode that they were in to take readings or observations. I had this feeling, anyway. I was very shocked by what had happened, and most any time that I think of what I saw, chills usually come up my back. Some months later on a visit to my parents, I told them about what had happened. Mom asked if I had been able to look at it standing clear of the antenna. I wish that it had been possible to do that, but there was not enough time. I can hardly believe that it happened myself, it was so strange. I have an added afterthought- When going back inside, I went into the radio room. I tried to operate the equipment, but I felt disoriented and stupefied. When I figured out I couldn't clearly tell what I was doing, I gave it up for the night.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,38.22604202898551,-122.65297500000001

The sky was bright and clear. They were flying in a triangle formation. When they were close enough for me to identify them, they looked like three burning, smoking clouds.  They were no more than 200 feet high, and they passed almost directly overhead. The bottom of these ""clouds"" looked like pure flame, violently churning inward toward the middle. The tops of these ""clouds"" were sort of bubbling, as the smoke did not rise in a column, but stayed with the body of these clouds of flame and smoke.  I have never seen clouds like this before, nor have I seen any since. Some might think that the sun was setting, so the bottom of the clouds were reflecting the sun, but very high in the sky, I could see white clouds, and for them not to reflect the same red from the sun should be proof enough that it was not taken at sunset.  These three clouds made no sound as they passed overhead at about two hundred feet, and traveling 60 to 80 miles an hour. These three clouds looked totally out of place for the sky above them. As they traveled toward me, a small amount of ""smoke"" did trail off from them. I remember the feeling of the hairs on my arm standing up, but I attributed this to static electricity.  I remember thinking how weird, and unnatural they looked, but my first thought was they were some kind of tempture anomaly. Now all this would be left up to speculation, and disbelief if it wasn't for the fact that I had a still camera with me, and I took pictures of these three strange clouds as they came toward me.  It wasn't until the movie Independence Day that I ever saw anything like clouds associated with UFOs. Recently I was listening to a program on television, and heard someone talking about UFOs that hid in a cloud or appeared like clouds. This made me look for the photos I have had for so long. I have found two of the three pictures I know I have. Two coming toward me, and one after they passed by and moving away from me.

The sky was crystal clear  which made it wierd, starry and a 2/3 waxing moon was up. It was about 8pm. We got on the Northway heading south at Exit 30 and a minute or 2 down the road I was the first to notice a well lighted Object hanging about 500 feet off ther ground and just east of the road. At first I thought it was a helicopter and mentioned this to my secretary, and we both said no. Then it suddenly dawned on the both of us that it was a UFO. It was so close that we see could see its complete outline and details of its structure. Its perimeter was outlined with red lights, One bright red at each 90 degrees with two smaller red lights in between. There was a huge flood light at its bottom center pointing to the ground. And the top turret system had multiple lights aimed in many directions. It was approximately 50 to 60 yards in diameter. It was dead silent. It slowly floated just barely of center as it hung, something like a gyroscope gently wabbles as it spins ever so slightly. The moon was at just the right angle to illuminate its upper surface. The finish was flat or buff, metallic grey, and there were no markings on the hull or fusilage. We had had trouble with our car earlier, so I didn't stop, but we did pull over to the shoulder and slow down to a crawl while we observed it. Then some trees came up between it and us in the center island and when we came out on the other side, it was gone. Did it land or take off we couldn't tell. When got home inn Glens Falls, I called the local police and Channel 13 in Albany, and they all blew me off like was a crackpot. Since then, I was talking with one of my friends who lived on Lake George for  many years and he told me that he had seen light like formations flying down along the lake several times when lived there, especially in the dead of winter, when the lake was frozen and no one was really around. My ownb personal theory is that there may be a landing port somewhere in the depths of the Adirondacks for one large reason- Ther are some heavy iron deposits in the Adirondacks that will even throw off a compass. What a great area under which to conceal a UFO landing port! That's it. That's my story. I wouldn't tell it any more because people look at me wierd when I do, but I have a witness, my secretary, who still works for me after all these years. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was flying parallel to the ground when I saw it.  I drove another few miles on Hwy 90 east of Crosby and turned onto a road heading north and saw three objects ""floating"" over the area.  I drove past a bank of trees and saw that the three objects were helicopters and they appeared to be looking for the object  I watched for a while and it appeared they found what they were looking for and landed.  Another time in I believe 1983, my mother and I were coming home about 8pm and turned off Hwy 90 just east of Crosby and noticed something thru the trees over a field of a local grass farm. We drove and cleared the trees and saw what I described as an orange football shaped object, maybe 20 ft across, just hanging in the air above the field, perhaps 100 yards above the field.  There were no other lights or sounds, just there. I should note that Mom described the object as red.  There was a white Vega that had stopped in the road ahead of us and the driver had stopped his car, got out and was standing by his car just looking at it.  I pulled in behind him and did the same, stopping the car and turning our lights out, just looking at the object.

This happened in January 1986. I remember it vividly because 1986 was the year that you were supposed to be able to see Haley's Comet and we had binoculars ready just in case. It was 9pm. My 9 year old son had gone to bed at 8:30-he slept on the top bunk of bunkbeds. He came out of his room and told me that he was scared because he was lying in his bed looking out of the window and said that there was something above our neighbors house across the street. He said that it was white and had different colored lights on it and it was just sitting above the roof. I went and looked out of his window and saw what he was describing...a white object with a green light on the top and a green light on the bottom. Across the center was a row of red,blue,yellow, and green lights that appeared to be blinking across it. The object was circular and was just hovering there. It was approximately the size of between a nickel and dime held at arms length and was hovering above the house across the street. I went and got my (now ex) husband, my son and 7 year old daughter and we went out onto the front lawn with the binoculars to get a closer look. The object was a luminous white with the lights as described above and continued to hover...occasionally it would weave slightly to the left or right, but basically returned to the same position above our neighbors house. My husband kept saying that maybe it could be a Christmas ornament that someone strung up above the house, but I said that no one in their right mind would have climbed up that high to string up an ornament that big AFTER Christmas was over. By 10pm, the object was still hovering there, so I went inside and called my best friend up on the phone(who lived at the end of our street)and she came up to our house to be my ""witness"" and saw the object with us. We all stayed outside in the cold staring at this thing until 11pm.It made absolutely no sound at all. By this time my kids were petrified and so was I. We went into the house and I proceeded to call the Yarmouth Police to ask them if they had gotten any calls about this thing. The answering officer started laughing at me when I described it and said that he had a phone number he was supposed to give out to anyone who called with a ""sighting"". I was so humiliated by his laughing that I just hung up. I do, however, remember being the most scared I have ever been in my life. I went around the house locking all the windows and doors and my husband was laughing at me saying that if ""they"" (meaning whatever was inside this thing) really wanted to get into our house, locked doors and windows weren't going to stop them. My 9 year old son was so afraid that he had to sleep with us that night. The last time I dared to look out was 11:30pm, and this thing was still in the sky above our neighbor's house. I and my son (now 26) will never forget this experience. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but it is unusual for a genuine UFO to hover in the same spot for two hours.  Moreover, such an event almost certainly would have caused a ""pulse"" of sightings and activity, which apparently did not occur.  Based on the description of the object, and given that it was a winter sighting, we believe that the first possibility to be ruled out in this case would be a ""sighting"" of the star, ""Sirius,"" which is VERY prominent, and VERY chromatic, in the sky.  If the witnesses were looking to the east from their home, that is a possibility.  If it was not Sirius, we do not know what they witnessed.  PD))",2004-01-17T00:00:00,41.6713,-70.1916

Later that night when the CT got off duty he came to our house with his wife (who worked for the Captain of the base) and had us come out and witness witness the UFO hovering silently up in the air.  It was a gray disc shape with red and green lights on the bottom and was completely silent.  Could not s see the top of it as it was overhead.  It was hard to judge the size but the night was sparkling clear that far out in the desert.  It was not a weather balloon as it was too big and did not move but hovered silently.  I did not stay up to witness it leaving as my wife and I both had to report to work early in the morning and we were conscientious workers and did not drink or smoke.  This is an authentic report from a military e-9 (30 years service) and his wife who worked for the U.S. Government.  My wife went to work at Supply the next morning and when she reported it, they all laughed at her.  The E-8 or E-9 who worked at the Transmitter site was demoted the next day to Barracks Master at Arms.  What does this tell us.  Were they flying a captured UFO in that remote area or was it from outer space and our government knows about it. Quite a mystery that I will never solve in my lifetime.

As it seemed to stop moving we noticed the dark outline of what we called a stinger protruding from the bottom center of the craft. The craft looked to be about 125ft long and 35ft high, the stinger looked about 20ft long. after it stoped a lite shower of dull sparks (embers) emitted from the bottom of stinger in a cone shape. the glowing died out as the embers fell. (it looked like the embers from professionl fire works as they fall to the ground and slowly die out). the craft had lights and what looked like windows on different levels and most of the length of it. After the ember showers the craft started its zig zag pattern but going away from us. We would look at each other than look back up and everytime we did this the craft would start moving faster and further untill the last time we looked at each other and looked up-- it had diapeared.(we did not know at the time that this was a typical reported movement).

I know airplanes, helicopters and weather balloons, obviously this was none of those. I forgot to say there was never any noise made by this craft and it was about 10 pm. We were not into ufo's back then and did not have any preconception of ufo's. one night about 5years ago I was listening to the art bell show and I thought I heard a caller say something about a ufo they saw with sparks emitting from the bottom but it was the end of ! the conversation and I was half asleep.

We all belonged to the Church of Scientology, and they had secretly smuggled a bunch of us down there where we were to study the mechanics of Dianetics and Scientology, for our own benefit and that of the Sea Org, as it was called then.  We were housed in one large tent which was situated some 2,000 ft., or not quite a half mile from the ocean, where which was the vast expance of rocky bluffs above the actual beach, that were maybe 40 to 50 ft high in most places.  One night around 11:30 someone noticed the lights over the ocean, so we all went out to the edge of the bluffs to watch.  Six brilliant diamond shaped craft were dancing in some irregular pattern over the coast, maybe no more than two miles out.  These craft would sometimes actually stop momentarily, then streak off again in some strange angle, seemingly mentally connecting with all of us. Even today, mant years later my brother and my friend and I often discuss this incident that happened so many years ago. We did feel a distinct feeling that not only did these craft know we were there, but that they were actually trying to communicate with us. We know that these craft were from somewhere out of our world. Two weeks earlir we all experienced a light as bright as the sun outside our tent, so we went outside and saw a disk shaped sphere glowing flourescent white intense light.  These were the incidents that we all wish to report. ((NUFORC Note:  The date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))",2003-10-31T00:00:00,,

Over Negros Island, Philippines, by amateur astronomer working on Observatory dome BACOLOD CITY (10-deg/50-min N-lat; 122-deg/51-min E-long;) Province of Occidental Negros PHILIPPINES  It was a clear sunny mid-afternoon day, and I was on our rooftop supervising the construction of the Observatory dome.  At the time, the other witness was doing the welding job on the dome while I was seated (on the roof)facing due east. Then this ""light"" which I would estimate to be of magnitude (brightness) of about -2 or -3.0 (or about the brightness of Venus at the time of its greatest brilliancy or a little brighter), caught my attention. (But Venus could never be more than 48 degrees in angular distance from the sun during the times of its greatest elongation,so Venus is definitely ruled out as a possibility). If my memory serves me right, I think I also called the attention of the welder/laborer to this bright object.  It was moving too slow, but not slow enough compared to an aircraft (viewed flying from a far distance).  My initial comprehension was that it was an aircraft somehow reflecting the afternoon sun which was at my back, due west, at the time. Looking at it, however, I could not discern any noticeable appendage(s)that would indicate its nature as an aircraft- and that the object simply appeared as a bright (starlike) object against the (blue of the) daytime sky. What caught my interest was the fact that the light (from my perspective and viewpoint) did not appear to be reflected sunlight in a way.  It was about 40 degrees altitude when first seen, and its rather slow movement in the sky towards a northernly direction took it inside some cloud cover after which it was not seen again (though it was still visible through portions of cloud breaks). A few seconds after it was first sighted, the intense (starlike) lighting seemed to have faded to a dull metallic (greyish) color, but I could still not discern any noticeable appendages or structures to indicate that it was an aircraft. From its apparent distance, no sound was heard (although no sound may be expected even from a passing aircraft at that distance which I have no way of estimating).  It is common for me to watch a commercial airliner from Australia passing through the sky at about this time of the afternoon, but it was at a different date than its usual flight schedule.  Also, the commercial jet aircraft leaves contrails. That object did not. All these/ the sighting took no less than 2 minutes- but could not have been more than 3-minutes, in duration.  It could not have been a balloon or blimp since we don't have (normally) these things flying around in a country like the Philippines. As a non-professional (amateur) astronomer and formerly a Field Investigator for CUFOS, I am inclined to believe it may have been a mis-identified man-made aircraft of some kind, UNLESS it was indeed something OTHERWISE.

Taichung is in central Taiwan and accessible to the whole island within a 2 hour drive.  On this particular day, my boss from the USA and I had visited a factory south of the city and were returning to Taichung in the late afternoon via the north/south freeway.  There is a Taiwan Air Force base near the city (CCK) that was formerly used by the US as a base for flying supplies to Viet Nam, and the freeway passes directly beneath the final part of the landing strip and the ocean approach.  The planes on final cross the freeway perhaps 400-500 feet above the ground at this point.  The landing strip itself has two parallel runways and it's common for fighter type airplanes to land 2 at the same time.  As we approached the flight path area, two F-104G fighters were crossing the flight path directly in front of us preparing to land.  Directly behind one of the F-104's was and oval shaped object, about the same length as the F-104 (maybe 30 feet long), dull silver in color and perhaps 10-15 feet thick at the thickest part.  It was perhaps 10-15 feet behind the tailpipe of the airplane.   In an instant, the object flew off at a right angle, and as luck would have it, directly in my line of sight.  It just got smaller and smaller and disapeared in an instant into a clear sky with good visibility on the ground.  I'm pushing 70 now and haven't mentioned this experience to anyone since I saw it, since I didn't want anyone to think I was a nutcase.   I've had a life long interest in aviation and earned a private pilot license back in the early '60's.  Because of this, I watch the sky a lot and see many things that others don't see.

After a few seconds, the light would gradually re-appear in a different location then where it had disappeared and move across the sky in it's illregular fasion.  Occasionally it would do perfect 90 degree turns without stopping.  The lights of an aircraft flying at commercial jet height was spoted by us and at that time the light did another 90 degree turn and excellerated at an amazing rate and seemed to be intercepting the aircraft we spotted.  It stopped short of the aircraft and again faded from view. Watching the actions of this object gave us all the impression it was coming into our atmosphere too hot and had to exit.  That might explain the difference in location of appearence when it would fade out.  No one on this camping trip really had an active interest in U.F.O.'s or had seen anything they believed to be one.

In the mid-1990's, I don't remember the exact date, I was awakened one night from a dream by my own screams.  My wife, quite naturally, was awakened by my cries and frantically asked what was wrong.  After calming down and bringing my heart rate down I told her that I had had a nightmare that seemed so real to me even after waking that I was shivering with fear.  It was a dream about a close encounter with a UFO.  Before I go much further, let me tell you about myself.  I am a former United States Marine Corps aviator.  I flew as a ((deleted--senior crew member)) on KC-130 aircraft for ((deleted--approximately 10)) years.  I have an IQ that has been tested to be over 160, am well educated, well traveled and very well respected by my peers.  I am currently working as a field operations officer for a large multi-national, multi-billion dollar corporation and hold a great deal of responsibility in my position.  I am a practical, straightforward individual, known for my calm, reasoned, common sense approach to problem solving and crisis management.  I have an extensive knowledge of both military and civilian aircraft, their characteristics, abilities as well as appearance and am a licensed A&P aircraft mechanic.   Back to my story...  The dream I had just had was of me driving in a car which I recognized as a late 80's model Chevy Berretta.  In the car with me were 3 others, a female in the front passenger seat and a male-female couple in the back seat with the male behind myself.  As I recounted the dream to my wife we both assumed that the car in question was that of a friend of ours, ((name deleted)).  We both commented it strange that I would dream of driving her car as ((name deleted)) would never in a million years let anyone drive her beloved car.  It also seemed strange to me that I did not recognize either of the females in the car as being ((name deleted)), or as my wife for that matter, but yet I felt some connection to the woman in the passenger seat.  I also felt as though we were driving home from the movies though it was more a feeling than any part of the dream.  As the dream unfolded we were driving along a stretch of road which crossed under another hi-way, like an interstate.  After passing the interstate we approached a rise in the road.  From beyond the crest in the road there was a bright light as though a truck with its headlights on bright was approaching.  As we continued driving up the rise the light became intensely bright, so white it was tinged with blue and blocked out our vision of the surroundings, yet did not hurt the eyes.  Once we crested the rise I was able to see a short valley that the road descended down into.  At the bottom of this depression there were two glowing objects.  Each was approximately 50 feet in height, cylindrical in shape with flared out conical bases.  (Very similar to the game pieces in the old game SORRY.)   The objects were sitting on either side of the road and were the source of the light, though no ""lights"" themselves could be seen.  It was as if the entire object was glowing with this intense blue-white light.  When I was able to shake myself from the sight of these objects I could feel that I was no longer driving the car, we were being drawn towards them as though caught in the sci-fi classic ""tractor beam"".  At this point I, along with my companions in the vehicle, began to scream.  It was at this point the dream ended and I awoke.  (FYI: I have had goose bumps the entire time I wrote this.  I am hesitant to think about the dream very often these days.)  I had the dream only once.  I would sometimes think about it and try to place where the dream took place.  At this point it did not bother me much to think about the dream.  It was kind of a mind exercise to figure out where it had taken place.  The overwhelming feeling that I was driving ((name deleted)) Beretta home from the movies led me to believe that the dream took place in the suburbs of Chicago where I live and I imagined several likely locations, though none exactly matched the dream.  The fact that the car had a light color interior in the dream, and that ((name deleted)) car had a dark interior was another part of the dream which I could not rationalize. Over time I began to let the dream fade I rarely thought of it.  About two years or so after having the dream I was in a conversation with some people talking about cars.  We were talking about the first car we ever owned and it was then that it hit me like a ton of bricks.  In the summer of 1988 I had left active duty in the USMC to go back to college and had bought a red 1988 Chevy Beretta with a light sand colored interior.  The car in the dream was mine.  Suddenly it all came back to me in a flash.  From that moment on the memory of the dream has never failed to bring on goose bumps, and occasional tears.  The girl in the front seat was my girlfriend at the time, the man in the back seat her brother, and the other woman his girlfriend.  I was living in North Freedom, Wisconsin that summer of 1988 after taking a summer job in the area.  The four of us had gone to the movies at a drive-in early that evening in Madison and had returned home late.  We stopped in Wisconsin Dells and had gone skinny-dipping in the river at a place known as ""Bare-Assed Beach"".  After getting in the car we drove back towards Baraboo to drop the three of them off before I drove on to North Freedom.  The next morning I remember waking in my bed with no recollection of the drive from the Dells back home.  After my revelation I was able to place the hi-way we crossed under as I-94, though I do not know if it was the US Rte. 12 underpass or one of the ones west of there, but that is definitely the rough location of my encounter.  I have long since lost contact with my companions that night and have no idea if any of them have ever had similar dreams.  As I have stated I only had the dream once.  Several years later however, in the late 1990's I had a second dream more terrifying than the first.  This time it all made sense from the start.  The dream took place in ""downtown"" North Freedom.  (I say downtown in quotes because it is such a small town, population 600, there is little else but a few lonely brick storefronts.)  The dream took place at night.  I was returning home from Baraboo in my 1988 Beretta and had arrived in North Freedom.  Being late at night the gas station was closed and there was nowhere to get a soda other than the Coke machine outside of one of the buildings downtown.  As I got out of my car with the change for the machine in hand, I looked up into the cloudless sky and saw the millions of twinkling stars.  I just stood there and stared for a long while at them.  I had some training in celestial navigation and was trying to pick out the major constellations, planets and stars.  My stargazing over I then started walking across the main intersection in the center of town towards the pop machine.  As I walked I felt a slight tug at my jacket.  Then another tug.  Suddenly I felt myself being pulled upwards off my feet, into the air by collar of my jacket, my arms pinioned by the sleeves.  As I began to rise at a faster and faster rate I looked up again, but this time saw no stars.  Instead I saw large black circular object blocking the sky from my sight as it hovered overhead.  At this point I again screamed and awoke.  I guess I should also state that being a former Marine I do not scare easily and have never screamed that I can recall in my entire life.  Whether or not these are just dreams or actual encounters I do not know for sure, but I will say this, I have NEVER, EVER had such realistic dreams.  To this day I can see and feel every aspect of the dream; the colors, the smells, the fear.

We parked at the top of a hill. Just as my mom and dad exited the car I heard my dad say ""what the hell is that?"" He sounded afraid. I jumped out of the car and stood next to them and in the night sky very close to us was a round, well light ufo. I say UFO because I simply don't know what else to call it. I was very young, about 8 at the time and really in shock so I can't give much in the way of detail. The craft seemed to be hoovering in one spot and I do recall an eerie sound. The only time I have ever heard a sound like that again was during an earthquake. The only way I could describe it would be as a moaning noise that went up and down in pitch. After staring at the craft for a moment or two, it just dropped straight down very quickly and then shot off in a straight line and was gone. I have never really discussed this with anyone even my mom and dad. I think we were all too shaken to ever discuss it again. I have only one other memory of that incident. I beleive it was the next day. Walking thru a little country market with my parents. I was still very shaken and I honestly don't remember what happened between watching that craft shoot off and when I was next walking in the store.

It was a clear bright December afternoon, with clear blue sky, unlimited view.  We were driving north on U.S. 165 from Kinder toward Alexandria, La. We had left the town of Oakdale and was about seven miles north headed toward the small town of Glenmora, La.  We were just chatting and I was looking out the window to the right where I was seated in the passangers seat.  I felt very funny all over as if something were wrong.  I looked forward and saw a very bright silver object hovering over the highway about a mile or so in front of us.  At first I didn't beleave what I was seeing was real but I saw that all of the cars in front of us had pulled off the highway and stopped.  I reached for my camera, a Canon QL Pellex, I had a lens on it that was for close in shots.  I was watching the object as we pulled over and stopped, attempting to change to my 135 telephoto lens and get out of the car to take pictures. (I WAS TOO LATE)  The object was hovering at what appeared to be about 400 to 500 feet directly above the highway.  The craft or object pevited from level to about 30 deg.s up on the right and moved at a very rapid rate to about 1500 to 2000 feet, stopped, leveled and became stationary.  The object did exactly the reverse and moved back to the level position over the roadway.  The craft or object glinting in the sun, did the same to the left as it did to the right.  Each time it moved it stayed for only two or three seconds in each position.  It then moved back to the level position over the highway and repeated its identical movement to the right once again.  It moved back to the center over the highway and paused, it tilted to a position of about 45 to 60 degree angle to the up side to the left.  The craft accelerated from zero to completly out of sight is only in only one second. The acceleration was unbeleaveable, the craft was visable for the first what appeared to be 10,000 feet as it became fainter and disappeared.  I was in the Air Force at the time and I was on leave before re! porting to my new station.  I never reported the sighting to anyone before now.  I do not beleave in UFO's or abductions by anyone from other planets.  I do not beleave that anyone from other worlds have ever lived here or visited hear.  I think we have developed these objects ourselves or they are the deamons of saton attempting to fool people.  What I saw was real in my mind and all who saw it, but it could have been deamon fooling all of us at the same time.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,,

This star was blinking on and off, about twice per second. It was as bright as surrounding stars.  Initially, it was not moving, just blinking.  This is was caught my eye, the fact that it did not move.  Had it moved, I would have thought it to be a plane.  But it stayed it one spot for about 15 minutes, never moving.  We wondered what kind of aircraft could stay so stationary.  Even a helicopter would have moved a bit in 15 minutes.  Then suddenly the blinking star instantly moved from its position horizontally about 10 deg.  Then it instantly moved diagonally, then vertically, then one way or another.  It would hold in one position for a few seconds, then instantly move again.  If you imagine a piece of cardboard with many little white lightbulbs randomly mounted on it about one or two inches apart, and wired so you could light individual lightbulbs, and then you randomly light the various lightbulbs every couple of seconds, this would be an approximation of what we saw.  After about 15 minutes of this star jumping about, it moved to about 10 deg. above the horizon and then slowly moved away to the south, moving in the way an airplane would appear flying along, straight and even flight, no longer jumping about.

When I was eleven years old, my family was visiting my grandparents in Kansas (where I now live)during summer vacation.  The date I gave is an estimate, because I am not entirely sure what month it was, though we usually visited around the Fourth.  I am certain it was 1972, because I know I was eleven.  I also am not certain of the time, but it was early afternoon. My grandparents (mother's side)lived in a small house (where my parents now live) on the corner of a tree-lined street.  I was inside, in my grandparent's living room, when I heard the music from the ice cream truck in the general vicinity.  (I remember each of these details vividly because of what happened that day).  I begged my mother for money so I could go run after the truck and get an ice cream treat.  My mother was hurrying around to find me enough change, and as soon as I had it, I ran out the door.  As I was leaving my grandparent's house, I saw the ice cream truck driving up the street on the west side of their house, which ends up curving back around toward the northeast on the next block.  I hurried because the truck was going around the curve and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to catch it. As I was crossing the street, what I saw stopped me dead in my tracks and I completely forgot the ice cream truck.  Hovering right above me, at about tree-top level, was (what I later would tell everyone) a ""flying saucer"".  The diameter of the saucer was about the same as the width of the street, which is a pretty narrow street, a little over the width of two cars.  It looked exactly like a flying saucer out of some horrible B movie.  It was metallic and exactly saucer shaped, and I was looking up at it, not directly underneath, but looking at it from about a 30 degree angle.  It seems weird, but I remember seeing what looked like rivets on the underside, but it all happened so quickly, I can't be sure about that.  Anyway, the ""saucer"" hovered above me, motionless and completely silent, for maybe five seconds, then before I had time to react in any way at all, it took off suddenly and ""zipped"" straight off to the northeast from the house.  It was gone from my sight in maybe two to three seconds. I can remember seeing it last as it just cleared the rooftop of the house across the street.  This detail is so vivid in my head, that I still think of that house as pink, as it was then.  (Now it is cream colored).  I then reacted, appropriately, I believe, and ran in the house screaming and hysterical.  I remember telling my mother ""Call the newspaper!  Call the newspaper!"".  No one called anyone, because I guess they didn't know what to think of the whole thing.  My mother says now that I had told her at the time it had little blinking lights as well.  This event is still talked about in my family, ""I remember the day you saw the flying saucer"" and I get teased about it from my cousins to this day.  It has always been very frustrating for me, because it was broad daylight, and I never knew if anyone else saw it or not.  I wish I had had someone else with me that day, but anyway, it is all true.  When I hear ""experts"" say there is a logical explanation for all UFO's, I just think it is because they have never been witness to something like what I saw, or they wouldn't say such things. I am 42 now, and a mechanical engineer in the aircraft industry.  My father is also an engineer, very pragmatic and logical. He told me many years after my sighting (after his mother died...my other grandmother) that she used to look out her kitchen window across the pasture (they lived on a cattle ranch in Texas) and had several times seen ""saucers"" hovering above the field.  She told him and my grandpa and aunt about this, but my dad said she didn't want anyone else to know because she was afraid they would think she was crazy. (She was a very stern school teacher).  He only told me after she died.  My father has always believed me, as he did my grandmother. Anyway, that is my story. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))",2003-10-31T00:00:00,,

We first thought it was a commercial jet, but we heard no engine sound at all.  I estimate the altitude to have been fifteen to twenty thousand feet.  About the time the object was directly overhead, we heard what sounded like a military aircraft in hot pursuit.  Its rate of closure was fast enough that it was about to overtake the silent object.  We stood transfixed as the silent object made a precise 90 degree turn to the southwest and accelerated OUT OF SIGHT in no more than two seconds, leaving the military aircraft helplessly behind.  We watched for a short time after that, but nothing else happened.  That is all we saw.  I verbally verified it with my elderly friend to be sure we both saw the same event. She confirmed that she had.  About the same period of time, I can't remember if it was before or after, along this same stretch of road, a farmer lost some of his pigs to mutilation.  Their nostrils and rectums were surgically removed.  No tracks led up to or away from the carcasses. Local law enforcement was unable to make any determination as to who or what it was.

We do not understand why the National Security Agency would be interested in a UFO sighting, since it would have been an agency interested in domestic events that would have pursued the event, we believe.  PD) Family encounters with glowing objects, spanning 50 yrs., for three members. I preface by saying events filled the lives of my family, in the early 1970's, leading to my being contacted by NSA. One evening, I heard a flying device in my living room, which decended, after the wall became physically transparent to it. It ""appeared"" to me, a basketball-sized sphere. It flew off at a 45* angle, retreating up and away. I could hear it whooshing, all the while. My bus. partner was in the next room. I began having dreams of floating up, from my yard, into a craft. I will never tell what transpired, in the dream, as I entered the craft, in order to prevent copy-cat stories. I heard from my sister, she knew of what I spoke. So, I am not alone. My business partner and I began having esp, and I dreamt future events. I told him of my dreams. One night, we were driving in the piney woods area of east TX. After midnight, and all alone, a hugh, very large object, glowing red, appeared as we crested a hill. It was up ahead, on the right, over a field. It flew down, as if landing, across our road, but instead, circled us. It repeated the manuever. Something was ""talking"" in my head. I said, ""They want me to turn left, just up there!"" No road was visible, and my partner questioned how I knew. I said, they are telling me, it is right up there. Sure enough. And my partner said, ""You have never been here, before. How did you know!"" So, I turned onto the small road, and came to a stop, and said, ""They are telling me that if I am not prepared for this, I am free to leave. They offer me that choice."" He said, ""Go! Let's see them!"" I began to shake, being only 18 yr. old. I said ""No. I'm not ready for this!!!"" I turned around, away from the craft, which was on the ground, up ahead, in a field. I drove off. My partner was very upset with me. I was young, and too naive. If only, I had more maturity. I have since regretted that choice, beyond words. Two others in my family had similar experiences. One had an object ""beam"" him, with a light that ""grew, forward"". They had lost time, and a car that had all the wires charred, leaving them stranded. My sister got cancer of her chest. Their watches never worked again. The word got out, and when I was in the Navy, two years later, I was taken to D.C., and questioned by NSA, while I was in the back of a car. I told them our experiences. There were two men. Even after I left the military, one of them came to my home, and asked me to move, to a city near my sister, 400 miles away. I declined. I believe now, they wanted to conduct research, of some sort. Years passed, life was not easy, because of health. Then, on May 14, 1998, five objects literally materialized. I was ""prompted"" to go outside, I carried my cat, with me. I looked up, and they were stoboscopic, decending at a soft angle, and then the strobe stopped. They glowed blue-white. They were maybe 150 ft.,up. They assumed a chevron, with one extra object(ship?), on the right. They then turned, in formation, pointing to where we first encountered, years before. Then they flew there, at a fast speed, and disappeared, over the horizon. I  ""felt"" they said, ""Not to forget you."" I should have returned to our first meeting place, but did not, because that was not overtly sensed. Perhaps I was not receptive, and maybe they had, indeed, returned. I'll never know. I have lived a difficult life, and just wanted someone to know. BTW, my wife used to be awakened by my crying out in my sleep, about ""them touching me"". My marriage was short lived. She did not accept the existance of life elsewhere. What she, or others reject, is irrelevant to what I know. Thank you for allowing me to at least write about this.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,31.315223243243246,-94.74656594594593

It had been raining and was extreamly dark. At that time I was still on time, when I came to the cross-roads I took the same turn I always took on to rt. 252 going towards Brunswick Ga. I drove this route many times on my way to Kingsport NJ. to make deliveries. I was driving a tracktor trailer and was loaded with shower bases. As I drove up rt. 252 something seemed to change, things got really quite. The night seemed to become still and black my head lights were not going out as far as they normally did, I couldn't see very far in frount of me, and the amount of distance I could see seemed not to change.All of a sudden I came up to a singe in the road, it was the same one I had turned at about a half houre earlier. I thought that it might of been a differant cross-road, so I took rt.252 again, and drove for another half houre or so then I came to the cross-roads again. Then I figured that someone might of changed the signes, but I knew that I turned the right way, but that direction wasn't doing any good kept comming back to the same cross-roads.I stoped and looked at my map and picked a differant route to Brunswick,I desided to take rt.40 to Kingsland then take 17 up to Brunswick, I turned on to Rt. 40 and headed east on 40 for about half an houre and came back to the same cross-roads. It seemed strange that I hadn't met any other trucks or cars in all this time, I didn't know what to think, at first I was worried that I wouldn't make my drop in time, now I was worried that I wouldn't be able to go any whear and that I might be stuck in some kind of time warp or something weard like that. I tried the other routs from the Cross-roads and they all lead to the same place, the cross-roads. I really don't know how long I was in this loop but I was scared. I stoped the truck and got out , it was really strange because I could bearly hear the engin running on! the truck. It was as if it was muffled, and all around the truck was lit up it didn't seem like it came from a ""light"" the area around the truck was light enough to see the asphalt and the texture, but I could only see to a distance of about 20 feet then it was as if there was a wall of darkness out side, and it felt threatning. I was scared enough to kneel down on the road and pray that god would get me out of there. The tears were running down my cheeks as I prayed. Then I just got in the truck and started to drive this time things started to change my lights started to light up more and I could start making out things that I could remember.I headed up 252 and got into Brunswick pulled into the truck stop, and knew I was running late, as I walked in the waitress said hello as if nothing was wrong, I looked at the clock and it said 3;00 oclock right on time I wasn't behind at all.

Shape of UFO disputed.  Not disputed are three eerie green chevron shaped bow shockwaves We were heading home to Moscow, Idaho from Spokane, WA on Highway #195 when I noticed something.  I was sitting in the back of our car and looked to the west and saw what I thought was a satellite heading our direction and after a few seconds mentioned it to the rest of the occupants in our car.  After about 20 or so seconds I noticed that this object in the sky was creating a triple shook barrier in front of the craft.  These shock barriers looked like extended sergeant stripes, but were colored an eerie Halloween green color.  These shock waves or whatever they were, did not touch the prow of the object (unlike a boat cutting through the water), but there was a clear gap between the last stripe and the object.   The object seemed to me to be flying high and at a good rate of speed.  I thought it might be a SR71.  There was a orange glow behind it too!  The four of us agreed that we saw: 1)  The perfect triangular stripes that were ahead of the craft--- they seemed like they  were breaking up the atmosphere in front of it and that they extended well beyond the craft itself; 2) There was an orange glow behind the craft.  We did disagree on what the craft looked like.  My dad said it was low and he could see engines.  I say it was high and fast and my brother agreed with me.  My mom sided more towards me and my brother's version.  My dad pulled the car over, but I could not get around my Grandmother to get out and I did not want to get out on the traffic side because I did not want to get hit by a passing car.  So all in all I did not see the craft at its best when it passed in front of our car up in the sky.  I still disagree with my dad to this day on about how high up and how fast it was going and what it looked like.  However I must give this to my dad and that he is somewhat far-sighted.  He saw buzz-bombs and Me 262s flying during WW11.  I have talked to several physics professors at both the University of Idaho and Washington State University and none of them could explain the affe! cts of the apparent shockwave.  I talked to the then Idaho professor Edson Peck  (he wrote the the standardized textbook for electomagnetic waves for college students---no one could write anything better than it for at least 10 years) and he said that the atmosphere is considered a liquid, but any wave effect would not be visible to the naked eye.  Later I read a Smithsonian Air and Space magazine and it said the same thing , but they included a photograph of a supersonic jet with similar sockwaves in front of it.  The big difference was that the waves were coming directly off the prow of the aircraft and not well before it.  Also the article said that only a high speed camera like the one they used could capture the shock-waves that were apparent in the photograph.  Also I can remember after we got home to Moscow we read in the next day's paper that many people reported an orange glowing object to the Sheriffs Dept. that services the Rosalia, WA area.

We were on a third floor balcony of a building across the street from the Costa Rican embassy.  We first spotted the craft to the northwest, visible as what appeared to be a bright landing light of a jet liner down near/toward the Washington monument, slowly moving eastward.  This is when it first caught my attention, and I pointed it out to my friends, as it seemed oddly bright and large for an aircraft landing light.  It remained in this aspect for 15 - 20 seconds, when it suddenly seemed to veer into a south-east vector, with the apparence of coming toward us, passing slightly to the east of the White House.  At this point my friends and I became VERY interested, as what sort of aircraft would be permitted to operate so dramtically and closely to the presidential mansion?  The night was overcast, it was most likely a weeknight, possibly Thursday or Friday night.  As the object veered toward us, it began to cross the city at a very high rate of speed, faster than any fighter jet could traverse the city.  As it came closer and closer it presented a definite red/orange roiling disk, with no tail ot trail behind it, underneath the cloud deck.  Now we were very excited, and shocked, and some of us began to be terrified and a few ""hit the deck"", thinking it might crash into us or crash into the low hills behind us.  As it passed east of us, somewhat overhead, it was presenting a pure disk (circular, perhaps it was spheroid).  I had the impression of a roaring sound, and yet, later, I realized that it had made no actual sound.  This was the most dramatic thing I've ever seen in the nighttime sky before or since, and I was fortunate enough to have see the meteorite that later crashed in Pennsylvania in 1965 as it flamed blue-white across the sky, through our family's picture window in St. Clair Shores, Michigan.  This was SUCH a dramatic nighttime display that I couldn't WAIT to hear the official explanation the next day......but there was no report of it in the papers, and when I called the local police station, the officer handling the phone had not heard a thing about it.  The lack of reporting of this aerial phenomena was actually more bizarre, even terrifying than the phenomena itself, for how could such an astounding display, traversing the entire nation's capitol, not be noticed by others, and reported, or at least SPECULATED upon.

Reading the recent reports of a triangle shaped object prompted me to write this. In the summer of 1974 around July 4th, I went with a college friend to visit his parents in Lexington , Mississippi. One of his cousins and her friend from the L.A. area of California had also come in for the visit. They were returning to California on a late night flight out of the Jackson airport, so my friend and I drove them to the Jackson airport. After we dropped them off at the terminal, we headed back to Lexington. There was a road that ran adjacent to the Jackson airport that lead to the highway back to Lexington, and we were driving on this road. Far ahead, just above treetop level, there were three very bright lights that were positioned like landing lights on a commercial jet. The two outer lights were like the ones on a jet's wings, and the center at a slighty higher position, like the nose landing light.  We friend and I both observed the lights because of their brightness. I said they must be landing lights. We continued driving down this road and became even more curious because the lights hadn't moved at all. That ruled out their being on a jet so my friend said they must be on the sides and top of a large water tower. We came to a stop sign and needed to turn left. The lights were directly in front of us, maybe 50-100 feet above the treetops, in this heavily wooded area. There were no street lights or buildings around and it was very quiet. We had the windows rolled down in the car and the radio was not turned on.  We sat there looking at the lights wondering what they could be. They were so bright that you couldn't see what was behind them or what they were connected to, much like when you approach a parked car in a dark area and it has its headlights on. You can't see the car at all, only the bright headlights.  My friend was driving and went ahead to make the left turn. The road we were turning onto was a four lane, divided road with a dirt and grass median between the lanes. He pulled across the two lanes that were headed in the opposite direction, across the median area, and then turned left onto the shoulder of the lanes we needed to use. He then stopped the car with the foot brake and sat there withthe engine idling. Now the lights were on my left, as passenger in the car. I stared out the window at them and started to become a little frightened because this was unlike anything I'd ever seen. After a short time, my friend took his foot off the brake and started idling slowly down the shoulder.  After we had rolled only 5-10 feet, the lights suddenly rotated towards us to stay pointed directly at the side of the car, but slightly behind the car. After the rotation, they started moving beside the car, at the same speed we were going, and maintaining the position slighly behind. As soon as the rotation occurred and the lights were moving along with the car, I went into a heart pounding panic. I was so afraid of what might happen next, because the object behind the lights was big -- maybe 80 feet from the left most light to the right most. And the silence, precision and complete lack of vibration in its movement was unlike anything I had ever seen. I urged my friend to step on the gas and get the hell away, but he hesitated as he craned his neck to look out of the passenger side window. After what seemed like an eternity, he pulled onto the main part of the road and accelerated. As soon as he accelerated, the lights stopped moving, but they slowly rotated to always point directly at the car. I had my head out the passenger window so I could watch it carefully because I was so terrified it would follow us. After we had gone about 500 feet down the road, the lights started moving across the road, always staying rotated to aim at us. The movement was slow, precise and vibration free. When they reached the stand of trees on the opposite side of the road from where we had begun our acceleration, they went down smoothly and disappeared into the trees. At this point, of course, I got a little courage back and urged my friend to turn around and go back to see if we could see anything. He agreed, but we had to drive further until we got to a crossover the median. We then turned and headed back. I watched the area like a hawk during the entire time, but never saw anything else.  When we got back to the median crossover that we had used originally after the stop sign, we stopped on the shoulder before turing around. I peered into the trees but saw nothing. So we turned around at the crossover and headed back toward Lexington. I watched out the back of the car until we got back to Lexington but saw nothing else.  Neither my frind nor myself had anything to drink and didn't use any drugs. We were completely clear headed and lucid when all this occurred. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the incident is approximate.

I do not wish to mention which company or location for obvious reasons but all information can be verified by numerous witnesses that my statements are true and accurate. At approximately 10:30pm in the summer of 1973 myself and two other friends had just parked my car in a large field to have a few beers and talk and just basically enjoy the pleasant summer evening. There was a full moon that night and it seemed to be bigger and brighter than I had ever seen. The moon was so bright that even though we were parked in the middle of a large field where there were no lights anywhere for perhaps a mile or more, we could see well enough to read by.  While passing out our first beers to my buddies I happened to notice an object in the night sky which I estimated to be at an altitude of between 2500 and 3500 ft.  I thought that I had seen the object move in a triangular pattern at such a speed that I was not sure if I had actually been correct in my initial observation.   Without mentioning what I thought I had seen to the other two people who were present with me, I continued to keep my eyes on the object.  After about fifteen or twenty seconds it did it again. After seeing this happen a second time, I pointed the object out to the others and asked them to keep their eyes on it.  They both laughed and started joking about how it was probably a flying saucer.  Because none of us had ever before seen anything of the sort and didn't actually believe the stories of such reports, I suggested that it might be a new military heliocopter or something of the sort because it did not appear to have a comparable lighting arrangement to anything that I had seen before.  As the three of us kept our collective eyes on the object the craft made similar movements to the first that I had witnessed by myself.  After seeing the speed at which this craft moved and the sharp angles at which it changed direction in mid flight, the two others who were with me became very excited and immediately decided that it was indeed a UFO. After the three of us had witnessed seeing the same such movements of the object, I decided to move my car so that my headlights would be pointing directly at it. I did not turn the headlights on until I was sure that they were pointing directly at the object after which, I began to flash them on and off and from high to low beam in a fashion similar to the old light signaling technics used by the navy. After flashing my lights in this fashion for about fifteen seconds or so, I turned them off and waited to see what would happen. At first I did not think that anything would come of it but, after about twenty or so seconds, we all noticed that the object had stopped flashing in the mannor that it had been and that instead it now appeared as a white light which remained on and didnot flash at all. As we continued to watch this object we noticed that it now appeared to be getting bigger and within a few more seconds it became obvious that it was heading in our direction at a fair rate of speed. The object had dropped in altitude and was now comming in just over tree top level. As the object moved closer to us it turned off it's lights or light and as it came within the last quarter mile or so it passed directly in front of the full moon which showed a very precise silouette of what was indeed a saucer shaped craft. The moonlight was being refracted off of the craft and it was now very clear that the craft was polished silver in color. As we continued to observe this craft during the last one hundred yards or so of it's approach, one of my friends became so terrified by the sight that he wet his pants and began to panic. This person is a large man and usually afraid of nothing. The friend of mine who became terrified was attempting to hide himself behind the back seat of my car and screaming that we were all going to die and that they were going to take us and disect us. As I stood there and watched this craft, it came directly over our heads at approximately 100 to 120 feet at which time it stopped moving and just hovered in mid air. There was no sound emitted from the craft at all and there was no wind being generated such as would be from a turbine or rotor blades. The craft was so close and the light from the moon was so bright that I could make out certain details of the saucer which struck me as interesting such as, rivots along where the apparent metal panels or sections of the craft were fitted together. I could also see that the lights which were around the entire outer edge of the craft rectangular shaped and were raised somewhat from the rest of the saucers surface area perhaps as much as two inches. The lights or light covers appeared to be somewhat opaque or semi-transparent and appeared to be fairly thick.  The closest thing that I have seen to describe this craft would be the saucer that was shown on the beginning of the old TV serial called THE INVADERS which was aired back around 1969 or 1970.  The saucer continued to hover directly over head for approximately 30 seconds and then shot off towards the west so fast that all I could see was a red trail leading to where it now hovered somewhere near HWY 5 which is also in burnsville, MN.  As we continued to watch the saucer dropped down below the tree line for about another 30 seconds and then lifted up to it's original altitude of about 100 to 120 feet. It then hovered for about 15 seconds in a stationary position after which it shined what appeared to be a red lazer beam aimed at an approximate 45 degree angle into space for about 2 to 3 seconds before taking off at the same extreme rate of speed previously witnessed. As it exited our atmosphere,it followed the same precise angle and direction as the red lazer that it had projected into space. About five minutes after the exit of this craft from our atmosphere, the other two friends who were with me said they saw what they described as a giant meteor or comet shooting directly in front of the moon. I did not see this other object but did make a note of the time. When I looked at my watch it was now 11:55pm. I cannot explain the missing time. Since this experience I have discovered many new technologies and have had many experiences which have opened my eyes to what actually happened that night. I cannot get into the details at this point and it would take volumes to tell it all. Also, the truth is now out there and it will soon be widely known to the rest of the world no matter what happens to me. I have given the description of this particular event simply because it is past time to bring this subject into the light of truth. Also, there is now to much that is becomming common knowledge for my past to continue to be a threat to the extent that it has for the last thirty years. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I remember the lights more than anything. The only thing you left out from my recollection was that you suddenly yelled that the craft had gone straight up almost instantly while it was still at a great distance, and when I looked up, it was much higher over the horizon. I've always wondered to this day why I can't reconstruct an image in my mind of exactly what shape the object was, because it went almost directly over our heads at a low altitude. Oddly enough, I've been thinking about this incident a lot lately, but I don't know why. The only shape I remember was triangular. I wish I could go back to that instant and see it again. I firmly believe that UFO's are a reality, although I wonder why so many reliable sightings describe so many different sizes and shapes of these craft. If you ever remember anything else about that night, let me know. It's always gnawed at me.

I guess I want to know more about what I don't know,  and I believe that desire is healthy.  The amount of time I spend thinking about the ""U.F.O. phenomena; however, well, it might be time spent better doing something else...but I digress.  I have read some references made to a U.F.O. ""flap"" which occurred in the southeastern United States circa 1974-1975 and in fact I remember reading in the Montgomery Advertiser at that time some articles mentioning some U.F.O. sightings. What did we see that night...was it September of 1974...on our way to Auburn?   As I remember, we were going up there to a ""concert""...a band that a friend of yours was in maybe?  What I remember is this...We were on I-85 heading to Auburn from Montgomery and it seemed as if it were around 8:00 P.M. when we left Mom and Dad's.  It seems as if we were about half way to Auburn when I first noticed a bright white ""star-like/planet Venus-like light appearing many miles ahead of us on the right side of the interstate.  I had been looking at it and initially thought it was Venus.  I remember asking you to look at it and I remember even joking about wouldn't it be cool if it were a UFO but I didn't believe it was anything other than a planet or a star when I first saw it.  That is until I / we noticed it moving...crossing over the interstate and coming toward us.  I remember seeing the object changing colors and intensity from bright white, to a dimmer white, to a medium intensity red and back to white again 2 or 3 times.  The colors seemed to alternate in time from 10 to 30 seconds.  I remember the object crossing back over the interstate to our side continuing straight toward us.  I remember one or both of us saying that the object wasn't any star or planet.  I remember the object seemed to cross back over to our left and us pulling off to the shoulder of the interstate.  I remember we got out of the car, was it Dad's old Galaxy 500?  It seemed as if we sort of just leaned against the car waiting for this thing approaching us.  I remember being very excited at seeing something neither of us had ever seen before but I don't remember being at all afraid.  I know I had no doubt that you wouldn't let anything happen to me...not without one hell of a fight anyway.  When it passed overhead it seemed to be over the middle of the interstate...maybe 500 feet up.  My recollection of what exactly this thing looked like seems hazy or maybe it's because I had never before or since seen anything that looked like ""it"" ! looked.  It seemed to me to be somewhat of an elongated ""sewing-thread spool"" with the flat ends oriented to the top and bottom of the ""craft"".  I had the distinct impression there was an inside and an outside dimension to this ""thing"" because it looked as if there were a ""triangular-shaped 'window' or translucent 'something' giving me the distinct impression of looking into the ""craft"".  I remember thinking the interior was illuminated by red light but that there was some white light or lights on the exterior of this ""thing"".  It did not make a sound.  It seemed to be moving 30 to 40 m.p.h..  How big was it?  Maybe 10 times bigger than our car...I can't really get a good grasp of it's size.  I remember we watched it continue on it's way seemingly following the interstate.  I don't remember it disappearing.  I remember getting back in the car and continuing on our way and I remember wanting to turn around and try to catch back up to it.  It seems as if we did turn around at an exit but for some reason I'm not sure if it was the first exit we passed or an exit further on.  I believe we did turn around and head back towards Montgomery.  I believe we drove most of the way back to Montgomery but when we didn't see ""it"" again, we turned back toward Auburn.  I don't remember anything more of that night clearly.  I seem to remember standing in your dorm and relating our experience of the evening to a friend of yours.  Nothing else. Well, there, my recollection is put into writing.  I think it odd that I haven't written this down before now.  I absolutely don't care one wit of what anybody thinks of me recounting this event.  I  believe we saw a ""craft"" under intelligent control that night but I don't know that it was extraterrestrial.  I do know that it was something outside of any other experience I've ever had.  I hope I have another experience like it again.   I love you ((name deleted)).   I'm glad I was with you that night.  Love,",2003-10-31T00:00:00,32.55663031914894,-85.52960531914894

As I looked south from the car I was a passenger in travelling east on the 610 North Loop West I saw a very bright object moving north over south central Houston.  It caught my attention because it was a very bright object and it did not appear to be a plane.  Suddenly it stopped moving and sat still in the sky for two or three seconds.  It then moved straight up and stopped again beneath a cloud formation.  Next a light from the object projected up onto the cloud for a second and then was turned off.  The object then shot up thru the cloud and I lost sight of the object. ((NUFOR Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)),2003-10-31T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

As I sit on the poarch quite often,I see a lot of military and civilian aircraft moving between Chattanooga and Atlanta. This object was moving too SLOW to be a jet or airplane. A helicopter is ruled out for reasons mentioned earlier. The craft seemed to float almost like a blimp. I watched the craft for approximately 7 minutes float? in a straight line. At that time, a small white globe? descended from underneath the craft. The globe? stayed close to the larger craft and seemed to ""play"" around it.

This is my story:  In spring of 1992 I flew out to Salt Lake City for a 2 week long business trip.  While there I rented a fast card and for fun I drove it out to The Bonneville Salt Flats near Windover, about 100 miles west of Salt Lake City.  I spent the afternoon seeing how fast my rental car would go on the salt flats and otherwise just exploring and appreciating the beauty of the unique environment of the vast salt flats.   It is so vast that at some point in the middle I could perceive the curvature of the Earth as I could see nothing but salt as it stretched out and met the horizon and the clear blue sky.  As the Sun began to set over the far mountains to the west I headed back to the access ramp and got back on the highway toward Salt Lake City.  As I drove east and as the Sun set further I could see a car about a mile in front of me as it just turned on its tail lights and then there was another car about a mile in front of it.  I noticed as we drove for about an hour the entire time we all seemed to maintain the same relative position, about a mile apart as we traveled.  I set my cruise control for 78 MPH and just pointed the car straight as an arrow east toward my destination.  Twilight began as all shadows disappeared and some stars began to appear in the sky.  Out in the distance I was suddenly alarmed to see four extraordinary objects as they were bouncing and tumbling and heading directly towards me head-on!  They were large globular shaped bodies about 1 meter in height, not quite round and not quite consistent in form.  They were translucent so that I could clearly see an inner nucleus that was complex beyond my comprehension and appeared like many lights or eyes.  I could see each of them was spinning inside like a wheel within a wheel.  Before I could react they overtook me.  I braced for impact but then felt nothing as the tumbling objects passed right through the car.  I turned my head and followed them with my eyes and saw them clearly as they continued rolling and spinning out the back of the car.  I turned my head to put my eyes back on the road in from of me and immediately I saw four more objects heading directly for me.  These objects were like dark shadows of the others, slightly larger, duplicating their shape and motion exactly.  Again before I could react they overtook me, but this time I felt a massive impact that slowed the vehicle instantly from 78 to about 45 mph.  As before I watched the objects go through the car and out the back and then continue tumbling and spinning and following the four objects that were before them.  I turned my head back to the front as I noticed a loss of power and saw the check engine lights indicating my car had stalled.  I restarted the engine and began to bring the car back up to speed.  I looked once more behind me and saw nothing but road and darkness.  At this time I overtook the car that had been traveling a mile in from of me for the past hour.  It was moving slowly and erratically as it struggled along in the slow lane.  As I thought about why that car had been moving so slowly, I saw the next car pulled over and parked on the shoulder with its hood up and the occupants standing around looking somewhat confused.  It was only a few seconds afterwards that I realize that the objects must have caused these other vehicles to stall as did mine.  By this time I was at least ¼ mile down the highway and there was no way to turn around, so I continued on my way.  Although my car was normal after restarting the engine I do have some form of physical evidence to indicate something odd had happened that day.  To past the time I had setup a portable CD player and connected it to the car’s audio system with a cassette adapter.  It was playing at the time of the incident and at the same time that my engine stalled the CD player died.  Later I tried to have it repaired but I was told it was ""burned out"" by some kind of electrical overload.  Beyond this small piece of evidence I will tell you I have never felt quite the same since, but for me I felt somehow enhanced knowing there’s something else out there.

I should note here, before I discuss the details of the sighting, that there are several important contextual factors that should not go unmentioned. First of all, I am an amateur astonomer. Several thousand hours spent watching the sky have yieled but a single event, an anomoly if you will. The implications of this are open to debate; however, I think these particular noctunal habits strongly suggest the presence of a logical way of observing natural and unnatural (artificial) phenomena. Secondly, I have had cognitive testing performed by a praticing psychologist, and the test results indicated a very high perceptual score. Apparently this psychologist has not seen such a score over the years, save for a ""few"" other examples. With these factors in mind, hopefully my report will be given serious consideration.  As indicated above, this event took place sometime around 1992 or '93. The month was probably July, but it may have been late June or early August as well. I recall it was a clear, moonless (new moon, moon set early, or late rising) night, well after midnight, but not yet near twilight. A light breeze could  be heard in the pine and spruce trees. I was alone but with one other person, and we were sitting so that we faced, by chance, westward. My gaze, at one crucial moment, happened to be fixed on the cloudless sky some twenty degrees above the horizion. Very abruptly, as if someone had flipped on a switch, a luminous orange half-disk appeared directly in my line of sight. The half-disk moved parrallel to the horizion, from my right to my left, silent (as far as I could discern) all the while. After but a few seconds, it faded out, and I was to never see it again.  I can recall other specifics related to this ""object"": it was of a luminous, dull orange color (my impression then ,as now, is that it was self-luminous); it displayed sharp borders all around and seemed quite solid in its makeup ; the flat section was actually slightly concave, thus it wasn't quite a half-disk; it appeared to travel with the aformentioned side in front; it left no trail or train that I could observe; it's apparent size was about 150% of the moon near first-quarter.  It is interesting to note that orange half-moons as well as disks are not unknown in UFO literature, however the precise characteristics seem to vary from sighting to sighting.

That is when one of the missionaries said, hey look at the moon, it looks strange, and I already had noticed the moon earlier, and noted to him that the moon was in the opposite direction.  We stopped and stared at this large spherical glowing mass, that seemed to be translucent with mostly oranges and a hint of blue coming from it.  There was absolutely no sound.  Then suddenly, it emitted like lightning bright white, and the whole valley was alluminated, for a split second like we were part of a huge camera flash.  At this point, we were getting very nervous, we could feel static electricity in the air, litterally.  The sphere was still there, and again, about a minute later, another flash.  And then it was gone.  And the night was again to us and the half moon and clear skys.  I don't have any explanation for this, except that we all saw it and wonder to this day what it was.  I have never seen weather do this.  And it dissapeared so quickly I doubt that it could have been any aircraft, such as a helicopter hovering.  The size which would be difficult do to distance had to be large.  We could see the glow of it on that ridge that was 10 to 15 miles away, the flash seemed to come from the center of the object.  A! t this point due to my career, and being in contact with large amounts of people, I prefer to remain anonymous, with no contact, just felt this might be interesting.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,,

So, i'm sitting in my car, waiting for my engine to warm up because it was quite cold that night. I looked at Mount St-Bruno, with its lit ski Hill and at the highway coming out of Montreal to my left. To my right was the Dealership where i worked.  Suddenly, just in front and above the garage, i would say 75yards in front of me and 150feet in the air, there was what looked like 3 large redish flood lights hanging in mid air, i looked at them for about a minute, i looked for the helicopter that should have been carrying these lights, but no, there was nothing i could see. I decided to get out of the car to listen for any sounds, i could hear the traffic on the highway at about 100 yards to my left, but nothing from what had now become 1 large redish light.  Then it started moving directly toward the ski hill.  When it got close to the hill, it turned west, towards Montreal following the lenght of the mountain when all of a sudden it was just a flashlight size glow, turned 180 degrees and went back over the ski slope. Now this is what blew my mind, i could see the hill behind the glow.  Well it passed beetween two light poles on the hill, went in to the woods an vanished.  Couldn't sleep that night.

On this particular night it was snowing quite heavily.  The three of us were out side talking, (as my friend was about to leave), when my friend saw a bright light in the western sky.  At first we thought nothing of it.  As we stood there talking for about five minutes, the light never moved from its position.  At that point we relized it was not a plane.   Now, we were not really talking but paying close attention to the object.  There was no sound and it did not move from it's position in the air.  As I said it was snowing quite hard and would not have been a star.   My brother became very scared and ran back into the house.  Shortly there after my friend and I felt it would be best if he left.  I went back in the house.   When my friend arrived at his home he called me.  He told me as he drove east back towards his house, which was about 15 miles to the east of my parents house, he lost sight of the light.   After some pressure from my friend, he got me to go out to check and see if the light was still there.  I went out and looked and the light was still in the air.  It was snowing harder and the light was brighter.  I was immediatly froze in my tracks, and chills ran through my body.  I was on the cordless phone with my friend and when I didn't say any thing he started yelling.   I snapped out of it and told him it was there.  So we stayed on the phone together as I watched the object.   After about thirty minutes, I could not take the cold any longer and had to return inside.  The light was still in the sky when I went back in to the house.  I had witnessed odd lights in the night sky before, but nothing ever like this and nothing this extrordinary since.

Rest Area janitor coroborates sighting My friend and I were driving in my friend's pickup truck on the highway about 50 miles or so outside of Fort Wayne, Indiana.  It was a quiet night and no traffic on the road and we're just coasting along.  Suddenly, my friend pointed up at the sky.  ""My God,"" he said. ""That's a UFO.  Look up there.""  I put my head out the window and sure enough, there was this big black triangular, maybe closer to a boomerang-shaped ship hovering directly overhead.  It was low, too. Maybe 40, 50, feet.  Not even as high up as a trapeze act act in a circus.  On the underside there was a bright red light on one side and a green light on the other side.  Both lights flashed alternately and kind of fast. There was no sound whatsoever.  Then all of a sudden, it swooped up at full speed from its stationary hovering positiion.  I mean, it didn't start slow and accelerate.  As soon as it moved it was already at full speed.  It went in a parabolic arc to a positiion about three miles away but much higher up in the sky, still in full sight and it was a clear night anyways.  So I never lost sight of the thing. It couldn't have taken more than two seconds maybe less to travel that tremendous distance.  Then it just stopped for a few microseconds and hovered there.  Then it flew really fast in a total reversal of direction and diappeared from sight.  I was dumbfounded as was my friend. We both knew there was no technology on Earth, and neither Russia nor America was anywhere close to the kind of maneuvering that we had just seen.  The silent hovering, the speed, the abrupt stop, no deceleration either, it just stopped dead, then the reversal of direction again at a phenominal speed, again no acceleration, it just took off at full speed, flew across the length of the sky and was gone.  ""We can never mention this to anyone,"" I said to my friend.  He agreed.  We were both so rattled that we pulled into the first rest-area we came to.  As we got out of the truck, the little old guy, apparently the caretaker or  janitor, walked right over to us.  ""Well,"" he said, ""did you boys see the UFO?""  My friend and I had just promised each other we wouldn't ever speak of it to anybody but here is this guy talking about it.  ""Yes,"" I said, I was really relieved that someone else had seen it. ""Did you see it, too?""  ""Oh, Yeah,"" he said, ""Its been around here for a couple of hours now.  The sheriff was just here and he got a call. Went over to a local farm where they saw it flying around over their fields.""  It was about 28 ago and I haven't mentioned it to very many people and the one's that I have mentiioned it to, either don't believe me or else tell me about their own experience.  But nobody else has the kind of corroboration that my friend and I had.  That is all I can remember. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-10-31T00:00:00,41.09336991071429,-85.1455725

The UFO was round and circular in shape and about 20-30 was just hovering (or floating) behind the ship with the blinking lights. In about 2-3 minutes, it simply disappeared as if it sank in the deep waters behind the ship. I realized that my shipmate had a grip on my arm with his mouth wide open and states, ""Wow, did you see that!"" I said , ""Yes, did you see it?"" I left the scene, and my ship mate still standing there in disbelief.  I told a couple of fellows about it and they simply state, ""Why don't you give me some of what you been smoking"" and they simply laugh it off.

It was the shadow of 6 perfect, unattached circles, moving at about walking pace. From my perspective, each circle on the ground was about the size of an over-sized dinner plate. This was a perfectly sunny and cloudless day, but when I looked up toward the sky to see the cause of the shadow, there was nothing. It was quite amazing to me, I remember, that I couldn't see what was causing the shadow, despite it's large dimensions. Any other craft casting a shadow that large would have been easily spotted in the sky. I followed the shadow for about 20 yards until the yard ran out and thich hedges obstructed me.

My friend and I were driving north on a state highway on a clear moonlit night. I noticed a light or brightness over my left sholder and glanced that way and saw some really bright lights in the sky. I scared by buddy as I locked up my brakes and pulled over to the side of the road and I remember yelling ""what the hell is that""? We both got out of the car and looked up. The lights were in a v shaped formation and there were 4 total and the one on the north side was a little offset from the rest but traveling at the same speed. The lights were moving west to east and as we watched them they flew right thru a partial moon but I could not see any outline nor were they pulling any contail behind them best I could tell. I did not see any navigaton lights as on a plane or any strobe lights. The lights continued on an easterly heading and did not change appearance in any way, it was hard to tell what altitude they were, but I did not hear any noise nor see any contails or nav lights. The lights were traveling at a fairly fast speed but hard to estimate, I guess the best way to describe would be when you see an airliner pulling a contrail these lights were moving about 3 or 4 times faster than that. My friend and I watched them until they went out of sight on the east horizon and at that point went on home. We did not think a whole lot about it until we saw in the paper a day later other people had seen strange lights in the sky.  A little background on me at that time. I grew up close to a large airport and was always interested in aircraft and was very familiar with most aircraft by a very young age. I could tell with a quick glance a Boeing 707 from a 727 from a DC-9..etc and even at night I could usually tell by light configuration what kind of aircraft I was looking at. I was a student pilot at the time and have go on to become a pilot and have been in the aviation industry in airline operations for 22+ years.  This report is not made up or a crank thing done for fun, this sighting has bugged me for many years and now that there are places to report them I have decided to do so.

The last I heard he was living in St. Petersburg Florida, that was in 1981 and I have had no contact with hi since I do not know if we had passed the Kentucky line on into Tennessee or not. I went with this person to buy one of the first chevy Impala cars. I am leaving in a few minutes to fly to ((North Carolina)) ((business information deleted)). I will return by Friday.  I was in my early 20's at the time. I don't think that I could find the spot, It was at that time like fields and country side and I don't think it took us another hour or hour and half to get to Nashville. I think I would remember the highway if I looked on the map, if it has not gone to an Interstate. Yes, it was so interesting and I felt unique in that I had seen something so unreal and special, However declined to say anything about it to only those close to me and I think Mr. ((deleted)) felt the same way. If we had a camera at time, I believe we could have given the world some very close spectacular pictures.  I will try to submit a drawing of some kind. I forgot I did contact some web page a few years ago but had the wrong town that we were traveling from. We had actually left from Bowling Green Kentucky and had passed thru Hopkinsville and some where after that was where we saw the unknown and they were beautiful.

We all agree to the following: It was dark and we were walking between houses. My mother noticed a large  fireball like-disc hovering in the sky,appearing very high, yet very visible and detail could be seen of pieces of burning material falling away, yet too, this object stood still for about 20 minutes. My grandmother and grandfather came out to see also. The object slowly began moving westward and stopped burning and simply glowed reddish yellow and over the next minutes of the sighting, the object faded away from our sight.

The fog was so heavy as I traveled the gravel road from town to our country home that I had to open the window and drive using the ditch to my left as my guide.  I drove this road for five miles beside the river; then I made a 90-degree turn to the left, away from the river, but still with heavy fog.  A minute or so later I turned right into our lane and drove to the end of it, making nearly a 90-degree turn to the left, away from the corn field that was on my right. As I had driven the long stretch of the lane, on my left were railroad tracks, a narrow corn field, and then a ridge. The distance to the ridge was maybe a football field's length. I parked the car, got out, and started toward the house.  Something caught my attention.  I looked toward the lane I had just traveled and saw a luminous object hovering above the field.  It was maybe 50 yards from me.  Because nothing was near it, I have only a guess as to how big it really was and how high it was from the ground.  I think it was as big as a football field and 30 to 40 feet above the ground.  I heard no sound.  There was not even a breeze.  But the fog had cleared. What amazed me the most was that there was no sign of motion.  It appeared to be glowing metal.  It's shape was of a shallow, large soup bowl inverted over another large soup bowl the same size and shape, joined by a strip of the same substance such that it was perpendicular to the rims of the two bowls.  This joining strip had what appeared to be rectangular windows in it.  I don't remember whether they were horizontal or vertical.  I do remember that their shape was distinct--no blurring.  I wondered whether these really were windows and someone was looking at me as I looked at the UFO or whether these were energy sites.  They did have a different ""glow"" from the UFO, as though a light were behind them.  Nowhere could I see any opening or any notable feature.  As I stood riveted, it suddenly both rose and sped away to my right-! -at about a 45 degree angle to the field. It's disappearance took only a fraction of a second. Because I had no kind of drug in my system nor was I tired, I believe what I saw was real.  I went back the next day to see whether the ground below it showed any signs of heat or of radiation burns.  Nothing looked unusual.  I want to add that the area where I saw it was a path for low-flight jet maneuvers over the river, from a ridge on one side to a ridge on the other.  These jets were from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to submit an illustration of the object, which we may post.

Whitney, California - 1993 After seeing the sphere earlier in the day we camped out under the stars at Cottonwood Lakes just south of Mt. Whitney.  Our elevation was above the 10,000 ft. level in the Sierra Nevada Range.  While not quite asleep around 10 PM I heard a strange ""whirring"" sound in the sky.  I opened my eyes and looked directly up towards the crystal clear, black and moonless, star filled sky.  This slow moving object flew directly over us.  The object radiated absolutely no light whatsoever.  If it wasn't for the fact that as it passed over head it blocked out the stars behind it, I would have never seen it.  It moved rather slowly across the sky.  Much slower than a jet would travel.  Its direction of travel was from north to south.  Several seconds later, maybe 30 or so, two jets flew overhead in the same path of travel as the object, as if chasing the object.  I could tell they were jets due to their wing tip lights and that I had served on an aircraft carrier in the US Navy I have had plenty of night sightings of US Aircraft.  I could not tell the exact height of the object as it flew overhead, but it must been at least 1,000 feet above us to clear the ridge line that surrounded the lakes.  We were just east of the spine of the Sierras and the elevation at the peak is about 11,000 feet.  The two jets were flying at higher than normal speeds but without their afterburners fired.  It just seemed so weird to see an object fly over and block out the stars behind it in a total blackness.  It must have been rather large for it blocked out the section of the sky as if I held my hand out at arms length and blocked out the stars.  I could not make out the edges of the object but it was more of a diamond shape than any of the other shapes you had listed.  No lights, no openings, nothing other than being its shadow.

We then saw a large object lift off and explode into light I am a life-long experiencer of ufo, sleep paralysis, psychic phenomenon. My most incredible sighting happened in 1993, while I was walking with my aunt. We were walking at night in her neighborhood, when a black van pulled up beside us. A man, who I could not clearly see, asked us if we ""wanted a ride"". We quickly said no. As we walked on abit, and rounded a corner. We walked in front of her apartment complex, Greentree Apts. Now, across the street, there is a radio station, and a large field behind it where, often is used as a small fairground. My aunt and I were speaking about nothing in particular, when all off a sudden she said, ""what is that light over there?"" I looked out of the corner of my eye, at somethingt that seemed to be coming up from the field. I said, ""oh, that is a helicopter."" ""But,"" she replied, ""it isn't making any noise."" I quickly realised she was right, and we both suddenly stopped and watched as a dark object with very bright lights at both ends and an occasional lightening flash on top rose, silently, from the field behind the radio station. It went quickly, at a sixty degree angle or arc, until we could almost see under it. Then it exploded into a red flash, and was gone quicker than anything I had ever seen. We were aghast for several minutes.  Now, that is the most incredible thing I have ever seen in the night sky. Since then, I have had many more experiences, discovered spiritualism, and began writing and channeling an entity I call Zem. Recently, i had a sighting on a country road with a member of the psychic development group that I had in college, and, again, there was a BLACK VAN driving toward the object down the road (it seemed to have come out of nowhere), as we drove away from the object (which was a cery bright, flickering object). What I suppose I am most curious about is, actually, what the black van has to do with these objects, and has anyone ever reported it? If so, I would like to know about it.

There was absolutely NO sound emitted from this object and from horizon to horizon only took it 1 to 2 seconds to travel.

It seemed to be bigger than a plane, circular, and either it was rotating or the lights were rotating around it, it was hard to tell.  It changed colour.  It was a blinding white solid, a steady globe.  Then it began to spin, and became brilliantly coloured, red, green, and back to white.  Sometimes a ring of smaller lights flickered and danced all around it but in a type of orbit pattern, not erratic.  When it stopped spinning it went back to a brilliant white colour.  It was very cold that night at least -30 degrees celcius, so it was too risky to set up my telescope, and I was worried that if I went back into the house, I would lose sight of it.  So I just stood there on my front porch watching it.  I know it was not a plane.  I know the way lights behave on a plane and the noise planes make.  It was a quiet night, and this object emitted no noise.  I called my local airport, but no answer.  I called my local police the next day and they said no one had reported anything, and to which I answered, ""Well I am"".

"Two oval shaped, firefly-like, yellow glowing craft, flew overhead at great speeds with erratic movement.",Olympia,WA,1994-03-10T21:00:00,oval,10 seconds,"Occurred : 3/10/1994 21:00  (Entered as : 03/10/1994 21:00) Reported: 12/20/2003 2:56:40 PM 14:56 Posted: 1/17/2004 Location: Olympia, WA Shape: Oval Duration:10 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34003.html,"Two oval shaped, firefly-like, yellow glowing craft, flew overhead at great speeds with erratic movement. Myself and three friends observed a mostly stationary light over the bay from a second floor apartment window.  The light seemed to stay basically in one spot over the bay, but moved slightly, enought to interest us in just why it seemed to not be approaching or moving away, up, down, left or right.  This light appeared to be at least 3/4 of a mile away.  My close friend (age 24) and myself (age 19) decided to investigate from a closer vantage point.  Leaving our other two friends in the apartment, we walked across the street, and over toward the bay, about four city blocks, into a semi-industrial area of downtown Olympia.  This happened on a Friday night, plenty of teenagers cruising the strip in cars and trucks, and at 9:00pm, when most people would still be awake.  These two factors seemed strange to my friend and I later.  Anyway, keeping our eyes on the original light over the bay, we walked into a part of town which has since been made into a new public transit station.  The area was not well lit, but we could still see the main one-way street, the basic downtown area, as well as the apartment from which we had just walked.  We stopped walking toward the bay and watched the light as it began to approach our area, seeming to come straight toward us.  It soon became apparent that it was two lights, both white, blinking lights.  We made a couple humorous and skeptical verbal observations in an attempt to make each other nervous, or poke fun at ourselves, I suppose, for investigating what seemed to be a small airplane.  The lights came directly overhead, and it did in fact appear to be the lights on the end of a small airplane's wings, blinking in unison.  Although we could not make out the shape of the assumed airplane, the speed at which it (the lights) was moving seemed that of an average small plane.  When the airplane was just passing directly over our heads, two craft appeared above, behind (going the same direction but not quite caught up to it yet), and slightly north of it.  These objects were identical in size, shape, and color.  They appeared seemingly out of nowhere.  They moved at an astonishing rate of speed compared to the airplane.  They moved in the same basic direction of the plane, but in a manner that neither of us had ever seen before.  They seemed to ""wiggle"" almost, like watching a coin fall down through water, erratic, almost like the atmosphere around them was being manipulated, quite literally looking like stones skipped on the surface of water, like the air they moved through was bumpy, yet they negotiated it so quickly and with such fluid motion (which I know sounds contradictory to ""bumpy"" or ""wiggling"" movement).  They were basically side by side, but appeared to move independently of each other.  God, I haven't had to recall this in such detail since the few days following the event, telling it to my mother.  My body feels nervous again.  Anyway, the two objects shot past the airplane and out of sight to the east quite suddenly.  The total time we viewed the objects was 8 to 10 seconds, which seemed like plenty to us.  As far as appearance goes, like I said, they were identical.  They were oval shaped; that's the easy part of the physical description.  The part I find hard to describe is the color and, well, how they seemed to glow.  Yellow.  Color is simple I suppose.  But it wasn't just yellow, they seemed ""alive"", I guess, like a firefly, and even in the short time we viewed them, we could see that they glowed not like a traditional light bulb, not like a filament (sp?) inside or like flourescent (sp?) bulbs, but the WHOLE craft glowed that yellow, and not at a constant brightness.  They seemed to ""warm"" or something, I don't know.  Like a firefly, that yellow glow seemed to be produced from inside in an almost organic looking way.  I have since become interested in UFO research and have always looked for photographs or descriptions that match the objects me and my friend saw that night.  I have seen somewhat similar looking pictures, but I don't reca! ll seeing video footage of the exact movement and glowing qualities we saw.  Anyway, the two of us were skeptics before this incident, and I suppose I still am.  My friend has since moved to NYC and I haven't spoken to him for a few years.  Last time I saw him, in 2000, after our ""how've you been""s and ""nice to see ya""s were out of the way, the conversation went straight for our experience back in 1994.  Neither of us have had a sighting like that one since, and I remain a skeptic, but in the year following our experience, I did see two yellow objects skipping through the sky at night again, and again, DOWNTOWN Olympia, which isn't a huge metropolis or anything, but there are plenty of people walking around.  I began to assume that people must just not look up or something.  I began to worry that I was MEANT to see these things, among a few other quickly passing thoughts that made me feel insane for a minute.  I phoned the local AM radio station, which is located right on the bay mentioned (we would have walked right to the station had we kept going in the direction we were walking when we went to get a closer look at the original light we saw) the next morning.  I asked whoever answered the phone if they had received any calls mentioning anything ""odd"" or having anything to do with seeing anything ""abnormal"" in the sky above the bay, and asked if anyone at the station had seen anything or heard about any strange things in the sky above their station.  I tried to avoid the word ""UFO"" as I always assume that most average Americans won't take me seriously.  Nothing.  They said they hadn't heard of or seen anything, hadn't had a single phone call about anything at all.  The guy's voice seemed skeptical; I suppose he thought I was pranking him or something.  This is the first time I have officially reported or claimed this event in any way.  I have told a select handfull of friends over the past nine years, as well as my mother.  I told my mother first, because she knows I don't lie to her, and I was such a ! wreck for a few days following the incident, I NEEDED to tell someone that I knew would believe me.  I felt crazy and my mind wandered into such new and frightening territory.  That night altered not only my skeptical and analytical mind, but also my perception of REALITY, PERMANENTLY.  I have never been the same since.  I look up with a different appreciation, not only for the sky, but for my place on this planet, my species, and I think most of all, I wonder about all the other possibilities, facts, and realities that our government knows of and won't tell us about.  If those things I saw were not of this world, then I imagine that our government knows they are there at the least.  If they ARE of this world, then I imagine that our government has technology quite beyond things I've seen in movies, and that frightens me a bit more than the prospect of being ""secretly"" observed by another species.  Overall, I would mostly like to state that this has not been a positive experience for me.  My dreams following this event were not pleasant and restfull ones.  My thoughts are filled with frightening images and questions.  A general feeling of anxiety and uneasiness takes over my mind and body at times.  As I get older, I wish so much that I could be filled with the excitement and wonder and curiosity I've read about others feeling when they speak of their own experiences.  I was traumatized by this event.  I shook until the next morning.  While I am interested intensely in this area, I AM quite troubled by the mystery of it all.  I DO want to KNOW.  I used to scoff at this crap.  I don't even know who you people are or why I'm telling you all this.  Maybe I felt some hope when I heard you on Coast to Coast the other night.  I heard you say something about reporting sightings and then ""easy to remember web address, UFO center dot com.  All you have to remember is UFO Center.""  Well, I wrote it down.  Here is my hope:  If there is any chance of me making contact with anyone else that might have seen what I saw! that night, I would like to talk to them or write e-mails or ANYTHING.  I have lost contact with the friend that I saw these things with and haven't talked to him for about three years.  I feel very alone when it comes to this subject in my life.  If feels pointless and silly to try to talk to even my fiance about it because she is such a skeptic herself that even though she knows (I think) that I'm telling her the truth, she can't really FEEL it.  I don't know why I've rambled so long.  This is my first attempt at contacting others like me if they're even out there.  Thanks, I think, if you are who I hope you are.

My older sister was the first to go outside to see what it was. She said she saw a disc shaped object over the top of the trees. The object was NOT emitting any light at the time. All you can see was the outline of the object over the night sky. After a quick glance my sister runs inside with the news. My mother then lets us all go to see it. We head out the back door to notice that it moved to the side of the house. This time it was emitting a green and red color. It just hovered there at the same altitude for about 5 minutes. (this is where the classic thing happens) my mother goes inside to find the video camera but couldn't find it. And was to afraid to take to long and that she would miss the object.) After the five minutes past of just hovering there it headed off over the house to exit going 20 to 25 miles an hour immediately followed by three jet fighters aligned in a v formation. When we went inside my mother called the police. Before my mom could finish her description of what happened the officer on the line said, ""that the lines were flooding but everythings alright the Air Force called and said that they were doing a test."" At the time my mother and all of us completely bought the reason the officer gave us. Ten years later all of a sudden the memory of the event flooded back. what came back to me was that i saw a object above the tree line emitting colors for about five minutes. That is all I remember. After gaining this memory back i asked my mother and sisters about this event. and thats how i got the whole story together and the first time the shape of the object was put into play. My two sisters rememeber a circlular object while my mother remembers a circlular object with a sort of square piece at the back. When I first heard them tell me the shape since it faded from my memory i was surprised that they didn't think it was wierd ! sounding. They replied that it was the Air Force doing a test. When i told them that no U.S plane was circular and could not hover they just said really. At first I thought they were just trying to pull my leg. But after a few questions I realized that they really had no idea how planes work and the great importance of basic aerospace dynamics. They really thought a plane could be any shape. Thats why they sucked up the Airforce's Reason. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-01-17T00:00:00,,

There were six to eight of them flying overhead which I estimate to be about a mile above us.  The wings were ""flapping"" but not like seagulls which flap in unison.

These were solid craft, sharply seen -- but they seemed to disappear and they reappear against blue sky -- as if they were going in and out of another dimension.  We watched them until we got bored -- went into the fish shop for the fish boat had come in and then left.  I reported this incident to the Canadian UFO reporting center at Vancouver, B.C. and the then president who called me back told me had a similar sighting, also over the Fraser River some weeks before -- but only one craft -- and no where near as many as we had seen.  This was a day time sighting, and one we watched long enough to be clear as to what we saw.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,49.13031102362204,-122.80632944881889

There were two bulges on each side .The sides were rounded .For some reason I did not stop as intended and the next thing I remember is looking in rearview mirror to see if I could see the object which I did not.We cotinued on till we stopped just acrossthe line into Minn.

My dog was looking straight up, snarling, and had her fangs bared.  I looked up and saw a single green light.  I watched it for just a few seconds, then I looked down and said to my dog: ""I certainly hope you are seeing what I am seeing"".  When I looked back up, the light was gone, the horses and dogs in the area were then quiet.  You have to understand that at that time, this was a very rural area.  The next day, I questioned a couple of neighbors, and none of them had heard anything.

For years I have been trying to track down a craft's symbol my 4 yr. old and I saw around 1978 in Pasadena, CA- a strange ""Flash Gordon"" type of ship with a very obvious ""H"" on its side (although slightly cursive)- the ship looked almost cartoonish and flatly 2_dimensional, seemingly suspended over the San Gabriels, heading West. Although there were several people in the area and apparently interested in what we were looking at, no one else saw it. We casually talked about 'our sighting' over the years as it was such a clear, vivid vision and it had been my son who was the first to notice it. We even drew pictures that same afternoon and, over the years, made a few sketches to maintain a fresh visual recall. Interestingly, his pictures always showed a very odd perspective, as though he was viewing it in extreme close-up whereas my view was more of a typical upper sky sighting as seen from standing on the ground. One night about 10 yrs. later, I heard him gasp as CNN aired a Moscow UFO story. Apparently a ship had landed near an apartment complex where many children were playing and many of them excitedly described seeing a UFO. One of the kids had even sketched a picture and as he proudly held it up to the camera, we saw that he had drawn a similar ship with the SAME ** H ** ! Then, about a year later, TNT was running a 50's UFO quasi-documentary (OVERLORDS of the SKIES) and I was stunned to see a crude representation of an analogous craft again demonstrating the ""H"". The narrator mentioned that the ship was said to be from the planet UMMO (!!!). I made a halfhearted effort to track down the video but discovered it was actually a motion film of which no one seemed to have current knowledge. I keep meaning to contact Turner Broadcasting and request a repeat but haven't done so. I later learned of a book with UMMO in the title and had a local bookstore run a search but was told it was out of print. Anytime I have asked about the sighting, I have been told by a few wannabe Ufologists etal that it was actually a famous ""hoax"" yet allegedly seen by about 15,000 people across the US sometime in the 50's; some say it was the 70's. Actually, I remain a bit of a skeptic (altho we sure saw something!), Have you any knowledge about this particular sighting or symbol? Even called Art Bell last year (1998)  to ask but rec'd a cursory ""Never heard of it..."" and got one of his infamous quick disconnects (smile). There's more to the whole story involving both my son and I and some eerie pre and post strange events but, for now, am simply curious as to what  you think of the actual symbol.

I happend to see a ""star"" move.  It looked like any other star.  It wasn't the brightes and it wasn't the dimmest.  It moved in a circular pattern; that is it quickly (about 1/2 second) made one circle with a diameter of about 3/4"" (using my fingers at arms length to measure this and the following apparent distances), and then remained motionless for several minutes.  I didn't say anything because I felt that if it didn't move again my friends might pass it off as an eye movement. It finally moved again, this time it moved in a straight line about 4 apparent inches accross the sky.  There was no appearance of accelleration or decelleration; just a quick move.  It then sat motionless again for a few minutes.  It made another circle, and one of my friend said, ""Did anybody see thst?""  I said that I've been watching it.  It behaved this way for quite some time, making circles and straight lines, and remaining motionless for minutes between moves.  The circles all seemed to be the same size, but the length of the lines varied from about 4"" to about 18"".  It always looked like a star: no flashing or colored lights, and it always held the same brightness.  The last time we saw it is when it disappeared into the sky (or over the horizon) with a long, straight-line dash.  There it was, and then darted off, out of sight in about a second or less.  What I find interesting about this is WHERE it occurred.  It was directly over what at that time was Carswell AFB.  From where we were sitting, if there was any ground activity on base, we could have seen it.  We saw no military activity.  Not on the ground, not in the air.  This is a place to report; not to speculate, but I can't help myself :) I'm now under the impression that thing was being operated by our Air Force. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Three of us were sitting on the front steps of the barracks at Iwakuni Air Station USMC in Japan, approximately 35 miles south west of Hiroshima. It was early evening about 20:00( 8 pm) when went out to have a smoke and watch the shooting stars over the castle to the north, the annual August meteor shower(I forget the name) It was hazy and they weren't visible so we sat batting the breeze. As I looked up into the southern sky over the inland sea I noticed a singly white light. It appeared to be some good distance away, probably several miles if it were an aircraft. At first it moved like an airplane in the distance horizontally across the sky from west to east. Then suddenly it changed direction from horizontal to a rising 60 degrees back to the west and covered a great distance that was either a rise in altitude or approach to our location. At the distance that it appeared to be a few inches of travel to us was miles of distance. It then changed direction several times moving across the sky at differing speed, sometimes fast and sometimes slow. Somestimes it just stopped entirely. When it made turns they were immediate and sometimes at very sharp angles.  After a period of time it returned to the general position where I first observed it to the south west sky, then went at a high velocity horizontal to a distance as we observed 3 - 5 feet to the east then changed direction back to the west and up at about a 30 or 45 degree angle and disappeared into or behind the rising moon.  My father is retired Airforce and I have been around aircraft all my life. I worked with helicopters in North Carolina for the Marine Corps and with Fighter/Attack Jets in Iwakuni. I know what man made air craft are capable of and no aircraft ever desinged and built by humans could travel at the speeds this object did nor make the kinds of turns it made at those speeds. It had to travel at great distances in its location since it was a good ways distant from us and out over the ocean.  It could not have been one of the jets from our air station because they were grounded in the evening because at that time Japan had a no fly rule to keep the noise levels down during the night hours. To this day I have not seen anything that moved like that light nor have I been able to figure out what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-10-31T00:00:00,,

This reports relates to the ""Bentwaters Incident."" I need to provide some background for you.  About 5 years ago, I was watching the History channel, and I saw a man being interviewed....and I recognized him as an Airman I knew back in the late '70's. He was (is) ((name deleted)). This was the first I had heard of the UFO sighting just east of the base, in the late fall of 1980.  I have never told anyone of this story before, and I believe that I can shed some additional light on the situation....from the perspective of a weatherman, and one who has certain knowledge and experience in observation.  To start. I do not know how familiar you are with this Bentwater Incident. Kind of pisses me off, it should be called the Woodbridge incident, as it occurred just east of RAF Woodbridge, not Bentwaters. Bear with me here.  The base is oriented generally east to west...in fact, the runway orientation is exactly 09-27. This makes it very easy to observe the weather, and the direction from the center of the airport.  For a several month period, all during the summer and fall of 1980, I and the ((deleted--technical personnel)) under my command observed lights to the east of the base, in Her Majesties Rendlesham forest. This is a rather large stand of trees BETWEEN RAF Woodbridge and Bentwaters, indeed, the east gate led to a small road which was a quick way to get to and from the base, from one base to the other.  My ((deleted--family member)) was also in the ((deleted--military)) at the time, and she was assigned to the Bentwaters base weather station. Normally, we worked the same shift, and I would drop ((deleted--family member)) off at work, go on to my work, and reverse the process and the end of my shift. Woodbridge was south of Bentwaters, we lived north of Bentwaters, in a little town of Leiston...along the north sea. I digress.  What I am about to write is something that I have been thinking a lot about. I am not about publicity, and will not leave my name. I will leave an e-mail address that you can contact me with, if you want.  On the way from my work, to pick up my ((family member)), I went out the east gate, turned left, and headed on up to Bentwaters. I had gone about 200 yards, and was pretty deep in the woods. It was foggy, the visibility was less than a mile. This was pretty common in fall, there is a climatological maxima for fog along the north sea that time of year. I was driving my little ((deleted--foreign car)), doing about 40. There was no radio in the car, just tooling along.  Up and off to my right, in the woods, about 50 feet into the woods I saw a bright, pulsating light. The frequency of pulsing was quick, and was an orangish-reddish color. This freaked me out pretty good, I didn't know what it was. The hair on the back of my neck went straight out, unexpectedly so...I became VERY frightened, and gunned the car, and left. Thinking back, I did not see a craft...but I remain convinced, to this day, that this was (is) something I can't explain.  I talked to my wife about this, and gradually forgot about it...until this entire incident came back into my attention several years ago. About a year ago, the Halt tapes became more public, and this kinda freaked me out, too! I KNEW Lt. Col. Halt, and spoke with him many, many times in my capacity of providing ((deleted--information)), and the various on-base agencies.  I have read several reports of this Incident, many contain innaccuracies, misjudgements, and many are just plain wrong. The people I worked with and I speculated for months as to the source of the lights to the east of the airfield. We considered, and rejected, the idea that it was the lights from the Orfordness lighthouse. We KNEW that one, bearing 140 degrees, at 7 miles. Little light, pause, big light, pause, little light, pause, rinse repeat.  This light we saw was IMMEDIATELY off the base proper, within a half mile of where my unit was assigned. As is the practice of many ((deleted--units)), we were assigned on the ((deleted))  floor of the ((deleted--on the base)).  Our job was to maintain a continuous ((deleted)) watch...we had no other duties other than to monitor the ((deleted)), and as such, we were outside a LOT...hours per day (and night) just looking around, and monitoring our ((deleted))  instruments.  Something that isn't talked about much....when the Colonel and his staff measured radiation, they knew what they were doing. The base still had an active WSA (weapon storage area) for nuclear weapons on the base. We even had an armored personnel carrier, painted Air Force blue on the base....pretty cool, actually. This is why a Lieutenant Colonel and other security forces were in the woods outside a small tactical fighter base after midnight in December....the Air Force doesn't fool around with their nukes. Ever.  I listened to George Khoury (sp?)  (sic--Noory) tonight, and heard this website, and thought....why not?  If anything, I have understated what I saw, but at this point, I am not prepared to say much more....I have a good job, I am now retired from the Air Force, and I think it is pretty safe here to put down a little of what I saw.  Thanks for taking the time to read this.  I will list a little used email address, if you have any questions.

I looked out my window and saw an orange fireball gliding over the house.  I went into the kitchen and told my sister to come to the window and watch what I thought was a meteor falling into the back yard.  I pulled open the kitchen curtains and saw a black diamond with green lights on the points settle onto the back porch roof-- but the green lights didn't light up any of the diamond. (It was small, only about ten feet across and about eight feet high.)  A low hum was shaking the house and rattling the back window.  The thing sat on the roof for a few minutes,and I wanted to go outside but I heard someone in my head saying, ""Don't go outside, you'll get hurt.""  Finally the thing slid horizontally off the porch and hovered in the back yard.  The green lights went off and it was just a black diamond, but it was blacker than the sky. It took off and seemed to be flying fast and slow at the same time.  After it had gone over the hill, four jets from the military base chased it, but couldn't catch it.

I have looked through this site, but I am looking specifically for a place to record an incident of missing time, which occurred when I was 30 years old.  Perhaps someone would be kind enough to point me to a more suitable site?  In September, 1973, a neighbour and I were intending to drive to Port Alberni, a  city about one hour away, in a northwest direction from my home in Nanaimo, BC.  We left my house around 10 am, drove about a half hour north, and we both clearly remember turning west onto the highway leading towards Port Alberni.  However, our next clear recollection occurred about seven hours later.  We suddenly found ourselves on a dirt road, with the car motor running, and it was after five oclock.  There was absolutely no memory for either of us, of how we had spent the missing hours.  My friend was absolutely terrified, crying and shaking uncontrollably.  On my part, I was deeply puzzled about where we were, slightly shaken, but not really frightened.  Since we did not know where we were, after a few minutes, I simply started driving in the direction my car was pointed.  After about 10 minutes, we reached the Island Highway, but we were roughly one hour south of where we started out in Nanaimo.  The place we re-entered the Island Highway was one and a half hours south or about 80 miles from where we both remember turning onto the Alberni Highway.  I have absolutely no conscious memory of aliens, a craft, or anything of that nature, but I know that this experience can have few other explanations.

While I was in college in 1976,I volunteered at a community radio station as a broadcast engineer and was driving to my shift early one evening. It was dark and I had gone approximately 1/2 mile from my house when I saw a flashing red light. Thinking that a local police officer was pulling me over,I checked my mirrors and was surprised to see nothing behind me. The flashing was pulsing on and off at at rate of about 1 Hz,1/2 second on and 1/2 second off. When I looked around to see the light's point of origin,it was not visible. I saw that the hood of my white car was illuminated in this pulsing red light, and thought it unusual that the light source was directly above me as I was still driving down the road at 35 miles per hour. I needed to get a look at what ever was above me and pulled my head up in front of the steering wheel and looked up through the windshield. When I looked up,I saw a pulsing, translucent circular red light that measured approximately 10 inches in diameter and two inches thick. It seemed to attached to a large,flat surface that was so dark in color that it was barely discerable and did not reflect any of the light. It it difficult to tell how large the ""craft"" itself was. The light itself was very visible,and measureable since it was only a foot above the roof of my car! As soon as I looked at the light,it instantly accellerated down the road ahead of me at incredible speed and dissapeared over the tree line at the end of the road. I had experimented with lasers in my high school physics lab, and it was quite similar to flicking a laser pointer across the ceiling. The light flashed once and appeared as a streak over a distance of approximately 2 miles to the horizon, then dissapeared. There was no sound,or force felt as it departed from over the roof of my car. The sighting was reported over the air immediatlely upon my arrival at the radio station, but I received no phone calls or feedback other than my fellow engineer who encouraged me to broadcast my sighting. I have never documented my experience until now,but have told many of my freinds. 8/19/2003 ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

My sister who at the time was 11, pointed towards the sky and said look at that, as I looked out her passenger side window I noticed a black circular disc, with changing lights, confused at what I was looking at, I asked my parents pointing to the sky,"" what kind of plane is that"", my mother looked out her window and yelled at my father to stop the car. My father not having a clue as to what we were looking at slammed on the brakes. Looked out the window and asked my mother, ""is that a flying saucer?"" I remember the expression on my parents faces, they looked as if they had seen a ghost, more fear than confussion. They didn't get out of the car, let alone, allow us to get out, but we just stayed there looking at this thing in the sky, but it stayed still in that same spot, probably about half a block in front of us and 12 stories high, and it spinned at a very low pace, but it did have changing colored bright lights. Then it began to travel towards the park we were heading too so, i'm assuming curiousity from my parents, we followed it, and sure enough it hung around right above the park, at the same distance from us as we saw it earlier on the road. On the street it probably stayed up there for a good 15 minutes and then at the park for a good 20 to 30 minutes. Other people at the park were seeing this with us, and then it just slowly bega to go higher and higher until it vanished from sight, at this point it was getting darker, so the lights were visibly brighter. Then we left, talked about through the years, but recently I brought it, and for some strange reason, my parents nor my sister seem to remember this event, which makes no sense to me, because we talked about this happening through the years.But now no one seems to remember.

I have video documentation of both sightings.  I was breast feeding my 4 month old daughter, sitting in a chair facing our large picture window, (north) there were no lights on in the house.  I noticed A strange ball of light suspended in the sky. (We lived in the country, no neighbors or city lights for many, many, many miles). As I stared into the sky I saw the object change from one large bright white ball of light into two balls of light.  The ""lights"" changed in size, density and color, from bright white into a pinkish/orange hue that would become opaque, over and over and over.  The objects rejoined and it began to move in a jerky, zig zag motion, then it stopped and hovered, over and over it did this. I kept telling myself that I was seeing things... and, that my eyes were ""doing"" this. I grabbed the video recorder and began filming.  During the six minutes of filming the ""other"" or ""another"" object amazingly bright and oblong shaped streaked across the sky right above the object I was filming, it was not a falling star, either! It was un-nerving and scared me terribly. So I quickly picked up my baby and ran into my bedroom!  After putting my baby in her layette, I layed down in bed, a minute later I decided that I needed to view the tape I just shot, I think to ""prove"" to myself I just what I saw!  Well, it wasn't my eyes playing tricks on me...there it all was on tape, but this part of the tape, where I filmed the ""objects"" were full of static.  (We had filmed in total darkness before and never had static in the film. So I did another dark sky ""test"" and taped the night sky in the back yard. The playback on this contained no static which  makes me believe that the object created the static).  It should also be noted that my 7 yr. old dog, Sassie, 1/2 wolf 1/2 german shepard, was with me the entire time this was going on. She became very agitated and nervous, panting and drooling.  (the only time she ever acted close to this was 15 minutes before a hot air balloon came into our view--her senses could pick them up miles away--and her behavior was never as amplified as it was with the UFO).  After all this happened, including the ""sighting"" the following morning, 05/20/03. (that sightings explanation will follow herein), Sassie would not leave my side, she was afraid and could no longer be left in the house alone because she would try to get out, by chewing, digging or whatever.  The next morning I left for a quick run to the local party store, I was gone maybe 20 minutes, during that time frame Sassie had dug all of the flooring away from our sliding glass door, my refrigerator which was next to the slider, was moved out from the wall on an angle and the vertical blinds were in shreds. Her front paws were a bloody mess!  I left her one other time after this and Sassie had chewed all of the trim from around a window, chewed the wood around one of the panes of glass, and broke through glass jumping out of the window. She was shaking in the yard when I returned from that brief errand.  That is when I truly ""put two and two together"" so to speak, connecting the sightings with her change in personality; a once easy going, relaxed, confident dog,was screwed fearful of being left alone in the house, something we had done with her for 7 years without incident prior!  It broke my heart because she was never the same after all of this.  Well, breastfed babies are pretty consistent in their feeding times, so the following morning at 12:15 AM, I again, was sitting in the living room chair looking out of the picture window breast feeding my baby.  Sassy, my dog, began pacing the room, panting and drooling, she was whining and nervous, and I could not calm her.  At 12:29 AM, to my amazement, the ""object"" from the night before reappeared in the sky.  (I know now that my dog, Sassy knew it was coming, even though we couldn't see it yet). I grabbed my video recorder right away and ran outside and started filming.  Again, this will sound strange, I know, but, I truly felt that the object knew I was filming because it started ""performing"" for me.  This night it would change it's shape from a large, bright ball of white light into a small ball of bright light, and, again, it would change in color from bright white to pinkish/orange.  After a four minutes of filming, and, this is going to sound really wierd, all of a sudden there seemed to be an darkish shadowey type of eye looking back into my eye that was on the video camera's eye piece! I felt like the object was coming closer and closer to me,too, I got very afraid and ran back into the house and to my bedroom.  I stayed there the rest of the night.  Both of these nights there were no clouds whatsoever in the sky.  These objects appeared over hundreds and hundreds of acres of nothing but farm land.  The only thing out that way is a unmaned powering station owned by Consumer's Energy Company.  I found a video expert who made 2 copies of my video for me, which I have placed in other secure locations, as well as made me photos of several video frames that he froze.  After seeing the object two consecutive nights like I did, I rearranged my living room and never looked out into the sky that way again...I was too scared to even look into the night sky for months after this for fear that I would see ""it"" again.  Please know that I have filmed the area of the sighting during broad daylight, too, and retained copies of the weather reports for those days of the sighting.  I would be happy to forward a copy of my tape, a map of the area and copies of my photos if it's desired.  Thank you for time and if you have any insight or explanations to what I saw, it would be appreciated.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We will contact the witness and request a copy of the tape.  PD))",2004-01-17T00:00:00,42.28467811900192,-85.60508272552782
"Silent ""Airplanes"" at Low Altitude",Richmond,CA,1997-06-01T22:00:00,other,5 minutes,"Occurred : 6/1/1997 22:00  (Entered as : 06/01/1997 22:00) Reported: 12/29/2003 9:21:06 PM 21:21 Posted: 1/17/2004 Location: Richmond, CA Shape: Other Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34211.html,"Silent ""Airplanes"" at Low Altitude To set the background, Richmond is the city I grew up in, and I was familiar with the usual patterns of air traffic.  At the estimated date of the event (mid 1997), I was past 34.  Any oddities in air traffic would be apparent to me.  Though some would say that what I saw were conventional aircraft, and I admit that they may have been - though with some strange twists - I felt I'd post this notice to benefit the doubt.  Having heard anecdotal accounts of apparent ET craft disguising themselves as conventional craft, I think thoroughness is appropriate.  Earlier in the daylight hours, I'd taken note of one or two large aircraft northbound over what I estimated to be western Richmond at unusually low altitude.  My vantage point was the vicinity of I-80 and the San Pablo Dam Road.  The aircraft resembled airliners or cargo transports...possibly C-17-like, but not grey as I recall.  It was my sense that there were more aircraft in general that day.  I e-mailed a friend in Monterey, Calif. to ask if he'd seen any strange air traffic in his area, and he said he had increased activity as well.  In the dark evening of what I recall to be the same day, from home (approx. 1 mile north of the previous vantage point and south of Hilltop Mall) I witnessed what visually appeared to be conventional airliners yet they were *absolutely silent*.  The aircraft came in a succession of three within a short period which I estimate at five minutes.  The aircraft appeared to descend from the west, and they moved eastward overhead at low altitude which I estimate at only two thousand feet.  At least one turned southward over the El Sobrante area and disappeared from view over the East Bay Hills (without a lot of clearance below).  In the many previous years I'd seen only such craft as Cessnas and helicopters in this low airspace.  Never had I seen an airliner that low that far from the airport (Oakland is the nearest for things that size).  As I mentioned above, the aircraft were silent.  I could hear the occasional car drive past the house, and I could hear the subtle distant rush of freeway traffic, yet no sound emanated from any of the aircraft which were closer than the freeway.  I was flabbergasted and listened intently as they approached and departed.  I was sure that even at low RPMs during a descent, I'd hear something, but these things were as quiet as gliders!  I also should note that they had what appeared to be navigation lights, and the night sky was quite clear.  I now live in Seattle, and air traffic southbound into Sea-Tac often merges over my part of the city.  They all make sound, some louder, some quieter, but none silent.  What I saw in Richmond still mystifies me. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received many reports of low-flying military transport a/c.  However, we do not know what the witness observed.

We were talking about the birth of jesus and the star of david and had just past the blue ridge  parkway bridge that goes over top of route 24. We where talking about the star of david when I looked up into the sky and said. ""did the star of david look likr that mommy?"" Directly ahead of us in the sky was what appeared to be the brightest star I had ever seen. It seemed to take my mother by suprise as well because of her reaction. By this time we had gone up the first hill on the way to Stewerstville, and where passing Wonder Drug on our right hand side of the road. By this time we where discussing how bright the object in the shy was, and how it appered to be gitting lower in the shy. We went up the second hill on the way two stewertsville and took a left at the Hopin store (now its a getty mart I think). By this time about twenty minutes have past from the time we first noticed the bright star. we past sterwertsville elementary on the right kept our attention on the star. By this time my mother is getting a little excited I think bucase I remmeber her saying someting about how it was fallowing us. As far as I could tell it was going along the same path as we were. We lived in the shady Grove area, and the road goes down a step hill and through a couple of s' turns. My mother is starting to panic because the star is right behind us. We dirve through the curves and come too a small pond and work shop on the right side of the road. ( the pond is dryed up today but the work shop is still there). We pull off the road in front of the pond which is on the right side of the car, we rolled down the windows. By this time about 35 minutes have passed. The bright star was about 100 yards from the far side of the pond. Then the Bright lites just turned off! There was a disk (two plates face too face) object about 15 to 20 feet off the water of the pond. The moon was full that night and the reflection of the disk could be seen slowly, the disk came across the pond. The water didn't move there where no ripples of any kind. The only sound that the craft made was the sound of what sounds like an amplifer makes when it is turned up to full blast but no music is playing. My mother and I just sat ther not making a sound, watching this disk shaped craft. The craft made its way right over the car. We could not have been much more than 15 feet from it. I can say how far we where from it because it was inches away from the power lines, and power lines are maybe twenty feet from the ground. I don't know how long we sat there but we didn't get home until almost 10:00 o'clock that night. My father was kind of pissed we got home so late. My mother can't remember just how long we where there either, but I am sure it was at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. there are few things I can remember fully from my child hood but this I can remember like it was yesterday the smell of the air and the sound that that craft made have been implanted in my mind. It changed my mothers live as well. She quite going to church and hasn't ever gone back. I would love to know how the technology that alowed that ship to fly!!",2003-10-31T00:00:00,,

At some point, we became aware of a gigantic light (with no sound, only silence and the waves) filling our little bay, as if an incredibly huge spotlight (or gigantic ball of light) was shining on it -  I say ""became aware"" because oddly enough, our awareness of this light - something so extraordinary as to warrant a seriously excited response I should think - elicited in us at first no response or comment, as if we saw this kind of thing everyday, and it was almost in passing that I finally asked my friend if she noticed this huge light shining in front of us. She said she did and we simply continued to sit there and stare at it.  This huge light should have lit up the pier and the rocks on either side of it, but really didn't - it just lit up the water as if the light were somehow localized or focused on the water. I think I recall mentioning this odd ""light behavior"" to my friend while sitting on the beach and incredibly enough, I think she may have said something like, ""It must be the sun"" - which was a ridiculous thing to say when it's nighttime, and this out-of-character (in that it was absurd) comment from a girl who was an impressive student, high achiever and is now a doctor.  I don't know if the light was there when we walked onto the beach and sat down (I don't remember doing that either), and have no memory of seeing the light emerge from the darkness - it was simply ""there"" by the time we ""noticed"" it and I thought to ask my friend if she too was seeing it. So after a time - it may have been 5 minutes or an hour or 3 hours (I just don't have any idea of the time), I said that it was odd that no one else was out on the beach looking at this (it was impossible not to see it if you were awake - it was that huge and the houses on the beach were right next to each other, with 10 houses directly facing the bay and the light). I decided to get up and go wake up my brother to show him, as the light was constant and didn't seem to be going anywhere, and it seemed to have been there a long time.  So I walked up the beach, walked up the beach stairs to the top of our seawall and just as I reached the top, the light rose up, traveled to directly over my head, stayed there for a beat and then split into two smaller lights which then shot off in opposite directions. And that was that. It was gone.  I walked back to the beach and my friend still sitting there and attempted to talk with her about it and she turned to me and said ""I don't ever want to talk about this again."" And she walked home down the beach. And we never mentioned it again. In fact, I never told anyone until about 10 years later. Not because I was worried about what anyone would think, but because it didn't (oddly enough again) seem ""newsworthy"" or ""interesting,"" which, of course, it absolutely was.  The following morning, no one else in our neighborhood mentioned it, either. Perhaps they didn't see it, or like me, didn't find it ""newsworthy."" Another odd thing is that my friend and I were only 14. Neither of us was allowed out on the beach (or anywhere) alone at midnight (my best guess as to time, as no one was awake in the neighborhood), and my friend's parents were especially strict. Her summer curfew was about 9 pm back then. I find it odd that we were even out there at that time, that neither of us were ""missed"" while we were out, that no one came looking for us, that neither of us got caught or got in trouble for being out of the house so late at night, and that no one else in our crowded little area saw this. From the light, to our reaction, to even our presence there on the beach, the whole thing could not be stranger.  About 10 years later, I was riding in the car with my fiancee, and was reading a book about UFO sightings. A description of a sighting in the book was almost identical to the experience I'd had and I read it to him and told him that I had witnessed something similar. We had been together for 7 years at that point and when he asked me why I'd never mentioned it before, I was truly puzzled and wondered myself why I hadn't mentioned it to him or anyone before that. In fact, I've considered filling out your form many times before and haven't, because I didn't think it was really of interest, but now that I have finally written it down, it does seem quite a strange and maybe even amazing event.

The light did not emit heat, nor sound, which was even scarier.  At that point we did not know what it was, and the light got closer, and closer to to us, it was directly in front of the car.

We had been there a little over an hour, and the ironic thing was ((name deleted)) was telling me that he did not believe in ghosts and UFOs and was giving me a speech about rational thinking.  I suffer from an abnormal epileptic condition, and have noted when i see UFO i feel a tingling sensation that is in the epileptic family of sensation for me.  I told ((name deleted)) this and he said we were going to sit there till i admited this was none rational thinking.  This converation was nearing 9pm.  By about 9:15 was getting dark, cold, and starting to get hungry.  I still felt the sensation, but wanted to leave as was not dressed to be on a Mt after dark.  I was just about to admit to him was being irrational when i felt the sensation grow very intense.  We were sitting on large rocks and over ((name deleted)) shoulder i could see what appeared to be a falling star falling from directly overhead, and should quickly vansih behind a Mt we were facing.  ((name deleted)) saw it and said...  that is just.....  He paused as right before the object should have vanished it stopped above the tree line.  It was not very bright, and would say the Mt. across from us was maybe 2 to 3 miles away across the Beaver Dam area of N. Asheville.  ((name deleted)) stared at the object and was speechless.  It slowly bloomed to be much brighter.  It was mainly intense white in color, but was so bright it appeared blue at the edges on the light.  The light appeared more in rays than round coming from it and seemed to pulse with energy.  I was now tingling all over with the electrical sensation.  The object danced up above the tree lines and did shapes, then would drop below the mt area.  But near instantly would come back up in another area of the mt.  This went on for a period of about a min.  My friend was speaking random curses such as ""well ((deleted)) I cannot be seeing seeing this ((deleted)) thing""  Even, My dad is going to dis-own me if i tell him this!  Suddenly the object pulled up above the MT.  and speed up and away from us in a burst of speed and simple went out of visible site.  My friend ((name deleted)) looked at me and asked me if i was still feeling funny... and i answered him... even stronger now then before and started getting very frightened as right when i said this we heard sticks snap in every direction around us.  The car was about 75 feet up the hill from us and almost instantly hearing what sounded like hundreds of footsteps we made a mad dash for his Honda.  We did not take time to even open the doors... we were absolutely scared out of our wits.  ((name deleted)) dropped his keys trying to start the car.  Finally he was able to get it started and we drove down this very poorly made dirt road far faster than was safe.  After getting off the hill we came to an Ingle's grocery store that is about 3 miles away on the main road and went in simply to be near other people as we were so freaked out.  We sooner after went back to my home where a large group of our friends were visiting that night.  We all told the story to everyone there and we both were stil scared out of our wits.

I was a patrol agent in charge on both Canadian and Mexican borders for last 20 years of my career.  I was also a special agent for a time in San Francisco with the Office of Insector General, USDA.  I worked as head of intelligence unit for the Border Patrol, working as liaison officer with RCMP in Canada. I am not a flake.  I have had a couple of UFO sightings myself and have known several people over the past 40 years, many in law enforcement in different parts of the country who have told me credible UFO stories that they experienced.  I reported most of these to MUFON several years ago and in 1977 I was contacted in Indio, California where I was agent in charge of that station about a UFO sighting there.  The UFO sighting that I refer to above was reported in the San Diego Union-Tribune and I contacted the reporter/columnist about what I saw after I read his story.  He plead with people who may have seen what he saw to call in or write him.  I called him and told him who I was and what I had seen.  He wanted me to go on the local TV station in San Diego and confirm what he had sighted as he felt I was the most credible of the 45 witnesses who had called him.  Another Border Patrol supervisor confirmed that he had seen the same UFO as he departed his apartment in East San Diego to come to work.  When I asked permission from my chief patrol agent to go onthe TV show I was told, ""you are not going to make the Border Patrol look like a bunch of nuts...permission denied.""  The other supervisor acknowledged in front of the chief that he had seen it, also.  But when the chief made his statement to me, the other supervisor said, ""I am out of here...don't include me in this.""  What I saw and described, and drew a diagram of, and can still vividly remember it and am able to draw a diagram, was a light that was travelling along a ridge along highway 94 as I drove west on that highway in the Tecate area.  I was going to San Ysidro to go to work at the Border Patrol sector HQ.  I was stationed and in charge of the Campo BP station at the time but had been detailed to work at the HQ for a month to fill in for a vacationing asst chief.  I had to negotiate highway 94 and try to watch the object at the same time.  But it must have moved along the mountain tops in what I thought was the Jamul area.  I was looking west towards SD and I saw a heavy bank of low clouds or fog which was not unusual in the early morning as one approached SD.  The light moved from behind the cloud bank and it had a conical beam that was extremely bright.  I thought at first it was one of our helicopters that was searching the ridge for illegal aliens in that arae.  But I found out that none of our helicopters were out at that time of the morning.  The beam was just too bright for a helicopter light and it could shine through the clouds almost as brightly as in front of them.  I watched the light, and negotiated the highway, which is very curvy in that area, and I had to take my eyes off it from time to time.  The strange part was when I got to the bottom of highway 94 at Barrett Junction, i started back up the hill to the ridge where I thought the light had come from.  It was gone at that time.  I was very surprised when I topped the ridge in the Dulzura area, that there was no cloud bank and no fog.  It was very clear that morning and the city lights from San Diego could be seen plainly.  The incident went out of my mind until I read the newpaper article a couple of days later.  The reporter told me, and wrote in the paper also, that there were 45 people who called him and reported almost the same thing as we had seen.  The other BP supv also confirmed that was what he saw, too, but he saw it further out to the west, probably over the ocean.  Some people who called the reporter were jogging on the beach and they saw it over the ocean and said there was a small airplane moving towards SD from the west over the sea and the UFO swallowed the plane in it's beam.  There was no official confirmation from the Navy or any govt agency.  The one incident that I reported to MUFON...and my report should be on file with them from back around 1977 was something told to me.  This is a really wierd story but I believe it.  In 1977 there was a story that came to me through a BP agent at my station in Indio that one of his classmates stationed at Alamogordo BP station (White Sands) had gotten into some real trouble.  It seems that he and another agent went onto the missile range that was south of Alamogordo.  I think it is called the McGregor missile range.  Anyway, as it was reported to me, the two agents drove quite a ways down the range in their 4 wheel drive vehicle which they were not supposed to do.  If there were illgals walking up from the El Paso area, it was customary for the Air Police to pick them up and bring them out of the restricted area to the BP.  So, the guys were just going down to scope out the area and track aliens if there were any walking in the area.  Quite a ways into the restricted area, they spotted what they thought was a small cone shaped mountain which looked strange to them.  It looked like a small volcano cone, as they described it.  They reportedly parked there vehicle and climbed up the cone shaped mountain which wasn't too high, but I was not told how high it was.  When they got to the top they could look down into the crater part and saw a flying saucer parked in the bottom being attended by Air Force personnel.  They apparently realized they were seeing something they shouldn't and they crept back down the hill and got out of the area.  AFter work, that afternoon the two agents are reported to have met some other agents and people in a local tavern where they guys hung out, and after a couple of beers they started telling the others what they had seen in the restricted area.  AS the story goes, it was not very long when a couple of men in ""black suits"" showed up, showed their IDs and requested the two agents accompany them, to what is assumed an office at White Sands base.  As the story goes, they were debriefed, their agent in charge of the station was called in, and the two were immediately transferred to other duties with a day, and admonished in strong terms not to tell what they had seen.  The agent in charge of the station was an very old friend of mine whom I worked with as partners in Carlsbad, NM for 5 years.  He passed away of cancer last year.  I called him on the phone and relayed the story as I had heard it and asked him if it was true.  We were using a government phone line.  He was an ex-Marine, very patriotic person, and the way in which he answered me led me to believe that it was true.  In a very measured voice he replied, ""Don't know anything about it...never happened.""  And he made no further comment.  He left me to believe that he would not discuss the subject any further.  Some years later, after I had retired, another retired agent in charge and I stopped by this retired agent's home in Alamogordo.  This was in about 1995.  We were having a couple of drinks and I reminded him of the call I had made to him about the UFO incident in 1977.  I asked him if he remembered my call.  He said he did.  I then asked him again...""We are all retired now, you can tell me the truth about the UFO thing.""  He looked at me, and in almost identical words and same measured tone, ""Don't know anything about it...never happened.""  That told me that he definitely knew and that he had been sworn to secrecy never to tell..probably by the people at White Sands.  His ex-wife was a long time government employee, a secretary and she worked at White Sands.  So there were reasons that he could not talk.  He was the kind of person, had he been sworn to secrecy about a national security issue, he would take it to his grave...which he did.  But he let me know in his answer that it happened.  That was my take on it.  The investigator from MUFON was very interested in that story alone.  He didn't seem to be interested in any of the other things that I had seen or had relayed to me.  When I was stationed in Carlsbad, NM in the early sixties there were UFO stories all over the place.  There were some vivid sightings by state policemen.  One, who was station at Alamogordo even took out his accident investigation camera and took photos of a flying saucer that had landed off the highway early in the morning, only to have the men in black suits from White Sands confiscate his film.  He personally told me about that incident.  That happened in about 1962 or thereabouts.  I heard about another incident involving a state police officer driving north of White Sands when his car went dead.  Everything electrical on it went dead, according to him...no radio no anything.  He got out and walked a little down the highway and every other vehicle was dead along side the highway also.  He walked back to his patrol car, got in and after a few minutes everything came back on and all the other cars were starting up a moving.  He said that someone told him that they were conducting some kind of experiments at White Sands but he couldn[t find out exactly what it was.  Strangely enough, part of our working area out of Carlsbad was Roswell and the ranch area to the west.  We contacted the air police people at the air base there which was still a SAC base and we never heard a word about the July, 1947 incident during that time.  But there were some other strange things that went on around the SAC base in those days.  In about 1964 my partner and I were driving up to Clovis, NM to pick up some aliens that were in custody.  We had left Carlsbad abou 4am because it was a long round trip drive.  We passed through Roswell while it was still dark, and as we turned on to the highway to Portales, about 2 miles up the highway we ran into a state police roadblock.  There were two state police officers that we knew and they stopped us.  As I remember we were the only car stopped there.  They came over, and I was driving.  My partner (the same man who was in Alamogordo in 1977 that said ""never happened"") was working with me.  We asked what was going on because there were helicopters flying over the sand hills there, and jeeps moving all around on the sand dunes.  They had spot lights and were obviously looking for something.  The state police said, since we were federal officers and had security clearances, they could tell us what was going on.  They said that the Air Force people told them that one of the Atlas missiles in a silo (there were about 20 missile silos that ringed the base and Roswell) had ""accidentally"" been fired and it had a nuclear warhead on it.  They said they were told the missile was able to rip through part of the covering steel and concete doors on the silo, and that the nuclear warhead had flown off it and landed somewhere in the area and they were frantic because they could not find it.  After we sat there for a few minutes, they finally told us to drive on through since we were in a marked patrol vehicle, and we did.  We were warned if we saw anything laying in the road not to get near it.  We drove through, seeing all kinds of AF vehicles prowling over the sand dunes with search lights, and drove on to Portales and Clovis.  About a month later we saw one of the same state policemen in their Roswell office and remembered the missile incident.  We asked him what had happened.  He said that the AF told them that they had located the warhead somewhere back east...I think Cleveland.  they said that an old Indian was dying in a hospital from radiation poisoning.  The AF people said that they figured someone had stopped and picked up the warhead when it landed in the highway, put it in their car and drove away with it. They said that is what the old Indian told them.  He had seen it on the highway, stopped and put it in the trunk of his car and drove to Cleveland, getting sick about two weeks later.  The story didn't really make much sense to us but that was what the AF said.  We also heard that one other silo had been blown up by and accidental missile shooting in it.  I recently heard some retired AF captain or something talking about how the missile silos (around Roswell, I believe) were harrassed by UFOs and there had been some major accidents in the silos caused by the UFOs.  I always wondered if that wasn't what really happened that morning and that the AF gave a cover story about the warhead being stolen by and old Indian.  It was strange because had an Atlas missile been shot off in a silo, the crew in the control room down under would have been killed or something.  We never heard a word about anything like that.  It was a very strange incident that has always stuck in my mind.  There are other stories that I have heard over the years from other officers, but am getting writers cramps right now.  I enjoyed hearing you on the radio tonight as on occasions before.  Keep up the good work.  I will bet that your job is fascinating.

The first major sighting to occur in a series of sightings, which later were to become known as the ""Hudson Valley Sighting,"" occurred on March 23, 1983, according to ""The Encyclopedia of Extraterrestrial Encounters,"" by Ronald D. Story.  [Please see the NUFORC website for details of that publication.]  The Hudson Valley sightings continued into the year 1984.  PD)) V shaped UFO tracked for miles by Ct residents  (Hudson Valley Connected) This sighting had taking place some time ago near the year 1983. It was witnessed by hundreds in Connecticut and I had later found out it was first spotted in Lond Island NY. I seems it was tracked form Long Island all the way to Waterbury CT. My sister had received a phone call from a friend saying there was a UFO comming towards our house and it had just passed her house. Well by the time we had gotten outside a few other calls must had been made because we were not the only ones out there. As we waited more people from the nieborhood came out to see what was going on. To my best count there were more than 25 people outside in the street just in our area. It did not take long for this object to appear. The houses in the area were all two story and pleanty of tree's that stood a bit higher blocked our vision so we all stood in the street that never reiced much traffic. As this object came into view over the houses no one spoke. There wasn't much to see as it blocked out the stars and the underside was lightless. No sound from the craft was herd as we looked upon it. You could make out shapes on the bottom but not clearly becuase of the lack of light and it all seemed to be the same color a dull dark grey almost black. It had taken a close to a minute to travel over us, it moved very slowly but steady. It seemed to be just over the tree tops wich made judging the size nearly impossible because you could not see all of it at once. Like I had said it just blocked out the stars as it passed over us like we wernt there. As it passed out of sight nobody said a thing and people just seemed to go back to there houses a bit stunned. My grandfather was ranting saying "" there's no such thing as UFO's when we received the phone call but after it had passed by he hadn't said much. We went into the house and he turned on the am radio (WICC in Bpt) and we listened as people called in about this object in the sky. People tracked it all the way to Waterbury and it was said it followed Rt 8 all the way there causing traffic to stop. People got out of there cars on a highway to watch. As it hit Waterbury new reports came in saying it had lights on it and that it was V shaped, something I could not see for myself. The lights were reported as large white lights and it had hoverd there for some time as hundreds of people watched. If I am not mistaken it left at a very high rate of speed but I did not see this and my memory of what I had herd is a bit cloudy now. My reason for writting this now is to gather more information on this sighting. I would like to research this further along with a few other sightings around that time. What I need is the exact date and time. I am planing to go to the library to see what I can pull up. You see this sighting was so huge that the next day it was in all the news papers dressed up as a hoax. It was reported as five ultralight aircraft flying in tight formation with huge lights on them that had come out of a NY airport. I can't speak for the sightings in Waterbury but what I had seen was by no means explained away by this. I have researched a bit about the Hudson Valley Sightings and I believe these are all linked but this one was seen by far more people than any of them I had read about. I have read many of storys that revolved around this and one even went as far as to speak of the military shooting one down that came on regular intervuls in Long Island. Something of a plasma weapon used to take it down and it was tracked with dobblar radar ( a military radar before used weather forcasters, or so its said) I'm getting a bit off track here but if you have any information on this please post it here. It will be a great help to me... thank you.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,41.213053513513515,-73.12902108108108

I looked at the book and inside a red square were these words TOP SECRET OFFICIAL US AIRFORCE FILES ON UFO""S. I told him that I couldn't read it because it was marked top secret, He said go ahead their giving them to all the new pilots to prepare them for what they might see.So I began reading it and it realy blew my little country boy mind there were hundreds of pictures of UFO's of every discription. And with the pictures were complete follow up reports. One picture was of a old house the jets took one picture at 10,000 feet and another at 20,000 feet, it had a chimney and a front porch and every thing.The followup report said it just kept going right out of radar range.another was a huge disc shaped craft hovering over a high power line and like streaks of lightning going up from the power lines to the craft, the follow up report said the metering station reported missing 80,000 watts of electricy.There were cigar shaped ones triangle shaped ones many disc shaped ones, all kinds.There were interveiws with people who had seen aliens and of those that had been abducted and discriptions of alliens and pictures people had drawn of aliens. I promise you that as hard as it is to believe every word is true, I know the Government knows about alien space craft they just don't want the people to know so they cover it up.

PD)) While walking at night, I saw an object with rod-like extensions and colored lights move directly across my path in front of me. I was walking down my small rural subdivision street in Brighton, Michigan with a neighbor at about 11:00 p.m. on a mid-summer night about nineteen years ago.  We were on our way to my house.  We were alone.  The weather was very calm and still.  There were no clouds in the sky.  I do not remember if wether or not the moon was up that night.  If it was up at that time, it was behind us and not very bright.  The night was very quiet, dark and filled with stars as there were no nearby city lights.  My neighbor was on my left side as we were walking down my subdivision street.  The street is straight and runs north (the direction we were walking)and south.  On the west side of the street is an open field and on the east side is thick woods with houses set back off the street about 150 feet into the woods.  While walking down this street (heading north), we both saw (at about the 10 o'clock position) an object moving low in the sky over the open field.  It moved in a straight and horizontal path at a constant speed.  It was moving from the west to the east.  It's movement was exactly perpindicular to our path.  It did not rotate during our view of it.  It was approximately 50 yards from us as it passed over the street directly in front of us.  There was no sound at all!  There was no sound prior to seeing it, and no sound while we were witnessing it.  When it passed over the street it disappeared from our view as it moved just above the tree tops on the east side of the street.  From the time we first saw it to the time it disappeared from our view was about five or six seconds.  The body of the object was dark and generally round.  I could see the silhouette of it with the night sky behind it.  It's height was about the same as it's length.  It's body was about the size of four full moons as seen from our distance from it.  There were a lot of rod-like extensions protruding straight out of the body in all directions.  The extensions were also dark, just as the body of the object was.  The extensions varied a little in length, from about half the diameter of the body of the object to about the full diameter of the body.  I did not see a pattern to the extensions with regard to each one's length with respect to where it was protruding out of the body of the object.  However, the extensions appeared to be evenly spaced from each other where they protruded from the body.  From the one side of the object that was in view (because it did not rotate), I saw approximately twenty of these extensions evenly spaced around the entire body of the object.  At the very end of each extension was a single light.  The color of these lights were red, blue, green, yellow, and white.  None of the lights were blinking or changing colors or fading out.  All of the lights were steadily on.  When it disappeared from our view we stopped walking.  We stood there stared at where it disappeared over the tree tops in front of us and listened.  There was no noise and the air was still.  Then my neighbor said, ""What was that?""  I said, ""I don't know.""  We continued walking north towards my driveway.  We reached my driveway about two minutes later and turned to walk down it.  My driveway is straight and runs east off of the street with woods on both sides of it.  My house sits about 150 feet down the driveway on the south side.  The driveway continues past my house as a firetrail which deadends about 500 feet further back into the woods.  We had not taken ten steps yet on my driveway walking east when we saw the same object again.  It came into our view in front of us out of the north and was moving to the south.  It moved straight and perpindicular to our path just above the tree tops with a constant speed and horizontal movement, just as we saw it moving two minutes earlier.  The object passed in front of us at the same distance from us as before-about 50 yards.  Again, there was no sound at all.  The object disappeared from our view when it passed just above the tree tops on the south side of the driveway.  I immediate! ly felt as though this object was tracking us.  The speed at which the object was moving when we first saw it from the street did not allow for the time it took us to walk the rest of the distance to the driveway and see it again two minutes later in the same manner and at the same distance in front of us.  The disturbing feeling that we both felt as soon as we saw it the second time was that the object stopped and waited just out of our view from the street until we reached my driveway two minutes later.  That was about nineteen years ago and the two of us have not seen this object a third time.  I am reporting this today because of the recent reporting of the Howell Township, Michigan crop circles.  Howell is now my home town.  I read the local papers about these crop circles.  One article mentioned that there have been several hundred reportings of UFO sightings in the Howell and Brighton area dating from just this month to several decades ago.  I have never visited this web sight before today, but I felt that with all of these reportings in Livingston County, Michigan, I should report what I witnessed in case anyone that reads this may have seen what I saw nineteen years ago and would like to report their witnessing of this object.

I had just started my drive into Mora, NM where I was employed at the time.  I got out toward the edge of town in Las Vegas when something caught my eye in the windshield.  I saw something shiny in the sky.  My first thought was that it was the sun reflecting on the windshield, but a better look told me it was in the sky.   I pulled my car over to the side of the road and got out just to make sure I wasn't seeing reflection.  At that point I became somewhat alarmed because I thought I was seeing a plane crashing due to the angle of the object and its path.  If it kept on going it would hit the hills to my right.  I thought I was seeing  an unpainted plane fuselage from the side but then noticed there was no tail to the object.  I should probably note that the object seemed to be luminous and I could not determine its exact shape.  It was bright enough that it hurt my eyes to view it directly for very long. Anyway, as I was standing there watching this thing slowly proceed at this awkward angle toward the hills it stopped dead and hung in the sky.  At the time it stopped it had gone low enough thatI could see the hills behind it.  That is when it really got strange.  I am standing there wondering just what the hell I was looking at when I get the feeling that it is watching me back.  I can't describe this very well, but I was flooded by a feeling of being caught doing something wrong.  That thing really was looking back at me!  What I report next sounds fabulous even to me and I experienced it.  I could swear I heard a conversation in my head between 2 or 3 different people.   Voice 1:  We are being observed. Voice 2: It is not permitted to be observed. Voice 3: We must leave. Then the object seemed to rotate and either shot off at an incredible speed or winked out.   It was just there and then it seemed to be gone in the distance.  It left me there shaking in my sneakers. For the record:  I freely admit that I have been fascinated by the UFO controversy and have enjoyed science fiction since I was a young kid.  That being said I have also served in the Army's Presidential Honor Guard.  I am not making this up. The whole time I watched this thing I was fascinated by it.  I had read about abductions and contacts etc before that time.  It had been reported that some aliens communicated telepathically.  While I was watching I was also thinking ""please land!""  I think that the fear I felt and the conversation I heard might have been their way of saying ""We'd like to stop, but it isn't allowed and we'll all get in trouble.  What I really wanted at that point was to have my existence acknowledged by them and I feel that they complied with my wish to the extent they felt they could get away with.

I was pointing at cassiopia, which is seen as a ""w"" shape, when I noticed that it had an extra star.  I shone the beam on it, flashing it to signify the odd star. Suddenly, it flashed a beam back at us then shot off at high speed. Next day, I was riding my GSX/R 1100 [brand new] along the country roads, running it in at high speed when I made a mistake that should have cost me my life. I wont go into the details here, but somehow, my bike defied the laws of physics and I was able to stop before the accident [the speeds were really high, I'm a very experienced rider having started riding at seven years old]. When I got back to the campsite, I was telling some campers about what had happened when someone noticed that there were tyre marks on the lower fairing where the wheel had rubbed. Anyone who rides bikes will know that this would be impossible to do under braking force. The forks were straight and true. It was as if something stopped me before certain impact! I couldn't help thinking the event was related to the object we saw the night before. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-08-28T00:00:00,,

I was outside taking out the trash, when I noticed this large object overhead with all white lights shinning down coasting along at a slow speed.  I could barely make out the shape, but the lights were shinning down in a V shape, just like the Lubbock UFO!!!! This was a very large object! Much bigger than an airliner. It was about several hundred feet in the air, and made not a single sound. I was only about to see it for a couple of seconds, because I was out on my front lawn next to the Apartment, and a line of trees next to a hill.  I remember all the lights I would say it had the same amount as the Lubbock. I can tell you it had more larger lights than smaller ones.  They were not blinding lights, but they were highly visible looking straight up! I always have been a big Aircraft fan (that’s one of the reasons I am in the Air force). I can promise you this was no aircraft! With all my current knowledge of AF aircraft I never herd of any such type of aircraft then or now! When it got to the tree line all the lights went out of site and it was gone.  The direction of this object was heading from north to south. I’m sure my parents, and my sister never did believe me the 7th grader. I hope this report helps. I hope you can help me shed some light on this, Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I noticed no sound because I could still hear crickets and palmento bugs cherping. The wasn't but maybe 100 feet off the top of the building. Once I saw the entire bottom of the craft it was huge. A massive rectangle in shape, I would say the size of a football field. That is 50 yards in width and 100 yards in length. It was close enough to see that the craft was made of what appeared to be metal. It had semetrical design that's to say I could see long flat ""beams"" (like I beams used in construction) they kind of criscrossed over the objects' undersurface meeting in a triangel pattern. In each triangle had it's own semitery a circular indentation and a receded light that was not very visible a sort of green in color. As it passed completely overhead and I could see the end of the object I was looking for the balloon part of the blimp and it wasn't there, it wasn't until that moment that I realized it wasn't a blimp. The object was thin at Max. 4 feet in depth. That was when I ran inside screaming there is a UFO outside! I was met with ""ya right"".

It had a searchlight shining down on the cars at the top of the hill much like a search helicopter would normally do. Except as I drove closer to the flying object I soon realized some strange things about it. It was unusual to see helicopters flying outside of Sacramento at that time of night, and I noticed it had no flashing strobe lights whatsoever - only two bright white ""wingtip"" or ""landing"" lights. The object became clear to me that this was not a helicopter as it had wingtip lights, however, it moved as slowly as a helicopter. Getting more closer, I think this is a very large and low flying plane with a wingspan of a B-52 or larger. Still, no flashing lights. Now it has turned off it's searchlight and moved to fly along the right side of the highway. At this time I am making my way towards the top of the hill and the object is about to come along side of me on my right side going down the hill as I am driving up the hill. The object is less than 100 feet above ground and about 100 feet out from the road flying slowly just above some power lines that were part of a large Sacramento radio antenna at the top of the hill. ""What the hell is that thing?"" I kept asking myself. It was too dark to make out anything. It was way too big to be a large plane with just two lights and no strobes flying way to low and slow. It wasn't until I was directly alongside the object, I rolled down my window to see if I could hear any engine noise when I saw enormous light between the wingtip lights. Rows of red, clear, and like a neon purple in  tubular sections, and there was purple lightning dancing between the bottom of the object and the ground! I screamed I was so scared because I was so close to it and yet I! had no answer to what it was other than alien being a real possibility. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I honked my horn and tried to get the people in the car passing me to look at it as I waved my hand pointing frantically at it for them to see. Once I had passed along side of it and passed it, I could no longer see the colored lights between the wingtips anymore, only the two white wingtip lights. I tried to pull over but couldn't so had to wait until I reached the top of the hill. I got to the top and pulled over and got out and looked, but it was gone. Shoook my head got back in the car headed home and I saw it again in my rear view mirror. It was just too low to see when I got out. I watched it for as long as I could in the mirror as I drove off in fright. The object stayed on it's course heading for Sacramento, slow and very low to the ground. The entire drive back home was strange, I kept looking up at the sky as I drove thinking there was maybe a mass invasion going on. When I got to Tahoe it was 5:30am. To this day I still have no idea why it took that long to get home. It's only a 2hr. drive. I only stepped out of the car for a minute or two at the top of that hill. I wanted to get a better look at it. I KNOW others had to have seen this but might have thought it was just a plane. If I only had a passenger or a camera at the time. I actually went back one week later during the day and took photos of the site and made documentations for myself.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,38.6839,-121.0526

We were to meet in El Dorado Hills for some supplies. It was late, about 10:15pm when we met at his RV. We were all outside on a very clear warm evening, No moon that night you could see billions of stars and easily spot a satellite going by in space, and I did. Being an avid astronomer myself, I pointed almost directly up at the sky and said ""look at this satellite going by"" So by the time everyone looks up and sees it - out from the south came a fish-tailing light about the same brightness as the satellite. It was fish-tailing from left to right as it went forward in space. And guess what, it was on a collision course with that satellite! ((Uncle's name deleted)) uncles older niece  (sic--cousin to witness??) said ""what's that thing below it?"" My jaw dropped.. I replied, ""I don't know.."" We all watched as this weird object made its way with the satellite in it's path. When it got to almost where it looked like they were going to collide.. BOOM! This thing just went crazy, started doing these violent superfast zig zags around the satellite as if it were threatened!! It did that in an instant, and when it did we all screamed at the same time! Look at what we were witnessing way up in space! And I bet we were the only ones to see it. You had to be looking up at the right place at just the right time. Nothing we have will ever reproduce the swift movements of whatever that thing is/was nor does it make any sense to have such vehicles behave like that. After the zig zag attack on the satellite, the craft went back into it's fish-tailing left to right movement as it went forward, heading West, high above the earth. About a half a second-left and a half a second right is about the pulse it was moving at. It seemed like an inefficiant way of travel. Very alien. We watched it fishtail for about a minute until it was too far away to see anymore. You probably won't believe this, but I had a sighting 2 years prior to this in the same ar! ea! With this sighting I am now fully convinced we are NOT alone in the universe. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-08-28T00:00:00,38.6839,-121.0526

I've had to to estimate the dates since this was about 4 years ago. I was in training at Fort Gordon (military base) in the 31-R course (Tactical Multi-Channel Transmission Systems Operator Maintainer). We were on a very large open field that we called ""The antenna field"" thats right behind the PX at Fort Gordon, there's also some old barracks that are no longer used (more useless information: These old barracks were used [as the barracks] in the Clint Eastwood movie ""Heart Break Ridge""). We were learning how to install the 9 meter antenna mast (used with a Radio Access Unit). It requires a minimum of 3 soldiers to install (although I've figured out a way that ONE troop could do it), we had four soldiers and one of our two civilian instructors (GTE employees - working for the GTE Resident School, Now called the General Dynamics Resident School). I was holding the Kevlar anchor cable, getting ready to lock it down - we were almost done making adjustments, when I heard the soldier to my right (Private Shaw) SCREAM at the top of his lungs ""LOOK AT THAT %#*(^%  UFO!!"" (thats exactly what he said). I looked up and saw a HUGE light streaking across the sky at incredible speeds. I dont know what I could compare it to since it was like nothing I've ever seen in my life. The civilian instructor didn't even look up, and he yelled at ME for taking my eyes off the anchor cable! (he yelled ""((name deleted)) pay attention to what your doing!""). So I looked down just long enough to lock the cable down (less than one second) and when I looked back up it was gone. Several nights later we were putting up a 30 meter mast and not every team would end up working because it took the entire duration of a class to do (and not enough masts for each group) so on this night my team was in a large white tent watching movies (most of which sucked) and eating crappy chinese food. I was bored with the movie so I went outside & looked up (still freaking out because of the previous sighting several days ago). I saw a bright lig! ht in the sky far off in the distance. One would have mistaken it for a star if not familiar with the constelations (which I am). It was sitting inside of Orion - I knew it didn't belong there (there's only supposed to be SEVEN stars in the Orion constelation). It didn't move for about 5 hours - even as the stars moved away from it through out the night (I kept going back out & kept track of it) it stayed in the same spot - it's position in relation to the constelations continued to change as the stars moved through the sky. I only stared at it for about 15 minutes each time (how long can you stare at ANYTHING before you get bored?). Towards the end of the night I went back outside & noticed that the light was no longer there - but there were about 6 Black Hawk helicopters flying all the way AROUND the spot where it was. They were NOT passing THROUGH the area where the light was! (even though it was no longer there) But going ALL THE WAY AROUND that area! I know my description drags on & on, but I have done my best to be as accurate as possible.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,,

At about 22:30 hours we observed a diamond shaped aircraft approach our location from the SW, flying generally NE. No outside lights other than farm security lights were in the area and none were very bright. There was a full moon. For about one hour prior to this observation we had been watching a red light in the sky SE of our location go up and down in an acrobatic fashion, diving and climbing rapidly and performing turning motions. That light was in the general direction of Connersville, Indiana. The diamond shaped craft approached from the SW. Our conclusion as to the shape was based on lights on four ""corners"" of the craft. There were several lights and they appeared to be on the ends of the ""wings"" but they were not bright enough to illuminate the craft or  the ""wings"" Most were white but none were flashing strobe lights. The craft flew almost directly over our location at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet. What struck us was the lack of any engine noise. It was absolutely silent.We did not hear its approach and it made no noise as it passed over us. It flew to the NE generally in the direction of Richmond, Indiana or slightly to the west of that city. It was visible for about one minute. Our conclusion was that it was a military aircraft because of our relative proximity to Dayton, Ohio and Wright Patterson Air Force base.Our host told us that he had seen similar objects in the night sky many times before. His home is no closer than 1/2 mile to any other residence and the sky is very dark. There is very little light pollution from Indianapolis 50 miles to the west or from Richmond 20 miles or so to the east.I am retired military and familiar with aircraft identification procedures.The other guests were all adults about 45-55 years old. We were all sober. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-01-17T00:00:00,39.8123,-85.2088

Before I start my stories, I have to let you know that I haven’t any even a bit of interest in astronomy when I was still a pupil, but before I recognized what I have seen, I began to pay attention to the dark sky for nearly 10 years. During these years, the curiousness to the universe was energy supporting my work. Well, you may have been out of patient. And I’ll start my own stories about UFO . And there are graphs to illustrate what I say, if you are interested in them, please send Email to me and I'll send them to you. ((e-address deleted)))  1.When I was a child, about 8 years old (around 1988). It happened in an summer evening when my parents and me were outdoor for cool wind. I noticed that there was a ""argent balloon"" standing still in the high sky just above our boarding house. It was in the round shape and its side which toward the sun was argent. My parents and some neighbors noticed too. Then, we asked the man living in the top floor to have a look at what to the earth it was, but the man said that it was too high to see clearly. When it was dark, the ""balloon"" still standing here but changed into a very bright star-the brightest star in the sky that day. 2.A unclouded morning in the winter when I was a pupil (around 1990). I got up as usual and when to the bath room to wash my face, then I detected through the windows there was a bright star in the sky. Contrasted against a tree outside the window and between the star and me, it was about waist of the tree. Because, in my memory, I haven’t seen such bright star before, so I kept my eyes on it. About 15 minutes later (The sun shine was just available that moment), it has been moved up to the top of the tree. And in the next minute, all for a sudden, the bright light disappeared and there was a ball (at least I think it like a ball, because of the distance) floating in the sky (a little big than I saw in story 1, maybe it because of the different distance). And in the second minutes, there were something like glinting lights looked like the lights beneath airplane began glinting on the bottom of the ball. At first, one white light, than, one blue light, and two white lights, two blue lights. More and more lights glinted alternate, meanwhile, the ball began to movie faster and faster toward the East-directed to the Sun. Until it was out of my sight, there were approximate 3 seconds, then the ball reached a astonishing speed that was much more faster than any plane I have ever seen before. 3.Years later(I’m a student in junior high school ), one morning I got up at 6:00 and sat down on my desk to prepare for my final examination. A familiar scene-the brightest star standing around the moon. For it I haven been prepared a pair of telescope, but I can’t see anything else but a bright ball. But I took notice of the distance of the star and the moon: fortunately, there was a smaller star beside the moon, and through the telescope the moon and the smaller star just like a background picture of the bright star-caused by distance. Obviously, the bright one was in the atmosphere. I kept observing it for about 5 minutes, during the time, it was quiescent. But 2 minutes later when I return to the window, it has been disappeared. I realized something and look toward the East-the Sun just rose up. 4.Maybe the UFO will visit me in every certain years. I met it again when I was a senior high school student. Morning, after I got my school, I found every one in the school was looking in the sky. Then I discovered there was a huge ""earthen plate"" floating in the sky! I can’t believe what I saw! It looked like a plate and there was a small circle on the central of the plate. Slowly, I move toward the shining Sun in the East, and in the end was covered by the Sun light. It was reported in the newspaper and some astronomer explain that it was formed by the ash from collision of two minor planets in the atmosphere.  I’m 21 and is an academician now. These usual experiences gave me spiritual energy to study science. And now, I want to share my stories with you.  ((name deleted)) 2003.12.30  (wee hours)  2:20 ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was driving my regular route as airport shuttle driver from Cheyenne, Wyoming to Fort Collins, Colorado on Interstate 25 and had one passenger onboard -- a civilian employee of the USAF on his way from Warren AFB to Vandenberg AFB, California.  At 17:32 I noticed a brilliant motionless white light about 20 times brighter than the star Sirius some 15 degrees above the southwest horizon.  I first thought it must be an airplane with its landing light on.  After 10 seconds, the light reduced to the magnitude of Sirius and stayed like this for several minutes.  Finally, I mentioned the object to my passenger, whereupon it immediately increased its brightness to 20 times Sirius for 10 seconds, reduced again becoming momentarily invisible, and then returned to magnitude of Sirius.  It held this appearance from 17:37 until 17:52, when it set behind a cloud bank in the position of the planet Mercury.  At the time of this sighting, I was 27 years old, attending college in Laramie, Wyoming, had served four years in the U.S. Navy, and was a private pilot.  I had also had training in basic astronomy and astrophysics.  We had left Little America in Cheyenne at 17:00, and then checked for passengers at the Holiday Inn, which we left at 17:10.

There was no noticable sound which I would have expected with a helicopter or plane.  This area is very quiet, and having served in Vietnam, I am quite familiar with the sounds of helicopters.  I got my binoculars and watched the craft until my wife said, ""We need to finish unloading the Van"".  On each trip back in the house, I would again go into the back yard and look at the craft.  I think it just started moving then moved away real fast and disappeared.  In the following two years that I lived in that house, I spent many evenings in the back yard and never again saw anything remotely like this disc.  A few years later I tried looking up any information that might have been reported in the local paper.  I found none.  Roughly three years ago a local radio talk show host mentioned he saw a UFO when he lived in Santa Paula, which is roughly East, Southeast of Ventura.  The time period sounded about the same.  About four years after the incident I was talking to an ex next door neighbor.  She mentioned that there had been a UFO sighting in that area and that she had gone to pick up her daughter at an evening church class.  Something above the car shinded a light so bright on her car, that she had to pull over to the side of the road until the light went out.  At the time of the sighting, I had been a mechanic at a local dealership for about 8 years.  My wife was a technologist in the medical field, and the neighbor was the wife of a local doctor.

This particular night I was staring up at the sky and there, directly above us, at what seemed like miles in altitude, was a gigantic triangular thing with bright lights on each tip of  the triangle. The thing just sat there motionless for a couple of minutes. Then, without warning, it began rotating back and forth as if on a fixed point. After I came out of my state of shock I grabbed my dad and showed him what I was looking at. My dad is not very emotional. He just kind of looked at it and said, ""Oh yeah. My brothers and I use to see that thing out on the farm all the time when we were kids."" Then he went back to spraying the apples while I flew inside the house to get my mom and grandma to show them the thing. They were frustratingly slow and was begging them to hurry. By the time we got out there, the thing was gone and I was royally p.o.ed. My dad was still standing there with the hose. I asked him where the thing went. He said he didn't know.

We met many others in the sky. All were floating through the air feet first dressed in pajamas. We landed in the Angeles Forest in the foothills of the San Gabriel Valley near a flying saucer.  One ""alien"" removed here helmet. She looked orientally human. She gave us shots in arm. Then we woke up. I remembered the dream. My wife did not. But we both had sore arms where the shots were administered and there were red marks. I had fallen asleep about 4:00 a.m. and awoke at 6:30.  The experience seemed to last 20 to 30 minutes. Very clear like a single long scene from a movie with no cuts.  This was a dream but of course what is a dream? This was by no means a typical abduction experience. No bright lights. No little green men. The alien looked very human.  There was no terror. There was no hypnosis required to help recall the dream. I remembered the dream as soon as I awoke.

It was a great distance from the ground and I couldn't even begin to say how far. Since I had a perfect view from east to west I saw another object that was identical in the east. Suddenly the object in the east moved at a very high rate of speed and joined the object in the west. There was no trail of vapor that comes from planes,no sound, nothing. It shot across like a laser beam to the other. But it left no trail of any kind and I know from the speed it was not a plane.

Thursday,6/11/1964 was a beautiful clear night.  Driving north on Rt. 128 a short distance before the Rt. 109 exit, I glanced ahead to my left, at what I thought was a huge bright full moon a short distance above a small pine tree on top of a rock formation.  I was mesmerized by the fact that it was so large and bright and so close to the roadside.  My fascination turned to terror when I realized that there were no markings on it.  I also, couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.  I sped up, desperately wanting to get away and yet, also wanting to take the next exit,(Rt. 109) back to the previous one, (Rt. 1) to return and see it again.  But, I was a young woman, driving alone and shaking like a leaf. I was deep in thought,puzzling over what I had just seen, when, a few miles away, where the trees and foliage by the roadside no longer blocked my view, I saw the real full moon on the horizon, markings and all.  At my family's behest,I did not reported it to the police. I was a teacher in the local high school in my home town of Arlington and they were afraid that I would be held up to ridicule. A couple of weeks later, I heard a radio interview with a man who was the head of the UFO group in Ma.  I contacted him and submitted the form he sent me.  His first name was Raymond, but I cant remember his last name.  I never heard from him, after that. In December, of 1964,(I remember it as the final Sunday issue of the Boston Globe for the year,) a full page spread was run concerning UFO sightings in N.E. for the year. It was stated in the article that 3 people in Hingham, Ma. had reported that very same sighting, on that date. So. at least I was vindicated before my family, who were skeptics. I have never forgotten my experience and have spoken of it many times over the years. But, I still have difficulty dealing with the attitudes of those who listen and look at me askance.  I know what I saw was real. As for electrical effects...from the time I was a small child, during an electrical storm, I get an odd sensation in my chest, a reaction I guess and I felt that same sensation as I drove past that object.",,42.2451,-71.184

My Family (Father, Mother, Older Brother 12, Myself 5, and my younger brother 2) was driving home on a rural dirt road to our farm house near dusk (i.e. somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00 at night in July). We were heading west down the dirt road that passes by our house when we saw a strange light emanating from behind our nearest neighbors house. The light was brilliant. As we drove nearer we asked each other ""when did our neighbor install a spot light in their yard?""  We approached our neighbors house for about a mile and kept looking at the light, but did not understand why they had installed such a bright light in their yard. The road turns North directly in front of their house. As we headed North, my brother, mother, and I kept our eyes focused on the light and we determined the light was not coming from their yard, but instead was coming from a craft/UFO hovering behind their house. After traveling North for 200 yards North, we turned west again and all of us including my father could now see the saucer shaped craft hovering about 100 feet off the ground 100 yards behind the neighbors house.  The craft was a brilliant orange, metallic color and was 30-40 tall and 100-150 feet wide and it was the classical saucer shaped craft.  We then turned into our driveway (North) and parked the car about 100 yards from the main road which left the craft hovering about 300 yards south from where we were parked.  We all got out of the car and focused our attention on the craft. It continued to hover there 100 feet above the hill in the neighbor's farm field. There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. The color was a brilliant fiery orange and it looked like there were windows on the upper half of the craft. The light from the craft appeared to have similar characteristics to heat rising from a hot road. We watched the craft from outside our house for about a minute and then went in the house because I believe our parents were worried for our safety. We went in the house and watched the craft hover above that hill for 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes it descended and landed behind that hill. We could no longer see the craft , but there was a brilliant halo of light coming up from behind the hill. We watched the area for another 5 minutes and the craft ascended to about 100 feet above the hill again. It continued to hover there (300 yards south of our house) for another 15 minutes, but then flew away to the south and disappeared in the forest in a swampy area south of our farm. The encounter lasted for over 30 minutes and I still remember it vividly even though I was only 5 years old.  After the craft left, my parents put us to bed and went to sleep themselves. My dad slept with loaded hunting rifle on their bed. My parents never reported the incident because they thought people would think they were nuts. There were other sightings in the area around that time and the people that made reports were labeled as ODD.  My parents never even talked with the neighbors about the encounter to see if they saw the craft which landed about 100 yards in back of their house.  My parents still live in that same town, so even 30 years later when we visit Minnesota, we talk about the event and drive past the site.

I thought his story should be shared  Friday, October 15,1999  My first UFO,  I finally have seen a UFO tonight at approx. 8:30 PM CDT. 10-15-99.  We ( friend #1, friend #2 and I ) were taking Friend #3 home this evening and on the way there, we stopped on a country road West of Ellis to chat, listen to tunes and watch the traffic go by on Interstate 70. Me being a star hound and watching the skys alot, had my head out the window looking around at the sky and Jupiter and watching for Saturn to rise above the horizon. There was a thin haze of clouds going over but thin enough to tell where Jupiter was and I could barely see Saturn through the clouds, just above the horizon. It was cool and windy so no one was getting out of the van. As I scanned the sky I saw what started to look like a meteor heading South and it got very bright and I started to have a thought that it was heading straight towards us because the flame of it looked peculiar and flared to an odd shape, just in one place and didn't look like it was heading in any one direction, then it dimmed and started heading South. When I first saw it, I told the guys something like, OOH YOU GUYS, like I was seeing an odd sort of slow motion meteor hitting the atmosphere and then as I saw it looking like a satellite and heading in a straight line South. I told them that I thought it was a satellite that had just turned or I had just caught the glimpse of sunlight shining off a panel on the craft and grabed my binoculars and started to watch it race along the way satellites do when, I swear to my honor and Gods, that it turned 180% and came back to the North for a short distance and turn back South again and stopped. I was telling my friends about this as it happened. It sat there motionless for several minutes and then as suddenly as it stopped, it started off to the West and stopped and turned and went back and forth in several different directions, going only short distances and then would move a short distance more, stopping at points and turning the other way and I watched it do that for at least five or six minutes when it quit moving. It was blended into the sky just as a star and didn't move ! at all so I had to prop my head up with one hand so I could hold still on the object with my binoculars and did that for several more minutes. I would approximate that after five to eight minutes of spotting this object, three jets then came from the West, of the first two, one banked and seemed to take the heading towards Great Bend direction and stayed low, the other turned and flew straight toward the direction I was watching this object and the third jet also coming from the West seemed to turn and go up toward that area of sky I had been watching. By this time friend #1 and friend #3 had got out of the van and saw the jets flying in there directions and I pointed to the one that was flying toward the area I was looking at. We watched as the two jets looked like they were climbing very quickly and then made a loop and started heading back to the West when the cool got the better of us and we got back in the van.  I stuck my head out the window a few more times that evening before we left the place we were sitting and will continue to watch the skies for all the celestrial events, the stars, constellations, and satellites and hopefully more UFO type objects in the sky.  I have always said, ""I will believe it when I see it,"" and tonight is the night that I can say that I have seen it. So help me God !",2004-01-17T00:00:00,38.9146,-99.6045

The craft emitted a low hum which I could feel throughout my body.  Every hair on my body was raised, though I suspect from fear.  The light completely filled the cab of my truck but i was able to see out my windshield fine.  I was unable to get more than a fleeting glance because I was affraid and unable to look at it more than once. I would slam on the brakes hoping the craft would pass but it would stay perfectly parallel to me.  I sped up to approx 90 mph which it also matched, perfectly.  I was driving in the left lane north bound on SR3 which is bordered by a grass island then the south bound lanes.  The craft was above the grass island.  It then went staight up and disappeared. I slowed down and looked around for a helicoptor, police car, riding lawn mower anything that could make what I saw NOT a UFO.  I saw nothing.  I was a skeptic until that morning.

I could see it plain as day in front of me It was the last day of hunting season in Mass. i was waiting on my grandmother's steps for it to lighten up a little so i could hunt. She has 110 acres in Lenox, Ma. I was just looking around when i noticed what seemed to be red flashing lights in the trees. I kept watching and it was moving upwards. This saucer came straight up. It didn't have flashing lights but stable red lights kinda spaced out around the disk. It's hard for me to tell you how big it was or how far. It was pretty big though. This is not a case of just ""seeing"" something in the sky. It was , as plain as day, right spack dab in front of me, a complete flying saucer. I didn't know what to do. I mean, i was scared but also excited a the same time. i then heard a car coming down the road. I began running towards the road. It's very hard to explain what I was thinking. I was planning on flagging down the car but decided against. A man in full camo with a gun before 6am jumping out in front of a stranger yelling ""flying saucer, flying saucer"" I would've probably run myself over and not looked back. Anyway, i stopped running towards the road and headed back to the steps. It was still there but looked like it moved a little west. It then moved down like it was going to land or something. I watched as hard as i could. It didn't land but moved low to the ground back to where i saw it first. It came up in the same spot i saw it the first time. This time while rising above the trees, it seemed to have trouble and looked like it wobbled on its way up. Then there it was again directly in front of me, clearing the trees, it just hovered therefor about 20 seconds i guess, and poof. Like a snap of your fingers it was gone. It literly left a streak of red in the sky. I know some may be reading this thinking that i'm crazy. My friends even said the same thing! But when i insisted that a bunch of us go out there and walk a straight line through the woods they knew i was DEAD serious. And we did. There was probably 15 of us and found nothing at all. I was hoping for burned grass or something. I mean it had to have been landed back there . Hell, i don't know. Listen it was the LAST day of shotgun season in Mass in 92. Wish i knew the exact day. I will find out.  I believe that someone else HAD to have seen it. They just had to!  My grandmother's property borders the Lenox sportman's club. I was hoping that when i searched ""sightings by the state"" i would see one in there around the same time on the same day. Who knows, maybe someone will contact me with the same sighting. I really hope so. You wanna know something funny? I went to the library immediately after my sighting and got a few books. Of course everybody's first question was,""what did it look like?"" In the book, UFO's and how to see them, there is the same exact saucer i saw in that book. If anyone is interested in contacting me please do. ((e-address deleted))   Thank you!!

It looked like a red spotlight, but big. I would say it was about 100 yards above the backyard. The exact size is hard to decribe due to the brightness of the light, as if looking into a spotlight. But it was bigger than, let's say, a full size van. It hovered there for a few seconds and shot straight up, faster then anything I have ever seen, a loud boom followed and it disappeared going up. It disappeared in less than a second or two. Being ex-U.S. Army, a Sgt (E-5) with the 82nd ABN, two combat tours, I know it was not a military plane or helicopter. The boom, it is my opinion was the sound barrier being broken due to the speed it went up. I have seen many weapons and planes/helicopters in action, I have seen F-15's and F-16's fly over my head low, but nothing will compare to how fast this object shot straight up, even faster than missiles being shot from a MRLS vehicle. The speed was undescribable. One curious thing is that it did not emit any sound, as in a motor running, only the boom as it went up. My next door neighbor came out to his deck and yelled at me, ""Did you shoot a shotgun?!"" I told him no, I didn't but had heard a noise, not figuring he would understand what I had just seen.

However, all of this is conjecture, since we did not witness the lights.  The dates of the sightings are approximate.  PD)) streams of light and triangular lights seen over Saskatoon, SK. NOTE - Date and time are approximate... This report is from 1994.  I was caretaking in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. My wife-to-be (at the time) and myself would often open our apartment suite window and gaze out at the sky. We had often noticed in the sky 3 red lights at various locations in the sky that always seemed to remain fixed in the sky (at about 25-30 degrees above the horizon, and certain fixed locations unknown degrees from north and south. they always seemed to be in the same place. for example one was always just a bit east of the peak of a house down the street.) even though the other stars in the sky would move.  We had jokingly called the red lights our ""friends"" and would often jokingly say, ""oh look, our friends are here"".  One night, we were standing in the window watching south. one of the red lights was there, almost due south and always at the same height in the sky... We had suggested to ourselves that the light was nothing more than the light of a plane heading either to Regina (The Capitol city of Saskatchewan) or coming in from it. But, after over 45 minutes, the light had not changed position in the sky at all, and the flight from Saskatton to Regina was only about 50 minutes. So that ruled that out... and we still couldn't figure out the peculiar red color of it.  About this time we noticed that the loight would ""jiggle"" slightly... just a short, small up and down motion. We thought to ourseleves, ok... we are imagining it and continued to watch and it would jigle again... we watched the other two red lights and noticed they were doing the same thing as well.  To make this easier to follow, I'll call the red lights ""south"" (the southernmost one we thought might possibly be an airplane), ""east"" (the red light to the east of us) and ""north"" for the one just to the north of us.  We became amazed when south jiggled yet again and then a stream of, well, for lackof a better term, northern lights style white light appeared to travel from south to east. A coupole minutes went by and a second stream went from east back to south after east jiggled.  We were amazed when we saw that... the light was in a straight line, and acted like an airplane contrail appearcing, making a longer line until it almost reached the other light and then slowly fading out after about 6-10 seconds... all to the south and east of us.  then the same thing happened with a stream of the same style light from east to north and back.  At this point, just to the south of the position of ""east"" there was a huge white flash (similar to the white flash from the fireworks that produce the huge ""bang"" minus the ""bang"")and then the same white color stream proceeded to appear from ""East"" but it created a clockwise spiral pattern that radiated out from the spot where the white flash had occured.  This continued to happen for another 20 minutes or so, with ""east"" being the center of the activity.  There were a total I recall of about 8 straight lines and 3 spirals.  After the ""show"" had finished we continued to watch ""our friends"" the red lights, and saw a small trianglar shaped light (imagine the ship from the old asteroids aracde game) leave ""north"" in a northerly direction, loop around in a counter-clockwise direction and head north again at a high speed (approximately 1 handspan / per second with the hand held outstretched above my head). My wife claimed to also see the same thing happen to ""east"" as well.  We have absolutely no idea of what it was we saw. It was one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen in my life though.  We would be willing to submit drawings of what we saw via email if requested.

I was mesmerized by the size, which I would estimate around 10 blocks wide, and 3 blocks thick.  It was low enough that I could see indentations like giant portholes all around the bottom.  It was a rusty/greenish looking metal.   There was absolutely no sound.  And no lights.

At about 3pm in the afternoon of October 6th 1996, my friend and I were laying on the track at the field on 6th Street doing situps.  My friend noticed something way, way up in the sky as if it were a star.  The sky was clear blue with just a few fluffy-like clouds scattered.  When I squinted to look at what he was looking at, I noticed a dark, greyish-metallic looking object which looked about the size that a star would look like at night.  The object was stationary, it did not move.  As I focused on the object, all of the sudden it took off toward the south at a high speed and went out of my sight.  This object went from stationary to high speed movement in no time at all.  I yelled at my friend so he could see that it had taken off, and he claimed it hadn't because he was still focused on the object.  I lay back down next to him on the track and began focusing on yet another object of the same description.  It was just there in the sky not moving.  Aparently, this second object was the one he noticed first, and when I looked, my eyes caught sight of the one that was next to it and took off.  As we stared at the object, something incredible and inexplicable happend.  The object began to wobble as we focused more on the object, we could see it was a triangular-boomerang shape.  My friend who has better vision than I said it had a orange-like glow to it as well.  As the object wobbled, amazingly, another object just like it came forth from it as if it had divided itself into two.  I know it sounds crazy or made up, but I will swear under oath and take a lie detector test or whatever is necessary, that this is what we both saw.  Now, there were two objects side by side.  The object that came out of the other one moved east slightly, so now they were aligned side by side.  I cannot recall which of the two began wobbling now, I want to say it was the original one that spit the new one out because I recall the third object being directly above the original or ""mother"" object. In any case the! object began wobbling again and yet another one seemed to appear from the other. Now there were three, one above the original one and the other still aligned alongside the original one.  At once, all three formed a triangle and stood there for a few minutes in triangular formation.  After a few minutes, the top one moved slowly along side the others so that they were now on the same level side by side.  The two in front now began to move together slowly eastward and the original or ""mother one"" stood still.  As we watched, the original one began to move as well, the two moving ahead together, in the same eastward direction.  Then they all picked up speed and disappeared East. This incident has haunted me and my friend all these years.  I was tempted many times to report this to someone, but did not know where or who.  I have seen other unexplained objects in the sky, but this was the most remarkable.

I was walking home from college by myself at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. i was heading down the road behind my house which is on a hill looking across a shallow valley. on the other side of this valley is a wooded area just off from a housing estate. in the side of this wooded area is a building called rowcroft hospice. this building is very distinctive. there's a couple of old looking buildings and a larger one with a big domed roof. you can see these buildings clearly from where i was and from almost anywhere in the valley. so i was walking down this road and i glanced up over the valley towards the woods and happened to notice something large and metal there. i looked closer and saw a saucer shaped metal object. now i am interested in ufos and was before seeing this, and in the past i've often thought what would it be like to actually see something like that. but when it came to it, it didn't seem that strange. i think it was that it was the middle of the day and in the middle of a busy town. it was very unreal, i was just like ""oh, that's unusual"". i didn't even stop walking. so i kept looking for a few seconds and saw that whatever it was it was definately in the air, i'd guess about 30-40 ft off the ground, and it was hovering above the rowcroft hospice i mentioned earlier. it was definately some kind of craft, it was just obvious, and made of a very shiny metal. it was saucer shaped but plain, no portholes or any features at all. just a plain metal saucer. so i looked for about 4-5 seconds then i looked down the road for just a few seconds, thinking ""what is that?"". then i looked back and it had vanished! no sign of it anywhere i could see. and i could see the hospice's domed roof clearly again. i really wish now i hadn't looked away so i could have seen if it just disappeared or moved off really quickly. in fact i wish now i'd just paid more attention to what i was seeing and that i'd had something to record it with. so what was it? was i really just across the valley from some genuine et's? who knows? i wish to god their was some way i could find out the truth about it. a couple of points about all this: someone i told about this said i probably mistook the domed roof of the hospice for something, but no way, the roof looks old and mossy, the thing was shiny and reflective. Second, This is all 100 percent true. i want to share an honest experience which i never recount in the real world. i've only told two friends about this and both blatantly didn't believe a word i said. it sounds too nuts! Third, isn't it wierd that i saw this over a busy town in the daytime? maybe it goes on all the time and we just don't notice because we don't walk round looking up all the time. And lastly, the thing that fascinates me most about this whole thing is the place where i saw it. For anyone who doesn't know a hospice is a place where people with fatal diseases go to spend their final months. Now what was this craft doing there in particular? I mean it was hovering right above it and it's an isolated building. so what did it want? Somebody tell me! ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2003-08-28T00:00:00,,

During intermission to a vaudeville show at Hokum Hall in West Seattle, the entire audience and some performers went outside onto the front patio and steps to enjoy the brisk still air.  After some time, everyone--all the grandmas and grandkids and moms and supportive West Seattle locals--went back in for the second half of the show...that is, everyone except me and my two freaky friends (one of whom hadn't finished his cigarette), and my performer friend, who was headlining that night.  After a few more words, my performer friend went inside and there were only the three of us remaining.   We contined to stand on the stairs, staring out into the deep western sky.  On one side of me, Mr. ((name deleted)) dreadlocked-to his-waist I-Do-Magic-with-a-K was still smoking his cigarette while people-cough-when-I-walk-in-the-room Mr. D stood on my other side.  Both D and I shaved our heads then and if you didn't know us as some of the most gentle folks around you might have been intimidated by our sense of style then, very minimalist, tough guy black leather jackets and boots.  Experienced trippers we, we were all on about 1/4 hit of acid (25mcg) each that night, not enough to hallucinate, just enough to encourage a little synchronicity...  Not even a minute had passed after my performer friend had returned to the fold, Mr. ((name deleted)) was speaking as I stared into the night sky, listening intently, while slowly, a pattern of lights in the distant west-northwestern sky 'dawned into my awareness'[ital.] exactly in the place I had been staring.  I'm sure we must have all noticed it at pretty much the same time, but I was the first one to interrupt Mikey...""wait, that's 'not normal'[ital.].""  All three of us stood there silent, mesmerized, as the lights moved in formation due eastward in the sky.  They appeared to by flying a little north of us over maybe Everett (about 30 mi. to the north), at the speed and elevation of low-flying aircraft.  What was strange was that each entity was only represented by one light, of the brightness and pale color of a star.  They varied from white into reds and oranges and blues and greens but only as much as a star would.  There were about 13-15 lights all moving precisely parallel to the ground plane in fixed formation.  There seemed to be two lights ahead of the denser cluster.  The quality of the lights themselves did not flicker or vary in constance.  I could tell that the lights did not form the edges of a single entity because you could see the stars behind and between them as they passed.  Due to the local topography of tall trees and two story houses, we had to hop down the stairs and run north to the intersection and turn right heading east to keep them in sight.  Acid is known for its ability to inspire hallucinations, but I hadn't been hallucinating at all that night, and was on such a low dose as to not expect it.  Still, I couldn't believe it and I checked in with my friends as we ran. ""Are we hallucinating?  Is this a collective hallucination between the three of us?""  They both had similar thoughts about low doses and hallucinations and it is also extremely rare to hallucinate the SAME THING as two other people simultaneously.  Still, we wanted to double check and so when we saw this black gentleman, apparently a local, on the street, we stopped and asked him, ""Do you see THAT?!""  He was staring at the lights but he said nothing, he only looked down for a moment and shook his head.  We took that as a ""yes"" and kept on running, keeping the moving light formation in sight.  Finally, as the light formation glided eastward, approaching a position northnortheast of us, it moved behind an extra tall tree on our block and we lost sight of it for a moment.  As the two leading lights emerged the trailing light formation no longer followed.  In the same way that the lights had dawned into my awareness, I watched the remaining two 'dawn out of my awareness'[ital], right before my eyes.  Wow.  We were silent.  We walked about two blocks or so back to Hokum Hall.  I always remembered the entire event taking about 30 really long seconds but there's a probability of it having been more like a minute and a half.  As we walked back up the stairs, an eerie airy haunting tonal music wafted out of Hokum Hall. We stepped into the midst of the second half of the vaudville show and sat down as unobtrusively as possible.  Mr. ((name deleted--2nd musician)) was playing his glass armonica, one of only six in current existence in the entire United States, an invention of Benjamin Franklin banned in the early 1900s on the belief that it awakened the spirits of the dead.  Crystal bowls of increasing diameter turned together on an axis as Mr. ((2nd witness)) touched his moistened fingers to the rims, playing it like a piano.  The sound was hardly like that of a piano however.  Sonorous sirens, otherworldly, perfect music to commemorate my first UFO sighting.  I felt strangely honored to have witnessed the event, one of three in a crowd of 60 who narrowly missed an opportunity to see what we had seen.  I shared this experience with a lot of people in Seattle in the days that followed; with my friends, with people in my local coffee shop, with my fellow bus riders.  Folks told me that it was on the TV and on the radio the night of the occurance.  I found the event reported on the front page of the Seattle Times and PI the following day, but after that, there was no mention of it to be found anywhere.   I was surprised by how many people, once I shared my UFO experience, in exchange told me stories of UFO sightings and alien encounters they had had at some point in their life.  Surprised especially by the ones I had known for years who had never mentioned it.  ""Some people think you're crazy,"" they'd reply, "" so I don't talk about it much.""  When I told my friend who shares my sun and moon sign (Aquarius and Virgo respectively), she said that she witnessed it also, only from a downtown location.  From her more northerly location, (for you out-of-towners reading this report, West Seattle is actually SW of downtown by about 5-8 mi.), she was able to she the shape of the formation--two ""V""s.  ""Like geese,"" she said.  This correlated precisely with what I had seen, with the two lights out ahead and a greater cluster following behind.  Just like the lights had disappeared behind a tree for me, for her they disappeared behind a skyscraper.  In the same way--two lights remaining, then winking out.  I have a B.A. in English/Professional Writing from the University of Puget Sound.  I was an honors kid growing up who won spelling bees and competed in math olympiads and writer's conferences.  I was a varsity athlete and leader of organizations both in high school and college.  I'm not trying to boast.  I'm just saying that I'm no dumb broad.  I know what aircraft, meteors, and ""Russian space debris"" all look like.  This was 'none of the above'[ital] and definitely nothing that fits within the realm of ordinary human experience or logic.  Go figure.  ;) ((NUFORC Note:  This event was widely reported on the night it occurred, and the U. S. Space Command Headquarters, based at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, CO, reported that it was ""space debris"" that flew to the west (sic) and landed in the Pacific Ocean.   What the formation of lights must have looked like to a witness experiencing the effects of 1/4 ""hit"" of LSD is beyond our ability to comprehend.
