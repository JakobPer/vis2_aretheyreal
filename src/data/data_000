We both remarked on it, me thinking it was a dimly lit satellite. That was contested by my friend by saying it was moving too fast and was too low. I quickly agreed with him. I said to keep our eyes on it to see if anything ""off"" about it happens. When it moved past our zenith, two more dim red lights presented themselves forming the shape of a perfect triangle. My perception was the the two additional lights were obscured by a solid object until our visual angle on it changed enough to reveal them. Watched it as it went out of our ability to see it any longer, about 20 seconds or so. The lights could have been part of one object or possibly 3 separate objects, most likely the former though. Light pollution in our area is horrible. It was about 2k (best guesstimate) in altitude, maybe a bit lower. Speed was faster than commercial craft flying at the same time but not remarkably so. Never acted non-ballistic, was very steady in its course, no deviations. I work at TYS at night and see aircraft all night long and this wasn't one. No strobes or navigation lights. No sound, coasting across the sky like it was on a rail. Could not see a solid shape but could infer one by how the lights revealed themselves to us. Skies were clear, temps cool and no surface wind.

I started at it the whole time it, trying to detect and determine the nature of what I was viewing. It looked similar to a headlamp on a train and too bright to be a planet. I checked and there are no planets anywhere near this part of the sky at this time. It did not appear to move in any direction and the shape and intensity of light suggested some sort of in-place motion such as spinning or oscillating. After about 30 seconds or so it vanished. Morning sky was lightly cloudy and the light appeared to somehow be punching through the clouds. The sky lighting and color was in very high contrast to the object viewed. The spot was way too bright to be a planet, but the distance and size light intensity was wrong for it to be any kind of naturally occurring reflection of the sun. Since the sightline is in the general direction of the US White House, I was curious and used a compass to get the direction of the sighting and plotted a rough trajectory to see where the vector would fall on Google Maps. My best guess about where I think the object may have been hovering based on what I saw, is indicated by the bold red arrow on the UAP_map_vector_2021-12-07_8-22-06.png image uploaded.

My oldest child (12 yr old) was awake and recalls the event as well. With peripheral vision, I noticed a bright blue light traveling above the tree line, about a mile away, at the exact speed we were traveling (65 mph).  This took place over about 30 - 40 seconds, until I recall turning my head to get a better look (by now I had ruled out almost everything else that could be doing this).  I can remember gazing at the light briefly (it was definitely above the tree line, and there was sky noted between it and the earth, with nothing holding it up) before EVERYTHING 'electrical' in my car shut off briefly before returning to function as though it never happened. I'm talking headlights, every dash light,stereo, cell phones, hand held video games, MP3 player...everything. I don't recall the engine ever sputtering. Afterwards, I noticed that the light was no longer following us. I was so calm, almost as though it were no big deal; I'm the type of person whose heart usually stops beating at any driving 'close call'. Talking with my son later, he said it was almost dream like in recollection (he normally has impeccable recall). I also recall getting to our destination later than expected and wondering why. (This doesn't need to be included with the report, but it is interesting) Almost 10 years later, an MRI of my brain showed a perfectly square abnormality that only appeared in one imaging slice, which means that it was extremely thin.

Suddenly the light shot up to high altitude instantaneously, then came directly at them. Passed at a slight tangent to them but was clearly visible. A perfect saucer shape, with bubble center surrounded by a white gas that gave it a haloed effect. 400-500 ft up, 1/4 mile distant.Filled a 3X9 scope.  the entire event lasted from 10-15 minutes. These two brothers have hunted the entire area and are familiar with it all.Sitting in their truck above the McLaughlin Gold Mine, where one was employed, they could observe the entire skyline for many miles from the ridgetop.The glow from the lights at the mine was visible below them.  In the distance they both noticed a bright white light.They both thought it was the light from a helicopter coming to the mine as happened occasionally.They watched it for approximately ten minutes when suddenly it literally 'jumped' up to a much higher altitude and then proceeded to come directly at them.This was their first sighting and they both describe the event as extremely frightening!They thought the object was coming for at them specifically and they were in a panic.It came at them and veered to a slight tangent from a northwesterly direction.As it got closer they could clearly see the object as it passed within 1/4 mile at an altitude of 400-500 feet.It was a perfect saucer shape with a bubble in the middle and what appeared to be windows in the bubble.The light turned out to be a white gaseous appearing cloud that surrounded the entire craft but did not obscure it in any way.It filled the entire viewfield of a 3X9 variable scope.  The gas formed a halo appearance and no other lights were visible.But it was bright enough from a long distance to be clearly visible beyond the mine lights glow.It flew to the south west passing over Mt St Helena and then turned directly west toward the ocean.Note:  Almost a year later these two men witnessed another sighting of a completely different craft at another location in Lake County.This sighting lasted almost 5 hours.Additionally only a few months ago,(fall 96), they witnessed a strange phenomena on the ground near the location of the first sighting.Described as a 'puddle of soft black metallic shavings, maggot-like but not easily described- moving as if a magnet were being passed over themand seeming to grow before their eyes as if feeding on the landscape.They report it looked like something out of a science fiction movie!It was late morning.  One of the brothers walked right up to it.  It was a drizzly day.The object appeared at first to be shiny black water. As the younger brother,(30's) approached it, the older one had a bad feeling.He told his brother not to get near it and as it seemed to be growing they ran to their truck and left.Another trip to the area will be made soon.Since this materials was in an open area near a ridgetop, we hypothesize it to be some sort of spill,byproduct or waste material from an unknown vehicle or craft. Perhaps fuel related.They kept these sightings to themselves out of concern fror what others might think until I told them about this internet site and they agreed to be interviewed.I will further describe the next sighting in another report and this and the ohter will be labeled the ""Dunn"" Sightings.",1998-03-07T00:00:00,38.8898,-122.5532

City, there at least two military basesrelatively close by.  There was 5 0r 6 of us sittingclose to the waterline at Beach Haven Terrace beach.  As this is a summer recreation areaand I was 19 years old at the time we were partying at the time of the sighting.  At thetime of the viewing I was not out of control perhaps slightly high but nowhere near to the point of halucinating (sorry about the spelling).  I was facing the Ocean and I was just taking in the veiw, for example I noticed some boats and ships out for an evening cruise and that the Moon illuminated the sky enoughto see the eastern horizen very clearly. At thispoint out of my left eye I saw a very bright light parallel with the horizen, using my thumb at arms length I would estimate it at 1 or 2 degrees above the clearly seen horizen. Afterabout a second or two I shouted out to the othersto look over there. All but one of us saw it(the guy with his back to the sea was'nt quickenough). by the time everyone looked it startedto do a 90 degree turn over the horizen and it did not appear to slow down, the fireball'slight faded over the horizen within a secondor two.  And thinking back on the moment (later on that night whenI was tring to get to sleep) I believe I saw the siloutte of a cigar shape craft in frontos the fireball. This I can not be absolutly sure since my eyes did not have enough time to focus in on any details of what ever it was.I am also aware of the fact that it seemed to be reacting to my excitementfor the 90 deg. turn accured directly striaghtout from our position, a coincidence maybe, butI wonder.  I hope you can coralate this report with someoneelse who witnessed this event,I sure some of thefolkes on board some of those ships got an evenbetter look at it since they were much closer.I'm just guessing but I believe it traveled atleast 2 or so in the time it was flying strightThe fireball did not get much bigger whenit was straight out from our position on the beachwhich is as close to sea level as one can get.With the help of a math oriented person you could get a rough ideaof how far it traveled and approx. speed.By the way I realize that CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OFTHE THIRD KIND had just come out in 77 and I really did want to see a UFO but at that timein my life I just had a passing interest inthe subject.

It was flying from N to S (I have confirmed this now based on the map view from where I had been standing) that would travel some distance across the apex of the sky before instantly changing direction 180 degrees, apparently without stopping, to move from S to N linearly back across its original path. I remember thinking that it seemed strange, as planes do not move back and forth. Another person who was older, maybe an older teen, noticed it too and asked me how long the “airplane” had been moving in that way.  I told him I had only just started paying attention, but I didn’t think it seemed like a regular plane.  He said it probably wasn’t a helicopter either as there was not any sound either.  We both watched it move back and forth like that several times before it just blinked out and never reappeared.  I do not remember which direction it had been moving in when the light went out.  Also, since I was so young, I don’t have a good estimate of the altitude or speed it was moving, just that it generally had the appearance of a plane flying overhead, but moved strangely and was slightly brighter.  The sky was clear that night and there were no artificial lights around other than the fire, which was behind me.

IN MY BACK YARD. I never believed in UFOs until I saw one with my own eyes. Im coming out now because the UFO phenomenon is more plausible or accepted now, then it was back in the 90s. I was only a high school kid at the time and certain that any account I might have shared with anyone, would have been dismissed entirely. I feared judgement and ridicule therefore chose to avoid embarrassment and remain quiet instead. I spent years trying to forget about the event, and brush it off to possible exhaustion?  My home was in a convenient location for a landing, if there was one. I can NOT speculate this. My home sat on a common neighborhood street, but at the back side of the developed plot. Most homes had an alley, mine did not because there was a rutted out, grassed and brushed over, and mowed once a year.  What's more interesting about this area of land is that it nestles behind a long standing Ford dealership. Before Ford, the lot was a Drive-in Theater attraction. Leaving some speculation as to why any E.T. might have seen this as a past source of observation, likely to return for more data from the outdoor films being played. Another strange detail about the field is that one circle patch of trees always remained at center of this 10acre field. The maintenance mowed everything around it. In the center of the patch of trees, if an old house. Now in ruins and graffiti.  I was between the age of 16 and 18 at the time. This would roughly set our timeline between 1999 and 2001. Today, I simply can't remember if I was returning home from my restaurant job, if I had a job at all at that time... or commonly returning home from hanging out with local friends. I can NOT remember which. However, I was sober this night... leading me to believe that I was at work. Being sober then, is why I decided it's okay to make this report now.  I remember clearly it was summer, but not sure which month. It was somewhere between 9:30 and 10:30pm, approximately. Neither my brother, mother or step-father were home, the place was very quiet and dark.  Our home had a split/ half finished basement. This was where my younger brother and myself commonly separated from the parents. As usual, I would head down the stairs and turn on the lights, then the TV. On the far rear wall, adjacent the couch is a sliding glass door to the rear patio. Two long curtain panels cover the view from the inside.  Out of the corner of my eye, I see my cat looking at something from behind the curtain panel. I call to her, but she pays no attention to my calls. The movement of the curtain allowed me to visualize a glow from the back yard, yet... I don't remember ever turning that light on. Thinking I may have flipped a switch on accident, I go check the switch...and the ACTUAL light comes on. Creeped out and confused, I go to investigate the yard from the glass. When I peek from a sliver of opening... that's when I saw it, and I froze for several seconds, in shock.  I was in a wave of emotions all at once, because what I saw... was sci-fi. My yard only extends 20yards to the back of the property, where the empty field sits. Hovered at the property line, about 40ft off of the ground was the vessel. It was close enough to not be mistaken for anything OTHER than a UFO.  What I remember about it, was it's silence. It didn't make any sound except for a low level hum. It had the basic saucer shape commonly related to UFOs. It was silver/ metallic in color. On the wide brim, several lights were visible, of several various colors. If I would guess the color of the markers, I'd say orange, red, blue and yellow. They slowly and dimmly illuminated to no particular pattern that I could tell. I can't recall if they flashed, but there was definitely a fading pulse of brightness to the beat of the internal hum. It moved gracefully.  After the realization that I wasn't dreaming sat in, seconds later, I panicked and scurried to turn off all lights in fear that I might have been spotted witnessing them.  My cat remained fixed, so I felt a little silly from hunkering in a dark corner of the room. I gather my courage and zip back to the glass. This time, I slide the door open as the craft slowly hovers up and over the largest tree at the back of the yard, at the division fence of the next door neighbors yard. This was how I could determine the level of sound it emitted.  At this point, I realize that it's leaving and my fear quickly subsides. I must have blown it's cover. I'm not sure why this thing wasn't more stealthy than it apparently was.  Curiosity follows as I slowly slip onto the patio to catch one last gaze of what I expect to be a ""one time only"" experience. I keep the lights off to be incognito. I watched the UFO slowly ascend across the neighbors back yard, up above the house and very quickly out of view once it crossed over the roof and eastbound toward the mountain range. This maneuver is how I was able to determine that the vessel itself was similar in size to their house.  That was the only time that I've had an experience. There's no shame to explain this today. It shouldn't be a stigmatized taboo subject and should always be investigated ...openly.  However... Its fair to add, that I'm genetically hypersensitive, hyperactive and hyper-autoimmune. This invokes a high level of intelligence and a special ability to possess a ""sixth sense"" persay. Particularly to electrical waves and signals... including emotions.  A few examples: knowing your phone is about to ring, seconds before it rings. Computing math in unorthodox ways. Not understanding how you know certain things or able to make accurate predictions.  Currently, I often try to rationalize the UFO event by relating myself to it. Why MY house? Why ME? Well...there's a lot to unpack there. It extends through my ancestry of the lost ancient Pict tribes. Or maybe... Im not related to this at all.  Perhaps, the old drive-in was always a destination for these off-world visitors... or even earthly spies. Who's to say? Back then, now shuttered...our Dupont plant was a point of industrial complex and something of an ecological concern. Maybe it was just a random drop-in altogether? I just can't be certain to speculate.  Although, I've never reported this until now... I've always talked to close friends about the experience. Those who know me best, not to make such a thing up. The story hasn't changed one bit, as the memory of that faint yellow-green glow will always remain crystal clear.  I believe.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,38.1103,-78.9073

Disclaimer: the incident date is accurate plus/minus 3 months as I can only remember it was my senior year of High School. I was visiting my uncle who lived in a very remote area of Mississippi (Henleyfield). I walked outside to grab something from my car that I had left and as I looked up at the very clear and open sky, I saw a UFO. It was out in the country and it was a VERY clear type of night...no clouds or fog or haze out in these parts normally and that night especially not. Initially, my brain rationalized it as a helicopter bc it was moving. It felt like the distance was about 1/4 mile away maybe. It had lights around the edges, I believe red/white. It wasn't moving so I just continued to stare at it without looking away for at least 5 minutes. I felt mesmerized as I came slowly to the realization that it might not be a helicopter. I was stunned, so much that I didn't even think to go and get my uncle or friends from inside the house...I couldn't look away from it. I didn't feel negative energy or anything. I knew it was a UFO bc when it left finally. It just zoomed off like a shooting type speed. It hovered for 5+ minutes in clear sight and then I clearly saw it go from zero to outrageous speed -- and it was gone. I was in a sort of daze for several hours after, I guess it was just a surreal experience.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,,

My dad had a big flash light that was really bright.  One night I was outside shining the light into the sky.  Just playing.  A solid, unblinking light started going over me.   would pass over..  then come back again.   time it would get lower and lower.  As it got lower, I noticed that there were 3 bold lights under this flying craft.  The lights were in a triangle formation.  They did not blink.  The object had no sound.  No wind.  No vibration.  When it got very low, I got little scared and went inside my house. I was spooked but interested.  I started including my friends and favorite cousin in this flash light activity. Everytime I ""called"" this flyinb object with the flash light.. it would come. My friends loved it. And so did I. We thought it was an alien.. we named it Monikiwoo. Please don't stop reading because of that. I'm not joking, I assure you. We were children, so of course we gave it a silly name.  As the summer went on, the object began showing up even when I didn't call it with the flashlight. One night in particular was terrifying. My cousin and I were swimming in my backyard after dark. Suddenly I heard my dogs barking, and seen them darting around the yard. A few moments later the familiar 3 lights came over the trees and to the pool. We hid under the biggest float. I will never, never forget seeing a bright light... light up the bottom of the pool. So bright that I could see the details on the liner of our pool. I do remember we heard something scuffling around the pool. But maybe it was the dogs.  Once the light left we bolted in the house. This is when I knew this thing was targeting my home and coming uninvited. My mother was very frightened and told me not to use the flash light anymore. Or go outside at night.  Fall came and I didn't see it anymore. But that following summer it was back.  Summer 1996. I was 12 almost 13. I was having a little slumber party with the same cousin and my best friend. The 3 of us liked to sit in the road late at night and talk. It's a small neighborhood with little traffic so that's why we could do that.  Anyways, we were talking. I looked up to see the 3 bold lights cruising between my house and our neighbors. Coming right over the houses, directly to us. It was lower than I'd ever seen before. Honestly, I'd say it was only a couple feet above the telephone wires. And again there was no wind, no sound and no vibration. It flew smooth. That's best way to describe  it.  Size of the craft? Seeming as it was night time and I could only see its lights.. I can only give you a rough estimate. I'd say it was approximately 25 to 40 feet wide. The triangle of lights was probably about 10 feet wide.  Perhaps I can explain better if I can speak with someone on the phone.  Once the craft was over us, I did see 2 skinny and long lights flash different colors.. right before the 3 big lights suddenly burst light down on us.  Us girls all screamed and ran inside. We told my mom what happened. She could tell we were really scared. She called the Middletown Airport. They said they sometimes got reports from Carlisle of strange flying objects. I don't know about that. I only know what we experienced.  Afterwards, I wanted to be tough and go back outside. My friend, cousin and mom stood by the front door as I made my way back into the road.  I stood in the road looking all around the sky. Couldn't see the craft. I thought it was gone. I looked to my left, down the street. Under one of the street lights there was a tall, skinny guy walking fast. I just thought it was someone walking home from somewhere. But I still ran back inside.  We all stood at the kitchen window, which directly faces our road. The tall man walked by. He was much taller than I originally thought. Very thin. Long arms and legs. Dressed in a shiny black outfit. Outfit was tight fitting.  Most alarming was how he was walking. Very jolty. Sharp movements with his arms. And he was like stomping. He seemed robotic in his movements.  Naturally we all freaked out. Something inside told us this man was not human.  Later that night: We went to bed an hour or 2 later. My cousin and friend were sleeping vertically in the bed. While I laid horizontally at the foot of the bed. I was the closet to the window.  My window was always open with a fan in it back then. We didn't have air conditioning.   At some point I woke up because of a light in my eyes. Yes, the classic tale of a light beaming through a window.  I feel stupid when I do tell someone about this part of the story because I was the only one who seen it shining into the bedroom, and because I'm afraid people will think I'm lying.  The light had a gravitational pull. I rolled out of the bed onto the floor. It was like I moved in slow motion. The light seem to be slowing things down(?) It was strong.  I was pushing off the wall for leverage and reaching for my door.  My cousin and friend did not wake up.  When I finally reached my door and got it open.. the light disappeared and it felt like someone cut off a heavy stone that I had been pulling.  I got Mom. We moved my cousin and friend into the living room. We slept out there for rest of the night.  That's it. It feels really nice to say it to an official place. I don't know what the flying craft was. Or the tall man. We still talk about it. All I know is it happened.  I will go to my deathbed wondering what that was.  Thank you so much. Amy",2020-06-25T00:00:00,,

I witnessed this event and was really close to Lake Erie at the time. 20 years old, (in the military at the time) approximately 1AM I was outside looking north toward lake Erie. Location was Oregon, OH on Corduroy Rd at my grandmother's house, next to Corduroy Carryout, just a few miles from the lake. I grew up near Lake Erie and know it very, very well. I am e-mailing a screen shot of my location, vantage point and my projection of this object across Lake Erie. I was so amazed by what I witnessed, I called Oregon,OH Police Department and Northwood,OH Police Department.  The object appeared to be very large and was moving only a couple hundred miles per hour (Meteors move much faster as you know). As it moved from west to east over the lake, it illuminated a very bright blue and had a significant tail behind it. I read the news reports that a Meteor crashed into a mobile home community in Windsor ONT. That could have been fallen debris.  https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/windsor.shtml  Those news reports NEVER made sense to me because from my vantage point, it was heading straight toward Cleveland and Pennsylvania. Listening to Director Peter Davenport’s interview on the  'X' Zone Radio Show podcast, enlightened me what happened after fireball was out of my sight near Cleveland Ohio. This UFO continued its flight and activity long after it crossed into Erie PA area. Multiple witnesses and reports from Pennsylvania.

I went over to a bush to try and see what it was. But had no idea.  We were a little freaked out so we got in the truck and went down the road about 3 miles to another spot I new we could hunt.  We pulled off the road and behind some trees.  While we were sitting there  out of the corner of my eye I see this craft come up to a tee in the road not 50 yards away it was about 12 ft long and 3 ft wide but round.  With a big light on the front.  We were both looking at it  and you could here it ramp up in sound  and it shot down a mile long shelterbelt in just 2 seconds and the bright light on front just went out  we couldn’t see what happened to it.  At this point  I really didn’t want to hunt anymore.  But we decided to give it a try.  We went down this big gully where it was thick with trees. When we got down in the trees.  Our flashlights went out and the Motorola’s stopped working.  All the bugs stopped making noise it was dead silence.  When all the sudden the fields around us lit up bright as football fields at night games.  We jumped into the bushes to hide. I was on high alert  waiting for something to happen  had my bow ready to go.  And 30 seconds later the lights slowly faded out and our flashlights and Motorola’s came back on  scared the hell out of us.  But here is the wired part.  The next thing I know I’m walking around the back of my truck and my friend is already sitting in the passenger seat looking confused  I have no memory of the time in between our flashlights coming on and being at the truck again I don’t remember the quarter mile walk out of there.

An old Fighter pilot’s late report..  ((name/rank deleted))l. USAF (Ret)    5/29/2020  When the Korean war began in June 1950 I was about to enter my 3rd year of college at the University of New Hampshire..  But the local draft board’s decision to call me up led to my having to enlist in the USAF in December 1950 while completing my application for pilot training..  I was sent to Lackland AFB in San Antonio, TX for basic training and the completion of my application for the Aviation Cadet program.  Having been accepted, I was them sent to James Connally AFB in Waco, Tx to work on their T-6 trainers pending selection for flying school class. I was selected in November 1951 for pilot training in class, 52-H and was sent to Hondo, TX, to begin the Cadet program, which I completed and was then transferred to Williams AFB in Phoenix, AZ to complete my Aviation Cadet program and get my wings. .T-6’s and F-80 jets were used at Williams to train pilots. While we were scheduled to complete training in December 1952 in Class 52-H, I was delayed in my training by contracting a local ailment known as “Valley Fever”- a lung infection which put me in the hospital to recover for 10 days—thereby forcing me to be moved back to the next  flying class, 53-A as I had fallen behind on school work and flying. This class then graduated from Williams AFB in February 1953. The event which I am about to relate occurred during one of my last flying missions in either December 1952 or January 1953 and involved a night instrument flight check on a cross-country from Williams Field to Hill AFB,  Utah, then to Nellis AFB Nevada and return to Williams AFB at night.  I was assigned an instructor pilot to conduct the check ride – but he was someone that I was not acquainted with. The instrument Check ride necessitated the use of a coated canvass hood to cloak off  the rear cockpit that could be slid into place such that it blocked any reference to outside the cockpit or horizon, simulating flying in solid weather conditions.  It is effective.  Just after takeoff from Hill AFB, I went under the hood and began flying the two place T-33 up to altitude and down the airway to Las Vegas.  This was not a difficult process and the red lights of the instrument panel were the only lights in use, as other lights are damaging to night vision. As we proceeded down the airway at 30,000 ft passing by Wendover and Dugway Utah proving ground/sites, my cockpit began to brighten up as if my internal lights had been turned on. I asked the check pilot if he was turning up my white lights and he said, “No, Come out from under the hood and look up to the right.” I slid the hood forward and what I saw passing by was the reason that my cockpit had begun to brighten up—a massive, glowing airship shaped like a reddish fat cigar was passing by us about 2000 feet above and  a mile or so distant. It had five distinct rows of what seemed like portholes or reddish colored windows while the rear appeared to be a bit diffused.  Its glowing appearance brightened up the area around it and the light had penetrated the hood under which I had been flying.  I estimate that it was a large as several battleships. We both were in such shock at seeing this huge ship that we did not speak to each other for some few minutes and watched as the ship made a right turn and remained off as a distant light—which we then flew past.  The IP made a call ahead to Nellis AFB to alert them as to what we had just experienced –we were advised to call the local intelligence office upon landing.. We did so and spent an hour with them at Nellis  AFB answering questions. We refueled and continued on home to Williams AFB, AZ.  This was one of my final flights as an Aviation Cadet as we were all shortly commissioned and got our wings. Most of us proceeded on further to gunnery training at Nellis AF and  continued flying both the old F-80 and then the F86 enroute to Korea.  But several days before we were to depart Nellis, our assignments were cancelled and a number of us were sent to form a new squadron at Hamilton AFB, CA. I stayed there for less than one year and was then sent to the 18th Fighter wing in K-55, Osan,  Korea. The incident with the huge UFO was forgotten and almost never came to mind until years later when my old class, 52-H had their 50th reunion at an old downtown hotel in San Diego, CA. While there, I mentioned the incident to a classmate, ((insructor pilot's name deleted)) but I could not recall who was  the Instructor pilot who conducted the check flight had been…But in describing him to Michael, as a black who was very light skinned and a trimmed  mustache, Michael said that that was his old flight instructor, ((name deleted)).. He was then living in Walnut Creek CA. just above Oakland. He later sent me ((instructor pilot's name deleted)) telephone number and I called him a week or so later. His wife answered the phone and said that ((instructor's name deleted)) was not there at the time, but then asked, what was it that I wanted to discuss? I told her about the night instrument flight check so many years ago and she said she would pass this along to her husband.  And to call back later.

His first comment was, “Don’t you remember that we signed some papers to never talk about what we had seen”? I said no, that I could not recall signing anything but also noted that I had said very little about that incident over the years. Then ((instructor pilot's name deleted)) said, “Then you don’t know all of the story.  After we got back to Williams field, the next morning the staff duty officer called me at home and told me that the Wing Director of Operations wanted to see me asap in his office.” “I went there and saw that two men in black suits and hats were sitting there with the D.O. . They  moved me into another room and for the next three hours, grilled me as if I was a criminal, insisting that we has not seen any such thing, and that we were not to ever mention it.” ((instructor pilot's name deleted)) then spoke about his subsequent experiences with these two men. He said that one of them would appear suddenly, as if checking up on him over the years as a warning it appeared.  When ((instructor pilot's name deleted)) was assigned to fly with the Air America crowd during the Vietnam war, into Laos, etc., on one mission he needed a Flight engineer, and when he showed up, it was one of the two black suited men from long before…((instructor pilot's name deleted)) refused to let him fly with them. Of interest also, is a TV program which was run by the late ABC Television newscaster, Peter Jennings. Several years before he passed away, Jennings had a 2+ hour TV show about UFO’s which included a number of former military pilots, airline pilots and others who had experienced similar incidents with UFO’s… While watching the show, one airline pilot was describing his sighting of a “cigar-shaped” ship. He went to a blackboard and drew the exact shape of the ship with we had witnessed so many years earlier, including the lighted windows and diffused rear, and the glowing brightness of its hull.. Confirmation of our sighting as well.. Of interest also, is another event over which I have no knowledge or recall.. About 10 years ago, I suffered from a bit of vertigo and my Dr. suggested getting a CT Scan of my head… When this was done, the technican came out to tell me that I had a bb sized something at the top of my head…She gave me the disc which I put into my computer and there it was—a bright white object that I do not know what it was or how It got there…Later, I discovered another hard round object under the skin of my right wrist… And as regards other flying missions, I know that some have been monitored by Divine eyes, as how I managed to avoid termination, had to come via Divine intervention.",,40.323600000000006,-112.7975

Sometime in spring/summer 1966 he was an MP at Loring AFB.  He was on patrol with another MP and they were at the top of a hill when 3 orange glowing spheres he estimated about 50 feet wide and same in height passed over the base in formation about 30 mph.  They followed the spheres until they passed out of view from their jeep.  Later that day he was friends with a fighter pilot on the base.  The fighter confided that fighters had been scrambled armed with missiles to chase the objects.  The pilots tracked the spheres into Greenland where they then shot up at unimaginable speed at a sharp 90 degree angle and out of view in the blink of an eye.  The pilot told my friend who was 18 at the time that the pilots were briefed not to mention anything and forced to sign secrecy agreements.  I am leaving his name in the contact section.  No sounds or exhaust were observed from the spheres and ! no aggressive actions.,,,

The total distance, hard to estimate, could have been that same span from city to city.  I looked back forward and began counting, as I hit around 36 I looked back to the origin amazed at how many I was counting.  The origin seemed to give the illusion of balls (lights) coming from the end of a tube that was not visible.  It could also be an effect caused by the proximity to the moon.

I turned 21 years old on August 3rd of that year, which was a Saturday.  The next Friday, August 9th, a friend wanted to take me out to a local pub for my first “legal” beer.  He came over to my duplex near the University to pick me up about 8:30 that evening.  It was almost dark when we left my house to walk to his car, which was parked on the street and facing South.  There were low, thin scattered clouds that evening.  So low that they were illuminated by the ambient light of the street lights, neon signage and automobile lights of the area.  As we walked  Eastward down my walkway to the street, I saw a red light streaking from the Southwest, skimming the clouds and illuminating them from above, turning them pinkish.  What really caught our attention was the speed of the object and the fact that there was no sound associated with it.  It simply stopped like it had run into a brick wall when it was due East of us.  Still no sound of any sort.  It started “pulsing”, then made a small circle.  When it was moving it didn't pulse.  It stopped and started pulsing again, then made a another small circular maneuver.  We watched it repeat this for several minutes, and were joined on the sidewalk by three US Navy personnel who were stained at the Naval Air Station at Millington, TN, who watched dumbfounded.  As we all stood there, it started pulsing faster and faster until it was a constant red, then it shot away like it was fired from a cannon.  It was literally gone from view in a second, and seemed to be receding, as if it was moving away from us at an angle.  What size it was is difficult to say because there was no point of reference or scale.  It's apparent size was like a piece of bird-shot held at arm's length.  Just a glowing red sphere with no discernible features, and never made a sound.

I was ten years of age in a rural area in the town of Bennington in the state of Vermont.  My parents were in a shoe store shopping.  A young girl, about my same age, joined me in walking about two blocks into a grassy field. She was a fiend of the family.  We were talking between each other when we both simultaneously turned to our left and noticed a metallic disc shaped object hovering motionless in the distance about ten feet off of the ground.  There was no mistaking what it was, and we both knew that it was an Unidentified Flying Object.  There was no misinterpretation of the event.  I immediately became enthusiastic, and so did this other witness.  I instructed her to go to the shoe store and alert the people inside to come out and see this.  After she had left the area, I was completely alone with the alien craft.  I watched it as it proceeded slowly towards me, and stopped to hover motionless about forty feet away and about ten feet off of the ground.  I was alone with this alien craft for about one full minute during this time.  There was no physiological or psychological sensation during this time: I did not realize until later on in my life that a telepathic exchange was occurring with the alien beings that were aboard the Unidentified Flying Object.  This will be described in greater detail later.  I never saw one of the alien beings, and nor was there missing time or the possibility of abduction.  The timeframe of the conscious comprehension of the event was consistent to this day.  After that one minute alone with that alien craft, it exited into the sky in non-ballistic motion faster than the eye could follow and was gone.  I returned to the shoe store before anyone else had been able to come outside to witness it.  This was an event that changed my life for the rest of my life. For over forty nine years now I have been awaiting an understanding of the purpose for th! at encounter.  I had genius quotient at such a young age, and these beings took exception to me to accomplis h an objective that was known only to them that fulfilled a purpose of benefit for society. These alien beings are a highly advanced and complex intelligence from other planets that are capable of the psychic exchange of thought processes between them, and are also capable of helping people to become aware of how to understand how this process works for themselves.  The complexity of this interaction exceeds our comprehension.  Psychic channeling of this authority through a discourse is different from telepathic thought implantation:  The wonder that surrounds genuine psychic phenomenon has intrigued some of the most well regarded minds in the country, both theological and scientific.  I did not even realize it as I was growing older, as it just seemed to me to be natural, but these same alien beings were guiding me at first to become psychic, and then to differentiate myself from this process which permitted the conscious ability to watch th! is unfold.  At first I could consciously watch this process, and then over the years I learned to trust an increasing level of a complexity that exceeded me, but without the fear of being overwhelmed by what was happening to me and other people. I could analyze the end result, and my uncertainty of a trust, which was a guidance to understand the fear of other people, began to decrease over time. This is what the purpose of that telepathic thought implantation at the age of ten in that encounter was for:  Those alien beings, and others like them, were preparing people that were ready and receptive to be able to trust the benevolence of these beings that had become constrained by the requirements of military security that surrounds the alien phenomenon.  It required a great deal of time and deliberation to correlate how my personal experience with this phenomenon became a means to help other people, whether conscious of their experience with alien beings or not, to incorporate into their lives a decrease of the fear of the unknown that the! se highly evolved life forms represent. It is a great enigma that humanity is confronted with:  How little that we know about these alien beings so as to not overwhelm people with the fear of the unknown has culminated in not being able to extend that trust in a more complex and evolved intelligence that is benevolent.  Theological interpretation will not be enough.  There is an immense void of a need in the human condition for a sustainable future in the face of great adversity that seems to destroy the planet faster than it can be saved.  These alien beings can provide that structure in the collective of human consciousness as to how to achieve that future that humanity has been unable to do for itself.  Life evolves other intelligent life in the universe, and the vast majority of people are receptive to this change.  There should be no fear of an alien mind control: In an analogy, the complexity of subliminal programming by these alien beings exceeds human comprehension despite all of ! the modern scientific advances in computerization and technology.  The factor of life force, as a creation of God, exceeds any barrier by the physical reality.  Miracles are commonplace in the universe.  Life is a miracle, and these alien beings can manifest these miracles in their domain once humanity can extend that trust in a more highly evolved and complex intelligence than the human race can comprehend until that trust is extended.  It is an infinite and timeless universe out there, with an infinite living force of all creation.  These alien beings await humanity to become a part of what the universe has to offer.  Humanity will evolve, as it is all a matter now for people to accept the common humility before God with these alien beings that will help to guide us into that synchronicity.

My twin sister(fraternal) and I were maybe 12 or 13 y.o. but no older than 14.  We didn't feel like putting the clean sheets on our beds one day, so with our parents' permission we decided to sleep out on the hide-a-bed in the living room.  We thought it would be great fun.  There were folding doors that closed off the living room from the dining room and family room.  At that time, there was no carpet in those areas. I woke up because my sister was shaking, scared to death.  She told me that she had been dreaming a 'flying saucer' was chasing us around the house.  We would run from room to room and it followed us.  We looked out the family room sliding door and there it was.   When we ran to the living room it circled around to that side of the house.  She woke up from the dream and told me that something big had hit the garage door so hard the screen! door by us had rattled.  I hadn't heard a thing, so was trying to calm her down and tell her it was just part of the dream.  What happened next is something that my sister still doesn't like to talk about,  Something started running around on the other side of the folding doors; or at least, that's what it sounded like to us.  Like a child wearing patent leather shoes was running around the dining and family rooms. We were petrified, could hardly breathe.  I wanted to get up and run get our parents, but I was afraid that something would grab me when I ran by the kitchen, so we just lay still and held on to one another.  I don't know how long it lasted, but Paula suddenly sat up and yelled, ""What is it?""  The noise instantly stopped.  It doesn't make sense at all, but we apparently just went back to sleep. Also, our cat never moved during the entire episode.  The next day we got up the nerve to tell our mother about it.  With hindsight, I think she was trying to make us feel better, because she brushed it off and said that we were imagining it.  When I asked her how two people can imagine the same thing at once, she had no answer.  Our older sister was at the table and then men! tioned that she had heard something during the night, but just assumed it was the ""twins"" up messing around.  Weird things just seemed to happen to us. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from same witness for Port Orchard, WA, for the date of November 01, 1967.

In the summer (I don’t remember which month) of 1974 about 20 miles or so North of the farm where I grew up in SW Ontario, my fiancé and I, along with another couple were out for a Sunday drive along a popular scenic back road, that ran along one of the county rivers. The fellas were in the front and myself and my friend were in the back.  I was talking to my friend, and past her, out her window, I saw this huge red thing in the sky, just over the tree tops. It was just sitting there like it was parked. I mumbled something like “what is that?” and my friend looked in the same direction and she mumbled pretty much the same thing.  We couldn’t take our eyes off it.  I don't know how long we looked at it, but because we were still moving down the road, after a while it became obscured by the trees along the river and we couldn’t see it anymore. My friend and I yelled “stop” and asked if we could back up? We kept backing up to where we thought we saw it, but the object was nowhere to be seen.  We thought the guys up front were seeing the same thing but it turned out they were oblivious to our conversation and didn’t see a thing.  I confirmed with my friend exactly what she saw and she saw the same thing I did.  It was big, and red and looked dirty, like rusting iron. It was not smooth, but had angles and shadows that looked like big doors.  On the side of it near the back, there was a round hole and from helping my Dad fix farm machinery, I remembered thinking that must be the exhaust, because there were black smudges running down, underneath the hole.  I guess because they didn't see it, the guys teased us relentlessly so we just shut up about it and haven't spoken since about it.  If anyone else has seen something similar, it would be good to know.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,,

A clear starry night was ascending upon 3 teenaged cousins who were just cruising around listening to tunes, in a Chevy Impala.  The sunset was behind us as we turned in an easterly direction, up the hill from Highway Y on Lochcrest Blvd., toward the house on Little Muskego Lake, located in S.E. Wisconsin.  As the driver (my cousin) crested the hill, we could see the hazy glow of Milwaukee's city lights to the north east, as well as the house lights that dotted the shoreline all around the lake. I don't recall Muskego's Dandelion Park ferris wheel being illuminated, which again makes me guess this may have been later in the year, when the park was closed for the winter.  The driver (my cousin) stopped the vehicle abruptly, pointed to the the sky above the lake and yelled ""WTF is that?!!!""  The three of us saw an intense bright white orbital light (close to blinding intensity), hovering about 200' to 500' above the south end of the lake.  Suddenly, the orb light traveled at extreme speed to the far north end of the lake (distance is about 1 mile). Then the light maneuvered instantly up, down, back and forth across the lake, precisely halting it's movement at several different locations.  There were no trails or smoke of any kind behind it.  The orb hovered for a few seconds over the south end of the lake directly in front of us before shooting straight up into black space.  We were awe struck by what we had just seen! My cousin quickly drove down to their home on the lake. The three of us ran inside the house to tell our parents about the sighting. I'll never forget the sound of the door hitting the wall so hard as we barged in, that it made a hole in the wall. My uncle was angered by the damage we caused the wall, and refused to hear a thing about our incredible sighting. He wrote us off.....saying we were probably smoking wacky weed.  We know what we saw that night was real.  There were several documented UFO sightings in Wisconsin, the USA, and other locations on Earth during that time period.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,42.8776,-88.1338

Mid-July 1977 / 10p / clear skies I had just graduated from HS, sitting at a local, Neighborhood Park in the Northeast Heights of Albuquerque, NM.  I was contemplating my collegiate future, looking up at the clear, dark sky. I have since told this story many times since that night, and it never changes.  What I saw was both startling and intriguing.  These five lights (about the brightness of one of the brighter stars in the big dipper) appeared in the SE night sky, traveling North by Northeast.  They formed a straight line in relation to my view, but at 30 degrees from the horizon, equidistant apart, just less than the length of my thumb as I held it up to the sky.  I first saw them at about 3 o’clock to my far right.  Their speed was constant, until they all stopped at once, after traveling just over an arm’s length (elbow to fingertip) in only 3-5 seconds. I initially thought they were helicopters, but convinced myself they traveled too fast to be ‘copters. They must have stopped for 2-3 seconds, maintaining the straight line.   What happened next gave me goose bumps.  One by one, while still in that straight, diagonal line, they made crisp, sharp 90 degree turns, changing their alignment to a V-shape formation.  This occurred in about 5-7 seconds.  Once in a V-shape, they maintained stationary for another 3 seconds or so, then continued at their previous speed in the same North by Northeast direction.  I watched them for another few seconds until they were out of sight. I am now a respected engineer and still look to the sky, convinced UFO’s are real, with the only question being where are they from and who are they.  Perhaps us, from the future?  We used to ask about disclosure.  It already happened, and we never really noticed!  We’ve become pre-occupied with our own lives, and concerns about such things as COVID-19.   UFO news is no longer intriguing or curious.  Most people acknowledge their presence, but also inquire about contact.

This is my story. I was 22 years old and lived in my home town of Springfield, Illinois.  I worked in a local grocery store and had finished my 3 to 11 shift and heading home. It was a weeknight as I recall and I had nothing to do, so I decided to grab a couple of beers and go for a drive in the country. Keep in mind that at this time, I had no interest in UFO’s and rarely considered them.  If you were to have asked me about them I would have shrugged off the question and considered it strange. I don’t remember the date because this happened so long ago, but the year was 1979, late October or early November. The leaves were off the trees, it was seasonably cool and the corn stubble left after the harvest in the fields had yet to be soaked and laid down by snow. The county roads in central Illinois at this time of night were completely deserted and at the time, the area I was driving in was sparsely developed and only a few lights from windows in a few houses could be seen. It was an overcast, moonless night and it was very dark. I was heading west on a very familiar road, away from town. I saw ahead of me, maybe a mile or less, three very bright lights suspended low above the ground, in a triangular configuration, motionless. My first thought was that I was looking at a helicopter with search lights, but that idea quickly evaporated as I neared the spectacle. It was just a matter of a few seconds before I was upon them. I looked out into the adjacent field and marveled at how brightly these lights illuminated a field of corn stubble. A shimmering blue-white light that lit the ground like nothing I had ever seen. I noted these lights still above me and to the right. There was a crossroads at that spot and I turned right and stopped to get a better look.( My intense curiosity and utter amazement must have pushed away any other thoughts, fear or self preservation). As soon as I did, the lights went off. I looked up out of my windshield and I could see hovering above me a large object. It was close enough I could have hit it with a underhand toss of a rock. I noticed the object had a convex bottom and had a shimmering brushed metal appearance reflecting the light of my headlights. It had a bluish color like some metals take on when exposed to extreme heat. There were two bright red lights on the side of the craft, shaped like thin, foot long tubes laid almost end to end, but aside each other with their ends touching side to side. These lights blinked alternately in one or two second intervals. I could tell ( I think) the object was rotating in place because of the slow arch they were ma! king above my car. Again, in utter fascination, I set the brake and got out of my car and stood by the door to get a closer look. Amazingly, without a sound, the object had vanished. I looked across the darkened field and could see, barely, maybe a hundred yards away, the outline of a craft sitting above a windrow of trees.  The shape was like two dinner plates, one up, one down with a cheesecake ring between. It was barely back lit by the lights of town on the horizon behind it.  I watched as it slowly lowered itself behind the windrow and as it did, without putting of any light of its own, illuminated the ground and trees around it with a dim yellow glow, as if it were somehow irradiating the objects around it.  I then watched it take off from behind the windrow, back across the road I was just on at incredible speed, again, without a sound. I stood there for a moment, awestruck. That’s when I began to formulate what I just saw in my mind, and decided get away from there as fast as possible. I’ve only told this story to a few people, including my wife of 30 years.  I don’t believe she or any of the others I’ve told ever believed me.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,39.79513762886598,-89.66251786941581

Crop circle seen in Medina, NY.  In 1980, I was 16 years old and a resident of Iroquois Job Corps Center in Medina, NY.  I often walked along the main road that led onto the property. One mid afternoon, I saw an odd  circular pattern of intertwined wheat just off the right side of the road.  I now know that it was a crop circle, probably made/left behind by a small UFO.  The circle wasn’t very big, maybe about 7 feet in diameter. It was awesome.  The green stalks had a glossy appearance because they were so evenly flat.  And the joints were bent (nodes?).²  I could not imagine what type of machinery created that pattern, and its presence did scare me a little, because I had never seen anything like it before that day (nor since it).  Special Note: One late night some weeks later, me and three other residents left the property (went AWOL) and walked very far to a bar in a neighboring town. Along the way, the roads became completely dark. We made it to the bar, and the trip seemed mostly uneventful. Soon after, IJCC staff came and got us and drove us back to the center.  During the ride back, one male friend said it took us longer to get to the bar than it should have (He'd made the trip before).  Around that time at the center, I began having UFO dreams and one was of a UFO invasion.  Fast forward year 1990 or so, I had the exact same 1980 UFO invasion dream.  Then, around year 2000 I began having a vague memory of one moment of that 1980 night. In that memory the four of us are standing on a stretch of road in pitch dark except for a single, small, dark, circular UFO. The craft was on or hovered close to the ground just off the road to my right. The lights of the craft lit the immediate area. My friends stood a few feet across from me. That is all I remember.

On Saturday night at about 8PM, George and I were collecting firewood.  My Cousin said….”Look, what is that?”  I looked, on the horizon there was a saucer shaped object.  I would guess it was about 3 miles away, and about 300 yards across. The first words out of my mouth were…”I know what it is, and I’m getting out of here.”  We stayed though.  We watched it for about an hour.  It had a rather soft light to it, almost pastel, and the size and shape seemed to subtly change from minute to minute.  It would slide back and forth across the horizon.  It directed beams of light at the ground as though it was probing (there are Uranium Mines out there).  It also was directing beams of light up in to space, as though it was communicating with a Mothership.  It had small spheres, red and white which it was also directing out on the horizon, which looked like probes to me.  The ground lit up near us, and then the light went out.  Then, two spheres about 3 feet across were floating across the Mesa, between the Pinyon Pines towards us.  I was terrified.  I though Life as I knew it was going to end.  Then, the lights just went out.  After about an hour, the main Saucer object became dormant, so we returned to the campground where my 2 Friends were.  My two Friends saw it when we returned to the campground and pointed it out to them.  The first thing they did was retreat to the Café there on Second Mesa.  We went to sleep, and in the morning, that distant object did not present itself anymore.  A Hopi Indian at the Café told my 2 Friends it was just a town in the distance.  I think they may have misidentified what we were watching.  My Cousin and I spent a long time watching this thing.  My Friends were scared and so they did not spend any time studying it, just a minute.   George died about a year ago.  I would like to point out that this incident occurred at the same time as the Rendlesham Forest incident in Great Britain.

There was a few houses along the road but mainly just fields where sheep, horses and cows grazed. This was our usual route home and there was rarely anything to see. In the distance we witnessed what appeared to be fireworks so as we got closer my father pulled over and stopped the car. Approximately 100 yards away we noticed that it wasn't fireworks as there was no one to ignite them and they larger perfectly rounded balls of a fiery orange color. They were the size of the inflatable ""fit balls"" used in gyms. These balls of orange seemed to be playing in the long dry grass. Some rose above the ground slowly and then seemed to hover 10ft in the air while others moved in rapidly in all directions. There was approximately 30 but may have been more and they all moved independently . We ! sat in the car puzzled as to what we were seeing. We watched for a few minutes as these balls of light moved everywhere and with more acceleration and at a speed I've never seen before or since. They moved up and down  and left and right,some hovering together while others moved around them. There was no noise only the lights. After several minutes of watching from inside of the car we got out of the car and as we did the balls of light scattered off and disappeared over the hill into the next gully.

We were driving north around sunset between 8pm and 9pm. Im guessing the time we were not sure, the sun sets between those hours in the summer. Summer of 82. Mostly warehouses and commercial property. Clear sky, no other traffic at the time. To our immediate left, (west) was a flower nursery. My friend from the drivers side of his van, looking to the west said ""what the hell is that? He said something was rising from the field.  He pulled the van over and said it is passing over the rear of the van. I stuck my head out the passenger window, looking to my right and to the rear approximately 15ft to 20 ft back and around 25 ft in the air was an object. Approximately 8 to 10 ft in height. It was in the shape of a cone or a upside down xmas tree. At the widest part the top of the cone was around 6 to 7 ft diameter, the small end or bottom was 1 to 2 ft in diameter.  The cone was made up of round glass like spheres, a little more than the size of a basketball. There was no structure or frame holding the spheres together that we saw. 1 sphere at the bottom and multiplies as you go up the cone. Inside the spheres was it seemed to us, was a white hot fire or energy, but it was constant white, not like a flickering fire and white.  The object stayed in one position and did not move or make any noise, it was motionless. There was no smoke or hum. There are electrical and phones lines, object was about 15 ft away from the lines. There was no breeze. It was also not far from a street light so we saw it very clearly. There was no reaction from the electrical lines or street light.  After a short time it changed shape to a V. We did not see a transformation, or noise, it was just a V. Not clear at what point this happened, either before it changed shape or after, we saw what appeared to be fire dropping from the object, not much of it but like if burning plastic fell from it, and it was more like normal fire burning. I would say less than a half of a cup of the burning liquid.  It was still motionless and It remained for less that a minute I guess, and then it was gone. It simply disappeared. There was no sound, or whoosh, or trace of light or noise. It vainshed without a trace of it ever being there.  It was there, than it was not. Same as the shape change. it was a cone, then it was a V shape.  I don’t know what the object was and we never reported it to anyone.  I am guessing  that for that object to vanish like it did would likely to me anyway, have something to do with time. If there was some kind of propulsion, we never saw or heard it, and there was no remnants, no smell.  The total time from it coming up from he field to vanishing is a little hard to determine. It seems to happen within a 2 or 3 minute span, but were just a little lost on that.  I thought we watched it a little longer. The time of it all is a little fuzzy.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,,

I live on a subdivision thruway. My son-in-law and his best friend and I had just loaded U-Haul of my daughter's stuff to go to Georgia were her family was stationed with the Army. Lambert Airport was about 8 miles away as the crow flies. At that time you could watch the planes lining up for landing in a cake pan pattern. So you could view  the planes circling St. LOUIS getting ready to land. Not any more because the trees have 40 years tree growth. Anyway, as we finished loading and drinking a beer a fleet of three groups of UFOs flew to the right of us in the Western sky about 2000 feet off the deck going hundreds of miles an hour with a black cloud behind them. They were V shaped. With two sided bright orange lights in a classic flock pattern. The cars in the street stopped on a dime and the occupants got out. The airport lit up like a Vesuvious Fountain. Our National Guard Unit filled the skies with every F 15 they had. They chased the fleet on a NNE glide path.  During those days I had a delivery route that encompassed the Airport. I used to watch the F 15 s takeoff. They used to take off Hot. They used minimum runway. Then they pulled to a 90°straight up position while doing a 360° spiral. Then they would fall on their back and seem to fall in the direction they wanted to go. Like a left turn. Then they would do a 180°to straighten out. Very impressive to see that is what those F 15 s did that night. One other aside. The best friend of my son-in-law was pretty shook up. He was Navy. He turned to me and said, I should not say this to you. I have seen a bunch of classified stuff. At sea we have shot a lot of missiles off at the Korean Peninsula and sent a lot of jets in war games. I have seen a lot. I have never seen anything like this. The next day the radio reported that a Russion sattelite flew over St. LOUIS and landed in Oklahoma.

Hello Sir,  I listen to the unexplained.com on an ad hoc basis and I've just listened to the show where you talked very eloquently about your work and the various reports you receive. Please note, this is an honest report and not one of the time wasters you sadly had to mention. Also, another show of Howard's reported phenomenon from a valley in Norway where the locals reported very bright lights, like headlights on full beam, flooding their houses. The same thing happened to a friend and I circa 1990.  As teenagers we were up all night watching TV when the same thing happened to us; incredibly bright light flooding the room which was accompanied by a loud hum.  I cant tell you how long it lasted, or what was causing it. My friend reminded me of it recently and also said 'we couldn't move' and I think he was right. We were aware it was happening but neither of us could get up to look outside.  I don't think it was fear, we weren't particularly scared, but I think he was right that we physically couldn't move.  It was a long time ago hence I don't know how long it lasted but I do remember it was like being in stasis, like time was standing still almost. I've often thought it was a Bin Lorry (Dust Cart!) but thinking back it couldn't have been; the street is a good 20 feet away and my Mum's house was surrounded by large, very thick conifer trees that would have prevented such light getting in to the room.  And the Bin Men dont tend to work in remote villages at 1am. As this matched content you have mentioned I thought it was about time I added to the database.  Thanks for your time Peter, very much appreciated. Regards",2020-06-25T00:00:00,,

My dad had gone there hunting since he was a kid and same with me.  Around October 29, 1993 (I remember it was a Friday of that year and was pretty warm out that evening so it was after opening day of duck season but before it got cold) my dad and I got to the campgrounds at 43.697031, 83.526229.   It was dark probably after 8 pm.  Just one other person was there, he was a friend of my dad’s and he was sleeping in his camper already.  The moon was mostly full, and since we are in the midle of nowhere it was like a large spotlight in the sky.  My dad and I walk to the top of the observation tower which is a wooden platform about 25 feet in the air. We look to the east and you could see a bonfire at the end of a road about a mile off. I looked to the west out towards the direction of Saginaw Bay, which is part of Lake Huron. I see what I first thought was a fire but it was in the air over the treeline which was about 1.25 miles off in a west by northwest direction.  I asked my dad what it was and he said, “Well that’s got to be a bonfire reflecting off a cloud or mist” I don’t remember any clouds in the air and certainly none that low to the ground. The shape was almost teardrop, the color was white with hints of yellow, the image flickered and the top wasn’t a straight line, so it had sort of an appearnce of a bonfire, but unlike the other fire we could see, this one was in the air, seemed quite large (this is based on the treeline near the shore and what looked like its position over it, best guess it was perhaps just offshore, any further off shore and the angle we wouldn’t allow us to see.) Also unlike the bonfire we could see, which was orange and yellow flames, this was mainly white.  I looked back at the bonfire and saw it’s size grew then shrank as whoever was there put stuff it. The floating flame stayed the same size.  My dad went to our trailer and got binoculars and came back up to the observation tower. Looking at it it just looked like a flame but couldn’t make out much detail. We watched it a few minutes when i saw it had moved every so slightly to the north. I could tell this based on the treeline which was esailly visible with the moonlight. I asked my dad if it was reflection from a fire on the beach how could it have moved and stayed same size?  He went down and woke his friend up in his camper saying “I don’t want to wake you be we got a UFO out here.” My dad’s friend came up to the tower and we watched it a few more minutes when in a blink of an eye there was a second flame light next to it, this one was much smaller, perhaps it couldve been same size but further out over the water. We talked how none of us saw it.  My dad speculated it could be helicopters looking for a lost boater (there is a Coast Guard station at Bay City). But there were no searchlights, there were no red and green navigation lights, and they didnt move like they were searching. There was no sound of engines we could hear. The lights looked to shimmer and nothing like a steady manmade light.  After perhaps 10-15 minutes since we saw the first light, the two started to move along the shore to the north then went straight out over the water of Saginaw Bay, as they went away from us their speed increased dramatically and were out of sight in about five seconds.  I spent a lot of times outside in the military, or hunting, or camping, and I’ve never seen anything like that. I know what helicopters and planes look like at night and that wasn’t it. In 1993 there were no drones. Unfortunately there were no camera phones either.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,43.6497,-83.4543

My college roommate and I were both from Houston, MS and we rode together to his house for the weekend.  My roommate was an avid hunter and had gotten a tractor stuck in a field behind his house the prior weekend.  I rode into the field with my roommate in his Ford Ranger pickup to attempt to recover the tractor.  This field was behind his house about 200-300 yards.  As my friend was working on the tractor, I was standing beside his truck bored (no cell phones back then to keep my attention) so I am just looking around.  I see a light in the sky in the distance to my right (east).  I think nothing of the light.  I look away and happen to glance back at the light and it is approaching us very slowly.  As the light gets closer, I can see it is actually three lights in the shape of a triangle.  I get my roommates attention and we watch this triangle Very slowly float over the top of a row ! of full-grown pine trees-moving east to west.  My roommate and I are speechless.  We watch this triangle float from our right to left over the trees without blowing the trees or making any sound.  The triangle moves to our left about 30 yards and comes to a complete stop and hovers soundless.  It remains in this position for maybe 30 seconds to a minute.  The triangle then began to move back over the pine trees coming back toward my roommate and I.  I don’t remember who panicked first, but we both began to run back to his pickup truck and the triangle breaks off from the tree line and begins to follow us as we are running.  My roommate is driving and I am in the passenger’s side.  We are both in total panic mode as my roommate is driving as fast as the truck will go while this triangle is floating somewhere about the truck.  I for some reason roll my window down to try and spot the triangle.  When I roll the window down, I can hear a very faint sound (maybe a humming sound)! and immediately tell my roommate, “It’s just a helicopter, it! ’s just a helicopter.”  My roommate slows the truck and we just simply “accepted” in that moment that what we were running from was a helicopter, because it brought us immediate relief to believe it was a helicopter.  This UFO lives in my subconscious as a “helicopter” for probably 10-15 years until I thought back on that night and all the proof in the world told me that was not a helicopter.  It is strange how our psychological defenses work to keep us safe.  Thank you for listening to my UFO experience and maybe it can help someone else.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,33.9242,-88.9476

Two other witness saw cigar and triangle craft same time, same direction My UFO Sighting — to submit to UFO hotline Peter Davenport  Bellevue, WA. 8-9PM on a beautiful clear spring evening in 1996.  I am alone in the car, driving home, going up a hill about 100 yards from my house.  Coming from the dense woods on my left, skimming the tops of the trees, is a large ball of white light.  It slowly, and leisurely glides  through the air right in front of my vehicle in a long arc.  That eery feeling of time slowing down came over me. As I watched it pass in front of me, I marveled at how beautiful it was, and how like the particular quality of light it emitted, similar, I thought, to the white glow of Saturn that I had had the privilege of seeing through a telescope so tall I had to climb a ladder up to the eyepiece. It was dazzling, and so was this.  I was not afraid, just fascinated. The glow of the sphere backlit my two-story house as it passed over and then behind the roof, in a trajectory that appeared to end in my backyard. Landed, I could not say, just that the glowing light extinguished. I parked hurriedly  in the driveway, and ran inside to greet my husband. I announced: “A UFO just landed in our backyard — would you please go take a look?” Startled, he collected himself then took my hand as we walked upstairs to look out a window at the backyard. We saw only darkness. The next morning, we examined the yard, and that of the neighbor, but see no indications of anything unusual. Here is the most curious thing about my sighting — I wasn’t the only one to see it, but I was the only one who saw a glowing sphere. Two friends both saw a UFO at the same time, in my approximate vicinity. We three had all attended an event and left at the same time. Soon after my husband and I had dared to peer out the window, the phone rang. It was Friend A excitedly telling me she had seen a UFO cross in front of her vehicle, and it looked like it was going to go right over my house. It was a cigar shaped craft. Had I seen it? Her phone rang, so she hung up to answer it. She soon called me back to tell me that the call was from Friend B who told her she had seen a triangle-shaped craft with lights, at the same time, going from left to right, and they compared notes. Had we each seen a UFO, at the same time, in the same vicinity, going in the same direction? Perhaps so, but it looked like a glowing sphere to me, a triangle lighted craft to one, and a cigar-shaped craft to ! the other. Or was it the same craft? What I saw was flying low, just skimming the tall Douglas firs with a trajectory that took it low over my rooftop that ended behind my house. Perhaps that trajectory had begun, much higher in the sky, crossing the paths of those two friends first, then continuing right over to me, if a descending arc which ended behind my house. If so, this object was quite the chameleon!  Alternatively, was it group of UFO’s? Were three objects out and about that night? If so, that would be an interesting grouping, and I wonder if there are any reports of a glowing sphere sighted with triangular and cigar shaped crafts. All in all, my sighting was one of those moments I shall never forget.  I feel privileged to have been a witness to it.

Subject: Loss of time!    In the late 90's, when there was a sphere over Las Vegas, a friend and I experienced MULTIPLE U.F.O.'s of all shapes.  I am scared to write this. When a friend and I got done working for the day we left from Vegas on our way back to Kingman, it was dark and late , we just passed thru Boulder heading down the long road to the dam. We were talking about what to do the next day about work when the truck lights and radio flickered and went off.  Then the truck stalled.  I laughed and said, "" Oh no, aliens.""  The truck kept rolling down the street, even tho stalled. After a few seconds we looked at each other then looked up thru our windshield.  There it was right above us. We could barely see it.  But with the light of the moon we can see the shadow, just hovering above us.  Way too close!!!  Then it was gone. The truck started and we pulled over to the left on a dirt road and went back about 1/4 off the road. My heart was pounding, my hands are tingling still as i write this.  We just looked at eachother . He said ""You seen that right?"" I said ""Yes."",breathless. We talked a few just staring at the sky.  We decided to just stay there for the night. We were there about an hr when we started seeing a flicker of light slowly coming across the sky.  It was small like a star but moved slowly flickering off and on like it was stalling or the engine was failing.  Then all of a sudden it got to a star (or we thought it was a star). We saw the little one line up under the brighter one and then all of a sudden there was a line barely noticeable from the one to the other. The bigger brighter one slowly lifted up the flickering one until it disappeared. Then it just stayed there, like a star that was supposed to be there. I don't know how long we sat there until we noticed more lights of red and yellow and white colors just sitting above the mountain beside us. It was HUGE. It went from one side of the mountain to the other just hovering above it. Lights just blinking. We were paying so much attention that i barely noticed the lights on the ground in front of us. I seen half circle lights that were red green and orange floating on the ground about 20-30 feet ahead of the truck. At first I thought street stop lights. But there was no lights in our area.these moved very slow and as I looked closer they were moving behind the bushes. I can see the bushes in front of them. There was at least 10 of them moving slow and bright but not that bright. I was scared, VERY SCARED! We watched them for a few minutes, actually a long few minutes. In our old pick up truck we had no lining on our inside roof. All of a sudden there was a flash like a photograph behind us to where we could see our shadows of our heads on the ceiling. I turned to look and there was another one. I saw 5 yellow squares that seemed to be part of another craft. Barely moving up in the sky about 100 ft up and 100 feet back from us. It had 2 yellow squares on top and 3 on bottom. I told him to look. He did. Now I was beyond scared! It just sat there floating back and forth. I was so scared I just started blurting out,"" Oh my god we got to go"". I screamed, ""We gotta go!"",""I love you we gotta go!"" But we didn't not move. We just watched. It seemed forever. We did not want to go to sleep. Then I felt like my body was going to vibrate. We had nowhere to go they were all around. I looked in front of the truck again to see how close the ones on the ground were getting closer they were. They were small tho. Only about 1-2 feet long and about 1 ft tall. Just then this bright light shot out of behind this side of the cliff behind them and just stopped. It was maybe 50 ft off the ground about a football field ahead of us. I froze. We felt like it was just staring at us. My friend grabbed his 500 candle flood light from behind the seat. He wanted to get out and shine the light on it. I FREAKED OUT!!!! He opened his door and stood on the door frame and shined the light on the thing. It looked like a very shiny silver bell. Like the kind you ring on the counter at a store for service. Then it started to move towards us. I screamed and started crying. He jumped back in the truck we locked the doors. I don't remember if all the other lights were still there. We watched it for hrs it seems It just stayed there and moved very slowly upward. VERY SLOWLY! Almost to where you couldn't notice. The next thing I remember is waking up laying with my head on his lap and he was waking up with his hands on the wheel sitting as if he was driving and it was morning. Not just morning.....the sun has been up for hrs. We went back to Vegas to go to work. We told two friends. They joked saying I could be pregnant. We told no one else.  There was a lot of talk in Vegas. About a flying silver cigar just hovering over the city. We knew it was the same craft as the one we seen come from behind the mountain.    Later that day we started back to Kingman again . We decided to stop by the spot that it happened. When we got close to it we saw 12 black helicopters directly over the sight where our truck was parked. We slowed down. It was weird. Now we know we didn't imagine it. This was proof. there was 3 helicopters side by side going north to south. 3 going south to north. Going in between each other , combing. Then the other six doing the same from west to east and east to west. But they were just over that area that we seen all of it.    We pulled over further up the road and got out. We saw what looked like impressions of crutch bottoms all over the sides of the road.  We got back in the truck. Continued on to kingman. We went and rented a camping spot in the Hualapai mountains to clear our heads and of course watch the skies.  In the morning we were packing up and this black suv came by our camping spot moving very slow. All the windows even the windshield was dark. We just seen shadows of four men. They left. We got a little freaked out. So about a half hr later we were heading down the mountain into kingman when we saw it again It was pulled off to the side of the road and someone was standing out on the passenger side. But I couldn't see him the back door was open and blocked everything of him except his shiny black dress shoes and black pants. As we went by I turned to see if I can catch a glimpse. He seemed to turn exactly the same time our truck passed. But I saw his stature. He was a broad shouldered man with dark hair. He had on a white dress shirt and black suspenders. When we got further away he jumped in the suv. I still saw nothing of the inside or of the other men in the vehicle. It was all limousine black tinted out.     Since that night and the day with the suv. I still see the suv. But not often. Just every other year or so. Just sitting in a parking lot when i am shopping and when i go to look at it after I get in my vehicle its gone.   Since this occured my friend has shot himself in the head, but survived. I don't know if he remembers the incident or not. I think he is lucky if not. Me.......I sometimes have to take pills to go to sleep. 1 time I woke up on my bed in the middle of the day not remembering how I got there, screaming my ex husbands name because I couldn't move. It felt like someone was holding me down just by my forehead. I screamed and screamed but nothing came out. Then it was over.    I still feel sometimes a numbing starting in my head and feeling like I'm going to become paralyzed again. I have constant ringing in my ears. When I wake up in the morning for the first few minutes before I'm fully awake, I hear what sounds like morse code. I don't even know morse code.    Well that's my experience. I went thru my stress again telling it. My hands are numb and my hearts racing. But I do feel some release telling it. In a way I want to know what happened in our lost time. I was looking for hypnotists to know. Then again who do I tell.        Thank You for Listening.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,35.926688000000006,-114.806292

It seemed to be as large as the ceiling, although, since it was directly above me, I'm not sure if it was just too close to me and therefore, I couldn't tell the exact size.  The eyes were red like laser dots.  The body was also black, but made of many round disks like gears that constantly turned - one on top of the other, seemingly as if measuring something.  The legs looked mechanical, as if jointed like a mechanical spider would be.  They seemed to be moving up and down in relation to whatever the gears were doing, each leg individually, and in a super creepy way, as if to scare someone who was arachnophobic like myself.  I knew that it was measuring my brain.  I tend to be sensitive spiritually, and I just simply knew what it was doing.  It was measuring every part of my brain, and also every flaw in it, every tendency I had in my personality, just anything that can be measured in my brain, such as how quickly the synapses responded.  Black widows are some of my worst fears so I was pretty much petrified.  My response was to hide under my covers and pray till I fell asleep.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,38.39446941580756,-121.37185910652921

All of a sudden about midnight, directly overhead in this star filled constellation, 3 of the stars in a triangle shaped pattern, that had been stationary, started moving!

They slowly moved in unison in the direction of the front point of the triangle for a few seconds and then the front star disappeared followed by the rear 2.  As if the nose of a craft lifted up and then took off.  Since they looked like stars (points of light) it was most definitely outside of the atmosphere.

It was probably around 2002 this happened.  I was in Staunton VA, on the Blue Ridge Parkway, at one of those scenic overlooks . It was dark, probably 3-4am.  My boss liked to take us out to bar after work, me and my coworker took her car to the overlook when we left. First thing that was weird – there was all manner of animal on the parkway that night.  Deer, skunk, opossum, fox, rabbit, even some cows randomly in the ditch on the way up. We’re at the overlook taking in the stars.  I have a handheld police scanner radio I kept with me at the time.  It was on, I had it in my hand or it was in the car fairly close. Through the trees, which would be off the side of the mountain, my first impression was someone had launched a firework. There was a sudden bright flash of only green light, not one point, but a firework like burst. There was no explosion, or ‘report’ from a firework. The color burst moved over the trees, and behind us on the road. About the time the ‘firework’ appeared, the police scanner (which was in scan mode) started picking up on static, I tried manually cycling though channels and every channel was static. The Object was no longer a burst of firework, but a nearly invisible blob shape that hovered over the road probably 100 feet or so from us and maybe 30 feet off the road.  There was never any sound except the static on the scanner. Within a few moments the object took off following the road. We were so stunned we did not consider following it.

What I first thought was a hot air balloon suddenly changed shape to reveal itself as a saucer overflying the heart of Canada's capital,Ottawa,ON,2003-08-21T16:30:00,disk,20-30 seconds,"Occurred : 8/21/2003 16:30  (Entered as : 08/21/03 16:30) Reported: 6/25/2020 9:18:24 AM 09:18 Posted: 6/25/2020 Location: Ottawa (Canada), ON Shape: Disk Duration:20-30 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/157/S157136.html,"What I first thought was a hot air balloon suddenly changed shape to reveal itself as a saucer overflying the heart of Canada's capital (Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA) On Thursday, August 21, 2003, at approximately 4:30 p.m., I was walking towards the Byward Market area with a friend, a fellow worker.  We had been walking North on MacKenzie Street and made for the steps between the Connaught Building and the U.S. Embassy.  As we were walking down the steps, I observed what looked like a hot air balloon in the sky straight ahead of us, i.e. looking East down George Street. When I glanced back at it a few seconds later, I noticed the object’s strange behaviour: changing shape, something that a hot air balloon does not do, obviously.  I tried to get my friend to check it out but by the time he turned to look, it had disappeared from view. I, on the other hand, had by then understood why its shape was changing: it was a disc-like object that had revolved on itself to look like a saucer on its side (note: perhaps the occupants wanted their “craft” to appear as a “hot air balloon”). It was 15 to 20 m. in diameter and around 4-5 m. in height. It was dark red. This is why I first thought it was a red hot air balloon since these are fairly common in our area, especially in August. When I first saw the object, it was about 400-500 m. away and at an altitude of about 20-25 m. (note: this estimate is based on the position of the object as it came very near a building that was about four stories high). For the couple of seconds I believed it was a hot air! balloon, I even thought it might crash or land atop a building because I had “rationalized” that it was part of a radio station stunt arranged with the Hard Rock Cafe, the rooftop terrace of which the object was approaching. When we rounded the corner of Williams Street, my friend and I both saw the object in the sky moving North. It was then about 1 km. away and not moving very fast. Unfortunately, it was too far away for my friend to tell what it was. Please note that the above report is a revised version of the initial report I submitted to NUFORC in August 2004, a year after the sighting.  That report inexplicably disappeared from the NUFORC database some time this year.  I have revised the date of the sighting since I had, at first, mistakenly thought that the event occurred during the famous power outage of August 14, 2003, but I was later corrected by the friend who was with me at the time.  I also made changes to the dimensions of the object as it did have dimensions similar to those of a hot air balloon.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,45.3813825,-75.70850071428572

Floating Spaceman/Human figure encounter.  This event happened years ago, around 2003 or 2004 while I was still in high school. A friend and his family had a party/bbq that I was invited to so I stayed the night and was going to get picked up by my parents the next morning. Naturally, being teens we stayed up late, hung out in the garage/driveway playing music, talking & skateboarding. The house was on the east side of our city and on a slope up the hill that gave us a slight view of the city & its lights at night.  Around midnight or 1am, we(my friend and our other friend) were standing outside talking when I noticed a dim lighted object out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head to it and squinted my eyes since it wasn’t in the shape of something I would be used to seeing in the sky. After having a confused face on and trying to figure out if what I was seeing is real, my friends look up and have the same reaction while using certain words to express our confusion.  We saw what we call to this day as “the space man”, an object that looked to be in the shape of a human standing up. While not lit up directly with street lights or anything of the sort, it had a slight glow or inner light to him if that makes any sense but it was very dim and you would only notice a shadow like figure at first until your eyes adjusted. The strangest part was it did not seem that high from us and within the span of 5 mins, it went from maybe a 45 degree angle to us, to floating SLOWLY down behind some trees at the bottom of his driveway and only 2 or 3 football fields away in the neighborhood. After we lost sight we wanted to go down and see where it might have landed but realized that with it being 1am, his parents not wanting us to go anywhere and being on the eastside of our city; any contact with potential officers or concerned neighbors would not be ideal.  We kind of bring it up every once and a while but I never knew where to share this or if others have seen it. I found these two searching the site that are the closest to what we experienced. I also saw a while back that in mexico they are called witches but I am not sure if what we saw fits explanations of those sightings since they tend to actually “fly” and not float or slowly fall like this thing.  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64651.html  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77040.html",2020-06-25T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

On this particular night, I was in a friend's car and as we went down a hill near the shopping center, I saw a saucer shaped craft in the sky over a walgreens.  It was just a glimpse, but as soon as we parked I hopped out to get a better view.  Here is my description of the craft:  The craft was saucer shaped, tilted towards me.  It was your classic saucer shape, with a bit of a bulge on the top part.  The surface was entirely smooth.  I could tell the craft was rotating because of the way light was either emitting from it or reflecting off it.  The light was the sort of yellow-white the moon gets on a cloudy night. This night was lightly cloudy, and at one point the craft seemed to be going behind a cloud, but the light was actually just fading. It faded back in a little later. It would do this a few times. It also would sometimes move slightly. Very slowly and deliberately. After a few hours, I had to go home, and by then the craft was gone. There were dozens of middle schoolers, parents, and families at the plaza, many of whom witnessed the saucer. One very strange thing was that the parents I spoke to about it seemed to want nothing to do with it. Like they wanted to ignore it, forget it ever happened.

Of course it was pitch black and distance can be hard to judge.  A object was traveling in the same direction I was and would guess it was about a quarter mile away.  It was at perhaps 3 times the height of the trees which are across a large open field.  There were no obstructions to block my view.  Out my window it appeared to be about the size of a silver dollar which if it were a quarter mile away would make it fairly large.  I would like to say it was a sphere but since i only saw one side can only guess.  It was perfectly round, white and luminous like a light bulb.  It trailed white boiling flames behind which were about two or three times the width of the object long. In the night sky it really stood out. It was going maybe two or three times as fast as i was on a parallel course and disappeared from my view when the field came to a end and the trees were once again right next to the road. I was very shakened but soon convinced myself I just didnt understand what i was seeing. Two or so miles further I made a left turn onto Cable Bridge Rd to continue home and would take me across the objects flight path.

angel hair   ((MUFON REPORT)),St Louis,MO,2008-06-30T12:00:00,unknown,20 minutes,"Occurred : 6/30/2008 12:00  (Entered as : 2004 12:00) Reported: 6/6/2020 10:54:27 PM 22:54 Posted: 6/25/2020 Location: St. Louis, MO Shape: Unknown Duration:20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/156/S156948.html,"UFO – Angel Hair Sighting Sighting Report submitted for Stella XXXX by John Budrys (FI #22542) 5 June 20  On 2 Apr 20, I, John Budrys, was assigned Stella’s MUFON sighting report #XXXXXX of an event witnessed with her husband in 2008. I completed my FI report on 11 May 20, but continue to stay in touch with Stella. During one of the conversations with Stella about her other life experiences, she related a remarkable event. As Stella said she had trouble working with the MUFON reporting forms, I offered to submit this report for her. Stella thought it occurred during one of her truck driving jobs in about 2004, though she said it might have been in 2005. She suggested records of the train wreck would help pinpoint the date, as these don’t happen that often. Stella and her husband, both professional truck drivers, were in the process of making another delivery in the St. Louis area. They heard from other truckers via their CB radio of a train wreck that had occurred several days earlier, so decided to visit the site that afternoon and have lunch. She that the train wreck was on a ! side road next to Hwy I-44, about 30-40 miles west of St. Louis. She said since they were “bob-tail”, which means they had no trailer attached to their cab, they were easily able to drive on the side road and have a look while they had lunch. Stella guessed it may have been March, as the day was fairly warm, and they had their windows open.  They sat in their cab looking at the two wrecked train boxcars that were still there, and the firetrucks that were spraying water on them. After about ten minutes, Stella said they noticed wispy strands floating down and hanging on the trees, street signs, and from the visor in front of their large truck windshield and side mirrors. Stella said she reached her arm out the window and picked up one of the strands that had fallen on the truck’s mirror. She said it dissolved within one or 2 seconds at most as she touched it, and left no residue. She said she thought it might be “Angel Hair” from a UFO, which she had read about in a Time Life book on UFOs.  Stella said despite having read in the book that angel hair was associated with UFOs, she failed to look up to see if there was anything there. In retrospect, she was sad she hadn’t looked up to see what the source might have been, and also regretted she hadn’t tried to save some in a jar. I asked how much of this angel hair was falling. Was it like a snowfall, or just an occasional strand? Stella said there were only a few strands falling at a time, but it was like a very light snowfall. And that there was quite a bit of it. It hung from the nearby trees, street signs, and their truck. I asked what the strands looked like. She said they were light gray, about the thickness of “Silly String” that kids shoot out of spray cans, and had lumps on them, perhaps a few small lumps per strand. I asked how long each strand was, and she said they were about 12 to 18 inches long, with some shorter strands. Stella said the Time Life book she read talked of skeptics suggesting people rep! orting angel hair were just seeing spider threads. Stella said what she saw was definitely not spider silk, and that it would be “absolutely ridiculous” to try and call it that. She was quite familiar with spider silk from living in country environments. She said if you are walking in the woods and get a strand in your face, you definitely feel it, and then might carry a stick in front of you to prevent another strand from getting in your face. I said yep, that’s exactly how I react. She said when she tried picking up the strand from the side mirror of her truck, she felt nothing, it dissolved immediately, and left no trace in her hand. Totally different from spider silk.  As they watched, the strands on the trees and signs were slowly dissolving away, and she noted, interestingly, that the ones on her windshield were shortening as they dissolved away. Stella said they lasted perhaps a few minutes, and covered a roughly circular area around them about 200 feet across. When I asked, she said that they seemed to be in the center of this circle. Though they found the angel hair interesting, Stella thought it was quite common, so they were actually more interested in viewing the two wrecked train cars and fire truck activity than the angel hair. They left after about a half hour, having finished their lunch, at which point the angle hair was still draped over the trees and signs. Because she thought angel hair was common, and because she had no idea to whom she might report it to, she never did.  I asked Stella if her husband would be willing to speak with me about what he recalled of the event. Unfortunately, he has several serious medical issues including the beginning of dementia, and she said he did not feel like talking, but did say he agreed with everything Stella had said about it. He did recall that the angel hair was disappearing as they drove off. When I asked for more detail on how it was dissolving, Stella said she really wasn’t paying attention to the angel hair as she had to concentrate on helping her husband, who was driving, in maneuvering the large truck. She said it’s always good to have two sets of eyes.  I emailed a copy of my first draft of this event to Stella to review what I wrote and answer a few questions, which she did by email. To clarify a few more questions, I called her on 1 June 20 at 4:40pm. Her husband Paul answered, and said Stella was running a few errands and would be back in a few hours. I did not mean to bother him, knowing he was not doing well, but did take the opportunity to ask his recollection of the event. I found him lucid, and speaking normally, though he did admit he could no longer remember the train wreck. I asked how the angel hair appeared, and he said it was like a light snow all over, but in strings. It was draped over the trees and signs and their truck. He said it did not dissolve immediately unless you touched it. And that it left no residue when you touched it. I asked how long it persisted, and he said it fell for about a half hour! And did not dissolve, but just hung on everything. I asked if it stuck to the windshield, i.e., was it st! icky? Or did it blow off like straw as they took off? Could they see through the windshield, or did they have to turn on their wipers? He said no, they had no trouble seeing through the windshield and they did not have to turn on their wipers, as it wasn’t that heavy, and that it wasn’t sticky but blew right off as they started moving.  So was it like “Silly String”, as Stella described it? He said it was, but not as heavy as Silly String. So did it have lumps like Stella noted? He said it was more like “it had ripples in it”. I asked what they thought it was when they saw it. He said they knew about angel hair, so figured that what it was. They probably should have tried to save some, but didn’t.  He then said he had to go, so I didn’t pester him with more questions. But what he did convey pretty much confirmed what Stella conveyed. And he was able to add a few more very interesting details. The few differences in his recalled details actually adds validity to their recollections, as a perfectly matching story would suggest a coordinated tale. I did not find him confused, but honest and clear in his answers. I did not press to keep him on the line, as I realized he might not be feeling well. I asked him to let Stella know I’ll get back with her. Phonecon ended at 4:47pm. In my last call on 4 June 20 to clarify a few more details, I asked Stella if anything odd had occurred before the angel hair began falling. She said no. Wondering about the firetrucks spraying the boxcars, I asked if these were spraying anything that could have wafted up into filaments, like some sort of flame retardant. She said she didn’t recall any hazardous markings on the boxcars, so could not say what was inside them. But it appeared to her that the firetrucks were just spraying water. She again suggested there should be some way to look up news reports of this train wreck, which would not only establish the date, but also might shed some light on the contents of the boxcars.  I asked how long they were there total. She said about a half hour, as they only had a simple lunch. So if the angel hair started falling about ten minutes after they arrived, that would mean it was falling for about 20 minutes. Stella figured that was about right. She had read the second draft of this write-up I’d sent her, which included her husband’s observations. She disagreed with his recollection that none of it had dissolved when they left. She said if it was hanging free, like from a branch, it seemed not to be dissolving. But if it was laying on something, like the windshield, or when touched, it would dissolve. She confirmed there was no need to turn on their windshield wipers, and that it didn’t leave any residue on the glass. She relayed an incident near an airport where jets were circling right overhead and their truck got some jet fuel on it. She was surprised at how much fuel the jets were dropping. The angel hair, by comparison, left nothing on their truck. S! he also disagreed with her husband’s thick as Silly String estimate, saying it was thinner than Silly String. She did agree with his “ripples” description, saying it looked crinkled. I also asked her to clarify her saying it shrank up as it dissolved. She said it didn’t so much shrink up, as dissolve starting at the end and getting shorter and shorter. The mental picture I got from her description was something like a fuse burning down its length, which she said was fairly correct.  I thanked Stella for all her time, and will be sending her a copy of this final write-up.  Just before I submitted this report for Stella, I happened across an older U-Tube video of a Brian Boldman speaking at a “NUFOC” conference, which I gleaned from the sign behind the podium. He had done extensive research on hundreds of angel hair sightings, going back many centuries. He reported some New York sightings of angel hair have been found to be radioactive, and some have been found to contain Tritium, which is very odd. He has handled some samples with tweezers, and found them to have quite a bit of static electricity. Most descriptions compare it to cotton candy, asbestos fibers, or spider strings. Though most skeptics dismiss it as spider webs, he has found a peak of sightings to be in October, while spiders migrate in spring. He submitted a sample he managed to obtain from a 1999 California sighting to Phyllis Budinger, whom I’ve worked with on other physical evidence cases, and who is very reputable. Mr. Boldman said she had found the samples he submitted conta! ined volatiles like carbon disulfide and 2-methyl 1-propene, unusual for a solid, but which might explain how the angel hair might “sublimate” directly into a gas, bypassing any liquid stage. I found Ms. Budinger’s formal report on these samples she analyzed, posted on “The Black Vault” site. She concluded they were organic in nature, were not spider silk, but were more similar to caterpillar silk. She noted no weight loss or physical degradation even after 4 months. This does not resemble the quickly dissolving material Stella or many others report. I will decline from further entering into this controversy, as it seems much remains to be researched yet on this phenomena. But I do thank Stella for her time and willingness to share her experiences. JB  I have submitted this report to NUFORC as the MUFON website surprisingly does not let me submit this report without numerous detail that is unknown. I am saddened as a long time MUFON FI that MUFON must be rejecting many reports due to the requirements for unknown minor details. This eliminates the vast majority of reports, to the detriment of study of this phenomena. I can see why witnesses do not find the MUFON reporting system user friendly. This is my first experience with trying to submit a sighting report to MUFON, and I am extremely saddened by my experience. Thank God for NUFORC!

While driving from Florida to Washington D.C., my wife and I saw this single object just hanging in the sky with what looked like a mist or smoke trailing above it.  It had no rotors like a helicopter and no noise or exhaust like the hover jets we have seen many times.  Yet it remained in one spot the entire time we watched it (about five minutes).  We took just this one picture with my lousy cell phone camera and kept driving as it was a long drive for us. Both my wife and I saw this and were not scared because her friend was followed by a small saucer for about ten miles on a very deserted road in central Florida during the late 1960s.  The father was an educated man.  (I want nothing that could possibly identify anyone!)  Also, one of my relatives was hunting with friends in the forests of the deep South in the 1970s when they were captured and taken aboard a saucer and examined, a very unpleasant experience.  My relative was relatively unfazed by the experience, perhaps because he had been in the first Gulf War on the front lines.  But one of his friends had a different reaction and went crazy and killed himself. The ""visitors"" seemed to treat them as we would animals to be examined and tagged.  So I and my wife know that we have ""visitors"" that sometimes do horrible things. I know this is really late to report but we really don't see our picture as anything significant but possible ridicule prevents us from coming forward with our names.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,,

We were all taking a break from riding and just talking and I happened to see something move extremely fast into view, way out past christmas village from where we were standing. The craft then came to a complete stop in the sky and sat there for at least 10-20 seconds. At that point I got the others with me to take a look and then the craft shot what can be best described as a short funnel of mist/light that was nowhere close to the ground. I would say the size of the mist that came down was no larger than if you extended four fingers with an outstretched arm to measure it. The mist started out very strong and over what was about a minute and a half, slowly began to fade away but the craft stayed still. Once the mist was gone, It then shot directly vertical into the sky. I! was hysterically yelling in fear at the speed this thing took off with. I went directly home to tell my parents. Then, about a half hour later, one of the kids I was with called me and said it (or a different one) had returned in the same spot, but this time no mist. All it did was circle the area, coming to complete stops at times, and then once again shooting back straight up into the sky. The next day, Hundreds of reports of this sighting were sent to news outlets in berks county. It was a very nice summer night, very few clouds, and definitely a night that a lot of people were outside with either fire pits or relaxing on their deck. This remains the only UFO sighting I have ever had. To get an idea of exactly where this took place, I was in the development off of christmas village road, on the circle closest to Christmas village. Out where the craft was hovering, there is nothing but miles of farmland and woods. It gets extremely rural as mennonite territory starts abo! ut 5 miles down the road. The town of Bernville is about a mil! e away, and the city of Reading is a 15 minute drive.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,40.4675,-76.1274

I am writing this report around a year after the incident.  I still can’t get it out of my mind whilst the other witness has forgotten it even transpired.  My father was driving me home, probably from our weekly grocery shop.  We were less than a kilometre from home when it happened.  For context, it was 2019, and it was a bright clear-skied sunny afternoon, no later than 1700 I’d estimate if it was a weekday and there was a private airfield near the location where the incident occurred.  However, the owners only flew this one old plane and the site, in general, was just worn down, so it’s not very relevant.  I was a passenger in a car passing a park on the way home.  I also didn’t have my glasses on.  My eyesight is excellent, however, I just want to be transparent about this. At first, I saw it in my peripheral vision, I turned my head to look just before it disappeared.  My father, who had the best view from the side window and front windshield of the car asked me, “Did you see that?” and I replied “Yeah, what was it?” and he replied, “I don’t know.”  Unfortunately, I didn’t ask him any more questions about it until a decent few months had past and he completely denied seeing the event at all when he was the one who had brought it up.  I was so shocked at the time at what I had seen that I didn’t want to mention it lest I be seen as mad. It was a bright light, completely bright like the sun.  There was no metal that I could see, nothing reflective, it had a tail like a comet and shot from right to left. It flew off in an obtuse angle, around 130 degrees.  It was only a few metres off the ground speeding so fast, the fastest thing I’ve ever seen. It was so fast if I blinked it would have been over and I would have missed it.  If it had just gone straight I would have thought it was a beam of light or a reflection.  It only lasted a few seconds but it was both the most beautiful yet most terrifying thing I’ve ever seen in my life. I’m still so stunned it happened to this day and in daylight too.  It was a few metres away from the car and we were moving 50kms at the same time but I’ve never questioned what I saw though because it’s etched in my brain and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to forget.  There wasn’t really anyone else around at the time, no one at the park where it occurred (above of) and the only other cars would have been going in the opposite direction at the time. It looked to be at least a metre wide a half metre in height, that’s proportionally accurate but in relation to actual dimensions I’m not sure.  The light came across my vision, right to left, then moved upwards, not straight up but it took no time to change its trajectory.  After it began moving up in this direction, we turned into our street and could no longer see the park or the strange flash of light.  It was probably oval-shaped but because of how fast it was moving it just looked like a bright yellow long light.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,,

It was a beautifully clear night with no clouds in the sky.  As I was observing the planes above I almost ran my vehicle into the ditch. In that instance I reminded myself to watch the road and stop admiring the planes in the clear sky. At that moment a “voice” in my head said “no, watch the planes”.  I was slightly startled by this voice in my head because I wasn’t sure that it was my own free thought that was saying this. It didn’t feel authentic to my person/psyche. Curiously I obliged and looked back out of my car window up at the planes.  (Side note: planes fly very low over crow mountain). Out of nowhere an orb appeared. It was a very intense blue colored light that appeared. The light didn’t radiate out from the object like planes lights do.  Meaning when you see a plane at night or even a star, the light emanating from that object splits and shines seemingly in different directions.  This light seemed solid/contained.  The moment I saw it my heart beat sped up and there was this hollow feeling in my chest for I knew what I was seeing.  It’s movements were sporadic “dancing” across the nights sky.  It seemed to approach the planes perpendicular, stopped, and then followed beside them parallel. This only lasted for maybe 10-20 seconds.  It was right above me when it stopped following the planes and seemed to change course.  When it decided to leave it shot off faster than Humanly possible.  It went from being right above me to out of our atmosphere (seemingly) in a matter of 1-3 seconds.

I had a window seat that faced North as the plane headed northeast.  At around midnight (I can rarely sleep on planes), we were just over St John, Newfoundland. The cabin lights were off and I could see the last dim lights of North America fall behind us. I am an amature astronomer so I was enjoying the stars out my window. About an hour later the flight attendant asked all passengers on the left side of the plane (windows facing north more or less) to close our shades. “The sun will be rising soon and it will shine brightly through your windows”, she said.  But it was only 1:00 or 1:30 AM!  She came around a few minutes later and really made sure that we had those shades closed.  I kept mine open a few inches and kept looking out. Shortly after the announcement, I noticed what looked like a flare or rocket rising above the far horizon.  It was maybe 100 miles in the distance, back in the direction of Canada.  It was brief, in duration, and made a short orange arc in the darkness outside my window. It was likely military exercises (I discovered weeks later that a NATO base is out there). What I witnessed within an hour after this event was very strange.  Out my window was a craft of some sort, with 3 rows of pulsating colored lights -blue, red, and yellow/white.   was following us about ¼ to 1/2 mile away, slightly behind us.  Each row of lights flashed in quick succession -fraction of seconds. It was almost hypnotizing.  It was too dark to make out a shape or size of the craft, but I could guess by the light pattern that it craft was less than 100 feet long and a height one third the length. It would drift behind us at times, out of my limited field of view, then reappear, just to our rear.  The pulsating lights seemed to reverse their top-middle-bottom row pattern at least once (though it could have been my eyes by now).

I had hiked there with the intention to do a solo overnighter. Once I reached the hike summit, I set up my tent and left the rainfly off (without it, my tent was mesh on all sides) so I could see the stars . I was the only one there, so I set my tent up in the middle of a grass clearing to the left of the lookout.  I watched the sunset in my tent, then laid down on my back. Once it turned dark at around 10pm, out of the corner of my right eye, I saw a floating light. I turned my head and saw a round shape with a convex curve on the upper/lower middle (kind of what you would think a generic UFO would look like) hovering maybe 150ft away from the ground. It had a light on it. The light was a warm light, not cool. Trailing behind it were two other hovering objects. They were not large, maybe the size of a smart car. I could not identify what they were and I was frozen with fear. They kept flying (it was more of a slower hover) in a pattern. They would make a pattern for a while, then leave, then come back again and make another pattern. This happened the entire night. I slowly tried to take out my camera (I was extremely scared) to film, but it would not focus in the dark. At one point, one of the objects hovered about 150ft directly over my tent and then flew toward Mt. Rainier (which wa! s straight away from my tent). When these things hovered, they made zero sound. He hovering was not extremely smooth, they would almost slightly bob up and down.  They made their last pattern right before dawn. I packed up my stuff and ran back to my car. I drove to the nearest ranger station to ask if they had been testing any kind of equipment near Shriner Peak. The ranger said no, but that there was a military base near by.

Reporting Party Background: -FAA Licensed Private Pilot (helicopter rated). -Former Police Officer. -Employed 36 years in a line of work which requires keen observation, analysis and reporting.  As a Pilot, I know a little about flight operations and characteristics, especially associated with those craft which fly low and slow like the helicopter I fly.  Summary of Video: The video is poor resolution, periodically showing the flashing rear red lights (a large triangle pattern) located at the tail of the craft.  Video time stamp for the lights:  at 3 to 30 seconds, flashing approximately every second (located middle right of screen), then at 29 to 34 seconds (middle left of screen), and at 1:15 to 1:19 (middle).  Incident Details: At around 11:00pm November 21st, 2015, I was driving North on Hastings when at the intersection of Coachman Rd and Hastings I noticed what appeared to be a large fixed wing passenger plane coming in for final approach to Sundance Airpark runway 36, which is located within one mile to the NE.  I didn’t pay much attention to it.  I noticed a white male jogger with black hair at that same intersection who looked back at the craft as well, so I know there was at least one other witness.  I continued North on Hastings and stopped at Surrey Hills Blvd where the craft (single hand hex dumb bell - much thicker in the middle - see my sketch) had quickly descended from an altitude of around 500-800ft AGL to a full stop hover around 75ft AGL and directly over the Church of the LDS gold horn blower Christus Statue, brightly illuminated by upward pointing spot lights. The craft began flashing several large lights (located flush in the belly and seemingly at least 10ft in diameter each) i! n varied patterns of colors normally associated with the old color projection television sets (red, green, blue, etc).  This really captured my full attention.  I was so mesmerized that I failed to start my phone camera……..either that or something else kept me from engaging my camera.  The craft appeared to be at least the length of the LDS building (190ft appx) and about 4-5 stories in height.  My outstretched hand holding a cantaloupe would have covered the craft, viewed from 500ft away.  The craft made no engine noise whatsoever, except for sporadic compressed air sounds (perhaps bow thrusters – not the same sound that hot air balloon igniters make).  When I finally engaged my camera video and looked back toward the craft, it had just departed from hover and traveled directly over Surrey Hills Blvd in a Westerly direction.  I followed at 30mph until I ran out of road.  I estimate the craft was at an altitude of appx 100ft AGL and traveling no more than 35mph, all the whi! le making no noise.  It was completed blacked out except for a! large t riangular pattern of 3 red lights located at the tail,  slowly flashing appx once per second (was not an LED flash; more of a glow from dim to bright).  Note that lighter than air craft (like hot air balloons) have no propulsion or motors that I know of, as they travel at the mercy of the wind direction.   I first thought this had to be a drone or lighter than aircraft, however, how could that be true when it was the size of a large building?  Besides, FAA requires Drone Pilots to obtain special authorization in order to operate at night, and the drone cannot weigh more than 55 pounds.

Under the object there were dozens of florescent lights, ranging in color from blue, green, red, and orange lights.. Underneath there was a semi circle of lights blue and red. Around the semi circle was a shape of a diamond or square depending on the viewpoint. The lights outlining the square/diamond shap! e underneath were green and orange in color. I am a person of sound mind, but this had me completely shaken. I was screaming at my husband, and honestly thought I was going insane. Never in my life have I seen anything like this. Ever. There's not a soul in this world that can tell me, nor convince me that this was a plane. It appeared to be 8 times bigger than any plane I've ever seen in my life. I am still very confused, and shaken over this. I will never in my life, forget this experience.

It was rather electrifying  but nit deadly like  all i could say under my breath was'Oh my fucking God!!  At that moment not a second later the light turned off.  It appeared to be 10 in diameter a solid blackish bronze ball.  Hovered for a second  then zipped 5 feet up to the right .hovered stand still All the other light phenomena  then ceased  Then the black steel looking ball zoomed in a second out of sight. Now after that we ran our tent climbed inside wrapped in sleeping bags and fell asleep.  I dont what time it was or the duration of that sublime experience.  All i can say is When the morning came we woke uo to a noreaster fog and rain storm from hell. I basically lifted the whole tent like a pilliw case full of camping gear and dragged it to the car we bith climbed in and drove away fast.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,40.9737,-72.1437

It was not a helicopter and sat over the road exiting to Bixby.  Other cars had pulled over to watch it and another did a u-turn to head back.

The craft had a light bar that would blow your mind very advanced. Bright enough to imitate a planet very wide and probably nearing 2 stories tall.  It shined the sink hole.  Why? Very very good question.  After that, the craft saw us standing there and proceeded due east then north at the next dirt road lol no shit.

It seemed to be some distance away; it was framed behind a tall pine tree's upper branches and gradually moved from one side of the tree to the other very slowly, often over about 30 minutes before moving out of view.  It was not a star: Looking at it through binoculars, it seemed to resolve into a cluster of red, white and green lights spaced short distances apart, possibly in a triangular or oval shape. However, it was too far away to see details or estimate the actual distance of the object.  No sounds were audible.  The same area of sky, viewed in daylight, appears to be empty of buildings, utility poles or towers that might be illuminated at night.

This location is on top of a big hill. It looked like it was only a mile away and larger than a 747. There were brilliant white lights all over it and one red light on the left side. The lights were reflecting off of shiny metal. The object had no wings or tail and made no sound. At first, I thought it was a plane landing at the Downtown Kansas City airport, and it would have needed to turn in order to do so, but soon realized that it was flying very low - at approximately 2,000 feet or lower and slow-moving from North to South. It did not turn in the direction (west) it would have needed to land. The object then either disappeared or turned all of its lights out. I immediately called another Field Investigator I often work with and she had just seen the same object in the western skies from her position, which is two! miles south and two miles closer to where the object was. So that means it had to have been approximately three miles away, making it absolutely huge - perhaps five times the size of a commercial airliner. The skies were clear and I am hoping that someone else saw this object and got a video of it. A few days later we had a MUFON meeting and yet a third field investigator reported seeing the same object at the same time. He happened to be outside doing an investigation when he noticed it, although he was several miles further to the southeast at the time. After publishing this incident on Facebook, several other people responded, saying they saw it as well. Each person described seeing the same type of craft with the lights in the same positions. The location of the object was likely in an industrial area just west of 435 Hwy and 23rd Street where there are no houses.  My daughter said that she saw the exact same object on February 9 at approximately 7:30 pm, from 40 Hwy and Sterling in Independence, MO which is south of the original sighting location. She was looking in a NW direction, and we determined that it was likely in the same location where I saw it on February 6. Also on Monday, February 9 several witnesses in Sugar Creek, MO reported hearing a horrible mechanical sound coming from the skies just two miles north of where the object was sighted, and that many neighbors went outside to find the source of the loud sound. They were all looking up, but no one could see anything. This was reported by another witness, who has made a number of UFO reports which are credible. Unfortunately, no one has video but I'm hoping that through Facebook and other sites someone will come forward as this was a spectacular sighting. No one else has filed a report. I can come to no other conclusion than that this was a real unidentified flying object.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,39.07880845410628,-94.38608574879227

LETTER: What kind of bird was that? •	Jun 23, 2020 A few weeks before spring I took my dogs outside mid morning.  I always check the sky for hawks because I know that my 3.5 pound Yorkies would be a full meal deal. The sky was very blue with no clouds.  East of our home are woods with trees between 50 to 70 feet high.  There were no leaves on any of the trees. Approximately I'm guessing 50 feet above trees a circle of silver caught my eyes.  My first thought was it had to be birds even though I'd never seen birds fly that high.  Also the birds appeared to be touching each other to form a circle.  They appeared to be going south but moving very slow. In a matter of seconds they turned and disappeared going north.  No sooner had they made this move but appeared again going south.  They didn't seem to be moving forward. the next second they turned north again.  I waited for them to reappear, but they didn't. I've had a lot of time to think about what I saw.  I would have written sooner but I didn't want to bother anyone. Much more important news was being reported. I am writing to you in hopes you'll print this and that someone else saw what I have described and have the same questions or answers.  If birds, what kind?  If not, birds what?",2020-06-25T00:00:00,39.9513,-88.8669

It did not light up the sky. It did not have no Color lights, The body of the craft was the only thing lit . It did not have no beams in front of the craft. Nor it did not Leave a tail behind. Nor made noise no sound at the moment. I was speechless and frighten with all that’s going on to see that with all that is going on today then I sad fe! eling came over me . About 15 seconds later I heard what sounded to be a regular airplane flying overhead . the it became more of a rumble. The sound filled up a bigger space then a regular aircraft space would have.

We came to the intersection of Appian Way and Fitzgerald Dr. and stopped at the stoplight.  There's a Wingstop and Wendy's restaurant kiddie corner to where we were stopped at the light. Above the restaurant building there were 3 large round/oval blackish/grayish balloon looking things. My daughter asks me, ""Are those balloons?"" They were really large and looked like mylar balloons, but way too large for regular mylar balloons. They were going kind of slow, somewhat floating like balloons, but did not go up. They floated/flew horizontally across the freeway. As we watched them, it seemed the sun was reflecting off of them, but it was a turquoise color. So it kind of had this black/gray color and sometimes turquoise.  My daughter described them as looking turquoise. Two of them in the front were closer together and one trailing behind. As we were still stopped at the light, they seemed to fly/float over the freeway going in a northwest direction. The light turned green and the entrance to the freeway was really close. We continued watching them and then I saw blue and red lights going off and on like an aircraft. It definitely was not an airplane or a helicopter. When I saw the lights I kind of freaked out, because it dawned on me that it wasn't any kind of aircraft I had ever seen before. I'm a navy brat and my father was a P3-Orion pilot. I was also married to a man in the navy and I've lived on Navy bases, Marine Corps bases and Air Force bases. I've seen a lot of aircraft in my life, but this was something completely new. As I got on the ramp to the freeway to go north, I urged my daughter to take a video or a picture of the UFOs, but she was in the passenger seat and the UFOs were on my left side at that point. She couldn't even see them then. I got off at the next exit which wasn't even a minute away and turned around to go south to try to spot them. We couldn't see them at all. It's like they just disappeared. I'm so disappointed we couldn't get a picture or a video, but it all happened so fast and I was driving. I've followed UFO stories since I was a little girl, but I have never personally witnessed anything like this until now. I'm not ruling out some kind of military surveillance or experiential aircraft or drone. I know that I've never seen anything like it and it didn't look like any drone I've seen.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,37.9927,-122.27609999999999

I live in La Verne, California (Southern), near the I-210 freeway.  As I looked out my 2nd story bedroom window, facing towards the east.  I observed a vertically positioned, NON-MOVING, brightly colored, string-like object (white & blue lights-non flashing) approximately 2 or 3 miles away.  The object looked like a string, completely intact, and not like a string of pearls.  I then observed a police helicopter circling many times around this object (both the helicopter & the object were the exact same height above the ground- approximately 900 feet or so.  It was obviously still dark outside, so I couldn’t identify the paint markings on the police helicopter (unknown department).  However, being a law enforcement officer (20 years), I saw the lighting which gave it away.  Whoever he/she (pilot) is, they MOST definitely saw ! that object, by the way they were circling so closely and so many times.   I then began to look around the sky, which was littered with these objects.  They were mostly dim, higher up, and there appeared to be a dark cloud covering.   The dimmer objects were also, vertically positioned, NON-MOVING, and not touching each other.  Against my better, more “logical” thought process, I couldn’t help thinking that the world was on lock down for a pandemic, and now, here we were (pilot(s) and I), looking at these objects ominously staggered throughout the sky.  Their positioning could be seen over Mount Baldy, San Dimas, La Verne, Claremont, Pomona, and perhaps farther.  However, that’s as far as my eyes take me in the dark.  I grabbed my I-Phone and took a couple of pictures of the brighter object (see attached pics).  I am obviously not a photographer, nor am I digitally inclined.  Through my screened window, I took the best picture that I possibly could.  The size of the “object! ” was slightly smaller than the helicopter, which continued to! circle around it a few more times.  Also, not knowing the correct photo settings, the pictures do not show just how bright the object was.  I then attempted to take a video, which wasn’t much better.  I will admit, I was fearful of going outside, they didn’t quite give us training for that in my academy.  However, I needed a witness(es), and woke up two family members, who, tiredly, and briefly, looked out the window.  They observed the bright object, and quickly dismissed it, as satellites, belonging to Elon Musk.  They laughed as they went back to bed, not realizing there were a hundred more in the sky, or what my picture would show the next morning.  I continued to stay up for 30 minutes, watching the objects remain in the same spot (vertically), before also dismissing it.  The next morning the objects were gone, and I felt that something JUST wasn’t right.  I then began to research everything from satellites, meteor showers, to falling stars, and anything else, that could expla! in it away.  When the research didn’t explain it away, I poured through the internet to see if anyone reported it, especially, THAT helicopter pilot.  Nothing!  I then called a few of my law enforcement contacts(my dispatch and local dispatch).  Those contacts yielded no further information, but more importantly, NO explanation.  I waited two days researching before deciding to report this to your web site.  Please keep in mind, my pictures are zoomed in as far as my phone allows.  At first glance, the object looks like a part of my window screen, it is not (also attached-daytime picture of same screen intact/not torn).  Hopefully someone else comes forward with an observation, or an explanation, because I am ALL OUT of them! Thank you.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,34.1008,-117.7678

I called for my husband to come out and look at them. I looked through my binoculars using both lenses and it appeared to be the oblong form with a single bar of light the other object was changing colors. I decided to use one of the lenses and then the shape of the object scared the crap out of me. It was like a diamond shaped orb with lights running in sections from top to bottom, it reminded me of a crab shell.   I texted my neighbor who lives .25 miles to the north of us who doesn’t have as many trees surrounding their farmstead as we have, then asked her to go out on her deck to see if she could see anything. She called me back and asked what am I looking for and I heard her husband let out a curse word and said that is what she is talking about. There was o! ne that was not too far from their home and then they counted up to 10 of the objects throughout the area. I got in my vehicle and drove up to their home and after I arrived they said the bigger one had just flown like a comet directly south after hovering for the 15 minutes between the time we had talked on the phone and we I drove into their yard. The objects would hover then slowly move to the west. One of the objects was SE of their home and I thought it was a satellite at first but then it started going in circles like a drone that had a drunk operator but the altitude was too high for a drone. Then it headed straight south. Those that had been in the west started to move south. They all would move a good distance then start hovering again, and continued the pattern. The objects observed would change from white lights to green to red and then stay white while hovering and then change colors again. I looked at the SpaceX website and they didn’t look anything like the photos of those satellites. I looked at the photos of the drones that had been plaguing Western Nebraska and Eastern Colorado and the objects we saw were not drones. The objects we saw hovered at a higher altitude. This wasn’t the first time I saw the objects. I saw them on Saturday the 29th of March and right after I spotted one it flew east light a comet. The other one was still hovering but I thought it might be a large helicopter but now I don’t think it was because it was exactly what I saw last night. The observers were a retired farmer, a working professional with pipeline companies, the owner of a custom harvesting company and his wife.

In the space of a minute they faded from sight to the East, in procession.  There may have been more before I looked up, as the farthermost light to the East was quick to disappear. The first six lights were in a line, the last was initially slightly behind and to one side, but by the time they disappeared it had caught up with the last light in line.

It wasn’t really moving either it just kind of stayed there. It gave me enough time to get a my phone out for a 1.45m video but it doesn’t do justice. So ran inside and grabbed my high power rifle but couldn’t focus it my adrenaline was pumping.

At, or around 9:30 p.m. this evening, I was taking my dog out, as we normally do each night before bed.  The sky was clear, the wind gusting heavy at times.  I glanced around the clear sky, taking note of the “Little Dipper” and “Orion” constellations above me. It was at this time that I noticed a very bright light in the sky, just to the west of “Orion’s belt.”  At first, I thought it may be the lights of an approaching plane, however the only sound that could be heard was the blowing wind.  There were several factors that kept me focused on this particular subject – First, it was the single brightest object in the night sky, including the moon. Second, to the naked eye, there appeared to be a “swirling” of lights, flashing at times with a Blue tint at the outer edges. Third, the subject did not appear to be moving, but continually would alternate between bright flashes then dim, then flash, repeating for several minutes. After watching this display for several minutes, I knew that what I was looking at was not a plane, not a helicopter, not a weather balloon.  It was not a planet, as I could also see “Venus” in the Western sky, but this object was significantly brighter and much, much closer and lower in the sky.  I grabbed my cell phone and proceeded to record several video clips, (in total, over10 mins) in which the bright light continues to flash and dim the “light display” for lack of a better term. My girlfriend, who also lives with me, came into the yard at this point and also noticed the “object.”  She instantly recognized the “light display” and noted that there were no sounds, other than the wind.  We both continued to watch and record the object.  At approximately 10 pm, I went inside and placed my cell phone on the charger as the battery was low.  I returned to the backyard (noting the time on the stove before I stepped out) and used my gf’s phone to record another video.  It was at this time that I noted the object was now much lower on the horizon line and appeared to be moving further away to the general West/NorthWest. I decided to get into my car and see if I could follow or track the object somehow.  I proceeded North on El Capitan Way for 2 blocks, then turned West onto Buckskin Ave and continued West until the intersection of Buckskin Ave and N. Grand Canyon Dr, where I turned right (North) and continued until the intersection of W. Gowan Rd where in the literal “blink” of an eye, the object was gone. I returned home and noted the time was 10:20 pm.  I decided to review the video footage we had both captured on our cell phones and was shocked to see what we were looking at.  I have never had a personal experience with “U.F.O.” before today, but after seeing this footage I believe the anomaly I have captured warrants further discussion/review with people who have more familiarity with this subject matter.  I look forward to speaking further with someone from your organization.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

At first I didn’t pay attention to the two pictures until later when I checked the location of the barn. It was then that the distance picture shows a bright light just above the lower branch on the left side of the tree in the picture. The second picture was when the cloud came closer and I took the picture again of what I thought was a small cloud. Later when I looked at the picture, I enlarged it on the cell and saw this round object with lights around the circumference of the object and at the bottom center was a large yellowish light. It was not as bright as in the first distant picture. You may be able to judge the distance of the UFO by seeing hawks flying in the distance.

So looking up at the moon and also scanning the western sky just for the heck of it-  I happened to see what I at first thought was a passenger plane.  I watched it for a second and thought it was interesting because I could not distinguish any flashing from the aviation lights.  It also seemed to be travelling about double speed from a standard plane at cruising altitude.  Even with that I just kept looking around at the stars and didn’t really think anything was that abnormal.  Then, I noticed another one following the first light – in the exact same path and exact same speed.  There was a good distance between them.  At this point I had been staring up approximately 30 seconds. By the time the first light went out of view to my left (behind some large ! trees in our yard) I could see a third light coming into view from my right.  Same path- same speed- same distance apart- same light brightness (about the same brightness as a medium star).  So in my viewing field of the sky, I could see 3 of these lights at one time…..like a train here came two more and decided to run in the house to get the wife .  She came out and was able to see the last 3 as the came by.  The last one we watched as it was almost out of view to our left, my wife said it just vanished.  I myself did not see it go out as I was looking to see if there were more coming.  I could have sworn I saw a steak of light from that direction also.

When I took my eye away from the scope I could not see it. I watched it drop toward the horizon for about 10 seconds. It was highly reflective. I tried to readjust my scope and then lost it.

I have been skydiving before and I cannot believe that someone could have been skydiving at such a high altitude.  Another reason that I thought it was not a skydiver was how reflective it was. I have watched skydivers many times where they jump from the Ogden –Hinckley Airport and this was something very different. The object did float downward as if it was connected to a parachute, but that was the only similarity. I do not know what it was but it was very strange.

My dog was sitting on the couch staring directly at the light the entire time we were.

My wife and I viewed it together. There was variable cloud cover, which apparently made for good conditions for a sundog to form. I took two electronic photos with my iPhone (4G LTE, Verizon) just to casually document the sundog and did not look at my photos until the next day.  Of course, I was surprised to see a luminous blue-green object in each of the photos. The camera date/time feature on the camera recorded April 7, 7:02 p.m.  My guess is that the photos were snapped between ten and 30 seconds apart. Oddly, neither my wife nor I recall seeing the luminous object(s) with a naked eye while looking at the sundog—but the camera did!  Photo one: taken through the living room window with part of the deck table visible. I cannot tell exactly where the object is relative to the white fence.  It could be closer or a bit further way.  The  distance from the window to the fence was measured with a tape to be roughly 176 feet. The height of the fence is 5’8” top edge to bottom edge, and the top edge maintains about 5’10” above the ground. The approximate vertical displacement from the floor inside the house to the ground is about 28 inches. There is a stream about four feet wide between the lawn and the taller vegetation but is not discernable in the photos.  Photo two: taken from the deck.  A rough measurement from my approximate position on the deck to where the object appears to be in the photo is 73 feet. The deck is 15 inches above the ground. Zoom in on the photo two object: it seems to be in the process of forming or disintegrating.  It seems to have a different configuration than in photo one. Note the “aura” in photo two. If the object(s) are one and the same in both photos, then it moved about 100 feet closer to me in the 10-30 seconds between photos.  Was it aware of my wife and me?  How long was the object around? What was it doing?  Why were we unaware of it and not seeing it with a naked eye?  This was not the first time that an unidentified object has appeared with a sundog photograph from our house.  One appeared in a photo taken just after sunrise in early March 2019, with unseasonably cold, sub-zero temperatures outside.  The object appeared as a planet-like figure to the right of the sundog in the distance, much smaller than the Moon. If you are interested, I could send you a photograph of this one also.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,45.70981012145749,-111.05357489878543

It was about 150 -200 feet above the treetops and moving very slowly to the South and it slowed down  and changed height before quickly taking off at high rate of speed to the east.  The lights were very defined on all three points and blinked in unison with each other but also had steady lights also on the three points.

I took my sunglasses off to try and focus, they were glimmering bright like the sun shining on stainless steel and appeared circular disk shaped with a raised portion in the middle maybe equalling about half the total diameter, I can only guess at this because the brightness was different in the middle. The objects were also large, probably over 50 feet in diameter and their distance apart appeared equal to their distance above the ground. As I observed, I also saw what I believed was a local Coast Guard (large red aircraft) surveillance rescue aircraft coming from the south hearing directly towards the craft at a slightly higher elevation.  It appeared to fly between the objects. As the aircraft came closed the objects didn't move, it appeared they faded, the glimmering became less and less to dim shapes and then nothing, just the blue sky and cloud behind.  It almost looked like they became cloaked with the background sky. Please note, the sun was behind me as I was travelling, possibly accounting for the glimmering on the craft, also I was not looking directly at or at and angle into the sun.  I don't know what I saw, but don't think it was a trick of my eyes and the sun.

I figured maybe it was a satellite or a military jet super high up till I seen it completely change course of direction( it was going East and went north in a flash) so I brought the dog inside went in my hunting gear and got my binoculars and came back outside thinking I’m crazy and seeing stuff.  I set up on the hood of my truck and waited a few minutes and out came another from the same direction going east so I pull my binoculars up to my face and watched.  It moved quick I watched it for a few seconds and it disappeared.  Then out came another then another same distance apart then disappearing.  I watched it happen at least 10 times but they all went straight and just disappeared. Went inside came out around 11 pm and seen one more this time it was headed south coming from the north.

After around 30 minutes, the lights made a loud, explosive sound similar to a rocket-like noise.  Then, they disappeared.  The lights were not head to tail, but exactly vertical.  The exact distance from our location is impossible to determine, but it was somewhere between the center-west of São Paulo in the northern direction of São Paulo, possibly the city centre.

Now this is the 2nd time, exactly 2 weeks from the last encounter, in the exact same area and around the exact same time, but first sighting lasted 5 1/2hrs.  Now this object, on separate encounters, was exactly the same shape and size.  A large chrome half dome object with 5 lights dangling underneath it on separate tentacles and different lengths.  It was accompanied by 2 smaller ones that were orbiting it and dancing around.  The 1st encounter, which lasted roughly 6 hours, I wanted to use a lazer pointer to get it's attention, but I only had a L.E.D. headlamp.  So I focused the beam and I 2-3-2 at it and it started to, I guess you can it sorta acknowledged us.  Where we were, saw, doing and witnessing I told my buddy that no one will believe us.  Exactly 2 weeks later, same time and same area, my girlfriend and I were enjoying the night, when I looked out the window and got startled and said to my girlfriend ""  They came back!  They came back!  They're here! I knew they would come back!!"" She started yelling "" Who came back???"" I told her to look and look she did. The expression on her face was priceless. I told her "" See??! You and my mom think I'm fucking crazy, well is that crazy??"" She didn't know what to say but she was in awww. This time I came equipped with a 632nm Lazer pointer and 3500luemen L.E.D. tact. light. So I 2-3-2 at it and it stayed hovering above us after about an hour we left for my house and hoping that it followed. Arriving out front of my house, looked up and to my hoping, there it was.  It followed us and hovered about 1/2- 3/4 miles directly above us. 1 thing I can tell you that don't try to use a telescope in hurry to zoom in on an object.  It don't work to the way you need it to.  I would've written everything to detail but I'm too lazy to and don't have the patience either, but I can tell you 1 thing tho.  It was real and what the media is saying it's a satellite? Bullshit! Satellites can't defy gravity.  No propeller motion and certainly not exhaust because exhaust mean! s thrust This was silent and hovering. Nada can blow smoke up your ass but not mine, it's common sense.

I express how is that possible too many one after another and no sound.  I have heard planes flying greater heights many times before and i can clearly hear engine roaring.  This group of objects make any sound. He left but i continued to keep watching, when i notice approximately another 5 behind the 15 - 16 except 1 object flow in a different direction north west same speed. The others were going the same speed same distance apart all the same size heading from south towards north east. I started thinking they possibly maybe be satell! ites. But i started feeling scared at that point and went inside.  After 20 minutes or so i was curious if the objects were still visible.  Unfortunately the sky was brighter and could see any more lights or objects.  Hopefully others witness this event this morning.

There I was going outside for a smoke when out of the corner of my eye I see what looks like a plane flying overhead with the flashing lights until a second later I see another one... and another... and another!  For 30 minutes solid the strange flashing lights flew overhead in a single file line formation from over the pacific ocean, heading from the west to the east inland, without a single sound.  I thought I was going crazy so I went inside, woke my mom up, and got her mobile phone from her to take a short video and to make sure I wasn't going crazy. Not even she had seen anything like this before.  There were many flashing lights following very closely to the single file line formation, clearly going in the same direction, almost as if it was an inexperienced pilot going off the directed flight path. 2 even crossed paths, not colliding, but clearly still traveling in the same direction. The only answer anyone could give me on the internet were Elon's Starlink schedule but after watching a video of Elon's Starlink schedule and view I can say with confidence that it wasn't a group of satellites orbiting in a single file line formation for 30 minutes straight. I've never seen anything like this before in all my almost 30 years of living.  There were so many flashing lights flying overhead that my mom couldn't tell they were flashing until after she'd completely woken up and watched the small video I captured while watching later that morning. She thinks it was a military exercise but I've never seen nor heard of a military exercise being conducted in such a plainly obvious formation. These flashing lights moved way too fast to be satellites in visible orbit. They were almost all in sync aside from the randoms me and my mom spotted flying in close proximity to the others traveling from the west to the east. These flashing lights went on so long that they were still visible as the sun peaked and started hiding the night sky.

We are currently under ""Shelter in Place"" order from gov due to pandemic.  Weather conditions were cold 32 degrees, cloudy skies, with consistent winds from NW direction at 12mph with gusts higher. I decided to take a back route home that takes me off primary highway 10, most direct.  My detour has me now heading due North through farm country.  No traffic etc.  As I come around a corner I see a very dull bluish white light high up in the sky, low enough in the clouds that whatever was illuminated was also lighting up the clouds around it.  Was similar to clouds passing in front of the moon only much smaller and dimmer. I took note but really paid no attention until a few minutes later it was now below the clouds. It looked like a big bright whitish orange orb. Honestly if it wasn't cloudy out I wouldn't of thought it was anything other than a planet or bright star. Seeing this really got me curious. I drove a few miles to an area I could safely pull over at and turned off the car. I watched this thing for about 5 minutes and it didn't ever seem to move. Brightness would change slightly but if you weren't paying attention you'd miss it. It seemed so ""normal"" I  had to try understanding what was looking at. Took out StarWalk 2 app on phone, nope no star or planet in that direction. Plus, there were no other stars visible as skies still cloudy. I checked a fight traffic map, no current flights anywhere close to my location. This pandemic has basically eliminated all air traffic in my area. There was no sound at all. It really didn't appear initially to be moving. I  decided to drive towards it to get better visual evidence. That's when I really couldn't make sense of it. I took first left available that would bring me headed West, the general direction I initially saw it. Heading west I could still see the object clearly but it was starting to look like it was getting farther away from. I pulled over again, got back out, still no crazy movements. It looked still but I was now 10 miles farther west and still didn't seem any closer. Took first video there. I went full on Chase mode, just trying to figure out what this was.  Drove another 5 miles NW to a gas station where in took second video trying to decide if this thing was slowly moving west or was I just in need of solid rest. It still looked like a bright star but was getting closer and closer to the horizon and tree line. I followed this object as far as I could west, out of the city lines and into an empty vastness of farm land between tree lined hills. I got about 25 miles and it just seemed to slowly get farther and farther away. Harder in tried ""catching up"" to it the more it seemed to elude me. When I pulled over to record and observe it would just sit there. I sat out of car for almost 10 minutes thinking it would fade off into distance but didnt. That kept making me feel like getting back in pursuit would bring me closer for better visual. It never did. After one hour and 20 minutes of following this light, it fell behind a distant tree line. Throughout entire experience the only observable changes I can describe would be that it started out bluish white, relatively dim, and scattered (meaning it appeared like ambient lighting in clouds).

There was no noise which would be expected from a motorized aircraft. I then noticed six evenly spaced lights about 20-30 miles north of our house.

If I am facing north, to my left, about 7 miles away are the mountains containing Lake Berryessa. Because the ground is flat, to my right I can see all the way to Sacramento, thirty or so miles away.  At night I can see sky scrapers. Where I am, in the sticks, is mostly void of city light.  Also have you ever gone camping, away from the city, to where the sky is fuller of stars than you’ve ever seen? Have you ever spotted a satellite flying over you, on its singular strait pathed orbit? Or perhaps the international space station? It has a different path and is faster and brighter than satellites. The only reason you see the satellite, is because the sunlight is reflecting from the sun, off of them to you.  And on its path, if it happens to duck behind the earth as you’re watching it.  Shows the sunlight slowly start to fade as it does. Otherwise you can watch satellites travel their path for many many miles until they become dim from the curvature of the earth.  They absolutely look like one solid point of light just like the surrounding stars.  Get stars kind of have a slight red blue flicker to them if you really concentrate on them.  I’ve also spotted what seems to be a high-altitude jet that must be secret, really high up in the stratosphere, yet leaving the usual ice trail that any regular jet would leave.  I am a skydiver.  I live on an airport. I grew up next to an airport. I was a ship look out in the Coast Guard. If I don’t know about anything else, I should at least be able to spot a craft in the air, on the land or sea. And be able to hypothesize as to what it is.)  It was 4 am. I walked out my door facing east. Out of the corner of my left eye, my attention was brought to a satellite looking type of light. But if was almost at a fourth five degree angle from me. I turned to loo at it. It was not an aircraft. It was not blinking. It had no running lights. It was as if I was looking up in the sky and spotting a satellite way up above our atmosphere. Yet, this thing had to be about a mile away from me, at 20,000 to 30,000 ft. It was heading towards my right, with is a path towards Sacramento.  (Interesting fact. At night, during normal not virus. You can watch the commercial jets flying in and out of the Sacramento airport in the way of my view of the city. All day, all night. Difference with this night. We are all coincidentally all stuck at home. No jets. No one getting up to go to work. No one to see what I was seeing.)  As this thing passed me, I realize it’s being followed by another one, about a mile to three miles behind it.  Same path. Same speed, which is under a hundred casual. As that one passed my position, another one behind that. Now I’m watching seven, eight, nine go passed. One of them was different. The only one out of the entire night. It was spinning in a different direction than the path it was on with its buddies. The side I was looking at, was just as bright as the rest. But once it spun its other side around. It was as bright as a strobe. Not strobing, solid light. Nothing about these things were blinking. Just a bright period floating by.  At one point a second path was formed, to the side of the original path and light points. It was closer to me, and started a pattern of the same spaces light sources, but staggered from them. Now they were coming in bulk. Same configuration, but continuous. After about ten minutes, I counted fifty of these things before running back in for my iPhone. When I came back out, I had lost count. But they just kept coming. I’m in the parking lot trying to take pictures of them, but the light is too low for the phone. I start trying to call people in my area. No one picks up, other than the owner of the property I’m on. I tell him to go out and look at these things. I explain to him what to look for and he goes.  These things were coming from what my perspective saw as the bottom half star of the Big Dipper. At four in the morning, if I’m looking north, the Big Dipper is to my north west. The handle is sticking strait up, ladles open in facing right to the north. The handle would be positioned over what I’d say is in the direction of Calistoga. If you follow that path, it probably brings you to the ocean after Jenner going north, and fort brag. All Mendocino county. Forrest and open land forever. No one but sleeping farmers to see. The path to my right takes them south past Lake Tahoe. If you follow that path. Well. Area 51.  Over the the hour that I was out there watching. They must have realized the path they took was a bit close to sac, and too close to the ground. Because by the time the end was wrapping up, their path had gained altitude, and had corrected more south heading towards Lodi (south, the direction of the moon and Jupiter/mars). That was taking them right over my head! about a mile up. I took a picture of the last two that were together, but with an iPhone it’s garbage.   I watched this go on for more than an hour, and had watched more than a hundred go past. When I was able to get my landlord up, he text me about ten minutes later and said he saw what I was seeing. By then, it died down to just about one a minute. They were still coming in when dawn broke and I could hardly see them anymore. So I went back to bed. The next morning I woke up at four, just to see if I could spot anything. I was out there for ten minutes. I spotted three. This morning I tried again. I stood out for about twenty minutes. And did spot two. But everything was so overcast. It could have been anything.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,38.485225,-121.64357625

Possible visible temperature of ion propulsion system, or some warp drive system. The travelled exreamly fast, maybe 5 seconds from horizon to horizon. The seemed to fly straight but also a sort of jerky motion noticeable over the distance it travelled. After it had passed we had no time to really have it sink in when from the same direction came what appeared to be a squadron of 8-10 pointy ships travelling in the same kind of glowing plasma bubble around all of them, followed about 10 min later by even another! larger grouping of pointy ships, same fuzzy plasma bubble, same direction and, same incredible speed with the same smooth but jerky motion. Everything appeared white in colours with the odd shade of green and yellow on the 2 larger ships. About a half hour later, the 2 larger ships, travelling from North to South now, same incredible speed and again together in the same fuzzy ion bubble. That was not all for the evening..... we saw 2 streams of the new satellite streams, going different directions and other normal satellite activity. One of the satellite in a line got incredibly, bright...diffrent from a normal sun reflection. We did get to see 2 meteors from the meteor shower zip by but they too.

I slept through Geometry in High School so please give me a break here. It literally went in a straight horizontal line from my view.  The orb was bright white in color. I only saw one orb. I would consider it was oval or a full circle filled in bright white. It left a very very visible bright white trail behind it almost like seeing a comet trail. It then was gone. Vanished.  My best explanation is that it did not gain altitude while traveling nor did it drop in altitude (to best explain the angle of its travel).

It looked like an airplane slowing for a landing. I soon realize the object had no tail, it was just a cylinder shape that was tapered slightly at the ends. The object was moving west to east, and was 15 seconds or so in front of me. It was Low I could see it clearly in the day light and had contrast with the Mountians in the back ground.  The color was not shiny but a dull gray that reflected the sun just a little. I continue to watch the cylinder object to see if it could be an airplane. Did it have wings I asked? The object began to turn towards me. I saw no wings. I saw a small soft white light. I thought that the light could be the headlight.  As the object continue to turn towards me the light grew in size. Eventually the light engulfed the entire diameter of the aircraft. Then “blink” the light turned off and they was is no object or light. At this time I was at mile marker 247. Less then a minute is how long it lasted 2 miles @ 65mph. I knew at mile 248 there was a brake check area. I stopped at the brake check area got out my binoculars and got out of my truck. I began to search the skies for object or aircraft. I saw no aircraft in the sky or the object. Payson Arizona is a small town at elevation of 5000 feet it is a mountainous Arizona terrain. I estimate that the object was the same size as a submarine, smaller than the USS Ohio. Aircraft this large would never land in Payson. Nor could it have landed in that terrain.

I said ""get theres that light that i guess is a planet (laughing because I got called crazy for saying it was a if I watching the area) and i looked away for about 5 seconds after saying.this to my fiance and he said yes I see it. But as we looked back 5 seconds later we both notice it was gobe. This was very big and white light so bright youd swear it wasa planet. And then boom. Gone. As we are looking for it wondering how it just dissapeared...it came back in a very slighlty different spot to thw right. No colors flashing. It disnt really twinkle or flash. Then it got super dim amd looked like a pin for light like a no! rmal star. Then itd get brighter and dim again but more frequently but still slow enough there was no fast flash in between. Then we noticed very far away was two more but these two were grouped together and seemed to be communicating with flashes. No other colored lights. Just super white. As we looked back to the original main huge dimming light we notice it was going up and very far away to where we couldnt see it no more. It made motions the whole time that i call swimming in the sky.

There were no house lights on in our house or on the outside of our house. It was dark. However, our neighbors all had yard lights and outside house lights on. Our big dog was in the house with me.

The light started on the west side at the small cattle shed and east to about 50 feet into our neighbor’s pasture.  The band width of light on the south side began in the middle of the pasture and stopped about 500 feet from our house.

Possible large craft sighting. I woke up at approximately 4:30 am on April 19, 2020. I was staying with my family in rural, Alberta approx. 50km south of Camrose. I decided to look at the stars while I was up. I looked into the southeast sky. In the sky, quite high up, I noticed a light. It looked about the same size, shape, and colour, of a typical star—small and white. It was travelling in a smooth, gentle arc to the east. Behind this light was another light, following maybe 4 seconds behind. This second light followed the first taking the exact same trajectory and maintaining the exact same speed. A third light then followed.  At this point I left the window to wake up my father. When I returned to the window, small lights were still travelling in the same manner, making no deviations to speed or trajectory. I counted at least 12 lights. The lights all came into my view, or materialized, at the same point in the sky and then passed out of my view. I only saw three of these small lights in the sky at any given time before the east most light left my field of vision. The lights gave off no noise and all travelled in the same, perfect, trajectory at the same speed. This uniformity seems impossible to have been obtained by human aircraft. Additionally, travelling restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 crisis make so many planes travelling at once unlikely.  When the last travelling light left my view, I noticed three lights in the sky where the travelling lights had materialized. The two lights closer to the horizon moved erratically towards and away from each other in jerking motions entirely different from the smooth movements of the travelling lights. The third light, which formed an approximate equilateral triangle with the two lights below it, occasionally moved but primarily stayed stationary and blinked in no specific pattern  After watching these lights for a few minutes, I observed a large object travelling through the sky. I believe it also materialized from the same point in the sky as the others. This object had three large yellow lights on it’s bottom and flew from higher up in the sky to just above the tree line before leaving my sight. The object flew silently.  The next morning I google searched UFO sightings in Alberta and noticed a report on the National UFO reporting centre from an engineer in his 50’s living near Calgary, Alberta. This individual, 2 months earlier, appears to have witnessed travelling lights similar to, if not exactly the same as, the travelling lights I observed. He was able to ascertain, through his work, that no satellites were present at the location of his sighting.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,,

I was taking my dog on a walk and as I was walking right past Long Lake in Lake Orion Michigan. I noticed a bunch of flying objects all in sync with each other coming from the middle of the lake going north.  Every time one would disappear to the northside one more would appear above the middle of the Lake. It was/is a very clear sky out and you could see every single star so I know it wasn’t any stars.  There has been a planet out lately that you can see that is the brightest star in the sky and it wasn’t that at all.  I kept looking to see where they were appearing from all of these star looking objects and they just kept appearing out of literally nothing. Just out of the middle of nowhere they just kept appearing and none of the stars around it were moving or anything except these UFO objects.  That were all in sink moving with each other one right after another  After about 10 minutes of standing there next to the lake at the boat launch I decided to start walking back home because I was getting scared. I wasn’t sure what was going to happen.  Every so often I would look up in the star sky and it was still there happening every single time and then probably about 15 minutes later I got home and I could still see the UFO lights looking things doing the same thing over and over again.  I came in the house and got my Dad to come out and see them and we walked outside and they were gone.,2020-06-25T00:00:00,42.75110163934426,-83.27271393442624

First was for Reddit.  -I have told the story SEVERAL times by voice, phone, in person. It has never once changed. I have (during C-VID 19 Lockdown in Chicago) ALMOST convinced myself i didn't see it. But i did.  I was coming home from my parents in the suburbs.  Heading to my place in Chicago where i live.  It was POURING rain the entire 40 minute drive. It suddenly stopped, still bad conditions while i approached o'hare airport. I believe there is an underpass from i90 where ohare is literally above me on the bridge… As i exit this bridge right next to o'hare… i see the.most.beautiful. Shooting star i’ve eve imagined existed. (this is the first millisecond of time broken down) I saw this bright bright light shoot out of my vision. As this millisecond comes to a close, i realize that i saw this light fly AWAY from me. I am a mechanical engineer, i know my coordinate systems extremely well. I can tell you this light traveled up, and away from me (North East Direction). The next slight millisecond of time consisted in me understanding all the sudden that this was NOT a shooting star. It was pouring rain not 5 minutes ago. I look up, the entire sky is covered with rain clouds. They are so presumptuous that they look like their 50 feet above my vehicle. This “shooting star” that i saw i realized left my plane of vision up and away and i still see where it went: a PERFECT horizontal break in the huge rain clouds. This all takes place out of the underpass of o'hare airport. After realizing this light just escaped through that cover, the next millisecond in time is butterflies in my stomach. Because the light i just saw couldn't have been a shooting star given the cloud cover. I realize that i also saw the lights TURN INTO ONE LIGHT. From the close, o'hare type location i first saw it, i saw there were in fact 3 lights and during their exit it formed to one. The butterflies progress. Another millisecond goes by; and i realize the lights are longgg gone. All the sudden my focus comes back, and i see two GIANT jumbo jets flying synchronized, in same exact direction, same exact plane of height of ground that the angle of the lights flew. These planes, giant aircrafts are moving fast i’m sure. But they're moving from my dumb perception slowly as they glide from a take off out of ohare. I line these up in my geometric mind; and i notice they are at the same plane the lights were, and the lights were PERFECTLY CENTERED in between these two flashing airplanes. As if the airplanes perfectly catapulted the lights. Or guided? Or Followed? Around this time i also noticed street lights separating east and west i-90 FLICKERED. Like a perfect trail in direction of that light… Also during this time it hits me of what i just saw. My next move is to call my father. He is a wise realistic man. Straight shooter but absolutely believes in UFO’s. I call him tell him the EXACT description and words i just used to explain this. The very absolute second my story comes to an obvious end. We both hear, a click click clunk and the call drops from us. I call back, thinking perhaps he was messing with me? He thought the same of me. He rushes me off the phone and goes to bed (10:15 ish Pm) He is never like that he was very skeptical.  I think i was confirmed sighting, and they used my phone call as aid in their research whatever is going on. Since this i have just today posted on another website, and all the sudden today there is our USA govt. Releasing old footage of UFOs normalizing them? So now any local stories are blocked by CNN and CBS mentioning the pentagon releasing UFO videos. Also After my sighting 4.20.20 there was a METEOR SHOWER the next day. NIce odds right?

The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes before it dissipated. Scene Summary:  The object was viewed from the backyard of my residence located in Seabrook, Texas.  The object appeared in the northern sky, approximately 45 degrees above the horizon.  There were scattered Altocumulus clouds that appeared to be traveling from WNW to ESE.  Temperatures were warm.  The object appeared much like a comet - With a bright ""head"" and a ""tail"", with the head on the bottom, and the tail oriented at a 90 degree angle to the horizon.  The object was pinkish orange. Details: My wife and I observed what appeared to be a fire in the sky for approximately 15 minutes.  We observed the object for several seconds before it completely disappeared. It illuminated again a few seconds later, much brighter than before. The object remained stationary in the sky. After approximately 8 minutes, the object brightened again and appeared to elongate. While observing the object, I phoned my mother, who lives approximately a mile from my house. She went outside and also observed the object. After approximately 15 minutes, the object disappeared. My wife recorded approximately 14.5 minutes of very good video of the object. End Report.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,29.5813,-95.0273

They looked like part of the star scape, but I felt they looked odd based off their formation and distance to one another. Visually they appeared to be in proximity of being over the unincorporated part of Riverside and the Lake Matthews area. Going back to factors that caused my attention, were that the 3 lights or star like ! lights, were equal distance to each other, but not that far apart for being stars. The 3 lights appeared to be part of the star scape at first glance. The lights were not only equal distance in width, but also on the same plane horizontally. That is probably what stood out to me most. They looked like 3 separate stars but strangely on the same plane. I asked my adult son to come outside and told him and pointed out, those 3 stars are never in the sky (as I look daily). We watched for 10 minutes. Nothing changed. I thought “okay” maybe they are stars and for whatever reason they are visible today and were not visible to me in the past. This was about 8pm “ish” at night. I then went inside. I came back out at about 830pm just to check on the 3 lights again. The 3 lights that had appeared to be stars, were now gone. All the other stars in the sky were still visible as normal, but the 3 star like lights had completely vanished. There was no change in weather etc. in that span o! f time.

It appeared to move like a stingray in water but without the large motion sweep of its wings. It was obviously not a bird or any other flying animal.

On April 25th, 2020, I was on my porch facing west admiring the sunset at 8:27pm.  I noticed approximately 45 degrees above the Olympics and perhaps about 1 mile or so away (from my vantage point) a flashing light.  The light was white and flashed every second with a 2 flash burst approximately every 5 seconds or so. At first I just assumed it was a civilian aircraft headed in my direction but it was stationary.  I then assumed it was a helicopter.  But the light didn't seem to match any civilian navigation lighting pattern I was familiar with.  So I went inside and grabbed my binoculars.  With the binoculars I could just vaguely make out a cylindrical black object.  No tail or wing structure that I could discern. After a couple of minutes a civilian airplane came into view and when it did, this object started moving in a fairly quick pace to the North, and then switched course and started moving to the south.  It was still plainly in view this entire time.  At around 8:33pm this object suddenly moved very rapidly downward or at least out of my view and below the tree line where I lost all visual contact.  The flashing white light was no longer there, simply a small red light as it made its way out of view. I am a huge aviation buff and can recognize numerous commercial and civil aircraft.  This was none of those.  This was a true UFO.  It was Unidentified, Flying and some sort of physical Object.  It's possible (I cannot rule it out) it was a drone but I don't get that feeling.

Fleet of lighted unidentified aircraft, traveling over Illinois (Peoria County) Saturday night, April 25th , 2020, (8 – 9 pm) Peoria County, Illinois, 2 hrs southwest of Chicago.

We were facing southwest when we saw the fleet of lighted aircraft appear in the sky. This is Covid 19 shelter in place now, reduced airplane traffic, so it was extremely odd to see this happening. Finishing up with some yard work after dark, I had looked up into the sky and saw the line of lighted objects that appeared to be rapidly shooting through the sky in single file formation, faster than any jet or rocket I’ve ever seen.  They were oblong shaped lighted craft, traveling close together, no noise, no exhaust, just light. They were flying in single file maintaining specific distance, some would speed up a little then slow down, although I did see two flying together side by side although still moving at the same speed and distance as the rest of the fleet. Watching them trail through the sky, then disappear, with the other crafts following in the same direction disappearing, simply blew my mind! They appeared rapidly, not like fading into view. I started counting them to myself, they were going so fast I lost track (maybe 50+). I alerted my husband to come outside to see what was happening. The event lasted a couple minutes longer, perhaps up to 100 craft total, and then they were gone. They just disappeared into the sky, just like they first appeared no trailing off into the distance, they were just gone, it was a clear night, we could see their lights very brightly. If I had to describe what it looked like, here it goes. You know the machines that continually shoot out tennis balls to a tennis player, or like a military semiautomatic shots being fired off.  The brightly lighted fleet looked like that, they looked to be on a mission. I’ve never seen anything like this! Thank you for reading my eye witness report.

As we were finishing up and getting ready to go in the house, I turned and saw a bright globular light in the SE part of the sky.  We live in the central part of a small city in Northern MN, so there is not much light pollution.  I immediately asked my wife -  do you see that light in the sky? because it was very noticeable.  It was orange in color, almost looked like a ball of fire, but very steady and bright.  The movement of the object in the sky was quite distinctive because at firs t I thought it might be a plane or helicopter…it’s speed was fairly similar to that of an airplane, but it made absolutely no noise.   At the point that I realized that it was not an airplane or any craft I was familiar with - in fact, I couldn’t see any real detail at all, other than it was globe-shaped and mostly a shiny orange color, with maybe some fluctuation in intensity.  I asked my wife if she was seeing this bright object too.  We both tracked it across the sky as it traveled NE to SW in a very straight line.  It did not turn or make any sudden moves, it moved quite steadily along a direct path.  It did not float or move erratically.  It was low enough that it was below the cloud deck, the sky was overcast.  I can’t say exactly the object’s  altitude was, other than it seemed to be about  what a  low-flying plane might be, but high enough in the sky to be close to the lower part of the cloud deck.  In fact, our house is under the main flight path of the airport for our small city, but the flight path is SE to NW, not NE to SW.  The light travelled above the house behind ours, still making no noise at all and clipping along at a steady pace. I tried to follow it further, but it disappeared from view.  My wife and I both saw this object and we both agreed that what we saw was not a plane.  My wife said she that at first she thought it was a planet, because the object was so bright.  We both saw that it was spherical in shape and mainly orange colored.   She also brought up the idea of it being a satellite, but we both agreed that this object was way too low to be a satellite in orbit around the earth.  I highly doubt that this was a StarLink satellite, and it was just the one object.  I’m a professional who works in academia and am not prone to seeing things that aren’t there.  My wife is also a very level-headed professional.  I was astounded by what I saw.  I’ve been reading about and researching UFO’s and wondering about what they might be for the last few years, but I’ve never seen anything like this.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,47.50319459459459,-94.68763918918918
