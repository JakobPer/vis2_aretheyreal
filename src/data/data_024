Driving South Bound on Dale Mabry Highway at 5:30 in the morning on my commute, I observed a diamond shaped object that seemd to have a distinct prismatic structure with pointed ends and was brightly illuminated. The structural detail, is what made it stand out from the garden variety landing lights of jets approaching the airport. If I recall,Tampas'airport does not begin flight operations until 6 or 6:30, realizing this, I realized I'm looking at something unusual. The object was the size quarter dollar held at arms length. I had ample opportunity to observe details as I was frequently stopping at intersections with my window rolled down staring at it (with my jaw hanging down). Object appeared to be about 5-7 miles to the left of my vehicle which would place it in a location to my east, between US Highway 41 and the campus of the University of South Florida. It seemed to be slowly drifting lateral to me. If it was as far east as Interstate 75, and the size it was to my naked eye,then this thing would have been really huge. If i had to estimate altitude, it appeared to be about 400-500 feet, but this is only a best guess. Object remained stationary, perhaps slowly drifting at times, and the intensity of its illumination changed every few seconds, i.e., dimmed and increased, in almost a blinking pattern.  2 (two) smaller orange-yellow orbs of light were ejected from the side of diamond shaped object and disappeared in a rapide downward motion. There may be possibility that this was a commerical blimp that may have been used in a recent Tampa Bay Buccaneers Football Game this month, but after it ejected the orbs of light, I quickly discounted that notion. I even considered a shuttle launch from Cape Canaveral, but I've observed many shuttle launches at night from our Gulf coast location and there was an absence of a large smoke plume illuminated by the engine nozzles and any distinct arc of movement. At the risk of diminishing any credibility this report may have,I prefer not to leave any contact infor! mation a t this time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Email report Received: March 15, 2003 Hello, I finally had a spare moment to find out who to tell about what I saw last December about a week and a half before Christmas. I live approx 17 Km north of Hazelton, B.C. And I was awakened by my dog barking by the south-facing glassdoor around 3:30am.  I took him out because he was going crazy.  I stood on the front porch and thought he had to do his duty.  Instead he stood by the bank barking into the sky.  I looked up more closely into the cold, clear, star-filled night. Then I saw a moving ""satellite"".  It was traveling over the town of Hazelton heading west.  It was red, with a blinking white light.  The blinking light was steady at first blink, blink, blink.  Then it got irratic right over Hazelton and would skip a blink or two. I decided to grab the binoculars, and it looked too close to be a regular ""satellite"", way up there as I have seen several times in the past. The time while I saw it throught the binoculars, it looked like a round ball or sphere and was predominantly a red glow about it.  And it appeared to have the white light blinking off to the side on the outside of the ""satellite"". After passing over to the west of Hazelton, it then hovered above what I think was Kispiox Village just north of Hazelton.  It is just 4 Km south of my porch view.  As it is a narrow valley, it then appeared to move up along the Hazelton Mountain and north along the western side of the Kispiox Valley finally passing along the Kispiox Mountain.  Then from my view it disappeared, behind the tall pines around the house. I really thought it could be any regular ""satellite"" at the time, whether it be Canadian or US due to the security concerns of the past year.  And it could have been on its way to Alaska?

Update for the Hazelton, B.C. -  17 Km north for December, 2002. Hello to you Brian, Thank you for your prompt reply.  When I reflect to that time of this sighting I would say that as the satellite appeared from behind nine mile mountain from Kispiox Valley, it was in front of Roche de Boule mountain with Hazelton down below.  It looked like it was flying due west.  There was no sound.  Then it made an L-shaped turn north where it looked like it slowed around Kispiox Village ( for maybe 30 seconds ) at which time I was seeing it through the binoculars. It was not that high up. And still no sound.  As soon as it was exactly west of me I watched with the eyes until it was behind the trees.  This was all within about 3-4 minutes total at the most. We have the jets going to Alaska around 11:30 am which are very high up. Also they come from the southeast and go right over the house here and leave the Kispiox Valley heading in a northwestern straight line. So that is why I thought maybe a satellite because of its unusual flight pattern, almost as thought it was going to Terrace, then decided to head up the Kispiox Valley on the western side of the valley. I appreciate your interest in this matter.

This event happend one night while i was with my friend's little brother at a friend of his house. We were outside (Me,my friend and his friend) and we had opened up a camper and got power going to it so we could listen to the radio and turn the lights on,they did that while i built a fire. We had been standing outside for about 30 min when i saw something in the sky about 3 miles away. When i saw it the craft seemed to be comeing down and was glowing bright red as if it were hot. My friend told me that it was common to see such things in the sky about that time and that it was ""Nothing New"" to them. At that point my friends friend which to be blunt was a retard decided to pick up a spot light connected to the campers power supply and flash the thing four or five times. After he did that the craft stoped glowing and looked JUST like a star,he flashed it again a few times. At that point the craft started to move over to where we were with great speed. The first thought that came into my mind wasent a good one and what my friends friend had done was a very bad thing. Being 17 and them 12 left me in control to take some kind of action and ideas for escape or hideing started to flow into my mind. One thought was that maybe their tracking systems (Advanced of course) used heat,not the fact we had a huge fire going.As the object got closer i moved us to a tree were we hid around it as the craft approached. This was from the idea that maybe trees take in body heat and that it was rather cold outside. So here we are huddled up around a tree trying to hide from this thing. As it came right over us the dogs nearby stoped barking and the radio staion changed along with the lights blinking. What i heard on the radio scared me the most. It sounded like talking but not anything we know on our planet. The thing as i said was right over us and almost appeared to be confused(like it was looking for us). it moved around the tree about mile or so above it and we moved with it to try to stay out of its sight. I could see ! it very clearly. It was triangle shaped with 3 lights on the edges of it. it hovered over us for about 15 min before the sounds comeing in on the radio changed and sounded like ones you would hear from a Air Force dispatch. It was hard to make out as it sounded like the person talking was rushing. At that time (and this is what got my eye) the craft seemed to tilt up a little and three blue like rings went over the surface and it shot out to space at a a VERY fast speed. A few mins later jets and bigger planes littered the sky. Call me crazy but i get ""Feelings"" about things. things i read or see and i got a spine chilling one from that craft as if it were comeing to get us. when we went back in the camper the radio which was not digital (old turn knobs)staion had been changed and the knob was clear across the dial. Also things that hadent been on such as lights, a stove and a cooler which none of had been on were. I would say over all...i would rate that 10.0 on my weird ((deleted))-o-meter.

I was sitting in the playground in front of my apartment about 3:00 one August afternoon, while two of my children played with several neighbor children on the playground. Several adults were there, including the supervisor of the apartment complex and a contractor, who were working on plans for redesigning the playground. I called the children's attention to what I thought were parachuters coming down. The adults heard me and also watched the objects. This event was unusual in itself because there was no airport nearby and the terrain was a river valley surrounded by wooded hills. There were 4 white shapes moving in a downward, irregular, floating pattern.  There were several jets passing by very high in the sky at the time. We lived in a busy flight path area, with jets passing overhead very high, very frequently.  At the time I thought that these ""parachuters"" had come from one of these very high jets. Another thing that struck me as very unusual, because I thought parachuters leapt from airplanes, not jets. The jets were too high to see clearly, but the jet trails were clearly visible.  As we watched for several minutes, waiting to see where they might land, I thought that the behavior of these ""parachuters"" was unusual. First, the area I lived in was heavily forested and sparsely populated, so nearby landing areas were not numerous. But then as we continued to watch, some of the objects stopped descending. This in itself could have been explained by the use of what I refer to as ""half parachutes"", the type used for stunt skydiving, but they seemed to hang in the air longer than you would expect, even of those types of parachutes.  The kids lost interest after a few minutes and went back to playing. I kept observing the objects, because I was struck by what I saw as inconsistencies in the behavior of these things. As I observed the objects seemed to change shape. When they were higher up, it seemed the motion was of a ""half parachute"" with someone swinging on the end of the ropes and causing the parachute to move in irregular motion. As the objects descended lower, they looked more like huge white balloon type objects, changing shape, and moving as though tumbling end over end as we watched. As though they were not completely filled and something was moving about inside the objects.  At first all the objects could be seen together, but as they descended, they spread out to different areas of the sky.  When I saw that these objects were clearly not parachutes, I though they might be balloons. But the ""balloons"" changed shape and were too big for regular helium balloons. And they did not act like you would expect from balloons that everyone has seen let loose by kids and soaring off out of sight. These ""balloony things"" clearly did not act like that. First they came down from very high and then stopped and some started moving up. One  drifted over under one of the puffy low clouds, and one went behind one and disappeared, then reappeared drifting off to the north, another went near a different cloud and stayed under it as the cloud slowly drifted to the south.  The last object drifted off to the south. By this time I thought we were seeing some kind of UFO and called the attention of the adults and children to look up in the sky at the ""UFO's"". As I was watching them, I saw about 25 white dots that came out of an area of the sky high above us radiating out in straight lines from a center area and I yelled out, look there's more! Several people looked up as these objects then started disappearing and moving erratically back up into the sky, but I was convinced we were seeing something unusual. All of these that had appeared later soon! could no longer be seen. I watched one of the lower ones that had been there before the appearance of the others, drift over the top of the roof of the apartment, so I went in the backyard to see where it went.  It was just a round sort of shiny looking balloon like thing hanging in the air and moving slowly to the south. I called one of my children outside to look at it.  As it slowly drifted further away, it started looking more like a star,  shining brightly in the daytime and we both watched it until it moved out of our view over the treetops. The whole duration of this ""sighting"" was about twenty minutes or more by numerous adults and children. Nothing was reported on the local news that day of anything unusual.

I noticed a yellow-orange light raise up over the mountains behind our apartment (Eagle Trace Apartments) and then just hover there. I was joking aroung about it being a UFO when all of a sudden 5 more came up to the same level one after another and spaced about an 1/8th of a mile apart all of them were evenly spaced and at the same altitude, about 100 ft. above the mountain. We lived right across the street from Nellis AFB and we could hear planes taking off. We thought they were just going out to the range but instead they headed twords the mountain. We thought ,ok they were just flares even though they were not over the range and this is when the lights faded to very pale blue lights and were much smaller in size, almost too small to even see unless you knew they were there. I dont think the objects got smaller. I think it was just the intnsity of the lights was far less. But anyway, as the jets, F-16's I'm pretty sure, got closer towards the lights, the lights went from hovering to heading left twords downtown Las Vegas at a high rate of speed. Eventualy we couldnt see the lights anymore because of the city lights but we could see the jets for a while. It was really weird. Another thing that has nothing to do with this night but I have always noticed about this mountain. This is the mountain right behind Las vegas Speedway. During certain times throughout the year there is something very shiny reflecting the sun on top of the highest peak on the far left of this mountain. I didnt see any antennas or anything up there. I used to notice it when I would come home from work at Nellis. Always wondered what it was, still dont know ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A train was directly East of us and we had been watching it for a number of minutes because between the almost full moon above it-it was quite beautiful-and not much else to look at in the Arizona desert at night on a long drive. The reason it probably caught our attention was because it was so very very strange and large-larger then the moon is size in the sky.  But what was so incomprehensible is that it appeared like someone or something had simply ripped open a whole in the dark sky leaving a huge opaque white diamond shape, then in just a few seconds-just enough to comprehend somewhat what we were looking at-it slowly but perfectly evenly from the top down disappeared!  It did not fade out-nor just ""turn off it's light-because it didn't glow, but more like something rolling back up perfectly.  I did not write this report before-because it didn't appear to be a flying saucer or anything of the more common UFO shapes, and didn't know if it would fit here.  It had perfectly straight edges-no variance in color or intensity of color and only white.It also did not appear to be 3-D.

When we first noticed the ""cloud,"" it looked to be only a hundred meters off the ground and less than one hundred fifty meters from our position, in the car. I stopped the car and got out of the vehicle to take a photo of whatever the black object was and by the time I snapped the photo (twelve seconds after our initial look at the thing) the black anomaly was approximately four hundred meters away. I then re-entered the car and looked to see where this black object had gone. It was nowhere to be seen! (Only six seconds had elapsed since I had taken the photo.) It really didn't look like a real cloud, at all. It looked more like a beginner's attempt at making a digital cloud. It moved toward the Northeast, even though the direction a nearby flag was blowing indicated that the surface wind was moving in a straight West to East direction. That was also the direction a line of upper (white) clouds were moving. Besides the small, black, cloud-like formation there were no other clouds in the sky except for the line of clouds that occupied an elevated height. The black mystery object was the only one of its kind in the sky. There were no planes or weather balloons or helicopters in the sky. The sun was near to its time of setting. Other than the above-mentioned clouds, the sky was blue. I'm not sure what else to tell you about this incident except that my wife had seen a nearly identical small, black, cloud-like formation just the day before. We still haven't gotten the film developed. Are there any special instructions on where or how this film should be developed? Also, any suggestions on which web sites would wish to be informed of this event? Hope to hear from you soon.",2003-03-21T00:00:00,39.96327543160691,-76.71886879150067

It was about 2 AM around the fourth of July of 2002. I was outside on a hill with two other friends of mine. We were all just relaxing and looking at the stars when all of the sudden a fairly large bright star looking object that was above us for sometime started to move. It went unnoticed before because when it was still it looked like just another star in the sky. When the object started to move it was CLEARLY not an airplane or a satelitte. It started off moving a signifigant distance acorss the sky, from a our view of the sky I would say a few feet, which I'm sure in terms of space is millions of miles.  After doing that a few times it came to a stand still. When it was at this stand still, I'm sure that it was directly above us, and when i say directly I mean as in if they dropped a pin it would have hit us. After repeating this process a few times, it went it to a frenzy of figure 8's. When the figure 8's occured we all noticed three other birght ""star figures"" which in turn were UFO's as well. They did not do as much moving as the one above us did. It seemed as though the one above myself and my compainions was the leader and the other three were followers. After doing the figure 8's and unexplainable patterns for about 10-30 min, it stoped abruptly. Right as it stopped, a car drove by us, this was probablly about 3:30 AM in a suburban area, thats not very typical for our neighborhood. The creepy thing about the car was that it stared directly at us when it drove by, which at 3 in the morning, and in very dark night on a hill, is strange. They should not have known we were up there because we made no noise and blended in with the hill. After the car drove by we became very frightened and ran back to my friends house.

It was going at an incredible speed west, then slowed down immediately and stopped.The object took off southwest at high speeds.  thanks  ""Addition Information""  Well the object was moving around and stopping it did that for about two times. I say that was a good 20 seconds until I lost sight.--The object was not that far, it was quite small, but it might be the size of 3 vehicles in length.-- how can you tell the altitude??

The day was bright and sunny, with a blue sky and fluffy clouds.  The temperature was approximately 70 degrees.  It was a breezy day.  Upon exiting the store, I glanced across the 4-lane divided American Legion Highway toward the small Getty gas station directly across the highway from the donut shop.  My attention was immediately drawn to a solid black sphere, approximately the size of a large beach ball (about 5 feet in diameter) traveling no more than 30 feet in the air, coming from the direction of the Bell Circle traffic rotary. It was traveling in a straight line, at approximately 20 miles per hour, and its path was located behind the Getty station, heading in the direction of the 11-story Comfort Inn Hotel which is located just past the Getty station, if one is facing in a northerly direction in front of the station.  At first glance, I thought it was a child's large balloon, but the day was very breezy, and this object was traveling in a straight line, never once fluttering or wavering in its flight toward the gas station. The object was a dull, solid black in color, with absolutely no protrusions, or any other type of irregularities on it's surface... it was just a solid, dull black sphere.  As I watched the object, it continued its straight-line path toward the Comfort Inn Hotel. The traffic was light on the highway, and with the absence of vehicular traffic noise, I noted that I could hear no sound at all coming fron the object.  As it approached the Comfort Inn Hotel, its altitude was at about the 3rd story level, and as it got closer, it began to climb at approximately a 50-degree angle until it cleared the roof of the hotel, at which time it leveled off for a few seconds, then began climbing again at the same angle.  To get a better viewing angle, I crossed the highway and positioned myself directly behind the object, and I could see that it was still traveling in an absolute straight-line attitude, with a total absence of flutter or wavering, even though the tree branches and foliage were swaying with the breezes.  The object once again interrupted its climb, and began to descend at an approximately 40-degree angle, heading for the roof the New England Confectionary Company (NECCO Candy) building, located in the next lot north of the Comfort Inn, again if one is facing in a northerly direction next to the Getty station.  When the object came within 15-20 feet of the roof of the NECCO building, it again leveled off and traveled along the length of the roof, until it cleared the building.  At this point, the object once again began to climb on its 50-degree angle, in its straight-line attitude, heading for a large cloud.  It's speed never wavered from the approximate 20 miles per hour it was traveling when I first spotted it.  Still behind the object, I watched it climb toward the cloud until it was no longer visible.  The time-frame from when I first spotted the object, until it disappeared from view was approximately 1 1/2 minutes, as best I can recall.  There were no people on foot in the immediate vicinity, and no people in the few vehicles going by seemed to notice it, even though I was quite conspicuous in my observation of it, even pointing toward it to try and get the attention of someone in one of the vehicles.  As far as I could determine, I was the only one on the highway who saw the object, but I'm positive that someone MUST have seen it as it flew over the always-busy Bell Circle traffic rotary. I passed the rotary on my way home, but could see nobody on foot who may have seen the object.  To say that what I saw that day was strange and very highly unusual would be a monumental understatement!  It was a very exciting thing to see, and I can say without a doubt that this was no beach ball, child's balloon, or ANY balloon for that matter. This object, or craft, ot whatever it was, seemed to be intelligently controlled, in my personal opinion.  An exciting day in my life, and one that I'll never forget.  I assure all of you that this story is absolutely true. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as working in an industry that requires a substantial technical background.

Interviewed NUFORC case witness by UFOMIG.com investigator Brian Adams for Missouri sighting on Dec. 27, 2002 near Roby, MO. Witness name responds> Since there are many questions, I will answer them in Q/A format one at a time to the best of my memory, for less confusion. What first made you aware of the object(s) when you were traveling? Since we live in a big city here, I'm absolutely facinated by the dark country skies to which every star in the sky can be seen, so as usual I was looking up at the stars through the front windshield and passenger window while my husband was driving. I immediately became aware when I saw the red flashing lights out of the corner of my eye.  You know those Christmas lights they call ""chasers"" that you can set the speed of the flashing by a remote near the plug-in?  That's what these lights looked like, very fast and rotating around the the circular perimeter, it was hard to miss.  With my mouth wide open in complete awe, I grabbed my husbands arm and said ""LOOK at that!"" What direction in the sky were they sighted? We were traveling North, and the lights were moving from east to west. Did you use any binoculars or use eyeglasses to view them? No sir, I don't wear glasses and we didn't have any binoculars unfortunately. How were the lights strobing like quick short flashes, random around the circular perimeter? They were flashing rapidly (red)in a rotating fashion (like the lights were chasing each other) around the circular perimeter. I'm not sure if my eyes weren't just getting blurry from staring so long at these things, but I thought I might have seen them change colors once or twice, to the color of white, very quickly as well. Did you stop and get out of your vehicle to watch at all? Unfortunately no.  I wanted to but there were 16 inches of snow on the ground (there were no place to pull over because of the snow drifts from the plows)and it was 9 degrees out that night, and we were late getting to our next destination.  We just drove very slowly observing them from the windshield of our mini-van. Have you seen any ufos before this sighting? Yes, but these two were very different from the other time.  The first time was about 1993 in Kokomo, IN. My mother and I were getting some groceries out of the trunk of her car (sometime around 9PM I suppose, it was over 10 years ago) when a triangular object with 3 big red lights on each point of the triangle (the lights weren't flashing) passed low in the sky right over our heads.  It was about the size of a football field and moved silently. It was made out of some kind of black metal and had some kind of groovy patterns on the underside. It flew just above the trees and was so low that we could see these patterns. I don't remember much about being 15, but I'll never forget that.  It was my curiousity in researching if anyone else had any similar experiences with both of these types of craft that led me to your website. Did you tell anybody you visited about the sighting? No. We were travelling with our roomate and her 5yr old son at the time to visit my husbands grandmother. My roomate and her son were asleep in the backseat of the van, and I didn't want to scare them. Did they tell you if they have seen or heard about any ufos in their area in the past several years? My husband's grandfather used to watch them from the front porch of the same house we were staying at when my husband was about 10yrs old (he's 24 now).  Oddly, every Tuesday or Wednesday (it was one day a week at relatively the same time at night, around 9PM) it would appear in the same place in the sky.  The front door of the house faces to the east and the craft could be seen from just above the trees.  He passed away in 1995, and has been known to watch this thing once a week for years while he was alive. I heard this directly from my husband. Are you or your husband from Missouri? I'm originally from Indiana, and my husband and I live in Virginia Beach due to him being stationed here in the Navy.  He's from Nebraska. My husbands family is from Missouri though, and his grandmother still lives there, whom we were staying with for the holidays. One more thing to add....  They were stationary when I first noticed them, then they began circling around each other very rapidly while moving from east to west and west to east again across the sky...sort of like they were playing or dancing. There were no other aircraft in the sky, and it was around midnight at the time.  There were no other cars on the road at the time either. We watched them for approx. 10 minutes, then they began to dim, or maybe get farther up into the sky so that they appeared to be dimmer I'm not sure, but then they just vanished. I would like to thank you for sharing your similar story with me.  I'm glad there is someone out there who saw the same thing and I know Im not crazy now. I've never shared either of these experiences with anyone else, besides my mother and my husband out of fear that they would think I'd lost it.  But I know in my heart these were not aircraft I was seeing, planes and jets just don't move like that.  It helps to know that people like you are out there investigating, and bringing some comfort to those like me, in knowing we are not alone. There IS something going on out there.

At first I noticed one white dot in the sky, and assumed it was just a lost balloon. However the object did not visibly move for a few minutes. When I looked again, about 3-5 minutes later, I noticed that two other objects of the same size were moving north towards the first one, which had moved slightly south from its original position. The three objets continued towards each other, and within 3-5 minutes eventully formed a triangle, still almost directly above me. Twice during this episode I asked my friend to look at the objects. He did see them the first time, but because of the branches in the tree, could not see them the second time. About 2 or 3 minutes later (the parade was distracting me!) when I looked up again, the three objects had straight-lined themselves, facing in a southwesterly direction, but still moving in a southerly direction, but the movement was almost imperceptable. I could only track the change using a couple of branches for positioning. A couple of minutes later, I could no longer find any of the objects.  During this time, thre were no clouds visible in the sky. I did see a couple of aircraft, including a 727 and an ATR pass overhead, which helped somewhat to better estimate that these objects were extremely high in the sky. Their size from where I stood was not much more than pinpoints. I have to say that I do not follow these sightings, and don't fully believe in little green men. NO, I am not a Raelian! I do not know who to contact to find out what it was I saw. Could they have been Predator drones practicing maneouvers? I believe they were much too high for small weather balloons, given that I could see them. The aircraft I saw, flew almost directly underneath the objects.",2003-03-21T00:00:00,,

But I am almost sure that it is not a jet trail and hence some more clarification would be appreciated. The reason is that I have been in India near a Military base and have seen lots of jet trails and that's why I am so sure of the fact that it cannot be a jet trail. I have seen the jet trails from lots of aircrafts and am a regular watcher of Wings. So I would really appreciate some more explanation if you could provide so. Also as I mentioned it vanished from the air in less than a minute which is quite unlikely for a jet trail since they persist for a longer duration because of the density differences of the water which is ejected out and the atmosphere.

No other direct light sources are in the scene, except for the tiny shaded light visible under the eve of the house. This light (to illuminate the flag at night) was only a 40 watt std light bulb and was shielded from the camera. However the strange 'reverse highlight' on the object does align roughly with this source, and NO other source of light or radiation corresponds.  3. Doesn't this anomaly seem awfully small, clear and 'distinct' to be a reflection of an internal camera component? (compared to other camera anomalies such as lens flair or internal reflections).  4.

However, because of the background of the witness in this case, we make an exception.  This is one of two high-quality reports submitted by the same source.  PD))  Connection between my vivid dream and reported sighting of crescent-shaped ufo over Huntsville, AL? Seeing a June 2003 report of a crescent-shaped ufo over Byrd Spring Lake in Huntsville, AL (~3 miles from my home), and not knowing the details of the second sighting of the crescent-shaped object, prompted me to submit the following diary entry I wrote with respect to a ""dream"" I had in January 2003.  It took me weeks to stop thinking about my dream and I still wonder about it even now.  For the record, I am a 40 year old mechanical engineer with much NASA and DOD design experience, have an avid interest in aircraft and flying machines, am happily married with two children, and am mentally stable.  I am very scientific in my approach to problems/solutions and take great care to apply my knowledge of engineering and science to the world around me.  I do believe that we are not alone.  I am submitting a sketch of the object seen in my ""dream"" via email.  My rather lengthy diary entry is as follows:  Just so I can remember later I will document a ""dream"" I had the other night.  I can not say I actually observed what I will describe, but the vivid detail of the dream, the fact that I could remember so much of it, and a power outage that left both myself and my wife with an inexplicable ""weird"" feeling about the power outage that night makes me wonder if maybe it really happened.  During the night of January 21, 2003 (morning of Jan 22), my wife and I were awoken by a strange beeping sound coming from somewhere in the room.  This sound reminded me of the sound that our old answering machine would make to indicate the end of a message.  The beep was periodic and would beep, then be silent, beep, silent, etc.  I remember about three or four beeps.  As I was becoming conscious, my wife said ""what's that"", and I said I don't know"", to which she responded ""the power's out"".  About that time there were no more beeps to my recollection.  We both were very puzzled as to the nature of this power outage, for some unknown reason, and felt there was something odd about it.  The baby monitor we've been using, has battery back-up on both the transmitter and receiver side should there be a power failure.  A day or so later, I tested this feature by unplugging both the receiver and the transmitter power supplies and observing the result.  The battery back-ups worked fine and there was no beeping.  The monitor, nor any other device in the house of which I am aware, emits any sound when the power is off, or when the power cycles on and off.  (At some point in this whole incident, I noted the time to be around 3:00 am, must be after the power came back on??)  When I was aware enough of what was going on, I decided to get up to check on the kids and peek outside to see what was happening.  I do not recall that I actually checked on either of the girls, but I do remember leaving our bedroom into the upstairs hall and looking out the front Palladian window.  I noted that the street light was off and it seemed very dark outside.  The lights in the valley were on, so it appeared to me that the outage was isolated to our street.  At some point I remember that I realized the power came back on and that the street light was re-lighting.  My wife may have said ""it's back on"", I don't know.  I think I remember getting back into bed, and maybe that I used the bathroom, first (I can't be sure).  Of itself, the previous seems ordinary, I admit.  When I awoke in the morning, I recalled a ""dream"" or ""dreamy event"" in vivid detail and could not get it out of my head.  This is very unusual for me since I normally can not remember 99.9% of my dreams no matter how hard I try. This is one of three dreams I can remember in any detail for the last 15 to 20 years or more.  They all may be related.  My memory of this ""dreamy event"", as I refer to it, is not complete, but I can remember many striking details.  We have a north-westerly facing Palladian window, which is in our two story entrance foyer.  When in the second floor hallway/balcony, one can look straight out the window.  Otherwise, it is 14 to 20 feet above one's head, from the first floor.  Although I can not remember exactly when in the night this happened, or time-wise, how it relates to the power outage, I remember looking out the Palladian window and observing a deep red light shinning down from above the window.  The color of the light was not quite ruby red, it had a quality to it that hinted of a touch of purple/violet added to it, but not enough to move it very far from a pure red color.  My oldest daughter has a lava lamp that gives off light of roughly the same hue.  The light was diffuse in nature and seemed to emanate from a point above the house and possibly centered over the house.  From the foyer and hallway, no source could be detected.  There was also, what seemed like another light of exactly the same color that was flashing on and off with a steady period; it also seemed to emanate from the same unseen source.  I remember walking down the stairs and looking up and out of the said window trying to determine the source of what I was seeing, but not being successful.  I also looked out the library window, to the north, and observed the same lights illuminating the trees outside that window.  Something led me to believe that I could get a better look if I went out the back door to look up.  The angle of the light, perhaps told me its source was closer to the backyard than the front. The next thing I recall was standing on the sidewalk to the back porch with my gaze turned toward the house, and up toward a point over our master bedroom.  I was in awe of the sight before me.  Hovering over our house was a very large disk-shaped craft.  I thought several things to myself at that instant. ""I've got to remember what this thing looks like"", ""I wish my wife was here to see this"", and ""for it being in the 20's outside, I don't feel cold, in fact I'm very comfortable"".  My recollection of the technical details of what I was seeing at the time are more sketchy than I would like, however, here is what I can recall.  I would estimate its diameter to be approximately 30 feet, based on a quick mental comparison to the house directly below it.  The disc was hovering, completely motionless, maybe 20 feet to 40 feet over the house.  On its ""belly"" for lack of a better word, were what I recall as 6 lights arranged hexagonally with respect to one another, with a 7th light in the dead center of the craft.  The centerline of the hexagonal pattern of lights was inboard of the outside edge of the craft by approximately 4 feet.  The color of the 6 lights was the same red color I have already described, although at this point, none of them was flashing, they were steady and not extremely intense.  I don't think I could look directly at any of them due to the nature and quality of the light they were emitting.  I seem to think the light in the dead center was white.  All the lights appeared to be the same diameter and looked as though they were fixed and non-moveable/non-aim able.  I don't remember the diameter of each light, and can't remember if they took up a large portion of the available real estate on the craft's bottom, or only a small portion.  I seem to remember them as relatively small in diameter.  There may have been additional white lights, a sort of annular ring around each red light (I don’t know for sure).  The contour of the bottom of the craft and its thickness escape me.  I want to say it was very flat on the bottom and, at least, had a thin edge.  The total height and top side were not able to be observed from my perspective.  I made my observations in what seemed like only a second or two before the color of the lights changed; to what, I don't know, I want to say white.  The craft lifted higher into the air and rotated 90 degrees, or so, counterclockwise and pitched upward 5 or 10 degrees.  If I could have put a line on the disc pointing N NE, that line would have now rotated to the W NW. (direction of flight)  As the craft performed its rotation and changed its pitch to a more skyward angle, I observed 2 additional structures.  On top of the craft I could see a portion of a long, thin rectangular object oriented longitudinally, along the ""direction of flight"" (as described by my imaginary line, above) and positioned above and through the center of the craft, as if being lifted and supported by the disc. The rectangular object had a square cross section that I felt was in the neighborhood of 3' by 3' and a more broadened ""tip"" that gave the impression of it being a ""cockpit"".  (Although I never felt it was a cockpit, that's just an easy way to describe its appearance).  It was (based on the 3' cross section) about 6' long, by 5'wide, by 5' tall centered left and right, as well as up and down on the rectangle.  The sides of the ""cockpit"" portion were flat and straight while ""nose"" was radiused and sloped both up to the top and down to the bottom surfaces with an angled portion (see sketch).  Looking at the color and sheen of the material gave me the feeling that the structure was made of a charcoal-gray ceramic material.  The finish was dull and lusterless, although very smooth and perfectly flat.  The structure was one contiguous piece of material with no seams, windows, rivets, etc.  It was perfect as though it was ""grown"" into that shape.  The ""cockpit"" portion of the rectangular object was outboard of the disk enough that there was a good separation between it and the disk (4'???).  The second structure I observed was at what could be described as the aft end of the assembly.  This was crescent-shaped object, in the same plane as the disc, made of the same material as the rectangle.  Top to bottom, the thickness was the same as the rectangle (3'???).  The bottom surface was very flat and I could not see the top surface, but assumed it was equally flat.  The crescent inside radius was offset aft (with respect to the direction of flight) of the disk by the same amount the ""cockpit"" shape was forward and its radius was equal to that of the disc plus offset.  The outside radius of the crescent was such that it caused the crescent to look like a waxing or waning moon with a taper starting at 0 to a max width about equal to the offset between the crescent and disc (4'??).  I did not note any attachment between the crescent and any other part of the assembly, it was just ""there"".  I could not viualize the area between the disc and crescent as there was not enough light  The crescent looked as though it could be slid toward the craft and cradle it.  The chord length of the crescent looked to be the same as the diameter of the disc.  The surfaces of both the inside and outside radii were both perfectly flat and seamless.  The bottom surface of the crescent appeared to be in the same plane as the bottom of the disc.  Based, again on comparison with the house, I estimated the total length of the assembly to be around 45 to 50 feet.  These observations were made in only a second or two.  As the disc rotated and pitched upward, the other structures only became visible as they apparently reflected some light.  I remember wondering why I could see them, since it was the middle of the night, but just assumed streetlights were the light source.  I also remember thinking ""so that's how they do it"" in relation to the dark rectangular and crescent structures and I knew for a fact that the disc was ""driving"" the whole assembly; the rectangle and crescent were there only for the ride.  As the craft  pitched up, I waved ""goodbye"" as if the occupants were good friends and it streaked off at amazing speed toward the West.  There was a very slight high pitched sound that it made as it left, similar to that of the sonar ping from many popular war movies, except without the reverberation.  The sound was pure, momentary, faint, and trailed off.  The next thing I remember, it was morning.  Later in the day I discussed the ""weirdness"" of the power outage with my wife and she agreed there was something odd about it, but what she did not know.  I asked her if she had seen any lights that night and she answered that she thought it was the utility company.  Later, the day after that, she had no recollection of seeing any lights.  For a whole week following the ""dream"" the inside of my mouth was raw and dry and some of my molars hurt.  (I assumed that eating cashews was likely the cause, but I continued to eat them and my mouth cleared up).  A week later I spoke briefly to our neighbor, directly across the street, and asked her if anything odd had gone on with respect to the outage and she said that not everything had been without power and that one of her clocks was flashing 9:30 when she got up, and based on the time of the outage should have said 3:30, or so.  A few days later I was speaking with another neighbor, two houses up the street, and she had mentioned that there had been a power outage (I verified with her that that was the same outage) and that their transformer had burned out, leaving them and three other houses without power for over 8 hours.  The utility company attributed the transformer burn out to too much current draw on too small and old a transformer.  There is no evidence to suggest that any of this happened, or could have happened.  For all I know, it was just a vivid dream and concerned a subject about which I have an interest.  I wanted to document what I remember because I still think about it over a week later.  I NEVER remember my dreams.  ******* PLEASE CONTACT ME ONLY VIA EMAIL, IF NECESSARY.

As I approached the Highway 54 exit, I spotted a bright light in the distance, above the left edge of the road.  The light hovered in place, appearing to be a few miles distant. I thought it was simply a TV helicopter, out filming beauty shots of the traffic for the 6 o'clock news. My clock read 5:49 PM, a bit early for news footage.  But then the light did something alarming. It began to drop quickly out of the sky. I blinked to make sure it wasn't moving towards me and I was just seeing it wrong. But in spite of my doubt, it was doing just what I saw - dropping like a rock.  ""Damn, that pilot is screwed,"" I thought. I believed I was witnessing a helicopter crash, possibly one that was being transmitted live to the area's televisions.  I blinked again. The helicopter couldn't have lost power, since it wasn't ""autorotating"" to the ground. If so, the light would surely be spinning around.  The light plummeted as I continued to drive. Then, just as suddenly as it appeared, it vanished, blinking out a few degrees above the horizon. I squinted in that direction but could not find any trace of it.  It took me a while to decide that what I saw wasn't the usual helicopter sighting. No sane pilot would drop a helicopter that fast. And there was no trace of it afterward. Very weird. I actually spent the rest of the trip scanning the horizon for signs of smoke plumes, on the chance I really did see a helicopter crash.  Thinking about it again later that night, I decided it could have been a flare. Why someone would shoot a flare into the evening sky is beyond me, as is how it could hover in one place as long as it did before dropping.  -- I put the above description in my journal for that date, but didn't consider reporting this event until today, 26 June.

I noticed bright lights in the sky North of my house. Our house is on one of the highest hills in the area and we are at least 20 miles from the nearest city, and have no close nieghbors. To our North is nothing but low lakes and swamp lands that is almost totaly deserted because of rouch geography. In the middle of that rough impassable land is also 16000 acres of wild public lands that are seldom used except for a few duck hunters and some fisherman, but never that late at night, and never in the sky. The object was a group of about 6 lights in a perfect line that appeared to be at least 200 yards long. While watching these lights just sitting in the sky another light came straight down from what appeared to be outer space, and disapeared into the other lights. At this time I called for my family to come out and see. My smaller kids after seeing the lights ran back into the house and hid under the bed, they had just watched Signs. After about 30 minutes the object began to move very slowly to the North, and looked like it was settling over the Lake as it was looking for somthing. We then climbed to the top of our house as the object was sinking lower in the sky and getting harder to see due to the trees. We started filming the object then and and have some footage of it. This was not the first time we have seen somthing odd in the sky here. About a month after moving to this house I walked outside about 2AM in the morning. When I walked out I saw an object at tree top level with red lights around it, and a red strobe light shooting into the trees below. This object was moving about 20 mph over the trees and disapeared over the hill to out east. 2 Nights latter at 3am we saw what looked like a rip in the sky to our south. This by far was the strangest thing I have seen. The rip looked as though it was an opening to another place. Out of this opening flew what looked like hundreds of small objects ! like streemers. We ran in the house for a camera but by the time we came back out it was gone. Another time around December of 2002 my parents who live 25 miles to our north called and told us to run outside. They said they saw a series of lights flying in circular paterns and moving south toward our location. We did not see them at that time but about 30 minutes latter they appeared in the sky to our north. These were round cylinder shaped objects flying in round circular formations around the sky. I have a police and fire department scanner at my house. While watching these lights I heard the dispatcher ask where one of the Sheriff deputys location was, he replied ""just sitting here watching the UFO's"", so many in our area had to see these things. We have also found strange human looking footprints in the mud at the lake to our north. They appeared to be human except for the fact that these prints come out of and lead into thick brush with lots of throrns and stickers. These prints are also way out in the woods, miles from a pathed road or houses. My feet would be nothing but bloody nubs if I did what this person is doing, even the Native Americans wore mocosins on their feet in this area. No one in the are can explane these prints that are found by arrowhead hunter after a rain. They also appear in the same area the lights are seen. I wonder if they are related.

The object noiselessly covered a distance of 30 miles in a period of about 10 minutes, passing over the cities of Chandler, South Phoenix & Scottsdale, AZ. It was moving parallel & nearly directly above the Interstate 10 Freeway. The object was observed from the parking lot of the 3 observers place of employment. The object had an irregular flight path, constantly, if only slightly, changing altitude & direction, but moving in a northerly direction. It was observed from a distance of roughly 1 to 3 miles. Due to the clear daylight conditions and close proximity of its observers, as well as the object's omnidirectional movements, it's shape was clearly discernable & was not that of any aircraft known to the observers. There was no tail, wings, fuselage or propellers visible. As it maneuvered perpendicular to the earth, its underside was seen to be black. When horizontal, it appeared the have a highly reflective metal surface. There was an intermittent orange glow about it.

I mentioned the fact to my family; my wife and two teenage daughters, and we started to speculate what it could be.  We quickly discarded that the object could be a plane, blimp, weather balloon or cloud.

The shape looked a little different from this latter angle, a shade appeared in the middle of the object that looked more cigar shaped than previous. We thought that it could be two ovoid shapes together or a peanut shaped object (see photos).   At approximately 10:10 AM two military craft were coming in from East to west over the highway. I assumed that they were military because of the fact that they were leaving vapor trails, and were flying side by side, a formation civilian planes do not oftenly practice. At seeing these planes, I asked my girls to see what the UFO would do and they mentioned that it had disappeared.  Because the mountain range was low in comparison to the height of the object, the fact that we were on a straight away, and the fact that we had observed the object moments before, we concluded that in fact it did disappear and was not obscured by the scenery.",2003-03-21T00:00:00,32.7038626459144,-114.59088443579766

Hi Peter, Hope you are having a wonderful Thanksgiving! This is a story my mother has repeated to me throughout my life. She is now 79 years old & I asked her yesterday to tell me once again so I could report it accurately now that I have discovered your site. In 1953 we lived in the countryside between Doylestown & Jamison, Pennsylvania. I was 3 years old & my mother was about 8 months pregnant with my sister, so it was either very late April or very early May. It was a warm spring afternoon & before my Dad came home from work we walked up a path in the woods to the top of the hill into a field where we had pretty much a 360 degree view. My mother recalls that as she was looking off toward the hill to the North between us & Doylestown she saw what at first appeared to be a blimp moving rather slowly through the sky. It turned & moved toward us & as it came overhead she realized it was IMMENSE, HUGE, it covered the sky, & created such a shadow that the breeze ceased in the trees & even the birds fell silent. She said it was 1000 feet above us, the size of three football fields from our perspective & that this was no blimp! The object was a dull silver-grey, had no seams, no lights, no windows, no propellor, no cabin underneath & it moved in absolute silence. She said she was terrified because of it's size. Apparently she told me to run home with the cocker spaniel & she tried to run also, but being very pregnant could not move very quickly. She has always thought they did not harm her because she was pregnant. My father did not believe her when he got home. Sometimes I think I should be hypnotized to discover how I remember this event. I read on your site that something similar was seen in Galveston, Texas in 6/1953. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,40.2553,-75.0762

The following UFO event happened in my home town, Del Rio,Texas, in 1957.  Although I did not personnaly see the event happen, the whole town knew about it, and it was reported in the Local Newspaper, and admitted by the local police department and the local U.S.A.F Base near Del Rio.  Here is Del Rio's real U.F.O. story as I remebered it from my youth in 1957:  One night, a local Del Rio traveling salesman who frequently traveled east on US Highway 10, from Del Rio to San Antonio (165 miles away}, was engaged by a cigar shaped UFO.  The UFO hovered over his car with oscillating multicolored lights.  The UFO caused the car's engine and electrical system to shut down.  When the salesman looked out his car window at the UFO, he was severely burned on his face.  When the UFO left, the salesman being terrified, restarted his car and returned to Del Rio, (he was about 30 miles east of Del Rio when he encountered the UFO). When he reached Del Rio, he went to the hospital for burn treatment and the hospital reported the unusual circumstances to the Del Rio Police Dept.  This type of encounter may not seem to odd until you hear the unusual thing that happened to the salesmans new ""two-day old"" car within the next few days.  The next morning, it was obvious all the paint on the salesmans new car had been completely burned off. Within a few days the outside of the car had ""totally rusted"" from exposer to the UFO. The local Ford dealer could not account for the ""sudden"" paint loss and rusting on the car.  As I recall, the local Ford dealer gave him a new car and the U.S. Air Force took the car away.  The local Del Rio salesman suddenly left Del Rio and was never seen in Del Rio again. This story is true.  It really happened in my home town in 1957.  Many of the old-time residents in Del Rio remember going down to the police station and seeing the ""new rusting car"".  Many local residents are still reluctant to talk about this incident.

This is the whole point I can't remember all the details, time, how long object was sighted for, etc.  Anyway, I keep asking my Father to stop the car because I had to go to the bathroom (not many service stations stayed open all night back then, also the interstate was not yet constructed.

My Father pulled off the hiway onto the shoulder of the road, stopped the car got out, opened the back door for me to get out, and he and I walked to the rear of the car. I am not sure of what time it was but it must have been very late, we did not see any other traffic. I do remember it was very dark, kind of warm weather. I was about to do my thing, when I looked over my right shoulder and saw an object with red lights around the bottom of it, it appeared to be a disk (circle) shape with me looking up at it from an angle. The object was at tree top level, no sound, I asked my Father, "" What is that?"". I don't remember him saying anything, but I watched the object cross over the road behind us and get to the trees on the other side. This is all I remember. Both sides of the road had trees about 30 feet tall. I believe my Father and I were as close as 50 feet to the object. My parents never talked about the sighting, perhaps it never happened, then again maybe more than this occured that night somewhere between Alabama and Florida on that lonely streach of hiway.

A daughter and her mother (ages 38 and 58) were driving home to Dubuque, Iowa from a concert in Cedar Rapids, Iowa after midnight on Tuesday April 8, 2003, when a golden-bronze light descended to the right front of their car (the daughter was driving, with the mother in the passenger's seat) and passed through, and perhaps alongside their car.  (Investigator's note:  It is important here to note the weather conditions:  Light snow; OVERCAST WITH 1100 FOOT CLOUD BASE; 26 Degrees Fahrenheit; Wind NE 12 mph.)  As the light passed through the car, both witnesses felt unusual physical sensation.  The driver (daughter) felt a burning, tingling sensation along her right side - and felt as if the light, which was a bit to her right, had affected mainly that part of her body, and stated that her ""insides"" felt as if they were being pulled to the right as the light passed through.  The mother also felt physical sensation which, because of the medication, Oxycodone, which she'd taken an hour before the incident for a condition called neurofibromatosis, she thinks she should not have been able to feel.  The mother saw the light first as it began descending toward the car, with the daughter then able to perceive it as it appeared in front of the car and moved through (and perhaps along the right side) of the car.  (Keeping in mind the 1100 foot cloud base, we at least know that the light would have been below 1100 feet when the mother first saw it descending.)  To the witnesses, the duration of the sighting and passage of the light seemed like no more than perhaps 5 seconds.  The daughter/driver remembers her head whipping to her right briefly as the light passed through.  The next thing she knew she was staring straight ahead at the road with her hands tightly gripping the steering wheel, with the words, ""Focus-focus-focus-focus-focus"" going through her mind as the car moved along at 55 miles per hour.  She immediately looked at the car clock and saw that it was 1:36 a.m., although neither witness is aware of the ti! me when the incident began, and so the question of the length of the incident goes unanswered.  At no time did the witnesses see a craft, but both of them perceived some kind of energy they find it difficult to describe.  The mother sketches a series of horizontal and vertical marks within the light, and the daughter mentions a kind of swirling, fluid black mist in the light.  Oddly, it was later found that a gold T-shirt purchased at the concert, which had been inside the mother's bag in the front seat prior to the incident, was now, following the incident, on the floor in the back seat.  Physical effects on the daughter/driver continued to manifest, i.e.: for 3 days her husband noticed the hair on her right arm would ""stand up,"" with the hair on her left arm lying down normally.  She also had the sensation of heat on the right side of her body, at the same time she felt normal temperature on the left side of her body.  When the daughter related the incident to a friend from out of state, her friend advised her to check her body for marks, and she and her husband noted a puncture mark about an inch below her navel.   Whether this is related to the incident, of course, is not definitely known, but the witness says she doesn't know how it got there.  About 10 days after the incident, the daughter/driver's lymph nodes began to swell (Whether this is at all related to the incident is not known; it is simply something to take note of).  The daughter/driver witness has now been to the doctor several times, with blood tests being taken, and nothing found amiss.  The swelling persisted at high level for about 6 weeks, then began to decrease somewhat, although there is at this writing (June 29, 2003) still some swelling of the nodes.  After the light had disappeared, mother and daughter say that there remained a golden glow on the clouds as they made their way on the rural highway toward Dubuque, Iowa.  When they came to the Dubuque airport some 25 miles further on down the highway, they noted that the airport lights could not have been the golden light they'd seen because the airport lights were definitely white instead of gold.  Iowa MUFON personnel continue to maintain frequent telephone contact with the daughter witness as she continues to have her health assessed by doctors in her area.

All three investigators were impressed with this 50-year old witness' willingness to be as objective as possible in his quietly thoughtful assessment of his sighting.   He had taken a short break from his office and was sitting on a bench at 2nd Street & 3rd Avenue in Cedar Rapids wearing ray-blocker sunglasses when he sighted what he at first thought was a flock of birds.  However, as the formation approached to nearly overhead (moving from north to south) he realized that he was seeing at least 5 shiny metallic objects (no further apart in the formation than their own diameter), and to his amazement he saw that the objects constantly switched positions as the ""tight S"" formation rather slowly moved south at an estimated 30-50 mph INTO/AGAINST the wind. (It should be noted  here that weather conditions were as follows: Clear; 87 degrees Fahrenheit; visibility 10 miles; WIND OUT OF SSW AT 26 mph, GUSTING TO 35 mph)  With 5 objects moving against such a strong wind, it seems reasonable to rule out balloons as an explanation for what this witness saw.  Witness estimates that objects were perhaps at around 2,000 feet when first sighted, but that they may have elevated somewhat as they drew closer to overhead.  (Whether this perception is accurate, of course, is not known.)  Witness observed a military jet a couple of miles away heading in the opposite direction as the formation, but it is not known if that pilot was aware of the formation.  Local police and sheriff's departments received no reports, and the FAA had nothing on radar.  This, of course, remains an anecdotal, one-person account, but Iowa MUFON investigators are impressed with this individual's careful attention to detail as he sought to satisfy his curiosity over what he was seeing.

i cannot remember what colors the planes were, offhand.i was trying to ignore them. as i said my friend was teeing off,i look up. i see a dark cloud approaching at a speed i'll relate to in time format.it appeared to be about a mile away when i noticed it. in the time it took for my freind to hit his ball,watch it land, and comment that he hit his further.it was directly in front of us.the distance is hard to estimate against the backdrop of a clear blue sky that goes ? how far until it meets the horizon.i'll guess it was about 300 ft up off the ground and 1/4 mile out ahead of us. it was the size of a large two story house.it started out like i mentioned as a dark cloud.more like smoke looking.i work on diesel trucks,some you start up and smoke rolls out that looks dark grey with hint of white in it.this had that appearance. i say to my friend.""look at that cloud.it's not moving"".he said,"" that's just some smoke or something.""i watched it come from over that way "",i said. he tells me to play the game. i watch more as i walk towards my ball. i stopped playing and just watch.he walks toward his ball, looks at me kind of irritated.yet he starts watching to. the smoke had seemed to get less obvious.it became sort of transparent like you could see more of the blue sky through it. i am awestruck.i am just asking him.don't you see that? it's not smoke. i just keep asking him this. i suddenly see a small perfect rectangle in the sky.and directly off to the right the ""smoke was somewhat visible still.but oddly it had became a burnt orange color.fading from a see through grayish color to this orangish color. i began raising my voice some because of the small rectangle opening, my friend notices more the color changing area off to the right.i see what i thought was a bird. so i point up ,because he could not really distinguish the rectangle opening.mind you, my story is becoming longer,like this was a great span of time.but actually only about a minute has passed .so we are kind of a little in disbelief that we are seeing something ufo-like. i point to the bird object and tell him to look close.he half leans towards me to follow where my finger is pointing. and he kind of stretches his neck forward as you do while straining to look at something far away.then the ""bird dissapeared into the rectangle opening. i don't know that he fully can swear ,like me, on seeing the opening. then the opening was gone.immediately the orange color to the right appeared off and on for about a half second at a time.shimmering is how i'll describe it.there was no more grey/white smoke at this time.it was large orange object then the blue sky behind it.back and forth.this happened for about 6 seconds. then the sun reflected off of an object.my friend really lit up.at first he was passing it off as smoke,non caring at all.we all know any ufo sitings are generally at night.and i have never seen any unexplained anything.so i was unsure it was anything either. he exclaimed""wow.thats a big parachute"" it looked like material of a parachute or a hot air balloon.the sun suddenly reflected off of the object for about 4 seconds.the best way to describe it.s shape is the size and shape of the large sail on a pirate ship.as if we were veiwing it not from the front,as to see its full width,more as if you wear looking at a boat sail from the side. it dissapeared again.shimmered 2 more very brief times.then the smoke gradually appeared,but less visible this time.and it slowly moved away for about 10 seconds and the smoke gradually dissapeared in about 30 seconds,we saw no more.meanwhile the planes are still buzzing the general area. i have thought about this near every day.i have told about three people in my family,because they had told me of some things they had seen. my sighting of this object,i have been trying to compare with other sightings but to no avail.my friend is non believing in anything he has no immediate answer for. i have been trying to find any other ufo story similiar to mine to try and figure out more what i saw that day. i'm leaning more towards a government type of project.due to the show i have seen on invisible clothing on tech tv.and the new 007 movie with the invisible car.because the object had same type of appearance about it. in both of these instances,cameras projected images gathered from surrounding area of object and project it onto the item to make it appear invisible..also the movie with eddie murphy and the olsen guy.where the bad guys were selling the top secret jet that was invisible,for transporting the nuclear weapons.a chamealion type of cloaking device.i realize these are movie tricks.but to describe the appearance of what i saw in real life.i'll use those movies to create a visual for you. that is it.i hope to read some accounts from others who may help shed a light on this sighting i had,of an unidentifiable flying object.

On Saturday, January 4, 2003 I had a phone call from a witnesses who lives in the small community of Rosswood which is approximately 42 km north of Terrace, B.C. on Kalum Lake Drive  . I  found it hard to understand the witness due to their excitement over what she just observed. I asked her if she would slow down and repeat the information again to me. The woman explained that her and a passenger were driving along the highway against the Rosswood Mountain Range when they both watched three large circular white objects hovering near the peak of the range. The driver stopped the truck and they both watched the objects as they slowly descended down the mountain. She explained there is a small hill which sits in front of the mountain. The objects dropped down behind the smaller hill and both witnesses lost sight of them. She said they sat watching for a while just in case what ever it was they saw showed up once again. But that was it, what ever it was the folks saw, was gone. I asked approx: how long they observed the lights for. She said it must have been close to 3 minutes. I asked if she could determine the distance between each of the lights. From their vantage point, and a ""rough"" guess, she determined the lights may have been approx: 1/4 of a km a part, but she stressed that this was only a guess. I was also told that the lights were at a equal distance between each other, or at least so it seemed, the witness said. Anyway, I will be paying these folks a visit after the winter is over as I still have a few others to visit along the route between Terrace and Prince Rupert ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Brian Vike, independent UFO investigator in northern British Columbia, for sharing this report with NUFORC.

My mother who is/was a very down to earth person, not prone to seeing anything out of the ordinary and with an aversion to even a mention of the same woke the entire household with the most terrified and agressive -reaction scream imagineable .I felt at the time , that she was instinctively protecting her young with that scream. she said she had seen a man in the hallway as she got up to go to the toilet and that as she screamed he calmly walked away towards the back door which is not visible from that section of the hallway. The back door on inspection was locked, which would have been an unusual move by an intruder, not to mention his calmness,also our alsation dog did not bark which was even more unusual. My dad put a extra lock on the back door on the inside the very next day. Not long after this maybe a week or two I thought it was quite natural for me, and still did for 40yrs till last night, to go and sleep in the back room adjacent to the back door on JUST this one night I don't recall ever doing that before or since..What followed was the most terrifying ""dream"" of my entire life. I was sitting up looking out the window, I dont know why or for how long when two men approached the back door. I am filled with fear again just writing that but I will press on. One was tall, with blonde hair, normal looking except that his facial expression belied greater intelligence and knowledge as well as the following- impatience with the other fellow and certitude that they would succed this time and, that it was unquestionably necessary to do. The other fellow was shorter, seemed inferior. I dont remember their dress exactly but it was nothing out of the ordinary. It took about a second or two to register all this . The rest of the time as they came through the back door(not the door to my room  but the room next to it, the kitchen) I dont remember the actual mechanics of this entrance except that it seemed ""normal"" at the time I was occupyed being terrified beyond belief and trying incessantly with all my might to scream but my throat was paralysed frozen and nothing came out which terrified me even more because I could not get help.The next thing I remember was being in the exact same position,(sitting up in bed looking out the window)  but without fear completely relaxed but with a keen perception of missing time. the two were gone.Also conciously observing myself and from this concious self observation I was able to have a sense of something missing between that and the previous memory despite the fact that I was in exactly the same physical position. I felt that that had been planned that way.I could go on to detail subsequent ufo experiences including the exact same man in my adult life which then and through reading threw light on this first known experience but I'm afraid it would take too long.

Can't recall the exact area, but we were from Dover AFB and I recall several outings where troops of other scouts used the same site. Our troop consisted of all Air Force Base personell dependents, so we were all intimately familiar with the sights and sounds associated with aircraft and support equipment. As we were hiking the object approached from behind, 4 or 5 stories in height above us, silently.  It stopped above us and slightly ahead of our path.  Everyone with me turned and ran back to camp, which was a distance away, as I believe we had been hiking about a half an hour. I was fascinated with it and stayed and watched it.  It was a mechanical object, with clear textured details on it's dark grey surface of lines and fixture details you typically see on well represented craft in most scifi craft we depict today.  I would guess it was about 40 feet across.  The center of it's circumference was about 5 to 10 feet in height, and was lighted with multi colored light banks, that rotated around it's circumference.  I recall white, orange and green lights in equal rectangle sizes.  I vaguely recall a bank of clear window-like details above, but I can't remember this detail for sure.  Absolutely silent and with no discernable affect to my position, such as temperature or wind variance.  It was a still summer night, and I am guessing at the month, and may be off by a year at most.

I spun around and did'nt see anybody close to me. But within a second or two it caught my attention. There in the sky was an object which looked to me like a ""grey banana"" with the ends pointing up, and rocking to-and-fro on it's bottom arc like a rocking chair. We wathced it for 30-45 seconds then we took off.

We looked at it for a few seconds before we could comment and we decided itw as not a clound since the edges were crisp and there was some obvious 3 dimentionality to it. The object was just huge since we actually had to move our heads from left to right to see it end to end. Within 15 20 seconds the object seem to be shrinking horizontally in size till it just vanished. To our estimation the whole incident lasted not more than 30 seconds. We ran down to the school to report what we saw and a group of the other children were very exited when they say us we figured that they had also seen the object. To our surprise their exciment was due to the fact that my b! ody and I had been gone for over 2 hours and we had been missed at lunch head count. Fortunelly for us a Franciscan monk in charge of the school was very sympathetic and offered to call a local USA air base (Torrejon) to ask about the phenomenon. The base reported that there had been no scheduled test flights that day but were very interested in a personal report. We declined. After all this time I still wonder what happened in those 30+ seconds that misteriously turned in over 2 hours of missing time ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)),,,

The girl said look at that so I looked up and out the window in the back and I saw this saucer and the bottom was swirling and making a swirling sound it was spinning up near the water tower and it had a small part ontop of the saucer and there were three windows and the light was blinking from one window to the next it was grayish.  I thought I have to get to the drivers seat and get out of here and all the time I was thinking if I move something might happen but I got into the drivers seat when I started the engine the saucer went up in the sky within a fraction of a second and I could see it way up in the sky.  I saw this one airplane come across the sky towards it and the saucer went down and then another plane came from the other way and the saucer went up in between both planes, one plane above it and the other plane below it.  Then I started to go and the saucer seemed to move along with the car.  We went to get someone to bring them back to show them because no one would believe us.  We went to her house but no one was home and then we went to a store were I hung out with friends and no one was there and then to my house and no one was there.  My house was about a quarter mile from it so all I had to do was drive straight down my street which was next to the Delaware River across from Philadelphia the south part of Philadelphia.  A couple miles to the north was the main part of Philadelphia and south was the Phil. National Airport.  Across the river was industrial and docks and the Eagles football stadium.  As I drove down my street I would pass the town park and then onto another street there were about 10 oil tanks and then the industrial park were I saw the saucer.  I kept going down the street (ALL THIS WAS DURING NIGHT TIME) and I got half way past the oil tanks, which were along the river to my right, and just before the water tower I got scared and said to my friend that I can not go back there and I turned left onto this street and all of a sudden three of the brightist lights I ever saw came shinning in the back window.  It seemed as if the or what ever it was came from behind the oil tanks and from the river and it seemed as if it was in the air and shinning the lights down from up in the sky.  I put the gas peddle to the floor and took off as fast as the car would go.  I was about to come up to a cross street which was a major road and this intersection was one of the worst in town for accidents but I did not care I went through the stop sign and went right across the street and when I got to houses were people lived I felt safer and slamed on my brakes and got out to look and that fast there was no more lights.  I asked my girlfriend what happen and she said when I put the brakes on it went off to the right of us. Well, I have never seen another saucer but a lot of times I can hear that swirling sound out side in the sky when I am in the house and it is quite.  I asked the girl I was with at that time if she had ever seen one before and she said yes.  Its been over thirty years but I have never seen her again but I hope I run into her to ask her if she had seen anymore. jAlso my science teacher said it was probably a weather baloon and the lights we saw was from an airplane but an airplane could not fly that low. Everyone said were seeing things and never believed us but I believe there was something to back my story up to be true.  Like I said this happened in 1968 and around the early 1980's the government attack force of the USA, and they never told anyone the Mayor or Police Chief or anyone that the were going to do this, attacked the industrial building behind the water tower and next to the oil tanks.  I read it in the city news paper and when they attacked the building it woke up residents that lived down the street and a couple blocks away.  The governments answer was that they were just practicing. The building they attacked was a place called GAF which is strang because I read a group that deals with UFO's and the organization name is GAF. Also I read somewere that tin or alluminum was used for spacecrafts, which I do not know is true or not, but this building made alluminum siding and they said that there was contamination in the building which closed in the mid 1970's. Well, thats all I have to say. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,,

About a month ago, my brother called me out on the deck of my house (in the back).  He said, ""There is a UFO out here!""   I went out as fast as I could, since I am disabled and don't move very fast.  It took me about one minute to get out there...then I looked in the direction he was pointing (almost straight up).  Here is what I saw:  The object was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 as wide as a full moon.  It was definitely cigar-shaped and brilliant white.  It looked just like a fuselage of a jet with absolutely no wings.  It was traveling from about 030 deg (NNE) on a compass to about 210 (SSW), which is exactly perpendicular to my house as it is oriented.  (That is why I am so sure of the directional travel of the object)  I would estimate it was quite a ways up into the sky, approximately 3 to 5 thousand feet, although it is difficult to say with no other reference points.  The object made absolutely no sound.  The skies were clear blue.  It was near 7:00 P.M.   I first picked up the object at an inclination of about 80 degrees (azimuth 030) and followed it for about 3 minutes until it was at an inclination of about 50 degrees (azimuth 210).  It made no sudden acceleration or deceleration during the entire travel.  It then flashed BRILLIANT WHITE, so bright I lost sight of the shape of the object.  The flash was almost as big as a full moon!  About five seconds later it flashed a second time (identical to the first time).  Then the object just disappeared!  I have emailed a sketch of the object, but it really isn't very detailed as I didn't see much detail other than the shape of the object itself.  The sketch includes the object shape, the relation of a full moon in size, and the size of the 2 ""bursts of light"" that the object made, in relation to the size of the object.  This is the second time in my life I have seen something that is absolutely unexplainable in the sky.  (The first being in Mancelona, Michigan in 1978).  I used to be a UFO skeptic.  I still have not been convinced that these objects are extraterrestrial, but I can say with absolute certainty that there are ""unidentifiable objects"" traveling through the atmosphere of this planet.  I know there are more than one type since I have seen for myself two distinct shapes of these objects.  It is certainly well past time for our government to ""come clean"" on what they know about these objects.  If they think they are protecting us by cloaking their knowledge in secrecy they are mistaken.  The more data the researchers have to work with, the better the chance that these mysteries can be solved!",2003-07-16T00:00:00,37.03104027149321,-88.66938235294117

At 9:30 p.m. CDT, on May 23, 2003, a family of three (mother, father, and 23-year old son) were headed north on Highway 17 in Webster City, Iowa when they met and drove under a dark, slow-moving triangle (speed is estimated at only 15-20 mph, and the sighting was of 3 minutes duration) as it headed south above Highway 17.  The son estimates the triangle's altitude as only a few hundred feet in the air, and even though it was deep twilight, the sky was still light enough to not only see the triangle as it approached, but to also discern the structure as they drove beneath it.  [Weather conditions were as follows:  Clear, below 12,000 feet; Visibility 10 miles; Temperature 57 degrees Fahrenheit; Wind out of the East at 6 mph]  Bright orange lights were observed at each angle of the object, although those lights did not illuminate the structure nor surrounding area.  The family observed what seemed to be a lighter gray circular area on the underside of the structure, with some sort of line, or stripe, or structural component leading from each angle in toward the circle in the middle.  With the car radio turned off and the window rolled down, the family could hear no sound associated with the object.  After meeting the object and driving beneath it, the family turned off on a side street and circled back around the block (while doing so, trees blocked their view) so that they were now back on Highway 17, only now they were headed south -in the same direction as the triangle had been moving - but by this time, the triangle was nowhere in sight.  The bright orange lights they had observed as the object approached (during this 3-minute sighting) had actually seemed a bit dimmer as they drove beneath the object, and the family theorized that perhaps the orange lights at the three angles were situated toward the top of the triangle rather than closer to its underside.  ""Apparent"" size estimate is that the object looked to be about the size of three full moons.  The family has indicated that they are not looking f! or any public attention regarding this incident.

The duration of observation is 4 minutes. The written witness:  ""I take a few moments to report the observation of a UFO phenomenon I have just witnessed last night. I am not someone who indulges in tellinh his personal stories but in this case I consider that it is my duty to share my experiment in order to help someone else or quite simply to get some hints and have someone tell me what I saw because I am still disturbed by it this morning on my arrival in Montreal.""  ""I left from Chicoutimi at about 2:10 A.M. to drive to Montreal. The night is hot and the moon strongly lights the forest of the park of Laurentides. When I arrived between the junction of Alma and L'Etape two lengthened and vers luminous elliptic discs fly over the forest on my left at approximately 50 meters of my vehicle. I start to observe them without quitting them from the eyes and I completely open the window to make sure that they are not reflections or something like that and they follow me during a lomg moment. The light which surrounds the two UFOS is whitish and their movement is very particular. They make abrupt movement and move fast laterally and ahead. I can perfectly see the two UFOS during approximately 10 seconds then they disappear a split second to reappear during a moment. I wondered during one moment if they followed my car because they followed me like this during approximately 4 minutes which were very long for me. Then whereas the two UFOS in the shape of lengthened discs follow me laterally, I see two other UFOs ahead which are movin in the opposite direction to join them and thus make a formation with 4 in rhombus, which move strangely with sharp and precise movements but always with logic. Approximately at the third minute there are not two only to move above the forest, but four luminous discs. The feeling I have at this this moment is both fear and amazement but I do not want to pull up for two reasons; firstly to not lose sight of them, then by pure fear that if they also immobilize their movements I would have quite simply lost my nerves. Thereafter, the four UFOs came above the road during a few seconds in front of my car (approximately at 70m), then directed themselves again to the forest on my left. Whereas I lost sight of them I see at the same time interval 5 seconds) a plane, helicopter or another apparatus which comes by in the North at the same place where I observed the UFOs, the pilot of this craft probably saw the phenomenon because he was at the heart of the p! henomenon also. The size of the UFOs was of approximately the length of three long cars (could be smaller) and they flew relatively low at the tree top at certain moments.""  ""I do not write this story for the pleasure but to have answers to my questions, what I saw this night. If someone saw the same observations than myself this same night in the park of Laurentides please please let it be known (I believe that I crossed 10 vehicles in the 200 km of the park and none during the observations). a second question annoys me a lot, which was this craft at low altitude seen at the same time when I lost sight of the four UFOs, was this a plane, a helicopter or something else. If somebody can have access to the possible flights of aircraft at 2:55 in the morning in this sector of the park of Laurentides there are strong chances that the pilot saw the UFO phenomenon and could testify about it but who knows who this craft belongs to. One thing is certain is that if I have had a video camera people could have be shown a spectacular display who would have upset them, nevertheless I reported it back the best than I can and if somebody can enlight me do not hesitate to write to me.""

The Marines had a machine gun nest on top of the hanger, and would walk the flight line with pump shot guns, 45's, and a prick 25 field radio. Our orders from a full bird AF Col., were to shoot to kill anyone within a double chain link fence, with tall hedges in between the fences. AF Air police would guard the outside of the perimeter. One evening while I was half way down the flight line, a Black Bird was coming in almost gliding to a landing.

We had finished seeing the movie and I was about to drive away when I saw an enormous, bright white round light coming around the side of a nearby mountain (small mountain, but bigger than hill).  I pointed it out to the others and we discussed whether it was a logging truck (no roads there, besides it was to the side of the mountain) or the moon (moon was in a different position).  Scared the living daylights out of us and I sped the car over to the, by now, only remaining vehicle - a family in a station wagon with kids.  I yelled at them to look and they took off like bats out of hell.  I was quickly on their heels. What is intriguing about this is that we all lived in Fernie and gossip was a way of life in a small town.  We never discussed this after.  About 13 - 15 yrs. later, I remembered it and mentioned it to one of the women who was there and she seemed to think it was a logging truck. I know what I saw and there was no logging truck that could hang off the side of a mountain and certainly no truck could've produced lights that size.  (There was only one light.  On the form above, I ticked off 1 craft buy we never actually saw a craft - only this enormous white ball.) Whatever it was, was moving very slowly around the mountain.  It was awesome and terrifying at the same time. There were a lot of UFO sightings in Fernie, witnessed by many credible people, including RCMP officers.  When Cranbrook airport was called after these events, one would be told that nothing had appeared on the radar screens. Since that event, I have experienced many paranormal experiences.

She was at the ""Mile High Drive In"" theater in Denver, Colorado.   Although my wife doesn't remember the year, she does remember that the movie playing was ""Dr Zchivago"".  Everyone there suddenly saw a huge flying saucer slowly rising up behind and somewhat to the left of the screen.  Everyone got out of their cars and watched as this thing slowly rose, with lights circling its perimeter, then came to a complete standstill, hovering.  As they continued to watch it just sit there, it eventually then tilted to a 45-degree angle and then suddlenly just ZIPPED out of sight in the blink of an eye.  Everyone was astounded.  That's it.  And of course she's been a believer ever since.  There is, however, an interesting little footnote to this event... About a year ago, my wife was watching an old UFO docu-drama on tv, and some lecturer or news reporter described exactly the event she witnessed.

I was playing in the yard at night with three other children who lived in the house next door. This was in Kent in the 1970's and it was very rural and quiet there.  It was a very still and clear night. We were playing hide and seek and happened to be in a group in the center of the yard. I was about 12. The other boy, ((name deleted)), was my age and his twin sisters were about 10. The yard is surrounded by dense trees so it is impossible to see more than 50 yards in any one direction. Basically, the only way to look any distance is staight up. We were standing there and a flying object came over so low I remember it was maybe a couple hundred yards higher than the tallest elm trees.  It was multicolored and disc shaped. The multicolors seemed to spin as if the disc was spinning. But I remember that just the colors were spinning. The craft itself was not spinning and this was evident because flames were shooting out the back.  Just like the short report I just read, it was very silent except for a deep muffled sound which sounding like flames burning. It flew right over the house and disappeared.

Right before the intersection with McCully Rd., I noticed a bright white light to my right, above some trees. At first, I assumed it to be a helicopter with bright lights on, so I turned off my radio, put my window down, & slowed down to investigate further. There was no sound, and if it was a helicopter, it would have made a noise, judging by the fact that it was no higher than 200 feet or so above the trees. It was at a standstill, and did not move, but changed colors from red to green to blue to white along the ""equator"" of the object. I live only 2 minutes away, so I thought I would see it at home as well, but when I got there, I looked in that direction, & there was nothing.

I went downstairs to unplug the TV and stereo because I know they are usually at risk when a surge of power hits when power is restored. I also grabbed some candles.

When I finally stepped outside, there was no storm that knocked out the power - actually, there was not a single sound at all - not even crickets or passing cars. The vehicle was probably 300-600 feet up (but hard to say exactly) and moved erratically but seemed to be hovering. It would wobble to the left and right and below it were two independent blue-ultra/violet-blue strobing halos that made the bottom of the vessel glow in this eerie blue.

I received a report from a very kind and helpful lady on July 1, 2003. She was looking for possible answers over what her and her husband witnessed at the beginning of June at 9:00 p.m. in Ardmore Tennessee, United States. Also the witnessed talked with a friend shortly afterwards, explaining what the couple saw. To the witnesses surprise her friend also said she noticed the same bright light on the same evening at the same time when she was outside, but never gave it much thought until the witnesses brought the topic up. I hope I can come up with some kind of answer for the witnesses to this event.  Report & Update below:  I have been looking for something for almost a month now, to help me understand what we saw one night. We live in Southern Tennessee USA, in the central part.  My husband and I were coming home about 9:00 PM, and as we started down the road towards our home, I got a glimpse  of a very bright light off to the north of us, not very high up, over the tree tops, it was more of a glowing or illumination...not a reflection!  I told my husband to look, and as he looked up, he said it was a plane.  I told him that it was not and since it was moving slow, I was gonna follow it, and we did.  We took back roads and tried to keep it in site, at one point, we went down a dirt road and it looked like it just hovered above the trees, maybe 1500 feet or so.  It was a giant egg shape.  At first I thought it was a blimp, and as of yet, I am not sure what it was.....one thing for sure, it was something I had never seen before.  There was no sound at all, and it was moving very slowly.  Not once did it speed up.  As it moved out of sight, we had to drive a short distance to be able to see it again, and it was moving to the South west....still not making a sound.  As we got into town, where we could see it better, it was moving further away, and appeared to be going higher.   Other people had to have seen it, but nothing was ever mentioned in the papers or to the police.  About 2 weeks later, I was talking to a friend who lives in the area and told her about it, and it jogged her memory to the same night, she went outside, and just looked up and seen a bright light, and wondered what it was, but never thought nothing else about it.  I have tried to find out what a blimp looks like at night in the sky, and I can't find anything.  I wanted to call the airport in Huntsville Ala, and see if they seen anything on radar, but my husband said, ""They probably wouldn't tell you if they did."" So I didn't call them.  Can you help me out,  what do you think it was?  Anything you can tell me, I would appreciate it. Thank You. (name deleted by HBCC UFO Research)  Update: I asked a number of questions in hopes of trying to get a better idea of what the folks saw that evening. Below is the witnesses response.  Thanks for the answer to my email.  I will try to answer the questions as well as possible.  It took place about the first part of June, of this year 2003.,about 9:00 PM.  The weather had been rainy for a few days, but it was rather clear that night, during that time.  From the time we spotted the light, until we lost sight of it, was about 30 minutes, I think.  Maybe 45, with all the driving up and down dirt roads and trying to find it again when it would go behind the trees and hills.  At one time when we seen it hovering, we had driven down a hill on a dirt road, and it was off to our left, hovering above the trees, if I held out my arm and measured the length of it between my index finger and thumb, it would have probably been about an inch and half to 2 inches in length.  (My arms are short also)  When we seen it hovering, we could not make out any details on it, it was just bright, no sound, no flashing lights, no indications of windows or anything like that.  It was just so bright, I don't see how anyone didn't see it.  The town we live in, is Ardmore Tennessee, which borders the state of Alabama also.  Interstate 65 runs north and south. And the town of Ardmore is located on the line.  As we drove into town, so we could get a better look, due to the horizon line, we noticed that no one even acted like they seen it.  The teens were cruising the strip and not even noticing what was going on.  As we entered the town, the road we were on was coming from the north east., and the object had moved across town and was headed to the West, southwest.  My friend that seen the light, lives south west of Ardmore, and she only briefly got a glimpse of the bright light, they have a lot of trees there and she couldn't see it at all, just a light in the sky, through the trees.  The bright light was like the color of a fluorescent light, kind of glowing.  Putting off a lot of light around it.  I said it was egg shaped, more of an oval, with the egg lying on its side, not standing up.  When it hovered over the trees, it wasn't long, rather, we stopped and looked at it, maybe 2 minutes, and then we drove off, trying to get a better look, as it started moving slowly again.  It never made a sudden movement, and never sped up, unless it did so while we were driving to get a better look.  The path it took, seemed to be straight.  We were the ones going in circles.  I was in awe, I have always been amazed at these things, and although people have made fun of me, I know my husband seen it with me that time.  When we finally got out of the woods and back up on top of the hill coming into town, it was headed on to the west, southwest.  And getting to far off to see it good, but you could still see the bright light.  It was just getting farther away, and my husband wanted to come home, and quit chasing something we may not want to catch.  Usually when something odd is in the sky, the meteorologist say something about it on the news at 10:00 that night, but not a single word was said.  Especially Adrian Gibson on channel 31 in Huntsville Ala. where we get most of the weather conditions.  That's why my husband said it was probably a blimp.  I got on the Internet and tried to look up pictures of blimps at night, and nothing came up....that was any help. My friend said she didn't see anything that she could speak of, except the light.  She didn't see the object.  So I guess we will have to go on my word.  Attached is a drawing I did to kind of show you how it appeared at first. Thanks again (name deleted by HBCC UFO Research)  The statement below referrers to a computer drawing the witness sent to me which gave me a better idea of where they were when they spotted the object.

It was perfectly silent, I got my dog to stop barking for a minute, I opened the door, and heard no sound at all. He started barking again, and as I watched this object, it just disappeared! My dog stopped barking when it disappeared. My boyfriend had been in his office, and I had said nothing to him about this. I went to the TV to see if there was something on the news, meanwhile I heard my boyfriend say, ""What's that thing out there?"" Then he said, ""This thing out there was up in the sky and it just shot a white laser-like beam of light down to the ground, then disappeared!"" He described the same object that I had seen. I went to the door, and saw thatt he car was gone, or at least his headlights were off. I had checked the news after that, and there was nothing about that. I have not gone to the park to see if it left any signs in the snow, and don't want to, really, thugh someone should, I guess. After the object had disappeared, I noticed the normal air traffic had returned. Planes usually appear as tiny pinpricks of light, as do stars, but this was as big as a thumbnail held out full stretch.",2003-03-21T00:00:00,41.5606,-73.2062

I was recently on vacation near Paphos on the island of Cyprus, and at sunset on June 14 (approx 20.00hrs local time) I witnessed an unusual event in the proximity of the setting sun.  The sky was completely clear and free of cloud, and the horizon in my view was the calm Mediterranean Sea to the West of my hotel balcony.  The event itself took the form of two intensely bright lights (one a pinpoint and the other a streak or slim cigar shape). Both were located a few degrees to the upper-right of the setting sun. The pinpoint was at approx ""2 o'clock"" to the sun. The bright streak (slim cigar shape) of light, was situated a few degrees to the right of the pinpoint (also at around ""2 o'clock"") with its left end slightly inclined toward the horizon.  Both lights remained stationery and continued to emit an intensely brilliant white light for several minutes, both before and after the sunset. The pinpoint then suddenly dimmed and disappeared.  Approx two minutes later, the streak of light dimmed suddenly and disappeared, leaving behind it for a few millisceonds a brownish streak of exactly the same proportions.  However, some ten seconds later, the brilliant streak of light reappeared in roughly the same position (possibly a few degrees to the right), and it remained intensely bright for approx. half a minute more. At this point, the streak of brilliant white light suddenly dimmed and disappearing as before, leaving for a fleeting moment, a brownish imprint of itself against the turquoise sky.  Soon after first noticing the lights, I attempted to film them using my camcorder. However, the camcorder refused to give me a clear picture, even though it was switched to auto-focus. I therefore switched it to manual focus, but the image didn't improve.  Frustrated, I then discarded the camera and decided to watch the event with the naked eye.  As a point of interest, my partner Jenny also saw the above mentioned lights and, without prompting from me, she independently described them in exactly the way I have described them to you.  I reported my sighting by telephone to the Cyrpus Mail newspaper office in Nicosia on the following Tusday morning (I spoke to a reporter called George).  However, he'd had no other reports at that time. I gave him my hotel address and invited him to contact me if he required additional information.  I had no further contact from him.  Nearly three weeks on, I am now back home in England, but I am still deeply puzzled as to the nature of what I witnessed on June 14.  I am a writer by profession, and I'm always keen to get to the bottom of a mystery.

Dear Brian Vike  My wife and I live on the SE coast of Puerto Rico. I am a former U.S. Infantry officer, and 3,000 hour commercial pilot.  We are in the habit of sitting on our roof at night talking and looking at the sky- it's cooler & breezier up there, and less buggy.  About 3 months ago we had an interesting experience that I'd like you to comment on, if possible.  At about 11 p.m. on a clear night, we both became aware, simultaneously, of 3 ruby-red lights, bright and distinctly visible, like car tail-lights or red aircraft nav lights, approaching us from south to north, right to left as we viewed them, in a symmetric V formation, one leading and two trailing. After 3 seconds of this motion, the 3 lights diverged, the lead light continuing straight, each of the trailing lights turning 90 degrees away from the original direction of motion. The lights passed more or less overhead as they made this divergence, then they didn't fade away into the distance but simply vanished out of sight in about  2 seconds. Literally, like poof, they're gone. It was stunning!  It was a clear night with no other air traffic. The experience lasted 5 seconds, and we both subsequently agreed that we had observed exactly the same phenomenon. There was absolutely no sound, and no other lights visible. There was no way of judging altitude of the lights, but we had the ""impression"" that they were several thousand feet above sea level, and that the rate of movement must have been extremely rapid. I have seen    F-4s fly directly overhead, and have observed a very large number of other aircraft movement over the years, and I can tell you without hesitation that those 3 lights were moving significantly faster than any aircraft in my experience, and in complete silence.  If you care to comment, I'm curious if this account sounds familiar to you, which is to ask, have other people witnessed anything similar? And what do you suppose those bright red lights were attached to??  Thanks, and cheers! (HBCC UFO has deleted the witnesses personal information)  I would like to thank this witness for the report.

Then it got slower and slower, almost a complete stop, that's when I opened my window to see if I could hear any sound and I couldn't. Then it flashed a big bright white, yellowish light and made a sharp left turn and moved faster towards the North, the light fading as it moved. I lost sight of it over the high buildings in the downtown area. Do you know of any aircraft that has this kind of lighting and can move like that? I would appreciate any information that you might have. Thanks  ""Addition Information""  I should tell you that I first spotted it when I was in a taxi cab on my way home from work.  I just glance up and saw this blue light and before I could take a better look we took a turn and It was above us so the roof of the cab blocked the view. It was just above Granville bridge as high as a small plane that's why I took it to be a plane and didn't think about again until I came home and saw it again through my window and it was moving from the west going towards the east.  2. I remember really taking a good look at this light moving and trying to make out any shape against the dark sky and thought that I did see something besides this light like a shape but couldn't make it out and it also seemed to have a very tiny faint light in front of the blue light but I'm not sure about that  I would say I watched it for about 7 seconds before it turned bright and turned, then another 5 seconds watching it fade and move towards the North.  3. Yes I would say pea size when blue but it expanded when it flashed bright and at that time it would be dime size and then back to pea size when it move away.  4. Altitude would be the same as a small plane. The same altitude of the planes when the Symphony of fireworks are here. Ten thousand feet?  5.  No one else was with me in my apartment at the time and when I was in the cab I didn't ask the cab driver to look because he was driving and I thought it was a plane. Surely someone else in the downtown area saw it too. People on their balconies facing it would see it but would they say report it? I don't know.

I left my home in Wabash, Indiana at  approximately 8:00 p.m. en route to Kokomo,In. to see my girlfriend. I was on bypass 24 east around the area of the city Peru gazing up at the sky  in front and to the sides of  the vehicle. Plenty of stars were out and i always notice venus, which i know is commonly mistaken for ufo's. Well, after about 20 minutes i notice to the upper left corner (drivers side) a luminous bright yellow light of significant size glowing and just hovering there like i've never seen before. I would guess it to be just a little above a radio tower in it's reference to height in the sky.This yellow light had definately captured my attention to the fullest. Ok, so trying to drive and keep my eye on it without accident, it faded out for maybe a minute before glowing again. It did this a couple of times for reasons i don't know before 3 more of the same size lights appeared to  what would be the right of  whatever it was. These other 3 yellow lights (which  were all in the same size)  luminated in what i would describe in junction to the original light as going up in a quarter moon fashion. They stayed on only briefly before giving  what i'm calling a blink in order from the first yellow to the fourth yellow and then it was done. I did turn left on county road 550 to try and get closer if not locate it after it faded but had no results. I have to admit that i am a believer in the ufo phenomenon and when i witnessed this it really made me nervous! It is really hard to say exactly where it was, but i do know that it was close to the Grissom Air Force Reserve Base in Bunker Hill, Indiana (roughly about 10 miles from where i was at the time) to make me wonder if it was montoring activity if any  going on there. I did notice a reasonalbe amount of airplanes around so i knew i could dismiss the fact that it wasn't a plane. The planes were much smaller and appeared to be higher.  After i reached my destination i told my encounter to my girlfr! iend wit h her knowing my interst in this she could tell that i was shaken . I never reported this to any law enforcement, media or the base, but now i wish i would have. I don't imagine they could have giving me any answers because there are a  lot of skeptics, but i need someone to know that understands just what so many people are witnessing on a astonishing basis.

Reading one of your past reports from July 31, 2000 at 9:24 am jogged my memory and I thought I'd add this to your database. Back when I was in high school, my father and I were out in the yard one evening around 9:30, using a telescope I had recently gotten.  My dad was looking down at the the telescope, trying to adjust it, but I was looking nearly due west and about 75 degrees up from horizontal, over the top of our house.  Suddenly a very large, spherical fireball, about twice the size of a full moon, seemed to drop into the sky and roll to the west across an invisible shperical dome, then vanish as if had burned out.  That was the most amazing sight.  There was no sound, no enormous amount of light (just a soft orange color), no blast.  It seemed to all take place at extremely high altitude.  The event lasted about 1 second, but was burned into my mind.  My father never saw anything.  In my own mental analysis, it seemed to me that something had entered the atmosphere and exploded at extremely high altitude.  I figured the invisible dome I mentioned, to be the curve of the atmosphere and that the fireball just rolled off of it.  One detail I clearly recall is that the fireball had a ""firey"" texture to it, much the same as the texture seen on close-up photos of the sun.  There was no residual contrail, etc. left behind by the event. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-12-23T00:00:00,43.1092,-74.8642

As it slowed futher the zig zaging of the craft became much more radical until it was making large sweeping switchback turns going from a speed of several thousand miles per hour to about one thousand miles per hour. We were witnessing this from a distance of about one mile away. The craft looked intensely bright at it's core. As it leveled off at the tree line in the dense forest that it was flying into one would have thought that it would light up the whole forest around it. However it did not emit this light out because as it disappeared in and out of the dense forest that it was zig zagging in and out of, it dissapeared totally and then reappeared with no light projecting on to the trees. So it didn't project light as we know it. It looked extremely bright at it's core but the light did not emit out beyond that core. It had the ability to zig zag in and out of heavy black timber at a speed of nearly one thousand miles per hour. It didn't bump any trees or make a single sound of any kind.

Suddenly I saw a large, silver cylinder object streaked across the autobahn down the road ahead of me, going east.  It seemed to skim the tree tops.  There was no sound at all:  Nothing like an approaching aircraft, helicopter, etc.  This siting happened very quickly because of the incredible speed the UFO crossed the autobahn.  I did not see any wings, nose, or windows, and did not think it was an airplane then or now, especially because of the speed and the fact that it was flying so low.  I immediately asked my ex-husband if he saw the object, but he was either looking another way or dozing, I cannot rememember.  He certainly did not hear anything.  It occurred to me the UFO could be a Pershing II missile test launch, but it was far to large and the Pershing IIs in West Germany at that time were black.  I did not report this siting to anyone, but I know what I saw and it was very odd. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-12-23T00:00:00,,

It’s been some time since this occurred, so I am guessing as to the exact date.  However, I remember the event quite clearly. I was in high school and attending a band practice. It was a very clear night, and quite dark.  We were outside practicing our marching under the parking lot lights.   --- For what ever reason, a few friends and I noticed a small light in the sky.  The light was silent and did not blink or flash.  At first, the light seemed to be a slow moving, high altitude plane, flying in an easterly(?) direction, and quite unremarkable.  However, after approximately 30 seconds of observing the light, it appeared to change direction and start flying strait up.  This upward direction was not apparent at first, however as we watched this object, it appeared to become smaller and the light dimmer.  Finally after about 1 to 2 minutes we could no longer view the object.  This seemed quite odd, and many of us were speculating what we had just seen.    What happened next made it even more interesting. A short time later, after the light disappeared, 5 planes flying in formation, appeared from the east(?). (Unsure of the exact direction.)  They did not appear to be flying as high as the light we had witnessed and we could hear their engines.  They appeared to be some type of military jet and were moving quite quickly.  These planes flew to the location where we had last seen the light. The planes then broke formation and seemed to be searching the area.  One plane appeared to fly strait up, the others spread out, a started flying in a wide circular pattern.   After a few moments, the planes regrouped and headed back the direction they came from. That was the end of the event.  From the time we initially saw the light until the time the jets left the area was no more than 10 to 12 min. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A movement in the sky caught my attention. I saw a barely discernable oval  of light moving in the North Eastern sky. The source of the light appeared to be behind the cloud. Then I noticed a second, identical oval of light. They looked like two dim searchlights and they moved around each other in large circular patterns, giving the impression that they were dancing performing a dance. In size they appeared to be like two small moons, but much, much dimmer. They were so dim that I wondered were my eyes playing tricks on me. I watched them until I entered the station. Down on the platform I looked to see if they were still moving around in the North Eastern corner of the sky, they were. As I'm a little short sighted I thought I had better get a second opinion. Pointing Northwest I asked a man standing on the platform if he could see the lights. He said he did and made some comment on UFOs and left it at that. My train arrived 5 minutes later. The journey to my station took about 7 minutes. My wife was waiting for me with the car. I looked North East.

I was looking out the window at the time. The sky was blue, and there were no clouds. The winds were calm as well. Then, I noticed an egg-shaped object that was slowly moving at about 15 MPH in a northerly direction, horizontally. It was about 150 feet above the water. Its distance from me was approximately less than a mile. I took my headphones off and got out of my room and continued to observe the object which seemed to be a goldish copper. The sun glistened on the front of the object, reflecting the light as if the object was made of some sort of metal.Another curious thing that I noticed was that there was no sound coming from it as it moved. It was perfectly silent. No type of engine was protruding from the object and I could hear the birds chirping in the trees. The object continued it's slow, northerly track until it disappeared from view. The event lasted approximately three minutes at the most. I am a believer of UFOs and have had dreams about them. However, I took the position of a skeptic and rationalized the event as I watched the object, and asked myself the following questions: is it a new type of private or commercial airplane, hot air balloon, helicopter, a blimp, a cloud, a new type of weather balloon, a hanglider. None of these applied to this object. All the crafts I have mentioned could have been easily identified had they been at the location where the object was traveling because we were always able to see Cessnas and helicopters fly close by, and we could hear them over a mile away.

Having a love of astromony at the time (and currently) I pulled out my favorite starchart and looked to see if it was a conjunction, venus, jupiter etc. It wasn't. It was very clear out and it being extremely bright(the light) yet twinkling. ANd according to the chart it wasn't any fixed star either. I watched it until the sun rose. Approxamtly 2 hours or so. And it did not move from it postion whatsoever. I knew then that the celetial sphere should have moved it. NOW, it was daylight and the thing was 'still' visible. Still twinkiling wildly. Later that day I mentioned it to my mother. She asked me to get her if I saw it again. And the next morning I woke up without prompting and there it was. I got up, brought over to see it. We watched it until the sun rose. This time I pulled out my 'kids' telescope and we took turns looking at it. I can't recall the final magnification we used but this is what we both saw. (the resolution was not the best) But it appeared to be oval or disk like in shape, appeared to have lights on the leading edge, red and blue/or greenish. ALthough I assume it was somewhat distored from the heat inside the room and the outside cold air. We also saw what looked like 3 other pinpoints of light coming from and going back to the light. Making thier way down 'in a zig-zag like movement' then another returning... This just continued for hours. This occured for 5 mornings straight. I only wish I got up earlier to see when it came visible. The perspective of our 'point of view' would land the light hovering either between 'Lake Ariel' to as far as 'Moscow/Gouldsboro' Pa..

It was definitely in the fall of 1987.  I was a junior in high school at that time and on one particular evening my astronomy class went to the observatory on the Yankton College campus.  That campus is now a federal prison.  That evening was very clear and I don't think there was much of a moon.  Our assignment was to look through the telescope and then write down on our sheet how many rings we could see around Saturn, moons around Jupiter, etc.  When I had finished my assignment I went back outside and stood with the other students on the hill on which the YC observatory is located.  There were maybe 10-12 of us there all talking about whatever when several of us just became suddenly quiet as an isosceles triangle shaped object in the sky to the west moved through our line of sight south to north.  It had no lights and made no sound.  Its only discernable feature was that it seemed to distort the sky behind it and the light of the stars it passed in front of in relation to us; kind of like heat waves rising off the pavement.  There were no additional colors.  Even though I can't describe the actual aircraft the shape of the visible distortion was definitely an isosceles triangle moving in the direction of the angle made by the two equal sides.  The base, or the back of the object in relation to its direction of movement, was a little longer than the two equal sides.  The translucent nature of the object makes it difficult to determine speed, size, or distance with accuracy.  The YC campus(Yankton Federal Prison) is not very big and is in a residential area.  From where we were standing on the hill the object didn't seem to be more than a few blocks away at an altitude of 200 feet, possibly lower.  At arms length it was aproximately 5-6 inches from top to bottom and 3.5 to 4 inches from front to back.  I did not get the impression that this was an extremely large aircraft.  When I caught site of the object I was facing southwest, and it moved! straigh t north until it was out of sight in five or six seconds.  Since it was night time and the object had no lights this probably wasn't a great distance, so it was most likely not moving incredibly fast.  Yankton is a smaller town so there aren't as many street lights as there are in bigger areas.  If this was not the case the object may have gone completely unseen.  Myself and possibly six or seven other people witnessed this event.  At this time I can only remember one or two who could corroborate this story. Even though this happened fifteen years ago those  five or six seconds are burned into my memory like a movie clip that I can replay.  I've never seen anything like it since.

As we passed a pond locally known as ""Stinky Pond"" due to stagnant water in mid-summer we pulled over ((deleted)) when one of us (I don't remember who) notiticed an enormous craft immediatly above us in the sky.  It was approximately 50 to 100 feet above the tree line and moving west at a very slow speed (2-3mph?).  In any case, I stood outside of the care, and Adam was still in it behind the drivers wheel as the craft moved directly over us.  The UFO was apprximately 200 to 300 feet across (absolutely enormous), and made virtualy no sound as it basically just sat above us (it was big enough that I could barely notice it moving when it was diriectly overhead).  As I remember, it had a number of white lights toward the out parimeter, and one or more colored lights (I was too in awe to remeber exact details but I think it was one redish light in the center).  In either case I suddenly realized I was looking at something extrordinary, and had a definite feeling that whoever or whatever was above me was looking at me as I was looking at the ship (perhaps a conditioned feeling from various UFO stuff I had seen in the past). I had  a definite impulse to get out of there.  ((name deleted)) was of the same mind , and regretably we left as a result of some instinctual fear.  The rest of the way home we spoke little except to try to figure out whether what we just saw was a bonified UFO or possible a high level military project with technology way-way beyond anything we previously would have considered possible.  We both agreed the white lights gave it a man made quality, but then we also agreed that regardless of how advanced something may be, if there was a need or desire to put any kind of lighting on a craft then why not white.  The bottom line is that me and my friend witnessed a craft approximatelly 200 to 300 feet wide from node to node (I can't give a more accurate estimate as it just completely engulfed ! the sky above me), and the thing was moving at a barely perceptable speed, and made little or no sound.  I say little or no sound because I kind of remeber a really low hum like that of an air conditioner, but it's been so long that I can't be sure. In any case, I personally would not be sharing this (as I do not care whether it was military or extraterestial as I believe the first is probably far more advanced than I would imagine, and the second is a given when considering the likelihood), but I am sharing as I plan on being hyptnotized so as I can remember it better as time has made the memory less clear, and it was just absolutely too cool to let the details become blurred.  In addition, I also want to get hyptnotized so that I can compare my description under hypnosis to those of a recent show I saw on the Discovery Channel which descibed a very similiar craft.  Before I get hyptnotized I am willing to take a lie detector test and recount the sighting in as much detail as I can remember for those who feel that it is important to prove to the world what most of us just know makes sense anyhow. If you would like to contact me about this please do so in the next couple of months before I get Hypnotized as hypnotism will diminish the the validity of any lie detector test.

I was out in my grandmother's yard (she owned an acre of land at the time) and as i was playing i froze. there was a paralyzing sound all around me. It was like a throbbing hum and it felt like it was rubbing against my eardrums. I didn't move, all i could hear was the this one noise. I really don't know how to describe it, it was as if i were caught in a wall of sound. the noise soon passed and everything was back to normal.

And the Chicago tower has identified it as an unidentified flying object.  (He did not use the acrynom UFO). I was sitting in a window seat on the right side of the plane and looked out the window.  I didn't see anything except absolute blackness.  Then I saw three small specks of light in a triangle formation in the far distance.  In less than a minute, these lights had gotten brighter and larger as they quickly moved towards the plane, in straight line.  It was as though they had been catapaulted closer.  Then they stopped moving and appeared to be stationary, moving at the same speed as the plane and maintaining the same distance from the plane.  They appeared to move with us as the moon does in the night sky.  Then as quickly as they appeared, the lights suddenly started moving away.  The movement curved a little bit as they moved away.  They moved very fast but not so fast as to cause a streak in the sky.  The lights just got smaller they moved further into the distance.  Then finally fading into the dark sky. I have told my daughter, who was a toddler at the time about this story.  I'm not sure she believes me or others I have shared this story with. I'm not sure if O'Hara Airport reports these sightings by commercial aircraft, but I am a witness to one such event which they were aware of.  Does the FAA make such reports?

I slowed WAY down to about 15MPH so I could take a good look at it.  It was a clear blue sky and no planes, helicopters, birds, no noise....nothing else in the sky near where I was looking.  I should mention that I wasn't look up I was looking almost straight out of my car window at it.  For the most part it was dark in color but reflecting some light towards me since the sun was going down in the west.  I was totally excited because first of all I have heard of things just like this but never seen one till now and second it was only about 40 feet from my car during the day light.  No strange lights in the sky with this one. It was an actual object there that wasn't there when I went back 2 minutes later.  I ride this bridge every single day (back and forth) so I'm very familiar with what is going on.  There were no lights on it but there was something strange on it.  At the very top of the upside down triangle it had what looked like a round dish shape thing.  I stared at it for about 20 seconds total before the cars behind me started to approach.  You can't stop on the bridge since it's only one lane now with all the construction going on.  I watched it in my side view mirror as it continued to levitate there about 10 feet off the side of the bridge.  I took the first exit and headed down to the Kone tower which is on the east side of the bridge to see if I could find it again.  After the exit I lost sight of it an! d never saw it again.

Using a long exposure soaks up whatever light is in the sky, even stuff you don't see with the naked eye.  For example, keeping the shutter open for ten seconds over a solid blue sky could reveal distinct, clear clouds once the photograph is developed (or you view the digital photos, such as mine).  The object was definitely stationary because otherwise it would have been streaked.  It wasn't a reflection or something stuck on the lens because it would have shown up in other pictures.  Also, as the position of the camera changed, the object remained in the same place.  There's a small, very faint, circle of light surrounding it.

It was a long time ago in Russia. I was about 6 (i am now 17). But by looking at my age don't turn away, i remember it quite clearly. Mum and i lived in a 10 storey flat and we were on the 8th floor. One night we went to our friends party in the same building and later came back with my friends for a sleep over. We were lying down in the loundge room and i was on the floor facing the window. We talked for a quite a bit that night and i didn't take notice of the time but the sun was gone and the sky turned dark blue. In the background i saw only the horison of the city and the dark blue skyes. About a minute or two after we all went quite but i kept looking at the window. Then i saw a large black object fly past our window and i said ""guys, look!"". I wasn't dreaming that's for sure. Every body hopped out of their beds like an alarm had just went off. Sure enough they've seen it but i layed there on the floor asking them what it was but they told me not to worry, yet they were talking about it the next day. I believe that by the time they got up and ran to see it, the object would have took off. Becasue it was getting darker i only saw the outline of the object so i couldn't have been able to determine the shape of the object from top but by what it looked like from the side and comparing it to all the other ufo's i would have to say that it was a sauser. The object was made up of the main body which was oval but had sharper ends (more like two dinner plates joined together) and a semi sphere on top (may have been the cocpit). The diameter of the sauser was around 4-6 metres and in height about 2-3 metres. At the base of the semi shpere (cocpit) were different flashing coloured lights, spaced out about 40-60cm from each other. The sauser was traveling at about our window level as if it was scanning our floor level. It's speed would have been approximately 10-15km/h. There was no noise at all even though the windows were open, so if it wasn't for me we would have missed it completely. I strongly believe in the ufo after that particualr encounter but i don't think i'd like to get any closer unless they start communicating. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

The sky was pitch black and the stars were very bright.  Directly over head I saw what I thought was a satellite moving slowly south to north.  It was a steady dim light, like a star, but moving.  I pointed it out to her and explained the difference, visually, between a satellite and an airplane.  An airplane has blinking lights and a satellite looks like a slowly moving star.  As I was explaining this, the object suddenly took a left turn (a right angle with no curve or change of speed) and began to move east  ((Correction--west.  Please see below.)) for a few degrees and faded to black. I stopped speaking and watched in disbelief as I understood enough about physics to know that what I was watching was physically impossible to take place, at least for a satellite.  I quickly asked her what she had seen and she said, matter-of-factly, that ""it turned left"" not knowing or understanding that what we saw could not have happened in a ""normal"" world.  I tried to explain to her what I was thinking and what I understood to be ""normal"", but she didn't seem concerned by the strangeness of what we had seen.

Police officials were recieving many reports. NASA confirmed the event stating it was only space junk. However, space junk doesn't fly level and I had an excellent observation of the exterior. The craft defied all known physical laws and aerodynamics. The craft made no sound and released a shower of sparks from what looked like a exhaust port.

I was traveling by car to Salt Lake City, UT when I noticed what appeared to be an airplane on the intermediate approach segment of a landing. I saw three landing lights (believed to be a heavy aircraft) approx. 3 miles away and wondered what airport was in the area. After a moment of thought I realized there was no controlled airport close enough to facilitate a landing. My next educated guess was that it might be a military aircraft flying a low level mission. I pulled my vehicle to the side of the rode and stood at the side watching the lights become three separate objects flying in a wedge formation. To my amazement they were cylinders approx. 100 ft. in lenght with a beam of 15 ft. olive colored with a line of port holes. The light on each craft was on the nose.

The object appeared silvery/white in color and was about the size of a 1/8"" BB at arms length. I estimate it was 1-2 miles away at the time, and about 50-60 degrees high in the sky. It was moving slowly to the southeast away from me, and at one point appeared to slow and stop, before continueing to the southeast and fading away in the blue sky. I had it in view for 5-6 minutes and had time to get my 35mm camera and take two pictures using the telephoto setting, which unfortunately is not too powerful. The sky was mostly clear with a few wispy clouds. There was no apparent wind at the time, but about 20-30 minutes after the sighting the wind did begin to blow and I saw that the clouds were moving to the northeast, which is at a right angle to the direction I saw the object moving. My first thought was that the object could be a large balloon but the fact that the UFO appeared to slow and stop, and move at right angles to the wind made me discount this.

I was shocked because this was the second siting I've seen within two years. The same thing came to my attention though. They were white and had a glowy look to them. After i gawked at it for about 4 minutes they started to get a little higher and took off at what seemed to be the speed of light up into the air. It left a trail of a redish white streak of light that faded away within seconds.,2003-03-21T00:00:00,39.9056,-75.4874

As I watched one plane heading south to north I notice a formation of 4-5 lights flying north to south.  The altitude was higher then the commerical airlines fly if their about to land or have taken off and yet the lights where as bright as if much lower.  The sky was extremely clear as I live in the country.  This formation flew silently until it reached the Orion constellation at which point as it was crossing it (from my vantage point) the formation disappeared.  I stood there for 5-10 minutes looking for any tail lights of planes in that area and saw nothing. I saw a plane in the north and a small craft far south east but nothing of the formation.

The bright light or lights gave the appearance of a large zig zag or Z shape.  I suggested to our sons that it might be some sort of aircraft, and they didn't think that made sense and had been observing it a good while as it approached, before we were called outside into the open patio. None of us heard any sound, which also was strange, since the clouds it disappeared into were not very high. The report below I just saw reminded me of the event: GEORGIA ZIGZAGGING CRAFT WITH RED BLINKING LIGHTS MORROW -- The witness says, ""While unloading supplies at my office 9:45 AM, I saw a strange looking craft on November 13, 2002, that had three blinking red lights."" It appeared to hover then zig zag around the sky and eventually diving behind a group of trees. In a few seconds it appeared again off in the distance at an even lower altitude. At the same time another craft with a very bright light and two red flashing lights appeared behind the same group of trees and just seemed to hover there! These lights were not blinking and were rather large lights. My family and I have observed a passenger type aircraft for 8 or 9 months with a extremely bright double headlight that can hover in one place for any amount of time, and turn on a dime! It doesn't have to make a large turn like a regular plane. We watched twenty to thirty minutes. It could be some new type of craft that the military is testing? We do have an Army base nearby.

It was June of 1992, and my family was sitting on the porch talking as they would do often.  I and my two cousins were in the next door neighbors backyard playing with their dog.  I happened to look southeast and see a light in the sky, which looked a lot like a star, just a bit brighter than most.  I dismissed it at first and continued playing around.  We lived in-between two Navy bases, Cecil Field and NAS JAX, so we were used to seeing planes and things flying by.  After my older cousin had stopped and took notice of this light we all three stopped to study it.  It seemed to be moving across the sky towards the northeast.  We ran from the neighbors yard to edge of my yard to get a better look, and in the process of running without taking our eyes off of the light, we all three ran into the fence which was barbed-wire (barbed-wire is almost invisible to see at dusk anyways).  When we reached the edge of my yard we just stood motionless staring at this light travel across the sky very slowly.  It then did something I have never heard of before.  Around the light itself, a sparkling, cloud-like bubble formed that was shaped like an egg.  It traveled with the light for a small time matching its movements perfectly.  The light then left the cloud, and the cloud disappeared very slowly.  After the two were separated the light moved about very spuratically across the sky in normal UFO fashion then disappeared completely.  The sighting must have lasted at least 25 minutes.

Well at last I have the opportunity to sit and write to you. Please accept my apologies for the delay in contacting you. This sighting lasted only moments but it was an unforgettable occurrence. The time was 10.15 pm in London, the conditions were excellent, the sky was crystal clear. Stars of every magnitude could be seen, it was literally a picture of heavenly beauty. It was a mild night and the temperature was comfortable. I was in my ground level kitchen washing some dinner plates, my kitchen window is situated above my sink so i had a view of the night sky where i stood. I went to the garden to throw some scraps for the birds to feed on the following morning and saw what a beautiful night sky it was. i thought to enjoy it for a few moments and realised after a moment or two that there was a fairly low star with a piercing white light in a position that was unusual for a star even for a planet. It was small enough to be mistook for a star but, the glow was not a natural starlit glow, it was also bobbing about slightly, like a top that has been spun and cannot stay completely, still but has slight movement. Of course this movement is easily detectable because all the stars in the sky are perfectly still and anything that moves is easily detected. I remember audibly saying to myself ,""Is that star moving."" I concentrated on this 'star' to try to detect movement and sure enough it was definately hovering. I watched it for at least 10 further seconds  as it humg in the sky emitting its very unusually brilliant white light. The 'star' was about pea-sized, if you held an outstretched hand and brought your thumb and index finger together without touching. It was probably at about 55 degrees.  The object then glowed brightly and moved foreward in a straight line very slowly for about 5 seconds then stopped I staggered backwards in disbelief. Then the object stood stationary and continued glowing for about another 5 seconds. Can you imagine my surprise. Then the object glowed really bright this time, imagine looking directly into a lightbulb. Then as if someone had lit a firework the object pitched directly upwards. When I say directly upwards, it was as if someone had used a ruler and drawn a straight line in the sky and asked this object to run along it as if on rails. But the glow disappeared almost immediately as it took off upwards at the most incredibly awesome speed i cannot find the superlatives to describe the speed, nothing that we know of here on Earth. The object then became a complete circle like a coin of light with a pinkish hue getting smaller and smaller as it disappeared DIRECTLY and vertically upwards. It was then that I realised that we were visited by a craft from outside our understanding. I thought of running into the house for my binoculars and then realised that the speed of the object would foil my attempt to observe it closer and I was pleased that i did not. I just watched it as it went higher and higher and became a tiny speck of light. If the sky was not so clear i would have lost it, thanks to a crystal clear night.The object (speck) made a slight change in direction as it got way up, I would say about 10 times past the moon's distance as we know it. The object now a pinhole of light headed towards a reddish star way way up. This may not be significant but it did, it finally disappeared from view but kept on travelling I'm sure. I felt that whatever it was, it certainly had no intention of returning to earth that night. But who knows. My feelings as the object moved forward in a straight line before pitching upwards, was that it was looking at something on the ground. I may be wrong but it's mannerisms were that of a bird of prey hovering over and stalking a slow moving prey on the ground. I have no choice but to use my imagination in this instance. I cannot say how far the object was from my vantage point, I had no point of reference,  the moon was not in view, even so the whole incident lasted only about 1.5 minutes maximum from start to finish. I was lucky to see what I saw. I believe it was a probe of some sort, nothing alive could survive the G-forces in the escape from our space. Almost every year I stand at the same spot in my garden, at 10.15pm and run the whole thing through my mind. I remember the stars that were in that area of sky at the time, thats easy because the same stars are there every year in April. I felt a change in my attitude after this. I felt as if I knew what millions af people did not. I felt that all we are doing here on earth don't mean one damn thing, because if they came to stay or showed themselves seriously we would be shocked into submission. We have no chance against the demonstration of raw power that I saw. I told a few friends and my girlfriend at the time, but I only told people who knew my character and would not treat me like a looney. Now I hardly mention it. I believe more people would have sightings of their own, but it's amazing how many people never look up in the sky especially at night. By the way with all the raw power and energy expelled in that instance, there was no sound at all. The following day which was bright and sunny I went to the garden and saw an airliner about ten times higher than the object the previous night and I still heard it's engines' noise as it dragged across the sky. We do not have the technology to do what was done on that night.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,,

I said to myself I'm going to bag a UFO tonight.  Watched planes flying around the valley… all had blinking, or strobing lights. I kept watching for an aberration in the stars, i.e. anything moving erratically.  Looking towards East, a light enters my vision, a moving solid white, smallish pinpoint of light, not as large as say Mars, moving slowly my way. Another airplane I said to myself. Ah, what's this? It stopped moving. Now its moving again but swaying… swaying right, swaying left. It stops. It goes down (relatively speaking from my LOS), sways right, sways left, goes back up and continues on its pathway toward W. Now it turns, not a sweeping turn, but a sudden 90-degree turn. It does a maneuver around a fixed star (again relatively speaking), and continues on it way, now in the southerly direction. Eventually, it fades from my view.

Last night a friend and I decided to go outside stargazing.  We love to look for shooting stars.  As we walked out the door, we noticed a super bright star.  As we gazed at it we realized it was moving.  It became brighter and brighter in the sky mostly straight up a little to the western horizon.  This 'star' was traveling from south to north and then stopped, turned, and headed toward space.  We watched as it disappeared from view.  As this was not the first time I've seen this strange event, I finally decided to report it somewhere.  Last year on Sept. 7, 2002 at approximately 11 pm again, 3 of us saw the same thing in the eastern sky.  It headed right at us and we thought it was a shooting star.  As in came closer, I actually became frightened as I thought maybe it was a meteorite going to hit or something.  I hadn't ever seen anything like it.  It finally changed direction heading south and then changed direction again and headed into space until it disappeared.  The object both times was extremely high...as if in space, but much bigger than a star or satelite.  It didn't have the lights of a plane or jet and didn't move like any kind of plane I've ever seen.  It was much too high to be a helicopter.  To give you background on myself, I'm a disabled police officer.  I went through 4 years of college and actually took classes in Astronomy in college as I've always love stargazing.  I'm level headed and logical.  I do believe in the idea of life in outer space as the universe is a big place and there are many things we have no clue about in it.  I will say that I have never met an alien that I'm aware of; I have never dreamt about aliens, however I do enjoy science fiction books and television; and I have never felt as if aliens were trying to contact me.  I would embrace an opportunity to meet other-worldly creatures, but I don't expect it to happen in my lifetime.  I'm a middle aged, down to earth, farm girl who went to college, got a job, and got arthritis.  What did I see?  I'm not totally sure.  But for now, I would have to classify it as an 'unidentified' flying object.  I'm continuing to search for an earthly explanation, but haven't found one yet.  I would really love to find out just what it was.  I'll be watching that sky!",2003-07-16T00:00:00,,

There had been a thundershower about a half hour earlier. This object stood apart from the the clouds as it was shiny, but not like chrome, more like the stainless steel of a medical instrument. It was definatley not flat-colored like the backing clouds.  I could hear no noise, possibly due to my distance from it. I could not tell at about what altitude it may have been at, I am not a meteorologist. It was clearly, in my opinion, not a conventional aircraft. There is significant aircraft activity in this area. Helicopters, float planes and passenger planes of all descriptions. One often looks up to see the aircraft coming and going, and gets to recognize many of the regular aircraft, by their paint and markings.  There is no air polution in this part of the country. This was not a weather balloon, it was motionless. It was not a helicopter, float plane, or regular aircraft, it was silent, and motionless.  I advanced up the road to see if I could get a better look at it, and it moved slowly into the clouds, and did not reappear.

A possible explanation for the beams of ""laser"" type light (horizon to sky) some people have witnessed could be an ongoing military project, which currently i believe is not classified. I have read extensively about this ""project"" online and in news sectors. Apparently the US military is developing a laser-based high energy beam system for disrupting/destroying satellites in orbit, they are also developing satellites with optic shields to prevent the same happening to our own. My guess is what people are seeing are tests being conducted on orbiting satellites and nothing more. Theoretically, a beam of concentrated light is fired at an orbiting satellite in the hopes of disrupting sensitive onboard navigation systems, thereby rendering it useless. By the same token, we are also protecting our own from the same possible fate by shielding any and all sensitive gear, including optical lenses, etc. It's just a guess...but seems likely. Any project requires some form of testing. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE TO WITNESS)) Dear Mr. ((message deleted)),  Thank you for your message and comment.  I suspect our government is working on high-energy lasers, and other beam weapons.  However, I seriously doubt that they are testing them in public places, where the reflected light, if it struck a person on the ground or in the air, might blind the person.  Thank you for your thoughts.  Cordially,  Peter Davenport ((END CORRESPONDENCE))",2003-03-21T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I made a snack watched a little t.v. and then proceded to bed. Upon lying in bed for awhile with my head opposite to the window, I began seeing lights reflecting/shining on the wall. They looked similar to an ambulance a fire truck or police. Some kind of emergency vehicle. I remember thinking what the heck is going on here. I did live in a very rural area at the time and I know I didn't hear any noise of sirens relating to an emergency vehicle. I remember lying there wondering what was going on. As far as I can remember I looked out the small window and saw nothing out of the ordinary...No emergency vehicle. So I climbed back in bed. Tried to blow it off as nothing. I tried going back to sleep wondering what the deal was. As I was lying in my bed I began to hear odd little noises. Quiet and suble. Kind of like voices, but they didn't make any sense. I heard some odd noise at the back door, but living in the country didn't think much about it. Then I felt a un-easy fealing like someone else was in the room. I looked up and I swear to god I saw a figure, not much higher than my water bed. At very most the figure was 3ft tall. It was staring directly at me. I looked at it, and remember thinking I am not seeing what I am seeing. I also remember a sense of panic. I suddenly could not move. I remember trying with all my might to move, but I couldn't. I couldn't move, couldn't speak or anything else. And I also remember be affraid for my life. I was never more affraid at that moment than I had ever been. Now I grew up out in the woods and in the country. I have seen wild animals, bear...deer...etc. Many people out of the area would be affraid of ther own shadow...in the great north woods so it takes alot to scare me. But I froze and can honestly say that I have never been more scared in my life. I have mentioned this story to a few others and they just think I am full of it. I did mention it to a roomate the next day that was sleeping in another room that night and he told me almost exactally the same thing that I had witnessed. A little more vague, but with substantial similarities without me going into detail with him.

They were grey with flashy clothes and big heads, with really big black pearl eyes. The fear that came over me when the one touched my forhead paralized me dramaticaly.

They had a futuristic metal object with like buttons or switches on it, they jabbed it into my leg and pulled it out, but not all of it was there when they done so. When that was done, the one that touched my forhead looked at me and it was like a mental message was spoke. It said ""If you tell no one we will return to visit you.""

I received a telephone call from a witness at 9:10 a.m., June 27, 2003. A man reported to me that he and his wife were just heading out for a couple of days fishing trip at Prince Rupert, British Columbia. They were just outside of Terrace, B.C.  driving on highway #16 along the Skeena River heading west when the man's wife gave out a yell for him to look up and towards the south. The gentleman said it took a couple of seconds before his brain kicked in, thinking what he was looking at was very unusual. He pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road and both watched an egg shaped object hovering over the south side of the river at approx: 1000 feet. They mentioned it was approx: the size of a pick-up truck, shiny silver in color. It was completely smooth, or no seams on the object were visible. ""Witness expressed: it looked like an egg""!! (he laughed and said they must grow large chickens in Canada).  They did not hear any sounds coming from it. The sighting lasted for approx: 10 to 15 seconds before it sped off at an incredible rate of speed south. He also said that since it wasn't that early in the morning there were other vehicles passing them on the highway, and a couple of vehicles had slowed way down and they could been seen looking in the direction of the object. The witness said I know what normal aircraft look like, and this thing was not anything that I have ever seen before.  HBCC UFO Note: Of course I am looking for any others who were traveling the highway that morning in hopes they may have seen the same thing. The witnesses had heard me on the radio and from there looked me up.  Thank you to the witnesses for their report.

At one time, my family had twenty-five acres of very high land in Connecticut. Behind the house, separated by some distance,  was a pool with a screened in porch. Beyond that, a very large, open meadow surrounded by woods.At thirteen, I was sitting in the screened-in porch with my younger cousins. They faced the house behind me, I faced the open meadow and woods. It was toward the end of the day, but still light out. It was then that I noticed two objects moving very slowly,traveling right to left, up above the tree line that skirted the large meadow. One was following the other. Moving slowly and silently. Then the strangest thing happened.The first traveling object just exploded. There was no reason for it. It just happened. It was a silent explosion. It just exploded into white and yellow burning light and its pieces just seemed to disintegrated as they fell. It didn't fall as a single large structure.It just broke up into chunks and each chunk- large to small burned up.  There seemed to be some smoke around each piece or chunk as it burned, but  no huge plumes.It just burned up and I saw little of it trail to the ground. It happened very fast. The strangest thing was that the disc traveling not far behind it was completely unaltered by all of this. It just kept traveling its course as if nothing had happened. Amazed, I ran inside to get the adults of which about five hurried outside with me. There we saw the surviving disc still making its way silently, slowly over the tree line until it suddenly,very abuptly, dove down sideways into the woods between two large trees. The only thing I could think of that could be of any interest there is that this is the location of a very deep, small pool of water left over from an old quarry.Yet, the disc seemed to almost instantly shoot straight back up.Changing its direction to come over the meadow and straight toward us! It went directly over our heads not any higher up than a large tree. I actually stood under it as it passed. The sun was setting in the distant valley below us, but it was still twilight with plenty of light to see. It was classic disc shape, flat bottom smallish hub on top- unified color. I seem to remember the texture of panels, but not sure. Over head it was a darkened metal color - yet as it traveled off into the valley below us and the setting sunlight hit it, I noticed it was shinning silver. When it went over my head I felt no fear, I think because there was no sound. It seemed surreal. I would say robotic! I felt no wind, no rush of air nothing. We all silently watched it sail off into the valley below us like one would watch a hot air balloon, totally unalarmed. All my aunt said was that it was a UFO and that she recently had been coming back on the New Jersey Highway with my Uncle when about thirteen UfOs appeared traveling down the road. She said people just got out of their cars and stared at them.We thought it was neat we got to see them. We didn't feel scared or threatened or that we had to call someone.I remain unfrighten by them. I feel they've been around for so long that if they wanted to have ended us, they would have done so long ago.I feel I am luck to know something personally about the world others have to still guess about.Yet, now I am left with intense curiosity. How did the craft and explosion emitt no sound?  Why did the other disc following behind the first just keep going and remain unaltered? Why did it shoot so quickly into the woods? And most of all, why did it chose to come right over us. Did it want to see us too? I don't know, but I hope I get to see another UFO in my life time it was great!

One instant it was traveling thousands of mile per hour in one direction, and the next instant it was traveling thousands of miles per hour in a direction 90 degrees to the first direction.

First of all, I never thought I'd be reporting ANY UFO sighting. However, I do believe in life beyond our planet and no, this is not a report based on my being an X-Files fan. I did not have any alcohol in my system and what I and my fiancee saw was as real as these words I now type. We had extremely cold conditions tonight due to the freeze that has hit much of the south. My fiancee and I were leaving our home at 1850 hours CST to meet a friend for dinner. We are both college professors, lest anyone doubt the validity and reality of what we saw. We live on the east side of the city where few if any street lights are lit. Our driveway runs north/south. We were walking from our north facing front door to my sedan to our right (east). My fiancee said, ""Look up, the stars are so beautiful."" I did, and at that moment as were looking toward the eastern sky, approximately 60-70 degrees above the horizon we saw what appeared to be another bright star, only moving. This light (star) moved to the left (north) of the constellation Orion. I knew the constellation well--Orion's belt and his inverted triangular upper point stars and his lower standard triangular lower point stars. This star-like light seemingly moved slowly north. It had no trail of a comet, did not travel quickly and leave a streak as a meteor or meteorite. The moving light was as bright as the surrounding stars, moved awkwardly, but mostly in a straight line. This star-like object did not blink in patterns as an airliner might, was not blinking red and green as a lower flying aircraft, it just stayed aglow. Then as it appeared to travel north-northeast, the light diminished in intensity, then faded as if losing power? switching itself off? or climbed higher out of the earth's surrounding atmosphere into space. The light flicked out. There were absolutely no clouds in the sky; the heavens were clear. We went to dinner shaking our heads, but we both agreed that the object we saw was real. In fact, when we arrived at our dinner location, we looked u! p toward the eastern sky again and saw two aircraft, one flying high and blinking its steady strobe flying westbound and we witnessed another low-flying aircraft with visible red and green lights as a comparison to our original siting. I truly believe what we saw was not an aircraft, meteor, meteorite, or satillite. This object had none of their characteristics. I hope other individuals saw this event in this part of Louisiana because I never would have believed this as a young boy, but I definitely can attest to this sighting, as well as my fiancee, that it was perfectly and absolutely real. We are still discussing the event even after telling our dinner friend; NOW, we are having a glass of wine. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object may have been the ISS/Space Shuttle.

Pilot said that all on board saw and were terrified.  Minneapolis center at Farmington contacted us (29th Air Divison, SAGE) and asked if we had contact on our radar with the aircraft and did we see any raw data near the 727.  I worked in Weapons on the third floor of the sage bldg. and was involved with some practice intercepts involving two ANG F-102 interceptors in a low altitude area just south of the Lake. Sawyer High at Mps Ctr called me and asked if I saw it.  I said that I did see the Airliner but not any extra raw data, but I said that I'd keep an eye on it.  2 Minutes later we saw a trail of something (eight raw paints) break south and it appeared to either go out of the atmosphere or into the lake before disappearing.

Tho it was cloudy, there were breaks in the clouds that the moon could make it easy to see. I went outside to check the guard that was on rear duty of our hut. As the guard and I were talking all of a sudden a green glowing round ball came out of the clouds and making no noise at all. We were very stunned at first at what we saw. It just glowed off and on and not making any sound at all. It didn't last long, but at the Chezch border and Germany thats something you wouldn't expect to see.

One night, I was outside with my 8"" Cave newtonian telescope when my father came out to tell me it was time to go in.  I happened to look to the north-east and saw a V-shaped formation of lights moving in a westerly course.  I knew that the LAX flight corridor is in the same area but I had never seen a flight of planes in that corrider as it is for ""heavies"" only, and not for military planes.  I told my father to look at the formation.  It moved to the western horizon and dissappeared into the L.A. light pollution in about 7 seconds.  That was faster than any jumbo jet would have moved in that corridor, and it made no sound.  I could always hear the jets flying by but these made no sound.  The best part was that as my father and I watched, the V-shaped formation suddenly shifted.  It seemed as if each light flew across the path of the others and it became a stright-line (line-abreast) formation.  The change was almost instantaneous, but slow enough for us to see them move.  We looked at each other knowing that military planes don't fly in the LAX approach corridor and they sure don't switch formation like that, especially at night. Plus they made absolutely no sound; we would have heard that many military jets.   Like I stated earlier, I am an amateur astronomer and have seen everything under the night sky, from flocks of geese, to meteors, to planes, to balloons, and this was none of the above.

I was out with my telescope around two in the morning and about ready to call it a night when I noticed a star directly overhead.  It was not especially bright but I knew that it did not belong in that constellation of stars.  As I looked at the constellation and was telling myself that it didn't belong, it grew brighter and brighter.  It did not move at all; it just got brighter.  It came to a point when it was brighter than any other star in the sky, which made me think I was about to get nailed in the face by a meteor. You know what they say; if it ain't moving, it's coming straight for you.  So, you're saying to yourself, big deal! That's around the time of the Persied (maybe Leonid, I forget) meteor shower. I know that and I know what meteors look like.  Well, the best part was that , as I watched for the impact, the light sent out about 5 or 6 dimmer lights in quick succession, one at a time, in separate directions.  In fact, it seemed as if they shot out in a perfectly geometrical design.  The little lights moved off in straight lines then the central light that first drew my attention started going dim.  It grew dimmer and dimmer until I could no longer make it out.  It never moved laterally.  I figure something came into the atmosphere straight down over me, let smaller craft loose, then went vertically back out of the atmosphere. I've seen meteors that fragment but they never break up symetrically. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was night time and i was going out to feed the animals when i saw a pair of lights in the south east heading towards the north west.  at first i thought it was a pair of lights on the wingtips of a low flying airplane so i didn't pay much attention to them.  but then it accured to me that i couldn't hear any sound of an engine so i looked at them again and noticed that there was nothing in between the two lights.  i then thought that it might be a pair of satilites moving in the same direction.  since i lived in the country, i had an excillent view of the night sky without any street lights or lights from buildings to obstruct my view.  as i took a harder look at the lights, i noticed that they left a trail, like a jet plane would leave, trailing behind them, but there were only two lights and i could plainly see three trails.  i called out to my brother to come and have a look, but he wasn't able to come outside, but my mother did and she saw them too.  i don't know what they were, but i don't understand how two lights can leave three trails.  As i was looking s.e.  one light was slightly on my right, the other on my left.  both moving at the same speed and in the same direction.  the two lights left thin trails behind them as they moved across the sky.  to the left of the light on my left, i could plainly see a third trail, a wider trail, but there was nothing there to cause it.  Another time i saw something was when i was out driving truck cross country.  my trainer was in the bunk sleeping and i was driving the night shift.  just as i crossed the state line from california into arizona, i saw a ball of light streak across the sky in front of me and appear to crash into the hills.  the ball of light was green.  the first thing i did was turn on my c.b. radio and listened to see if anyone else had seen it.  no one mentioned anything about it on the radio.  my first thought was that maybe i had seen it and no one else did or maybe it was my ima! gination.  then i figured it might have been a meteorite falling to earth.  the green glow could have been cause by copper deposits in the meteor burning as it went through our atmosphere.

From a Piper Archer II I saw one light flying. After a while it turned 130 degrees. I contacted tower and nothing was known or seen on the radar. After a while a second light appeared. I flew to them not able to close them further in. They disappeared and when the appeared to hear the communication, they returned and I flew towards them again, which game lasted and lasted. They appeared to be intelligent lights which seemed to overhear the radio communication. I have an audio tape of it from the air traffic control. At one time the radar controller says to the tower controller - over the intercom- which I could not hear in the airplane at the time - : two objects, three miles at his twelve o'clock position. Tower asked me what I saw at the time and I reported : the two lights are now 12 o'clock, three miles. The channel silenced down and surprise was the master at that particular time. Later on I saw one light disappear between the stars. I know how high airliners go, I know satellites, I know the weather which was clear sky with hundreds kilometers of sight. On the ground was fog only up to 200 feet from the ground. They were no natural explainable things, because I read a lot of them and my response: No way José!

I was travelling back to Broken Hill at night when myself and the driver of the car noticed lights in the sky in the distance which we immediately presumed to be aircraft.We had just come over a small rise when the lights appeared. This part of the country is dessert terrain and on that night the sky was incredibly clear with generous moonlight.However the lights held our attention as they remained stationary in the sky and as we drove it became apparent that we were moving towards them. Our second conclusion was that it must have been the lights on top of a piece mining equipment. It also became apparent that the lights were a lot closer than we had first presumed and as the road made a slight curve within minutes we were driving alongside them. The light formation consisted of 4 vertical rectangular shapes. The rectangle on the far right glowed a constant red while the other 3 alternated in a pulse. Firstly the outer two would pulse white while the inner would remain black/invisible, next it would pulse red while the other two turned black/invisible. As we drove they remained up on our left not moving in a rock solid position. Our estimate at distance from us would have been 50 feet back from the road and about 50 feet in the air. The length of each rectangle looked about 10 feet long and about 3 feet across. The light given off did not radiate off of any surrounding shrub or the ground and even though the night was clear no shape of any object connected to the light could be seen. When they were on our direct left we slowed down to about 15Kms an hour as did the car directly behind us (they were the only other car on the road, I wound down my window to look at the lights which kept on flashing and made absolutely no sound.

It took the form of one on one interviews and I'm bringing it to your attention because the people of Broken Hill have withdrawn from the spotlight and you will not see the city which is a copper mine town, I think the largest in australia, on any ufo map. But its stories are the most rivetting I have ever come across in the past ten years. The craft were described as common in the area, but not talked about because the people do not wish to be thought of as crazy. They are generally recognized as being massive by all witnesses including a world famous and respected artist who lives in the city, Pro Hart, and I quote , ""about the size of sixteen football fields"" ie each one or ""about a mile long"". And on a regular basis. This story might be old and the craft have probably moved on . Why stay near a desert town like Broken Hill forever, but I think it deserves to be put on the record. I believe these craft are Intergalactic ,  which would explain their great size. I was again reminded of them by your Rense show with a similar sized craft (or three) in Arizona. These craft obviously know everything about us , see my earlier post about the searchlight phenomenon and continuous presence over Sydney Australia for several weeks with nothing in the media ,they have been studying us with superior technology for so long ,and are probably just waiting for us to grow up.Finally like my mother used to say ""there is good and bad everywhere"" and no doubt this applies to these extaterrestrials as well. In which case maybe some of THEM should grow up. I was just wondering, do these craft need copper? it doesn't hurt to take the discussion beyond 'Did you see that.It was..etc!' Finally I believe that maybe every star in the Universe may support life at some time. This concept gives glory to God so it is worth thinking about. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is unspecified by witness.

That night after watching them for about an hour and 45 min. , we decided to (crash the ufo party) where we saw 5 of them land aprox. 1 mile away. It was very dark and was in the middle of nowhere. We drove across a dry riverbed way down this dirt road and then we came to this hill with an unused road and drove up it. It was very difficult getting up this road becase it was full of deep wash ruts. When we got to the top we sat and waited, I called my wife and told her what we were doing and laughed and I stated (ahh. there ain't no UFO's ). At that time we started driving down the large hill and it happened, We were lit up by what appeared to be two large lights (A large rectangle of light about the size of a car seperated by a thin black line, thats why it appeared to be 2 lights). I screamed to my wife who was still on the cell phone ""Oh my god I guess there are UFO,s if we dont come home we've been abducted"". I took off really fast and the truck was bouncing up and down from the ruts . My friend said stop but I did'nt. At first the UFO was about 100yds away, within a second it was half as far away, one more second and it was passing over us. we drove back to the house we were fixing up (a triple wide mobil home with no power or water). I was really tripping out, what was that? I lit a fire to keep us warm, it was really cold! my friend was tired and went to sleep on the wood floor with no blankets, so I keept the fire going. Every half hour I had to collect wood to keep the fire going. At 400am I had just put the wood on the fire and I looked at my watch and it was 400am, within a second I looked back at my watch and it was 600am, two hours disappered! What happened? My friend woke up about 700am and I told him what happened about the time, and asked hin to check my body fpor marks. To my suprise i had 5 needle holes, barely starting to scab on my sternem on my chest. We talked for a while an I laid down inside the mobil looking up out the window. this is when I saw it, what appeared to be a spec of dust went past the window very fast, I jumped up and looked out the window and saw a round translucent grayish bubble accelerating at an unbelivable speed. I estimated its speed to be from about 200mi per hr. to 10,000mph within about 4-5 seconds (My view was from directly behind it) It went across the valley ,up over a mountain and punched the sky and disappeared into space. We saw another that day aprox 1200noon egg shaped and extreamly silver. We couldnt tell if it was solid or liquid. this was in Awanga also. The next day I was on the Ortega hwy. with another friend and he said whats that? It was a silver egg the same as the day before 100mi to the south, and I said I dont know but its following me. We went back to the place we first encountered the lights, It was hard to find, but we found it. We couldnt belive it but there were these strange pictures of ailens on the rocks all over the place. the paint was a very strange green and kinda fuzzy. Ive been back several times since and all the rocks have been bulldosed, which is weard because it was in a place that there would be no reason to do any bulldosing. I have videos of the five ships landing that night from a distance and includes a vehical driving down to meet them,. I know a place (a aprox. 100 acre ranch ) where someone in a truck or car met them on a landing sight I have proof on a video. I belive in the video that aliens are visible in thier ships. Everyone ive have shown trips out Ive only shown about 8 people. I know these events are true and i havent worked since this happened to me Its changed my life!",2002-12-23T00:00:00,,

I was driving home from a job in a town away from my home town. I had just turned west on I-70 at Crecent Junction, Utah and had traveled just a few miles past the town of Thomson Utah when I glanced over to my left and saw way off on the horizon a straight line formation of five different colored flashing lights. I was with my partner and I exclaimed that I thought that there were five helecopters hovering out there with different colored strobe lights attached to them. As he continued to stare at them he told me to pull over because something was strange. He noticed that the lights were flashing in sequence from left to right and were very stationary in the sky. I said that they must be radio towers and he said that radio towers have lights all the way up the tower not just one light at the top. Then we noticed that the lights weren't really the type of light that we were accustomed to seeing. They had a funny little glow that didn't quite look normal. Then we realized that they were in the same color sequence as a rainbow, from infra red to ultra violet and in five different colors. I decided to turn on my amber yellow strobe for some unknown reason and when I did that the flashing sequence started to speed up. They started flashing in sequence from left to right very fast and they started to grow together very quickly which means this thing started to speed off in the opposite directing very vast. It's really hard to judge distance or size the way they sat out on the dark horizon but I would guess the formation to be about two hundred feet between the unfra red light and the ultra violet light, but I really don't know for sure. There was no sound that we could hear. We couldn't see any other shape attached to the lights. We saw only the five lights. My partner looked over at me after it disappeared an asked me ""How long do you think we sat and watched those lights?"" I replied, ""About five minutes."" I retired right after that so I haven't seen him since then but I'm sure I can find him and he will have no problem cooberating my story.

Last night I was sitting in my backyard and looked almost striaght up at the stars for a few seconds. As I started to look down again I noticed 2 lights kind of low on the horizon barely moving west. My first thought was it was 2 helicopters following each other at a very slow speed. Since it took a minite or so to come to that conclusion I decided to play a joke on my wife and called her out to see. I just kept looking at them because something was just not right with my conclusion. Mainly because for as close as they appeared I couldn't hear anything. When my wife got outside and about half way to where I was I told her to stop turn around and look up. She started questioning them right away asking me what they were. Shortly after she got outside it appeared as the first one seemed to have sparks fall from it and seemed to have turned north as if the light came from the front because it became real hard to see so I focused on the second one which kept going west.Then the second one kind of stopped for a couple of seconds and also turnin the same direction the other one did. Since there wasn't anymore I really focused on this one as the light got further away. This time noticing the direction was north but it also was climbing in altitude kind of like when watching an airshow and watching the plane as it climbs to a point until it stalls, but this kept going. Then the light seemed to disappear and I remember saying it's gone right as I said that it faintly reappeared and (this is where I really started to question what we were seeing) We both saw it shot up and I mean up and in two kind of swooping motions (the dot of light became a trail slowed down and did it one more time) and it was gone nothing like we have ever seen before nothing. I am 31 y/o and I have alwayed watched our airforce jets as they fly around that are based in Miramar, seen all that latest tv shows regarding the usa's technology in jets, been to many of sky shows (blue angels) and never seen anything take-off like th! is did.

We had seen an object 'hanging' in the sky several weeks ago, and wondered whether this was the same or similar object. It looked similar. We watched this object for a couple of minutes, waiting to see if it was perhaps a small plane that was far off and heading toward us. There were no contrails around the object. And no clouds whatsoever. We watched it for a couple of minutes, then I said, ""Let's note the time."" It was 13:57 Mountain Daylight Time. The object moved slowly toward the south. We looked at about 45 degrees to the horizon to first see it. In approximately ten minutes it had moved so that we were looking at about 85 degrees, not quite straight up. Watching the object was easier with polarized sun glasses. Without the polarized sun glasses, the object was hard to see. I told my son to go to the car to get the other sunglasses. When he came back, the object was closely to straight overhead, and I said, ""I've lost it."" My son said, ""I see it."" I asked, ""Where?"" He said, ""There"", but he was pointing to the 45-degree location. It had to be a second object in about the same spot as we had first seen the first object. Unless the first object zipped back down. I think there were two objects. We watched that object for a number of minutes. It was just hanging there. I said, ""What would happen if I tried to contact them?"" I stepped out into the open and waved at the object. I waved with both hands scissoring over my head. The object immediately faded from sight. We started walking back to the car. We noted the time.

In addition to that, how many professional flying pyrotechnics would shoot 2 green trails and not make any sound what so ever?  As for a meteorite, every one I've ever seen tends not to leave twin trails in perfect parallel sync' and also tend to leave white streaks.  Others may assume that it was a military jet since Moffett field is under 5 miles away, however this couldn't be the case since Moffett should not be used for fighterjet aircraft due to its decommissioning about 5 years ago.  In addition, the streaks were green and what sort of plane burns a fuel mixture or uses technology that leaves not red, not orange, not yellow, not blue, but green streaks?  The fact that there wasn't even a sound also bothered me.  If this isn't a U.F.O., the military is using the Moffett/N.A.S.A.

I was 15 years old at the time. Below are the details of the sighting.  One evening in 1974, during the first week of September, myself and two friends were sitting up on the roof of my Mom and Dad's house (we would go up there for a cigarette every now and again - typical kids). It would have been about 8:30 to 9:00 PM at night - the sky was extremely clear that night. I had both my hands behind my head and was resting my head against the shingles on the roof (the roof is at angle of approx. 35 - 40 degrees). I saw a UFO - it was a perfect triangle with a white light on each point of the triangle. There were trails coming off the back two points of the triangle. The triangle was pitch black and blocked out the stars above it as it flew over top of me - it would have been about as high in the sky as a jetliner. I remember trying to convince myself at that time that maybe it was a meteor or a group of meteors of some sort (or even some sort of reflection) but I kept reminding myself that it actually blocked out the stars above me as it flew over top of me. It COULDN'T have been a meteor or a reflection. It was definitely NOT a plane. I was a smart enough kid back then to know the difference.  The triangle flew in a southwesterly direction, from northeast to southwest very, very quickly - much faster than a jetliner but slow enough to see some details. Definitely slower than any meteorite I have ever seen. I can still picture it as clear as day when I think of the sighting some 30 years later. I jumped down off the roof and went flying into the house yelling to my Mom and Dad 'I just saw a UFO!'. It was so significant to me at that time that I actually wrote down what I saw and even drew a picture of it in one of my notebooks. I remember my Mom and Dad and I calling the Saskatoon Airport that night but the airport indicated that they had received no other reports. This was something I had never seen before and have never seen since.  Having been interested in UFO's ever since that time, I recently obtained a copy of Timothy Good's book, Above Top Secret. Amazingly (which is why I am reporting this to you now, this many years later) - in Chapter 8 (Canada), I came across these two incidents in Good's book:  Page 200 ""...in July 1974 a Scandinavian airlines captain flying 35 to 40 miles southeast of Quebec City reported a triangular shaped object moving in a southwesterly direction...""  Page 200 - 201 ""...on 10 October 1974, John Breen, a Canadian armed forces pilot, was paced by a UFO over Newfoundland, en route from Deer Lake to Gander. A passenger flying with him noticed a strange light following the plane when they were about 50 miles from Gander. Every time Breen looked at the light, it seemed to turn off but finally he got a better view of it. It seemed to be a sort of triangle - or delta shaped, luminescent greenish light following us...""  Date-wise, my sighting falls in between the two above sightings. The triangle I saw was moving fast enough that it could very well have been in Quebec or in Newfoundland a few minutes beforehand (although the date of 10 October 1974 in Good's book is approx. 4 weeks after my sighting occurred). I drew a GIF animation of what I saw and will attach it to an e-mail using the address you've given below.",2003-04-22T00:00:00,52.1078373650108,-106.66923239740821

My friend and I observed a metalic object coming straight towards us from accross the bay. It appeared to be about 50 feet across, and it was disc shaped. We assumed from it's relative slow speed, size, and lack of sound, it was probably the Fuji ballon craft, or something like it. There was a very bright light on the bottom of the craft. It was just beginning to get dark in the area and this was the only moving object in the area. It hovered directly overhead, about 50 feet off the ground, and somehow we knew it was not a balloon craft. It was shaped wrong and it was too metallic. There were no jets or propellers. I joking told my room mate, it was probably ""swamp gas"". He wasn't laughing. We were scared and the hair was sticking up on my neck. I looked around and it seemed like everyone was watching this thing. I saw no portholes, anteneas, or any protrusions at all. As it got darker, the light seemed brighter and stronger. It was like a floodlight, but it did not have a directed ""beam"" of light. It was just bright. After hovering 25 minutes or so, it began ascending and moving away from us in an upwards arc. It suddenly rapidly accellerated and was out of sight in seconds. I have seem anything that could accellerate that fast. It was like zero to 1000 MPH in about 2 seconds. It started moving north and curved around to accellerate to the south and almost straight up. The next day, we looked in the paper to see if anyone reported it, but it was not in the paper.

It was a daytime sighting which lasted approx: 45 minutes at least.This is off a U.S. air force UFO form ftd 164.  My parents went into a home and left us three kids in car, brother, sister, and me. We were playing in the car jumping over the seats as there is lots of room in a 1950 Pontiac. It was my brother, now dead that looked up and out the window. He said ''WHAT IS THAT'' !  It was large, about the size of a running track and was a metallic, silver round or saucer shape object. From our angle it did not let us see the top of it.  No speed involved as it was just standing in air, kind of revolving on its own axis at about 60 degrees and it made no sound.  The object would often catch the sun and reflect light at us, blinding us momentarily. My father came out to the car and we asked what it was. He looked and said its probably army stuff because their was a radar sight a few miles away.  He finished checking on us and went back into the house he was looking at. My brother did not say any thing until my father left. My brother then told us kids, this was important, this is the time of prop planes. But this thing is standing still and defying gravity. As kids are, after such a long time watching it we began to play again. After a while my sister said, were did it go ? ""It was gone and none of us seen it leave"".

In mid March 1985 there was a large fish kill in a private pond at a friend's summer home.  She asked me to stay in the cabin at the site to protect the property.  The cabin is about 10 feet back from the shore line and has no electric.   On or about April 15, 1985 my husband and I went up to the cabin around 9 PM and went to bed.  About and hour or so later I got back up to answer nature's call.  The out house was about 30 feet east of the cabin and since the moon was nearly full, I didn't take a flash light with me.  Just as I was ready to sit down, i heard what sounded like some one jacking shells into a gun chamber.  Since i had no light or gun with me, I tried to hurry the business at hand and get back to the cabin.  Before I could finish, I heard a sharp snapping sound and then a dull thud.  I tore out the door, not fully clad and in the moon light, I could see that the center of the pond looked humped up.  I let out a scream for my husband who sleeps like a log, but there was no answer.  Before i could run, a flat thing, like a coffee cup saucer, rose up out of the pond.  It hovered briefly, and then turned side ways so that all I could see was a thin edge.  As it did so, i could hear water running back into the pond.  Then in a faint flash of color it was gone.  I was facing south at the time of this event and the pond was in front of me.

I put two witnesses because somebody in another part of the city with a car dealership type spotlight was trying to illuminate the object but couldn't keep up.  Tonight I was driving to my daughter's play in Spanish Fork, Utah.  I was facing North. The sky is cloudy tonight.  I saw a beautiful blue sparkling light, like 4th of July sparklers (but not sputtering or leaving sparks) in the sky.  It was below the clouds over the North end of the city.  It had a smaller red light exactly like the blue one either attached or in close formation to it.  I watched the object for those few seconds it was in view and looked around for others who may have been watching the same thing too, but saw no one.  There was a large spot light, like the ones at Car Dealerships when they're having a big sale, trying to follow it.  ""Trying"" is the key word here, because this object was moving so quickly that there was no way the spot light could catch it.  The sparkling blue light sometimes changed colors to a beautiful green.  Sometimes the red one either would go out or maybe it was in back of the big blue/green one.  I've never reported anything like this, but I found myself saying out loud, repeatedly, ""I am looking at a UFO!  I am looking at a UFO!""  I know what I'm about to say sounds crazy, and maybe I am unaware of the maneuvering capablities of helicopters, however, this moved with such grace and so quickly, I only saw it for approximately 5 seconds.  It was initially traveling across my field of view from the west to the east and then it reversed direction.  First it went up at a 45 degree angle, then made this tight loop, then moved straight across (west to east), then another turn to reverse its direction to go back the same way it came, only lower, then down with the large (ground based) spot light trying to follow it all the while.  I didn't hear any sound.  An hour later a helicopter kept flying all around the city.  Anyway, you don't have to believe me, but I know what I saw, and I'll never deny it.

While I'm on the phone I tend to look out at the sky and clouds.  Today I looked up at a contrail and immediately noticed something moving near it -- a pinpoint of light, like a satellite, but obviously a satellite can't be seen during the day!  The light was on a very steady trajectory from N/NW to the S/SE, moving about as fast as a satellite would.  I thought it might be a mylar balloon, as it was moving in the same direction as the cloud-level winds but slightly faster than the clouds, which were higher (i.e., the light was seen against the cloud backdrop -- it was partly cloudy).  But within seconds, I noticed another light, following in a straight line behind it, and I put my fist up to see how many degrees apart they were.  If my fist is 5 degrees, which is what I remember from astrophysics class, then they were about 2 or 3 degrees apart.  Then I noticed a THIRD light, equidistant from these two, so that they formed a string of three star- or satellite-like lights traversing the daytime sky.  I watched until they disappeared to the left from my window view -- a few minutes.  Because there was sun in the east, I could have been seeing a reflection off mylar or other metal, but I couldn't say with certainty that they were not self-luminous either.  And because they travelled in a straight line and were equidistant, I find it hard to believe they were mylar balloons, unless they were connected by a very long string!

For one thing, I may have entered 1/31/02 by accident, but it was 1/31/03, the same day I reported it.  Furthermore, I had forgotten that a fist-width at arm's length is 10 degrees, not 5, as I guessed in my initial report.  Therefore, the distance between the first and second object, and between the second and third objects, was about 5 degrees -- about half a fist-width at arms length.

Once it got above the tops of the trees, and was completely visible, it quickly shot upward even more, and within a matter of seconds had moved from one side of the sky to the opposite, leaving behind it a distinct crackling sound, much as a jet leaves a sound trail. For the duration of these happenings, the entire sky lit up neon green, and was, as I describe, brighter than day. I could see everything, and given the circumstances, thought we were being bombed. Once everything was back to normal, and the object was no longer visible, I could see flickering trails that were the same color as the UFO disappearing almost as quickly as they were able to be seen. This all happened within a matter of seconds, but everything remains so clear in my mind. As I went back inside to tell my family, there had been reports of transformers blowing around the county, and a wire down on a nearby street. These events seem peculiar to me, and though there could be some rational explanation, I am very skeptical. I know what I saw, and I've never seen or heard of anything that comes close to being like it, especially not the fact that the entire sky was brightened even past the normal daylight we are all accustomed to.

The disaster happened over Texas, I live in Massachusetts where I watched repeated video footage filmed about an hour earlier. This coverage was repeated several times while some spokesperson got their act together enough to say something. So I had ample time to study the video footage. I went channel surfing and got a channel that was showing the same footage as I was previously watching; BUT, this footage showed about five seconds more coverage at the beginning. With this earlier coverage I saw the smoking space craft travel past a disc shaped object whose diameter was about 3/4 the width of the contrail the shuttle was leaving in it's wake. The lighting of this object wasn't quite as bright as the shuttle and contrail. This appeared to the far right of my TV screen and the shuttle at this time wasn't appearing to be breaking apart. The object appeared below the contrail and would have been obscured if the network logo was being displayed at that time. The camera operator was apparently focused on the shuttle tracking it's flight trying to keep the subject centered in midscreen. Therefore the UFO disappeared off to the right of the screen as though it had no motion at all. Two days later I saw another UFO in close proximity to Columbia. This footage was reputed to have been videotaped in Nevada by an Air Force camera and the pre-dawn sky was darker in comparison to the footage shot over Texas. In the Air Force release I saw two brilliant spots of diffused light seperated from one-another. The light on the right traveling left toward the second light was leaving a contrail. The light on the left stayed stationary and the light on the right appeared to be on a collision. The camera operator went to wide lens and continued the coverage then when collision seemed imminent; coverage ceased. No mention was made of this bizarre display and neither scene has been shown since. That makes two UFO's I've seen in proximity to the shuttle Columbia.

I lived on the lake Allatoona,  I was on my pontoon boat with my sister talking, a normal conversation,  when she stop and said you would not belive what I saw.  She said she saw a blue looking object fall out of the sky,  fairlly close to where we were.  I thought nothing of it,  passing it off as a shooting star. The next night me and five of my other buddies went out on the boat,  it was a very windy night on the water which is very rare most of the time it is dead calm.  We were just talking when,  we noticed something fall out of the sky, in the decribed area my sister clamed the night before.  Again I was passing it off as nothing,  but I had a spot light on the boat,  and for fun sake I got it out and shined it in the area where the object fell.  I was ha ha UFO yeah right, continuing to shine the spot light into the sky.  Then I noticed a very bright light comming closer to our location.  This skared the people I was with so I stated the boat and went down the lake alittle ways,  This object stayed above us.  Then another object appeared and went ahead of the other object.  Through out a duration of two hours we saw four or five unknown craft morfing colors from bright yellows to red colors.  I was loving it I was thinking to myself you will never see anything like this ever again conteinuing to shine the spotlight.  Then there was a thought to be a boat heading straight at us.  I turned on my lights and this object headed back into a cove, across from us.  I wanted to get the attention of it to see if they had a phone so we could call someone to get a vedieo camera or just talk to someone because we were electicfied.   So we went closes to this boat and call out to them but no answer.  So we went closer and called out but still no answer.  I thought this is odd.  So we went ever close and called out are you seeing what we are seeing, long pause Then the most earrie voice said ""What did you say you saw"" then silence.  So we go closer and as we get to the point where we can start to see the boat our boat is engoulfed in this extermly bright light.  While this light was shining on us I was looking for a back wave from the boat, because it was windy and wavy and when a boat bounce up and down in the water it will give a back wave,  but this boat have no back wave,  This did it for me it really scared! me.  I stated out the boat and got out of there.   On the other side of the lake I tied up our boat and went to the dock where this object was it was move back forth right to left, and looking like it was comming towards us.  so we ran throught the wood back towards the house,  as we start to get to the house the front porch light went out,  I thought this is it we are about to be obducted.  I bangged so loud on the front door my nabor called and thought I was knoking on her door.  I told my dad the whole story, and he wanted to go back down to the lake one of the guyes we were with refused to go back down her was teriffied.  We went back down and it was as calm as glass.

The reason of this delay is that I´ve just found your site and I´d like to give a report. It was late in the evening, almost midnight. Me and my friend were kicking football on a nearby field when I noticed something strange in the southern horizon. I saw a formation of star- or satellite- like dots moving from south to southeast. I know that there are satellites moving in formations but there were far too many objects here, over ten. The formation of these objects was irregular, but they were moving with a visible speed like satellites. Time to time these objects vanished slowly and then came back into vision. When noticing the phenomenon I told my friend to take a look of the objects too. (His face was heading north while I was the goalkeeper with my face heading south) He saw the objects and said only:""Those are definitely UFO:s."" Then we kept on kicking the ball and paid no longer attention to the phenomenon. However, this sighting has bothered me ever since. Do you have any idea, what this strange formation could have been. I can only tell that in July the nights here in Finland are quite light so this phenomenon could have possibly been something reflecting the light of the sun. Birds of course are out of the option. The sun had already set. ((CLARIFICATION FROM WITNESS)) Whoops! Made a little error there. The year of the observation was really 2002 but I just can´t remember the exact date, sorry.

Although I have always enjoyed looking up into the night sky I've never seen anything that I would characterize as strange. Anything that looked unusual I was quite sceptical about and always looked for an earthly explanation. One occurrence although I was not able to explain away so easily. It happened while some friends and I were camping at Restoule Provincial Park in July of 2002. The time would have been about 11:00P.M or so. Five of us were at the waters edge shooting the breeze when one of us noticed something near the moon. As we all glanced up we noticed a black rectangular shaped object in close proximity to the moon. It moved from the top left down and seemed to be in an orbit around the moon. As it descended in a circular motion around the moon it slowly reached the bottom portion and than drifted further off to the left and gradually disappeared. Strangely enough, this object actually appeared to be the same distance as the moon which would mean it had to be of incredible proportion. I cannot obviously confirm this though. The whole incident took place over a matter of 5  minutes or so as we were all able to comment on it several times. The size of the object in proportion to the moon would have been about 1/5 its radius. What it was I have no idea but we all have talked about it since.

I was living in Terrace at the time but am currently living in Pr. Rupert. I am fairly sure that my experience occurred in the early morning of Sunday August 25, 2002. It is not what I saw that intrigued me as I really did not see anything, it is what I heard. About 4:30 am I awoke to go to the bathroom.  The window was open in my bathroom as it was quite a warm night as it has been lately.  As I was standing at the toilet a very loud and intense noise quickly filled the sky.  It was loud enough that I wondered if it would wake up anyone else in the area.  The noise lasted for approximately one to one and a half minutes and then was gone again quickly.  The noise sounded very much like a military plane flying overhead with one very distinct difference. This noise did not come out of or move into the distance.  In my experience with military planes you can hear them come from a distance and as they pass overhead you can hear them go off into the distance.  This sound did not move like that. The skies were clear and bright and I could not see anything in an direction that was visible to me. I'm curious if you have had any other reports from that time or confirmation of any military exercises in the area at the time.  Any information would be helpful.

The binoculars didnt work to well in the dark but I noticed that the small object was now touching the cigar shaped object. I then ran back inside to get my camcorder. When I returned back outside the large object was gone. I now saw three to four objects flying high overhead. I began to film them with great success. These objects are seen on my video flying, stopping, moving up and down and dropping what appears to be balls of flame. Todays date is 11/22/2002. I remember this night like it was yesterday. I attempted once before to report this and was told "" we dont want any videos unless it is! a real UFO"". I thought this was funny and felt pretty stupid. I am retired from law enforcement and father of three, I didnt feel like being rideculed so I have had this  video in my safe since this date.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,41.6601,-74.1105

But they were'nt by them selfs. They were hooked to something else. The circles were in a circular pattern, as if they were attached to something. They were about 5 feet from one another. But you could see them clear.....it was'nt a plane! Those lights were attached to the left side of some kind of craft. I told my wife to look at it.

While driving down Flatlands in Brooklyn I noticed an object hovering straight ahead, normally I would not have paid a flying object any mind because we see helicopters and planes all the time, however this object was noticable because of its shape, it was round with what I can only describe as a domed top, furthermore this object was not high up like an airplane but only several stories it was low enough that details could be made out.  It had a metallic appearance with lights located around the bottom along the edge, these lights were between purple and blue in color and there was also a pulsating yellowish light located between the round bottom of the craft and its round domed top. I looked at it for several seconds trying to make out what I was seeing before I tapped my boyfriend and said do you see that, I should mention that I have never believed in aliens, or bigfoot or anything of the sort I am a graduate student majoring in forensic science and have always been taught there is an explanation for everything, he looked up got quiet for a few seconds and said ""oh my god, what the hell is that.""

Now we had to look back and to the left to keep the object in focus, at this point the object began to tavel in our direction rather rapidly however it was now slightly tilted with the bottom turned toward us, the closer it got the larger it appeared and the more detail we could make out (at this point the object was only about 2 blocks from us,) we co! uld not understand how those around us could not see this, it was so close, but the drivers around us did not appear to be looking in the direction of this craft which could easily be seen by looking through the back seat window on the driver's side but rather straight ahead.  At this point the craft was traveling behind a set of buildings, once again I commented on how low it was, it wasn't flying over the buildings but behind them so that its view would be blocked for about half a second everytime it went behind a building,( the buildings were apartments I estimate to be about 15-20 stories high)the object suddenly took off in the opposite direction and we lost sight of it.",2003-07-16T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I was having difficulty finding it, and I blamed this on a stray cloud, even though it was a clear night. Suddenly, something caught my right eye and I realized that a small pinpoint of light was moving across the constellation Bootes toward the area I had been searching earlier, to the North. At first, I thought it was a shooting star, but I continued to watch it and it did not fade or disappear. I knew it was not an airplane, either, as it was far too high in the atmosphere. It was about the size of a small star, and had a reddish glint to it. As I watched, it made its way across the sky, then disappeared from my view once it got too low to the horizon. I shrugged this off, and continued to stargaze. But it hit me as a real shock when I realized that there was another one, following the same Northern path in the sky. I watched this one, and then a third, for it appeared shortly after the second.

I am guessing that it was in September because it was dark and yet it was warm enough for me to have the car windows open.  As I came around a curve in the interstate I could see over the median a black object with a number of spotlights shining down onto the median.  As I got closer I could see that it was triangular in shape but with the (back?) side sort of dented in (chevron?) The vehicle was very angular and not curved in any way.  It spanned the median, so it was about fifty feet in diameter, and I would say about the same in length.  There were about five or six of the spotlights that shone straight down in almost a pinpoint of light - definitely not floods but spots.  It was matte black, and it was hovering, and was absolutely silent.  I saw at least one other car coming the other direction on the interstate but it was impossible to tell if they saw it also. The object stayed there as long as I could see it in my rearview mirror.  I was about 19 at the time and was on my way home from work.  I had been away to university for one year and had decided not to go back, and went to work full time.  I had worked overtime for two hours which was typical for that time.

I was looking south from near the intersection Evelyn Ave. and Fair Oaks Ave. and saw bright lights about three or four times the size of a star making figure-eight movements parallel to the ground. My estimate is about 2000 to 2500 ft. altitude. It took me a few minutes to figure out how many craft there were. One would make a figure-eight and have a trail of light behind it briefly, while the other craft would do the same but at 90' to it. So that it looked like a four petaled flower, about 2-3 miles from end to end. The two craft would come very close and almost hit each other at the center point. The duration for one cycle was 4-5 sec. ANOTHER two craft doing the same thing about 4-5 miles away over Mt. View. Total of 4 ships making BIG figure eights. As I say each group of two at 90' to each other. The loops or light trails were oriented on North, South, East, West directions. After about 35-40 min. I said out loud ""is that all you've got""? 5-10 sec. later a red light detached itself and made an erratic path away and down before fading out. A white light did the same a few seconds later. I was getting bored and went inside. As an experiment I turned on my stereo to check for RF interference. Scanned the dial, some intermitant noisy static on 104.5 FM. My AM was not hooked up to the antenna at that time. I got a phone call from a friend. I thought it was to tell about me about the lights, but she hadnt seen them. I told her go outside and look in the sky. A few minutes later she comes back to tell me, it's ""search lights"". They were not search lights, there was NO beam up into the sky and they were moving far too fast. It is hard to credit your senses that you are seeing what you are seeing when looking at ufo's. About 15 min. later I went back outside and noticed that one of the ""flowers"", (two ships) are gone and only the Sunnyvale two remains. Then I heard bam bam bam bam bam bam, six pops. Gunfire from behind me (north), real close. Somebody shooting at them! I thought ""thats stupid"", their too high. Just then a ship comes from the area of the gunfire sounds. It was about 100 ft. away from me (east). Moving about 25 mph. It cleared the power lines by 10 ft. So however tall the high tension lines are, add 10 ft. It was dark but I got the impression it  looked like a ""top"", (Ya know, the childs toy?) it had a light on the top and the bottom. One was red, one was white. I dont remember which color light was where. Probably the size of a car or truck, not very big. It leisurely made its way south-west towards Wolfe Ave. There are other details of this sighting and later events I'll leave out. While all this was going on I counted 16-18 aircraft in the sky. Apparently the miltary and whoever else was watching too. Pretty spectacular. But I never heard a word from the TV news or radio or people talking, anywhere. Not even a report on THIS website by anybody. During this time frame, 1988-91 I saw a lot of ufo's. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We believe that conventional aircraft, or perhaps advertising lights of some sort, would be the first possibility to be ruled out during an investigation of the sighting.  Sunnyvale is where Moffett Field is located, which is a major U. S. government research center, so perhaps the event was the result of some type of work or display conducted there.  If this had been a genuine UFO-related event, we suspect that hundreds of reports would have been generated, and the incident would be well known among present-dayUFO investigators.

While in the vicinity of Basking Ridge near the wildlife overpasses with relay towers on the north side of the highway, I caught a glimpse of something large aproaching the highway from the south.   I leaned forward to get a better look and in doing so saw a airborn vehicle approximatly 40 to 50 yds from tip to tip.  The shape was that of a cresent moon or chevron which was light metalic grey in color. I would estimate that the craft elavation was no more than 400ft.  I told my parents as we passed under it but the brake lights were distracting them as both lanes of traffic were rapidly coming to a halt as people saw the object.

When I stuck my head out the window I noticed that there was no discernable noise generated by the craft.  The craft was moving far to slow to remain airborn by any conventional means of propulsion that I am familar with.  There were five lights across the front arc and a panel of white lights pulsing a pattern rythmicly as we drove under it.

Now, after almost fifteen years, I will tell this story as I can assume that the only others who will be reading this are for the most part those who believe in this stuff. My story is hardly the fodder from which films are made of, I was not abducted, nor did I have any implants or anything of that sort. But I will tell this anyways. It feels good to do so...  It was the summer of 1987. This was the year I graduated High School. I do not recall the exact date. This takes place in Missouri, about an hour and a half South East of Kansas City (+/-). Whiteman Air Force Base, now the home of the B-2 bomber, was at the time a missile base. It is about 30 to 45 minutes away from where this happened. To this day there are countless old missile silos scattered throughout this countryside, though they have been dismantled as far as I know.  A friend of mine, as well as one of my uncles decided to go to a place outside of our hometown of Windsor, known as ""Windsor Crossing."" Windsor Crossing is about fifteen minutes from Windsor, at the edge of Truman Lake, which in reality is the outer edge of the Ozarks. It is a much larger drink of water than what the word ""lake"" implies. At Windsor Crossing is a campground, as well as a dock to put boats out onto the lake, and a ""beach."" Our plan for the evening was to go to the beach and go for a late night swim. Given the humid summers that Missouri experiences, this seemed like a great idea at the time. My two companions rode along with me, and I parked my car away from the beach as it was forbidden (dare I say ""Illegal"") to go swimming there after dark-for our own safety of course.  After our swim, all three of us went up onto the beach and lay down on the sand. The night was cool as I remember it. The sky was clear and dark blue, punctured by the pinhole-sized stars that littered the night too numerous to count. It was a very beautiful evening. As the three of us laid there on that beach talking, the conversation ultimately resolved itself to silence. Several moments passed. Then as always seems to be the case, when it is a beautiful night, the stars out, etc, somebody has to speak up about space, parallel universes, and things of that ilk. The guy that came along with my uncle and I was saddled with the nickname ""C((name deleted))."" The reason behind this is simply because of his haircut. I won’t bore you with the details. Anyway, ((nickname deleted)) was the one guilty of breaking the silence with ""Wouldn’t it be cool if we saw a UFO?"" This was immediately greeted with a reprimand by none other than myself. I sat up in the sand and forcefully declared that no such thing existed, and that it was downright stupid for him to even bring it up. It was a beautiful, clear summer night. That was the reality of the moment. It seemed ridiculous to contaminate such a nice midnight swim with silly speculations of another race from outer space. C((nickname deleted)) snorted something under his breath that vaguely resembled an apology. After several minutes, we all toweled the sand off of ourselves, got dressed and made way to my Toyota Celica (1978 GT. Moon roof.  Damn fine car. And I don’t like Japanese cars.) Windsor crossing is on Y highway between Windsor and a little speck of a town called ""Tightwad. Tightwad is only two minutes up the road past Windsor Crossing. This is significant as my girlfriend all during high school lived there. This meant I spent a great deal of time on that highway, naturally. So I was very familiar with all the details of that road. Where all the houses where. Where all of the lights where. And where lights should not be.  As we were moving down Y towards Windsor, we came to the only stop on that highway. A stop sign at a 4-way in the middle of nowhere. We passed it. As our conversation continued (to this day I have no recollection what it was about), I noticed way out in the distance what looked like an amber light over a field (there are lots of fields in Missouri.). It did not register with me as I was immersed in a conversation of so much importance that I cannot recollect what in the heck it was about. So I filed the light waaaaaay in the back of my mental Rolodex. Our conversation continued. As we drew closer to the light, at this point it was still about a mile or so away, it demanded my attention again. It had suddenly dawned on me that there was no house in that area, save for one farm on the other side of Y highway. It could not be a lamppost; I would have seen it from all of my excursions to my girlfriend’s house in Tightwad. Cows of course, have no need for a lamppost out in the middle of a field. The light now had my attention.  I interrupted the conversation between my uncle T((name deleted)) and C((name deleted)) and drew their attention to the light. As best I can remember, from that point on we were silent till we drew closer to the light. I pulled my car over to the right side of the road and all three of us got out to take a look at what was over the field. This is what happened to the best of my recollection:  An amber light hung suspended over the field not quite two stories high. To give you an idea of what the light looked like to me, imagine looking at a streetlight through a foggy windshield. It had streaks that came out from the main source, but not sharply, they were not long streaks, just stationary. The light made no sound. Behind it was a single row of trees. I will describe the setting to give you an idea of the distance as best as I can recall it. Y highway is a lone country road out in the middle of nowhere. It is mostly used by the few that live down that road, and the summer traffic going to the lake. At well past midnight, we were the only ones on this road. This small road has no streetlights. So it is dark, save for the house light in the distance, or the occasional traffic lights. From where we were parked at the side of this two-way road, you could walk across it, cross a ditch and come to a fence. You could easily climb the four or five foot fence, take about thirty steps past it, and you would be beneath this thing. You could throw a rock and easily hit it. The three of us stood there and said nothing. We just looked at this light. It made no sound. It moved not an inch. It just hung there. An amber light with soft streaks emanating from it. This is the part that I struggle to understand, much less explain to others: I do not know how this happened, nor do I recall seeing it happen at all. One second I/we were looking at this light floating over a field, and the next thing I know is that the light is no longer there, but what rested in it’s place was what we all know as that familiar cigar shape. Its outline could easily be made out against the clear blue night sky, punctured with millions of stars. This cigar shape seemed to me to be about the length of two or three full-sized cars. Around it was blocks of colors. Green, yellow and blue. These colors did not move. The cigar shape did not move. At this point, I tried to gather information about what I was seeing. It was near a row of tall trees, yet the leaves on the trees rustled only when a soft summer breeze passed. It made no sound. Not a hum that I could hear. Nothing. I could make out the blades of grass in the moonlight. They rustled not a bit. I looked over at T((name deleted)), and he was silent. I looked over at my friend C((name deleted)), and he was silent too. My attention turned back to the cigar shape that hovered silently, effortlessly, over this field. I have no idea of how long we stood there and looked at it. I was not scared, quite to the contrary, I felt very peaceful. If I felt anything, it was the urge to run across the road, jump the fence, and run up and try to touch it. But I did not. As the tree of us stood there, I recall us saying things to one another, yet I cannot remember what it was.  After several minutes, the cigar shape slowly rose up, over the treetops and lowered itself behind them, as if it was trying to hide from us! It was only one row of trees, so we could still easily make out the lights on its side, as well as the cigar shape. After what seemed like a short amount of time there, it again lifted up over the trees and went away from us. We jumped into my Celica (Damn fine car.), and sped down the highway following it. Ultimately, it stopped over a field. We parked the car on a curve that ran along side a hill that looked down on this field. At this point I was convinced that what we were seeing was indeed not a helicopter, or some kind of airplane. From beneath this (what I will now call a-) UFO shone a bright, concentrated white light. The light’s edges softened outward from its center. This light swept over the filed in patterns I did not recognize or find any logic to. It looked very random to me. After a few moments of this, at the blink of an eye, it was very high up in the sky and way out in the distance (and without even the slightest sound). Those lights around it now seemed to be rotating around it. Eventually, it was over the horizon. It would dip below the tree line, and then would pop back up again. It did this a couple of more times before it disappeared, never to be seen by us again.  The conversation back to Windsor was dominated naturally, by what the three of us had become witnesses to. I dropped off my Uncle and my friend, but did not go home. Instead, I found myself driving around my hometown of 3,000 people just trying to process what was going around in my head. I eventually came to the parking lot of a grocery I worked at during high school and came across one of my co-workers there. I pulled up to his car. His window was rolled down and I could see his face. It was an expressionless mask, his eyes were hollow, and his skin as white as a sheet of paper. The first thing out of my mouth was-""D((name deleted)), you won’t believe what I just saw!""  D((name deleted)) interrupted me and said, ""I know what you just saw. It was a UFO.""  His voice trembled, and there was very much a tone of concern to it. He had tried but failed to hide his fright.  While we were on that hill on Y highway watching this thing bounce above and below the horizon…as it turns out, it was over another small town that is called Calhoun. D((name deleted)) girlfriend lived there. According to him, he and his girlfriend were sitting on the porch of her house, which has an awning over it, when he said he felt what amounted to a low rumble. A strong low hum. This caught my interest, as I did not hear any noise whatsoever from the UFO when I saw it. The two of them sat there and from over her house this thing gently sailed over. They watched this, every bit of it as it stopped over her front yard, right in front of them. Then it went up high, above the tree line, and then back down, and then back up. According to D((name deleted)), it did this a few times before it ultimately shot up into the air and disappeared. This seems to match what we had witnessed on that highway, watching this thing go above the horizon, within our view, and then dip below our view a few times before ultimately disappearing. The UFO was described to me by D((name deleted)) as being saucer shaped, and metallic silver. This was all I could get out of him. He was visibly shaken and went home. I rode around town for several more minutes and did not see him again.  I went home and looked at the clock and saw that it was about 3 am. I do not believe I lost any time as I can honestly believe that the incidents, including the time I spent driving aimlessly around town, realistically could have burned a couple of hours.  The next time I ran into D((name deleted)), he was able to chat about it briefly, but he made it obvious that he wanted to put the whole experience behind him. In a small farming community, you could be the laughingstock of the whole town if you went around proclaiming to have seen a UFO.   Well there you go. All 2,206 words of it. I never believed in anything if I could not reach out and touch it. This rule especially applied to UFO’s. My companions and I were not drunk, nor where we on any kind of drugs. We were just three guys on our way home from a swim.  That night, fifteen years ago, I saw something that I know with every fiber of my existence, answered my question of ""Is there life out there?"" Well I am now here to tell you that I believe that there is. And now that I have thought about it for years, and finally shared it with you. I am now saddled with an even bigger question: Why are they here? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-04-22T00:00:00,38.5263,-93.51929999999999

I hope to give some evidence that this type of sighting is not unique. It was when I was still a child (in other words before using perception changing substances) with a few of my friends that we noticed a light high in the sky whilst sleeping outside and mindlessly looking for satelites. I'm not sure how many of us noticed the light but I do know that we were at least 4 to have seen it. The light was, I suspect, very far off. At first we thought that it was another satelite, but as we gazed at it started  moving in a zigzagg motion at a very quick pace. After a number of seconds, the star-like light stopped zigzagging and continued to move in a straight line. This was already a great surprise to us, but that wasn't it. In the path of the light there was a star, which the light did a semi circle around and then resumed its course until it was no longer visible as it faded. I know it sounds ridiculous that the light went around the star, since the star was probably nowhere close to the light, but thats what I saw and so did my friends.

One at a time we noticed these lights coming out of the northern sky over top of us to the south and than breifly stopping (for less than 5 seconds) and shooting at an extemely high rate of speed directly to the east. It was definately not a normal aircraft because the acceleration was almost instantanious not to mention the the perfect 90 degree angle they were making to the east. We witnessed this about seven times in row that night all following the same exact pattern over the same exact tract in the sky.

We turned down a side street and thought we saw a plane flying very low we moved into the middle of the street to get a better look.  we thought this was a plane because we saw lights (lights like that were pretty visible then because alot of the sidestreets had only 2 or so streetlights on them so there was alot of dark areas).  we stopped walking, looked at each other and remarked to each other about how low that plane was flying, and how something must be wrong for them to be so low.  we spoke for what had to be less than a minute or two. as we looked back up the lights were almost directly above us and hovering.  it was oval shaped, black i think, with 3 lights in a semicircular shape, there were 2 sets and 2 rows of these lights facing each other.  they were so bright.  they were just so bright it seemed unreal.  It must have been about the size of a large oval pool.  i think that is what shocked us the most.  that what we thought was a plane was so small and so quietand that while it was  hovering it was sort of dipping from side to side kind of like a small boat on choppy water, not like it was going to flip over or anything i don't think.  just like choppy water movement.  my friend and i looked at each other again for what seemed like an hour,  and ran in different directions.  we finally caught up with each other, and made it to her house. no one believed us.  even now, today no one believes me.  i don't speak to that particular girl very much anymore we both went different ways in life.  but any time i see her we both end up talking about it.  we know what we saw.

PD)) ((BEGIN COPIED ARTICLE)) New Straits Times » NewsBreak  Partial ban likely on Kong Ming sky lanterns Firdaus Abdullah PUTRAJAYA, Feb 11:  The Government may impose a ban on the hot-air Kong Ming lanterns as their indiscriminate release has proven dangerous to aircraft besides being a fire harzard.             Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today that this did not constitute a ban on all lanterns. ""It is not a blanket ban on all lanterns as we understand the requirements and traditions of the Chinese community. But we have to regulate the practise and indentify the type of lanterns which are suitable. ""The huge air-borne ones caused some serious problems when they were released near the Bayan Lepas airport in Penang. We cannot allow this to go an as it poses a serious threat to aircraft,"" Abdullah, who is also Home Minister, said. Pointing out that such huge lanterns could cause fires if they were blown onto houses, he said police would come up with clear regulations on lanterns soon. ""I will inform the police about this and they will go into the details of the matter, including approaching tanglung makers and relaying to them the problems that had cropped up,"" Abdullah said when responding to media queries on the issue. He was speaking at a Press conference at the Home Ministry after chairing the Cabinet Committee on National Competitiveness (CCNC)'s second meeting today. The Kong Ming lantern issue made headlines after 12 evening flights at the Bayan Lepas airport were forced to be diverted last Saturday due to the runaway being littered with the lanterns. The airspace near the airport was also reported to be filled with the hot-air lanterns that night. Following the incident, Penang Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon called on the Federal Government to impose guidelines on the release of such lanterns while Penang police chief DCP Datuk Arthur Edmonds suggested that the lanterns be banned. ""What happened in Penang is serious enough for us to impose some kind of a partial ban on certain kind of tanglung. Malaysians must know to enjoy themselves but not create things that endanger the the lives of others. That was the same reason why we banned firecrackers,"" Abdullah said.

HBCC UFO Note: The couple of days ago I reported that three blue/white lights in a triangular shape were witnessed by a Canfor sawmill employee flying very low over top of him. The object moved very quickly and disappeared over one of Houston, B.C. local mountains. This sighting took place on February 3, 2003 at approx: 8:10.p.m. Today, February 9, 2003 I went to visit a close friend. While sitting around talking he told me that his brother has witnessed something very strange on February 3, 2003, in the morning between 8:00 & 8:10 a.m. Of course my ears perked up when I heard the date of the sighting, and I asked my friend if he would call his brother and ask if it would be ok to come over to take his report on what he saw. He agreed and I soon left my buddies home and headed over to look into this new report. First of all, I would like to point out that the fellow who gave me his account of events, does not really believe in UFOs, or visitors from else where. I also know this fellow very well, and both himself and his wife are well respected in the community of Houston. The witness to the early morning sighting works for Houston Forest Products which is one of two large and very modern sawmills. At the time of his sighting he was operating a heavy machine in the log yard when a ""extremely"" bright yellow/orange light caught his attention. The source of the light was coming from the northern side of Pea Cock Mountain, which is at the south end of the forest companies property. There was a low lying fog in the valley that morning but from his position he could see the fog had only gone part ways of the mountains, so it was laying very low. After he saw the intense light, he saw what he first thought was a helicopter, but wondered why it had such a bright light on it, then after a couple of seconds went by he thought it couldn't be a helicopter due to the size of it. The description he gave me of this object was as follows, the object at a distance of approx: 2 kilometers ( or less) away up on the side of Pea Cock Mountain on a logged off area, sat either hovering, or ""sat on the ground"" for approx: 40 seconds. The witness said the color of the object was a light gray/white. And the color was changing, as if it was translucent (almost as if it was flickering in and out). The craft was oval is shape with this bright yellow/orange light dead center at the bottom of the object. As the witness sat watching it, it rose up only a little, and flew to the south heading to the top of Pea Cock Mountain. But before it even came close to the top of the mountain, and with no obstructions in between the witness and the craft it completely disappeared. Or as they say, blinked out. Now I find this interesting because of two reports on the very same day, one in the morning and evening in pretty much the same area. HBCC UFO Note: Monday morning I will be stopping into the local helicopter business, in which there is two of. I want to see if they were flying that morning, or around the time of the sighting. I also will stop in and see if the forestry knows of any logging operations going on at the sighting location. Plus I may have to dig out the snowshoes and take a short hike to look around the area for any possible signs that something may have been there. It has not snowed in a while here, so if anything had got close to the ground, or even landed, there should be signs of this taking place.  I will keep everyone posted on this case. Also I am just going to post a computer graphic on my site to give you an example of what this thing looked like. My wife recreated it from the drawing the witnesses supplied.

I was too young (about 7 1/2 years old at the time) to remember the exact month however, I know that it was warm because my parents took my sister and I to the local drive-in movie theater.  This theater was located in the town of Bridge Hampton.    Bridgehampton is located to the east of Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The orientation of the screen was so that the patrons of the theater were facing west towards Brookhaven. The night was clear and warm with a spattering of stars in the sky.  The contrast between the screen and the night sky was stark.  The sky over the screen was jet black except for the stars.  I really don't have an idea of what time that it was however, I would have to say that it was probably between 9:30 and 10:00pm.  The object was only observed for less then a second however, it appeared as a Bright yellow white light (about as bright as the planet saturn).  The object moved straight down at a high rate of speed until it disappeared.  It was in a dive of about 170 degrees.  The object oscillated or zig-zagged down behind the movie screen.  The sighting was swift yet did give a clear image of the light and its rapidly zig-zagging movement.  The reason that I associate this sighting with Brookhaven is because it was definitely in the direction of Brookhaven or West Hampton that had a mmilitary airbase that is still in use.

Suddenly , what looked like a star began moving across the sky very fast in a straight line.  Another ""star"" in the same area began moving in a different direction but this one was zig zagging at impossible turns. Then a third one from again the same area began yet another direction and blinking on and off.  I dropped the cigarette I was holding and when I looked down to pick it up,, all the other boys began yelling at the same time ""Did you see that?"" They were all very excited and I looked up immediately but only saw what I have already described. I asked what they were talking about and they all began to chatter that one of the ""lights"" shot a red beam out from it to a light in the sky that it was passing (that light or star never moved).

This all may sound melodramatic, but that is the way this encounter began. When all this happened, we spotted the glowing object slowly hovering about 15 feet above the densely planted mesquite, oak, and huisache trees. We heard branches break or a crackling sound as if some were being burned up on contact. When it landed about 60 yards or so from us, the light or  glow ceased. However, we heard an earthly sound that shook the ground and vibrated the concrete patio we were standing on. The noise got louder and the thumping vibrations more intense. By coincidence, another 16 year old who was asleep inside the house, woke up, came out to the porch, and said that we all looked as though we had seen a ghost. By that time we were running to the car to get out of there. We drove five miles away to wake up the game warden who comforted us with a heavy gauge rifle and the words: ""if you see or hear anything more, let me know and I'll round up a posse to investigate the area.""

It happened early enough in the evening that it was still light outside despite the surrounding hills. Most of the concert choir had gone outside the front of the school to socialize and enjoy the nice weather. Suddenly, someone noticed a fairly strong light coming up the Ohio river valley from the south. I think our initial thought was that it was a helicopter because of its altitude and its slow leisurely progress, but as it came closer someone pointed out there was no whooshing sound.  The object continued moving to the north up the river valley until it was directly overhead. It appeared to be triangular shaped, with three round lights at each corner and one larger light in the center. It seemed to be a silvery colored metal,approximately 200 feet above ground, smaller than a light plane and with no visible wings.  As it continued it passed directly overhead, giving us a clear and unobstructed view of the underside of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

As I got a little closer I discoverd that the red and green lights were actually one light traveling very fast around a circuler object. The light changed though the entire spectrum appearing on the left side as green then rainbowing to the right very quickly and disapearing as a red flash. The light travelled so fast that from a distance you only saw the the green appear then the red go out. Eventually I walked directly below the object and could see the light travelling clockwise in a perfect circle. I was a UFO nonbeliever at the time but I knew this was no normal aircraft. It was about this time that the object started to zip around the sky doing imposible precise turns of 90 degrees and more.

I picked up my pace but only made it about another 200yds. before the object sreaked back and stopped right over my head. I was right behind the backstop of a baseball diamond and I remember clutching the screen with both hands and swearing and threatening the thing as loud as I could scream.I thought that if I put up enough fuss ""THEY"" would leave me alone. It then began to zip around the sky at extreme speed and I turned and ran faster than I could to a friends house about 150yds. away. I hid in a hedge and sure enough it returned and cruised about slowly near where I was hidden for about 20 seconds[ which seemed like an hour ] then shot straight up till it disappeared. As terrified as I was I remember thinking I wish it would come back. I also remember saying to myself that I'll never believe this really happened so I swore to myself to remember that exact thought.What makes it harder to believe is that it was there again the next night at 17:30.

It was just after dawn, when only Venus and the moon were visible, and I was walking the dog on the deserted beach here in Mazarron, S.E. Spain.  I happened to look up to see directly overhead a bright white light moving very slowly west to east.  It was not high, by that I mean not a satellite, but I am not able to estimate how high. I got the impression it was about the height a light aircraft might fly, and it moved at about that speed. The light was very intense, and did not change intensity, and there was no noise.  I watched it for about 1 1/2 to 2 Min's. as it progressed in a straight line eastwards. I thought I might see its shape as it moved towards the bright morning sky, but I only saw the light, and lost sight of it in the distance.

I was getting ready for bed and just turned off the airconditioner and opened up the windows for fresh air. My husband was in the kitchen getting some mid-night snack. My 2 boys age 19 and 10 and their two friends age 12 and 14 had headed up to the grocery store on their skateboards to get some sodas. My last words to them was to be quiet when they get back. I looked at my clock and it was 12:30, I laid down and then it started, The wind picked up and was very strong, my blinds on the windows are very heavy and they where banging around as if a storm was moving in, I remember yelling out to my husbans., Boy feel that nice breeze coming in. Well anyways I closed my eyes and must have dosed off lightly, The next thing I remember is that my eyes opened and I looked over toward the window, and  I heard this Whum Whum Whum then a loud like explosion or something Then the power went out. I jumped out of bed and tried to find some shorts to put on as I was talking to my husband in the other room yelling: Did you see that Did you feel that Something is not right here something is not right here, I went out into the dining area to light a candle and the power went back on, My husband seen the lights from the livingroom and could feel the electric pressure on him.  No sooner as I was getting ready to go out side I heard the Boys running down the stairs to come in Yelling and just pumped up with energy : Did you see that, What was that , Mom we could'nt move it went right through us I have never seen my boys so scared, They said the hair on them stood up .They could'nt move.  I told them to stay in because something just is'nt right That my husband and I are going to go outside and see whats going on. So we walked out to the back of the Apts looked around and then Heard chopper coming from the otherside of the building so we went to the front of the Apts and saw 2 large helipcopters flying toward us going North and they were very low and VERY FAST I looked c! losley and did not see any white stripe on them which tells me they were NOT Medi flight More Like Goverment DARK (maybe Black) copters. So we went back in the house to get keys to the car and told boys to stay in the house, that we were going to see whats going on. We got in the car and realized we had no gas so we headed toward gas station on Ols US 23 and Lee road, got out of the car and the lady that was working yelled out to us our pumps are not working power went out and on and we don't know how to reset them. One lady that was there said her battery went dead and I asked them what they seen and they said BRIGHT LIGHTS BLUISH IN COLOR. They seemed to my abit stunned. So we went to the station across the street and I went in to see if there pumps where working and they went sure so we tried to get gas and no luck. So we headed back home. Went in the house and the boys where still all pumped up and talking. They decided to go back outside and I told them not to be to loud it's late and don't wake up the neighbors. My husband and I finally went to bed and no sooner did we fall asleep the boys came tearing into the house and yelling Mom you got to see this,Mom you got to see this, So they brought me a small piece of branch from a tree and the leaves were dead and curled and I am thinking to myself (so it's a dead branch so what, and then my 19 year old said to me : Mom I cut through the wall everyday to go to work and move this out of my way AND IT WAS NOT LIKE THIS WHEN I GOT HOME TONIGHT. he was scared. I took the branch and told them to go wash their hands from what appears to be a white residue on it and I placed it in a plastic bag and put it in the hallway. I do have the branch now in a safe place incase anyone wants to study it.. I told the boys to write down their thoughts and how they felt because We needed our sleep and I know they would have stayed up all night talking about it and would have kept my husband and I up. Slept all night and went to work the next day and approx 9:15 a.m next mor! ning at work, The phone rang and it was the assistant manager from the apts asking me:  What the Hell was that last night? She also was woken up because her Cat jumped on her in bed and was just as how she put it VIBERATING. The cat never has done that before, she usally hides when there is a storm but no storm insight but something scared the hell out of my cat.  Well later in the week I asked many people in the area and some say nothing and some remember the power going out and 1 remembers his cat freaking out while he was tring to play video games and he knows power went out too. Meanwhile now we hear they found a crop circle in Howell that weeks time frame. So I guess my question is : Who can contact us to help ease the mind alittle of the events that happen around us.  My son and I have started a little file on the weird and bizzare pheomenons in our Hometown. Thanks for reading and hope one day we all can share stories together.

I saw flashes of light on the horizon, as i didnt have a real good view, but they were all coming from the southeast, perhaps towards the Andrews Air Force Base area.  These flashes were not in the sky, but on or under my field of view, as there was a stadium in the way.  I think the booms corresponded to the flashes being made, but as i could not determine what they were, i went back to sleep.

As was our normal routine on the weekends, my gilfriend and I would sit out on the dock and look for satellites on the beautiful clear nights. This particular night my girlfriend pointed to a small group of what looked to be satellites moving across the lower eastern sky. The night was extremely clear so what we were viewing was without question objects at satellite height moving south at a clear constant, no flashing lights, no noise. The formation was as three objects, one leading two more following. The two following were in a stack formation. Picture if you will four dots forming a box with the top right dot not visable (right angle formation). We observed this for just a couple of seconds when my girlfriend pointed to a fourth object trailing from the north moving on the same plane but at a very high rate of speed easily catching up to the formation. It closed the gap so fast that it made my girlfriend exclaim that it was going to collide with the lower rear object. But without any hesitation the object dipped below and overtook the bottom rear object turning upward toward the top rear object circling over the top as to make a half figure eight then heading downward and toward the leading object. These movements were flowing,no jerky movement,as if doodling on paper. Never slowing or moving out of formation the three objects remained on a steady course. The fourth object overtook the leading object and narrowly missing it passed below it excelerating twice to three times the speed of the formation. Now the fourth object was now heading in a southwestern direction. That fourth object was out of view in just a blink of an eye. The three in formation stayed on course as if programed to do so eventually disapearing to the southern night sky. I know that what I saw was extroidinary. Nothing made on planet earth moves at that speed with that kind of movement at that height with someone or something at the controls. But if we do have aircraft capable of such flight we are being kept in the dark ages by a organization much more powerful and secretative than anyone could possibly imagine. To this day my girlfriend is still quite scared and somewhat reluctant to talk about that night. Also, what we viewed that night we told to my parents and family that very morning.

My girlfriend and I where looking foward for this ""escape"" from our every day urban life, little did we know this trip was going to change our views about this world tremendously, and will rise so many questions no one could possibly answer. We decided to go camping, we had bought our gear at cosco about a year before this event, but work was always on the way because to get days off these days you have to be really polite in asking your boss, because some corporations have a hard time understanding ""time off"". So we finally did it was on august 2001, just a week after my birthday. We took along my father in law and his little son, my brother-in-law, and ofcourse my girlfriend. We arrived at sequoia national park at about three p.m. and we arrived at our camping site I dont remember the exact name it was something with ""creek"". The reception lady was an older female really friendly looking and whit great spirits, like those kind of persons that just make you feel welcome and confortable around. she gave us advice on how to avoid disturbing the natural life around us, because is so beatiful all those trees, rivers, and humidity made the place like heaven on earth. So we pulled out our tent only to find out that it was the small two person tent and we were three adults and one child, but we where ready to sleep like sardines it didn't bother us at all in such a wonderful place things like that are easily overlooked. the ""neighboars"" next to us welcomed us and where inviting us close to their fire place since we did not have wood at the time to burn our own fire, and we politely declined since they where so many and we wanted them to enjoy themselves. To this point everything was perfect The moon was bright only the natural light of the stars along with the burnig wood from our neighbors was the source of light which was beautiful.so at about ten thirty there where no more noices of the chattery of all the campers and the burning wood started smelling a little stronger since it wasnt burning anymore only smoke was coming out and so we decided to take our place in the tent because the day after would be full of activities. at about eleven (at least thats what time it felt like) we all kind of woke up, but didnt relly talk it was a feeling like if something was calling for our attention. but didnt know quite what it was, first thing that came to my mind was that really nice old lady at the entrance that warn us about wild life specially the bears, so I thought well we might get to see a bear close hopefully everything is ok I thought. I asked my father-in-law wether he heard any noise ""no"" he replied. hmm.. I mumbled; well is it just me or is someone's light pointing this way, at this moment we couldn't see the source of the light because the tent from the inside is covered, but it definately got brighter almost as to where you could feel the warmth from it, and my father-in-law said ""yeah it's brighter"", ""perhaps is the rangers scaring away a bear"" he said. After he said this the most peculiar feeling went through my body I felt heat coming from the outside, it wasnt uncomfortable heat, it fell like an actual lamp got close to my body and I told father-in-law Im gonna open the zipper from the tent to see whats going on with the light since its been here for a while. then I aproached the zipper and started to open it at that moment my girlfriend said ""what are you doing""she said, ""Well dont you see the light"" i replied ""yeah I havent been able to sleep either, i feel like there is a bear or something outside. So I knew I wasn't the only one experiencing this. then I proceeded opening the zipper. At that moment whe where facing eastward opposed to the moon's position and indeed we saw a light; there was this bright light right behind some big trees right in front of us. only It seem too close to be a bright star. and too big to be a light bulb of some kind, there picking thru our tent we stared at it I would say for two minutes, then after that the most unexpected thing happen the light moved its focus from the neighbors tent to their extinct fire, I was puzzled by this light then I asked my father in law ""Do you think it's the ranger?"" ""Idont think so"" he said. and ther this bright intense light it seemed ideal for that light to be in a football field only no football field around sequoia that I knew of. So this light just I could say ""staired"" at the extinct fire smoke, It was hypnotising to see the light and at the same time the smoke I never payed attention to smoke before but the way it extinguishes is beautiful, you can actually create patterns of ""s"" shapes and rolling into the thin air, and then in a split second my eyes where flashed by an intense flash. I dont remember exactly how it happen or when, but the light was now directly in our face, my father in law said it's an ufo. I was speechless. although I was speechless though I asked him have you ever seen an ufo? ""no"" he replied, but thats not a normal light, I agreed as well the moment it looked at us because in fact the light was looking at us. I felt so diminished I wasn't scared I just felt really diminished, Im not sure why I felt this way. As the light made that movement from the fire to our tent it felt like in a way the light was aware of our precence and it felt we have seen it as well. so in kind of a friendly way it focused back on the smoke. after that we got reall tired the light was still there thought but neither my father in law or my girlfriend wanted to coment about it, I guess we all were so confused there was nothing to talk about. Next morning we woke up around eight a.m. the wood still smoking and then a ranger passsed by in truck and my fahter in law stopped her and asked ""hey were you guys the ones with the really bright light"" he asked. ""hu? what light?"" ranger replied. then my fahter in law explained what we experienced the night before, then she said ""well we dont have any lights that strong besides where are we gonna stand the light from the direction you are pointing beyond the little hill is a big drop my friend, so to even bring a light up to that hight would take a lot of long tubes to hold the light"" So me and my father in law glanced at each other and we knew we had to go see what was beyond that little hill, as we climbed it we  looke and those trees are about 100 feet thats why there were visible but the drop ws tremendous! no way it could of being a ranger with a lamp, that light was floating right by the tree branches and the thing that still amazes me the most is the fact that it was about twenty feet away from us!. From that day we have a more sencitive aspect as far as when people say they experience thing like that before we just assumed they were on drugs or something, but ever since that happened I am stil exited, anxious, scared, and puzzled by that event, yet I want to know...",2002-12-23T00:00:00,,

They were to have been launched in late June 2003.  We will attempt to confirm the date of the launches.  PD)) While packing to leave my beach house, I looked up and saw a large, odd-shaped cloud that was very clearly glowing with a blue-green light.  It looked kind of like a trail left by an aircraft after the aircraft had been gone and the trail had widened, but this cloud did not move with the wind or dissipate.  I had the impression it was extremely high up (dozens of miles, perhaps).  The cloud/trail varied in thickness, and described a roughly 270-degree ""swoop"" or semicircle about five times the circumference of a full moon..  As it was an otherwise clear night, and I was intrigued by the trail, myself and two friends went over to the beach to get a better look and benefit from darker sky.  The cloud was very clearly glowing (not reflecting light) and the light was a pale greenish-blue.  It kind of looked to me what I always imagined aurorae might appear like.  Anyway, at the beach, we saw four people who claimed to see what caused the cloud.  They saw a very bright ball of light, the same color as the cloud, come tracking in quite quickly from the southeastern horizon and seemingly ""higher"", it appeared to follow the curve of the earth.  Then, almost directly overhead, it kind of ""ricocheted"" and appeared to dissipate, the fading light flying very quickly toward the opposite (western) horizon and leaving the strange glowing cloud where it ""bounced"".  In the darker sky, I could see a faint, very straight trail leading to the cloud from the direction which these other folks said the object originally appeared.  To me, it looked like the straight, slanting trail leading to the cloud was emanating from ""deeper"" into the sky, like the path of an object which ""fell"" from deeper space to the point of the cloud.  The other observers had claimed to see shooting stars and fireballs before, and that this object was a different color and moved much more slowly.  After about 10-15 minutes of observation, the cloud very slowly seemed to lose its ""glow"", though it didn't really dissipate, and never move! d from its position almost directly overhead and just a bit out to sea (east).  My hypothesis at the time (and which I still believe, but would love to have confirmed) is that some sort of meteor, fairly large, struck the upper atmosphere and glanced off, leaving a ""bruise"" of ionized gas very high up, which slowly faded out.  I'm submitting this report in the hopes someone at that end might have more information and be able to shed some light on this mystery sky-sign.",2003-07-16T00:00:00,36.837301342710994,-76.06194814578005

This black triangle in the western sky puzzled me for several reasons.  As it was in the direction of a seeting sun on a clear evening it did not reflect any sunlight as I have seen airliners do thousands of times.  The strangest thing about the whole event were the other objects that appeared to be with this black triangle.  On each side of this triangle appeared 3-4 silvery spheres.  From my view they appeared on each side of the triangle lined up at 45-degree angles.  My girlfriend who was with me noticed the triangle, but because of poor vision could not see the spheres (they were smaller than the triangle).  I witnessed these objects for a total of about 5-10 minutes.

Then I looked up and saw 3 orange circles, that look like when you turn on your stove to high.  The 3 circles formed a large dark triangle shaped object.  I immediately called my younger brother and he also observed it with me.  It was flying directly above our heads without making a noise what so ever. It looked very large, larger then a commercial air plane but flew to low for a commercial air plane.  I can't say how high it was, but a guess would be 500 to 750 feet.  1 year later, I saw on the ""Unsolved Mysteries"" show, a person who submitted a live video tape of a UFO, in Ottawa and it seemed to coincide with the time of year I saw the object.  The video showed a craft that was landed on the ground with a lot of lights, and it's hard to determine if it was triangle shaped. So I don't know for sure if it's the same one... Could be a coincidence or maybe not.  Then later on I did research as I got older and this triangle shaped object with 3 orange glow lights has been seen in different countries.  At least I'm not alone.  Another strange event, but not a sighting, which happened perhaps 5 years ago... Is that I dreamed I was having sexual intercourse with an alien.  Didn't think of it much really.  But then 1 week or 2 later I see a special report on aliens on FOX and in that report, a man was being hypnotised because he claimed he got abducted by aliens and had sexual intercourse with one of them.

You write more skillfully, I observe, than most U. S. college students. Can you be certain that the lights were not being projected by some type of device on the ground?  The motion of the lights, as they rotated, is not > inconsistent with the motion seen in a type of advertising light we have here in the U. S., so I feel duty-bound to pose the question. We will post your report in the near future.  If your friends, or wife's brother, would like to submit reports about their recollections of the event, we would most welcome them.  Please invite them to use our Online Report Form, if they would like to record the incident in their own words. Thank you very much for sharing the interesting information with our Center! Cordially,  Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE)) DEAR MR Davenport I CALLED THE OBSERVER THIS MORNING AND HAD THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS: * THE EVENT AREA IS A NON POPULATED SEMI MILITARY- CLOSED ZONE BOARDERING JORDAN AND ISRAEL. HENCE, ENTRANCE PERMISSIONS ARE ALLOWED BUT TO FEW TRUSTEES;COMMERCIALS ARE NOT TRANSMITTED TO THE PIGS?!.WE HAVE VISITED THE AREA MANY MANY TIMES AND THAT WAS THE MOST UNIQUE OCCURING EVENT. WE CAN EASLY (ME AND ALL MENTIONED VISITORS) DISTINGUISH MILITRY LIGHT PROJECTED AT ALL ANGLES SCANNING NIGHT SKIES AND SURROUNDING LAND. NOTHING WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT MY WIFE'S BROTHER HAS SEEN. ALSO, THE LIGHT EMITTED FROM THE ""OBJECTS?"" WAS SO SATURATED AND CONDENSE IMPLYING A SOURCE NATURE AND NOT A REFLECTION OR EXTENSION OF A GROUND PROJECTION. ALSO VIBRATIONS WERE (AS DISCRIBED BY THE OBSERVER) SO TINY  IMPLYING A SOURCE SELF SHAKING; A MINIMAL GROUND MOVEMENT OF A SKY PROJECTED EMISSION MEANS TENS OF KILOMETRES HORIZONTAL MOVEMENT AT THE DISTANTLY OBSERVED FOCUSED LIGHTS. ALSO, LUMINATION WAS STABLE AND CONSTANT WITH NO LIGHT SHADOWS OR LONG BEAMS EMITTING FROM THE GROUND. MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT IT WAS A VERY CALM NIGHT WITH NO REPORTS OF BOARDER PENETRATIONS URGING MILITARY SCANNING OF BOTH SIDES.

A  witness reported looking out his window and seeing an unusual object at approx: 3:00 a.m. near the Oak Bay Junction, where Oak Bay Avenue meets Fort Street and Pandora Street. The fellow said there is a hill, which is at the highest point in the city on Belmont Avenue. On the hill there is a large condo complex which is 12 to 14 stories in height. On top of the complex there are microwave and cell phone towers. From the witnesses position, looking toward the condo complex he saw a strange object flying close to the top of the complex. (He said if people would have been looking out there windows they would have had this object pass right in front of their faces). He described the object as looking like an ordinary florescent tube, square on both ends, maybe slightly rounded (ends) and a pale yellow orange glow in color.  It was traveling in a flat trajectory and just ""zipped"" by, traveling at an incredible rate of speed right at the top of the building. The witness noted the same object passed by the building twice within ten minutes in exactly the same spot. At this point he said his heart was thumping rather hard due to what he just saw. Each time the object was noticed the sighting lasted maybe for about 2 seconds. He figured it was approx: the length of a city bus.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

He reports that himself and two other friends saw an object sitting at approx: 100 feet from the ground. The sighting took place right downtown in Victoria, B.C. over the Calwood Hills. (Witnesses description to where the object was seen). He said there is the break water running along Dallas Road, and from here you can look over what is called the Calwood Hills, in the Calwood area which is over a small stretch of water called the Esquimalt Lagoon. The witnesses were out taking a walk right down at the waters edge at sunset and fortunately one of the men had a pair of binoculars with him. One of the fellows looked up and thought he was seeing a very large airplane over the Calwood Hills. The distance between the witnesses and the hills was approx: 3 to 4 miles away.  When they all realized what they were seeing was not an airplane they got very excited and went on to explain the shape of the object to me. One witnesses described the object as being tube shaped, or like the fuselage of a large aircraft just sitting stationary in one position. Even though the sun was setting behind the craft, they could see it glowing brightly from the objects side facing the three men. It was slightly tilted at about a 20 degree angle then moved slowly down behind the hills. The men stood watching for approx; 20 minutes more to see if they could catch another glimpse of it. It was about 9:45 p.m. and completely dark at this time when the object came back up and sat just above the trees. Finally they remembered they had the binoculars with them, and started to pass them around so everyone could get a good look at it. After watching it for about another 10 minutes it slowly dropped back down again. Due to having a young child with them at the time, and it was getting cooler they decided to head back home.  The fellow I talked with still went on with a few more details about what he had saw. When the object dropped down for the last time, he said it would have been right over a small lake, called Prospect Lake which is spring fed. He also said the lake itself was only a half kilometer across at the most. After thinking about it, he wondered if the object was dropping down to pick up water. The fellow claims that what was witnessed was larger than two of the biggest aircraft he knows of, even with them being so far away. There were no wings visible on the structure.  I would like to thanks the folks for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

We have reviewed all of the several photos forwarded by the witness, and all the photos appear to us to be ambiguous, with regard to whether they are photos of bona fide UFO's.  The objects in the photos could be birds, we believe, but that is pure conjecture on our part.  PD)) Pictures of UFO's that appear during stormy weather near Clovis, New Mexico. I live in Clovis, New Mexico. This is really strange, but it is true. I have been taking pictures for quite some time with a Sony digital camera. I love to photograph rain storms, clouds, sunsets, and things of this nature. This may seem really wierd, but it is true and I am willing to take a lie detector test if necessary to support my allegations. When I am photographing the sky, the naked eye doesn't see anything but clouds, rain, and rainbows. But, after I download the pictures to my computer, it is very noticable that their are foreign objects in the sky. They look like oval to circle shape objects. Some look like jets are in pursuit chasing them. The pictures I have taken are always in the eastern part of the sky during the storms. They have been taken over a 3 year span. In most of the pictures, the objects appear and are visible. When blown up some of them look like they could be flying saucers with what could be jets. I live very close to Cannon Airforce Base. I was wondering if anyone is interested in seeing these pictures. I swear these pictures are authentic and untouch photos. They are not super clear in nature and could be questionable, but I would like to know what other people think the objects could be. ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS)) Unexplained objects appearing in my photos taken with a Sony digital camera. The other day I sent information on pictures I took during stormy weather with unexplained images appearing on them. I tried to send you the pictures that were taken, but my i.p. address or mailing client is blocked from your site. So, I'll try to send them through here. Hopefully it will go.  I filled out a form under ((name deleted)). I haven't actually seen the UFO's. I like to take pictures of the sky, weather, and nature. I have taken several pictures over the past three years. When I'm taking the pictures, I don't see anything in the sky. After I download them to my computer, wierd images appear on my photos.  At first, I blew it off as something on the lense, etc. I take these pictures with a Sony digital camera. Recently, we bought a new Sony digital camera, and I got the same results. These UFO's seem to like the rainy and partly cloudy weather. Especially, if there is a rainbow or light cloud cover. I live in Clovis, New Mexico, and I often take pictures of the eastern sky because that's where the rainbows appear. I swear these pictures are untouch and there has been no digital enhancements. I find it wierd that they appear in so many different photos. Some look like jets are taking them. They are not clear, but when you blow them up you will be surprised what they look like. I'm just curious if it's possible that they are UFO's or space craft of some kind. Lately, they seem to be appearing in my photo's more and more often. I live really close to Cannon Airforce Base. I've been thinking about contacting the base and showing them my photo's. No one but family members and friends have seen them. I work most of the time so I rarely have time to spare. I'm sending you the photo's I have taken. They are very credible and I would be willing to take a lie detector test to validate that they are not retouched photos.  I hope you enjoy looking at them and you can see what I'm seeing. I've shown them to other people and they say there's diffently something showing up in these pictures. I'm sending you all the ones I have. They have been taken over a 3 year span. I'm including the pictures that look like helicopters in the sky, which appeared right before the other objects. I've also included pictures with rainbows showing nothing at first, then changing to the objects appearing, and exiting at the other end of the rainbow. That's why I believe these objects are real. Some of the picture I had were lost because my computer went down and I didn't have them backed up.I will check to see if perhaps they might have been saved on zip discs, but I'm sure they were not. Some of them were even better then the ones I will be sending in this email. I hope you find these photo's interesting.

After seeing the shadow on the ground I would immediately look up at the appropriate angle based upon the position of the sun. There was no object in the sky where one would expect based upon the position of the shadow and the sun. As I stated there was nothing in the sky on the occasions I witnessed the shadow. I kept quiet about it until my daughter (age nine) described the funny shadow to me that she had seen on a sunny day with no clouds. At that point I knew I was not just seeing things. It is rare to have completely clear days in Wisconsin. Many things crossed my mind in regard to the source of the shadow. At first I suspected it wa s perhaps a sattelite; however the size, the fact that it did not move in a straight line, and that it would have to pass in front of the sun, made this questionable to me. I decided to type in some key words in GOOGLE to see if I could find a reasonable explanation and your site came up. If I see it again I will record the day and time and provide you the information.

I was walking down a back alley toward the setting sun when I saw something zooming across the sky at an unbelievable pace.  (I remember squinting my eyes to try and get a better look).  As it continued it's path out of the sunlight, I could see that it was a very large triangle (at first I thought it may be a stealth plane) but that's when it stopped abruptly in the air and hovered for what seemed like a very long time.  I don't think stealth planes can do that, can they?  Anyway, it zigged and zagged up into the sky (again at a jaw-dropping speed) never to be seen again.  Now I know a stealth plane can't do that!

I was about 11 years of age, lived in Baldwin Park on a dead end street, there was a huge area across the street which was fenced off, there was a large hole there and machinery for breaking down stone and such, we called it the rock crusher.  I was out in my front yard and just looking around and at the area where the rock breaking machiner was, and I saw a long, cigar shaped craft not far off the ground and it was huge.  I rather remember it being brownish-red in color.  I never mentioned it to anyone, after all I was eleven and who would believe a child and even adults are not often believed.  I have never spoken about it, let alone written about it.  Reading reports and making note that there are cigar shaped crafts made me decide to make mention of the fact that I had, in fact, seen one.  This was quite a long time ago and, since I was a child, I cannot readily remember how long it was there.  I do remember, however, that it was hovering, standing still in the air and that it was huge.  I think I saw what appeared to be windows as well and they appeared down the length of the craft.  Since it has been over forty years ago and I was rather young, that is about all I can recall of the event. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP FROM WITNESS)) I am sure it was not a dirigible or blimp or baloon.  It was very low in the horizon as I remember and it was more longish rather than roundish as a blimp tends to be, although I have seen blimps with lights that could have fooled one into believing that they something else until seen clearly.  It was quite a long time ago and I have always remembered it as I have always been one to read books on UFO, science fiction, mythology, theology, etc.  I am a bit higher than normal in intelligence and I don't imagine seeing things so far.  I am not great in remembering names, but extremely good at remember faces and events, some events are almost cellular and/or visceral in their recall; remembering conversations, emotions, scenes of events, textures, etc.  What I recall was a longish, cigar shaped (which really threw me because all the movies about UFOs showed disk shaped objects - War of the Worlds) object suspended not too far off the ground, at horizon level, it was rather flat there, unlike where I live now (not too far from the Hollywood Hills).  It appeared to be a brownish red color and really long.  I didn't stick around too long and, more than likely, went inside.  Uncommon events tend to make one unsure of the true nature of things and since I was only about 11 years of age, I had nothing to relate what I saw to.  I tucked it away in my memory banks and there it has stayed until I started reading some of the sightings listed on your site.  I never realized others have seen flying cigars also.  Cigar, in my mind, is the best way to describe what I saw then.  Rather bizarre.  ((END))",,34.0853,-117.9609

Unbelievably beautiful spatial anomaly,Santa Rosa,CA,1971-04-03T20:00:00,light,30 Minutes,"Occurred : 4/3/1971 20:00  (Entered as : 04/03/71 20:00) Reported: 1/17/2003 5:06:13 PM 17:06 Posted: 3/11/2003 Location: Santa Rosa, CA Shape: Light Duration:30 Minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27141.html,"Unbelievably beautiful spatial anomaly My father and I were driving over a ridge top just at dusk when we saw the phenomenon. The object was at the far right of our view and was moving majestically from right to left horizontally at about half the speed of a satellite - VERY slowly. The object itself was about three times the size and brightness of Venus on a clear night. There were maybe 13 ‘rays’ coming from the object that spanned approximately 25 degrees of arc (it was huge, anyway I couldn’t cover it with both hands at arms length) and were equal in brightness to the object, uniform in thickness and length, and absolutely ‘steady’. In other words, they did not ‘waver, change color, or vary in any way until the object ‘exploded’. It was as if someone were slowly moving a static transparency across the night sky. Well, we were amazed! I quickly found a turn-out, stopped the car, and my father and I got out and sat on the hood of the car to watch it. As objective as I’ve tried to be it’s impossible for me to judge the time we sat there watching this. I have to say maybe 20, even 30 minutes, although it felt much longer. After it had crossed 2/3 of the sky, it ‘exploded’. I say exploded, but I really don’t know what it did, it was so beautiful and inexplicable. Suddenly the ‘rays’ disappeared like a light switch being turned off at the same moment a ‘ring’ of fuzzy light expanded rapidly from the object (which at that moment retained it’s size and brilliance) and, in about 2 seconds time, vanished out of sight over the horizons and into space. This ‘ring’ lost about half of its intensity during this expansion. Then, VERY slowly, like the unfolding of a six petaled flower, the object itself began to expand: As it expanded, in perfect symmetry, it rotated very slowly. This phase of the experience lasted maybe 5-10 minutes. It continued to rotate and expand in graceful majesty, slowly growing dimmer and dimmer. By this point the ‘lines’ of the ‘flower’ were becoming fuzzier and less distinct. Until it filled the entire sky from horizon to horizon, although by this time it was extremely dim, like a fog or vapor, with the ‘lines’ only barely visible. And then it was gone. What was it? I don’t know. It felt somehow ‘alive’ to me… like the creature in the first Star Trek: Next Generation pilot movie. It didn’t seem like a ‘craft’ exploding because of the perfect symmetry. The speed with which it was moving gives me the feeling it was quite distant, above orbital range, perhaps as far as lunar orbit, but I am no physicist. The local newspaper reported on it the next day, and I suppose many people saw it, although I’ve never spoken to anyone who did. They said it was a Soviet rocket stage re-entering the atmosphere. Maybe it was, but I don’t believe it. I’ve seen these re-entries, and they resemble large meteorites, flaming and breaking apart and moving quite a bit more swiftly across the sky. I just don’t know.

From our vantage point from a mountain northeast of Santa Rosa we spied the object perfectly sillouetted against a river of fog luminated by a full moon that was flowing across the entire valley below.I would quess that we were about seven miles away as the crow flies. I make that assumption based upon my knowledge of how far the city of Sabastopol is from Santa Rosa. Using the lights of Sabastopol peaking through the fog as a measuring stick I would have to say the object was close to being at least a mile across.Now unlike other alledged sightings this object did not have any flashing lights.I thought it strange that it wasn't illuminated like the fog or lit up at all.It was like light had no affect upon it. It was  flat dark grey in color.It had a dome on top and bottom. Hollywood movie makers could not have created a more perfect saucer,only this one was real. We looked at it for about two hours before getting bored and to cold to look at it anymore, then went home. All the time we were watching it, it didn't do anything.  It just sat motionless above the fog as the fog flowed beneath it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is public employee.  Date in 1974 is approximate.

We live out of the city, in a more rural, mountainous area.  The overseas flights from Bangor International Airport fly overhead and from my home we see/hear them passing above daily.  My first thought was that this was a late, redeye flight but the plane moved too quickly across the sky. I was about 1+ mile from the Hatcase Pond Road (formerly the South Road).  As I ascended the crest of a steep hill in the road this plane went zooming overhead.  I sped the car up trying to see out the front and passenger window in the direction that it was heading and I didn't see anything.  I then drove faster to the next field/clearing on the right (about a quarter to .5 miles further)to see it and instead of being far away it was slowly flying over the field.  This scared me so I drove faster towards home, still looking to the right above the tree line and was shocked to see that the UFO was hovering above the clearing at the end of the South Road (another .5 mile or so away).  I slammed on the brakes and was mesmerized by the shape and lights.  I could see it completely as I leaned over the passenger seat of my car and looked out the window.  It was triangular shaped and appeared black against the night sky except for blue circular lights which seemed to line the edge of the ship.

I was laying back with sunglasses on at the pool with my husband when he said ""Do you see that?"" Just a few moments before I had noticed something and was trying to figure out what it was just as he said that, so I knew exactly what he was referring to. I said ""Are you seeing what I am seeing?"" He said ""Yes."" We were laying on our backs looking up into a perfectly blue California sky, the sun to our west we were able to look straight up through our sunglasses and see what appeared to be 3 totally still triangular shaped objects that were just barely visible. The looked as if they were attempting to be invisible. The shape was easy to make out the edges seemed to shimmer from the sunlight but the color was almost mirroring the sky. They stood there very still just above us thousands of feet, I am not sure how far but far enough so that they seemed small to us, but not so high that they were hard to see. We both laid back discussing what we were seeing, they were not a kite, or any such thing, they were too perfectly still. At first we only saw 3 of them, but then another one seemed to just appear. They were all together like in a formation, two side by side, one in front, one behind. After about 5 minutes one of them went off slowly to the left then stopped, not moving at all, just as still as could be, and then went back again into same spot in formation. Then one of the other ones completely just dissappeared. We never even saw it move. Then just soon after that it seemed as if they all just dissolved very slowly, as if all they had to do was tilt so that we couldn't see them anymore, as if the material they were made of could be so mirror like to just absorb the colors of the sky and blend in. Just when we thought they were gone we saw two of them come into view again and at this point a very faint teal color seperated it from the blue of the sky and when this happened one of the craft moved quickly out of view to the left and the other just dissappeared again. We laid there at the pool staring up for another 20 minutes or so talking excitedly. There was no one else out at the pool with us so we had no one else to share this with. The thing that amazed us most is how almost invisible they were, and how still. We were not scared in the least they were too far up to scare us, and we just didn't think these objects were aware that we could see them. I have always been optimistic about ufo's being real, but I have never known anyone who has seen them, and I have never really investigated them. I was sitting here tonight ( I am in Washington State now ) watching a channel on UFO's and it donned on me that I never told anyone about that day, except for a few neighbors, but never officially reported it. My (now) ex-husband who is living in Utah now can totally back up this story, and tell you it is true. Notes: We saw no lights on these objects, but then it was in broad daylight. I do believe these objects could have been there for a long time before we even noticed them as they were very difficult to see without starting straight at them, had I looked away and tried to find them again, it would have been pretty difficult. We heard no sounds coming from these objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-04-22T00:00:00,34.19450050251256,-119.16316080402011

I went outside to the lawn area next to the pool where our apartment manager was setting up tables for later in the day, to have a BBQ and get together. It was still early and no one was setting off their fireworks yet. We lived only 3-4 miles from Moffet NAS.  I heard a very deep rumbling sound which I knew was a sonic boom. But it was deeper and louder than I had ever heard before. We both looked up at exactly the right moment to see two or three eliptical disks swoop over very low and fast. The low one that caught my attention was dull silver on the bottom but burnished orange on the side and top from the reflected sunlight. It was only 150 feet off the ground. They may have been playing 'chicken' to see who could fly lower. The higher one(s), were identical but I did not see any sunlight reflect off of it (them). They were a little bit bigger across than the wingspan of a P-3 Orion sub-chaser, of which I saw everyday in those years. It happened so fast I only got a good look at the lower craft. After they went by I looked at the manager and said ""Did you see those... I was was going to say, flying saucers, until I noticed his face was white as a sheet. So I said ...rockets"". He went inside, probably to get a drink. I thought to myself ""Well, flying saucers yeah, their real what's the big deal?"" The only question I had at that time and still have whenever I see ufo's, (14 other sightings) is who does it belong to? Ours or theirs?

I asked everyone who was on watch to look for anything unusual relating to this, and when I went on watch again it came back, but this time I had about 5 people there with me. It came down island again, as it did before and turned towards me at tree top high and approched me, but stopped about 100 yards away, and turned down island again out of sight. This happened 5 times, but only on my duty. It always stopped about 100 yards away and turned down island. I guess the thing that bothers me the most is that I had 16 section duty, which means that, every 16th day I would stand duty, and it showed up (only) on my duty.  Well, after the 5th time it did not come back until. I was sitting in the shack, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up, like someone was behind me, or watching me,so I walked to the top of the hill where I could see the other side or the island,and there it was crusing along the island at a high rate of speed, about what looked like about a couple of feet off the water. I have had dreans on occasion of a green beam, and I feel I an all knowing feeling knowledge of how this craft is powered.  I have more or less kept this to myself, as people who have not experenced this, tend to make you feel like an ass when you bring it up.  ((name deleted))  PS; As I looked below, the craft I saw was a tipical saucer type with the top dome showing a lite that looked like a diamond that you would turn in the lite of day. I have never seen one like it in all the articles and shows about them. I just remember the sound that it made which was like a low pitched sound of wind blowing through a tunnel.

I am reporting this on behalf of my son, who may choose to file his own report later. He may not recall this as he was only eight years old at the time.  This report relates to the Sighting Report filed by the Police Captain and occurred within the Mansfield, Ohio city limits just south of the west end of Cook Road.  After an early dinner our son went out to ride his bicycle while his mother and I finished our meal. It was a clear, sunny and beautiful early evening. Our son ran into the house, out of breath and said that a space ship just chased him on his bicycle and he ran into the house. Our son was NOT prone to exaggeration but after a casual glance outside on our part, we dismissed the subject and idea.  His description of the craft was that it was shaped like a cigar and had red, blue and green flashing lights. He said that it got ""real close"" to him but I don't know what the distance might have been. No mention was made of any noise comming from the craft and he did not say what happened to it.  Parents learn lessons the hard way sometime. That evening on the news out of Cleveland, 65 miles to the north east of Mansfield, it was reported that a military helicopter on a flight from Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio on it's way to Cleveland had to take evasive action to avoid a collision with a cigar shaped UFO with red, blue and green flashing lights. The encounter occurred over Mansfield, Ohio in the same time frame as our son's experience. The pilot was interviewed along with his co-pilot and both men were highly respected by the military and were considered honest. I had heard, years later, that this was one of the best documented and most reliable accounts on record. Also, years after the experience, there was a notice in the Mansfield News Journal newspaper that research was being done on this very incident. Witnesses were being sought and the intent was to interview them and get their consent to undergo hypnosis for in depth acquisition of data. I responded to this notice in writing and my letter was returned, unopened, several weeks later claiming that no such address existed in Columbus, Ohio.  Needless to say, neither his mother nor I ever dismissed his inputs to us thereafter. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-05-27T00:00:00,40.74201321839081,-82.54685747126437

We were just finishing up dinner when one of the guys said, what is that and he pointed down in the valley toward the road.  He asked me if that was an airplane because I am a licenced pilot.  It looked exactly like a small plane trying to land with its landing light on.   All of a sudden it stopped and seemed to appear right in front of us about a mile away.  My distances are not going to be accurate.  It appeared to be about 500 feet above the ground which would make it just about even with us.   When it appeared there was no landing light but it was surrounded with round light that were very bright.  It seemed that the top lights were smaller in circumfrance than the bottom lights.  There was no definite shape to the craft but it appeared to be saucer shaped with a bubble shaped top.  It seemed alot like CE-1 Vallee:  I that is why I'm saying something about my sighting now after all these years.  What is a little curious is the fact that we waited for the object the next night and it appeared in exactly the same place but with no landing light, it just seemed to come from the northwest if i remember right and hovered for 30 minutes then left in the blink of an eye you might say.  We went down to where I thought it was hovering but found nothing. We left the same day.  I've never seen anything like it again but sure would like to, it was very exciting.

I thought that ""sure is a bright yard light"". About that time we topped a hill on the interstate and directly over the trees we saw a large silver disk hovering right over the treetops. It was approx. 40-50 feet in diameter and encircled with different colored lights. Right from the center of the disk a VERY bright beam of light was directed into the trees. I had the feeling that it was collecting something or leaving something with the light beam. In just a few seconds the beam turned off and the disk rose about 30 feet in the air and departed at a fantastic rate of speed toward the horizon. Several cars slowed down to look also. We had our windows down and the object was soundless. My husband was terrified over the event. We listened to the radio and watched the papers for several days to see if there were any reports.

We lived in a quiet suburb in massachusettts.  While driving home one evening with my dad driving and mom in front, we all saw a UFO.  It happened that whihle mom n dad talked away in front, I noticed first off that my lil brother looked ""stupid"". I would have automatically thought he was making that face on purpose as we always joked around as kids do, but my immediate instinct (and i get goosebumps now at 39) was something is very wrong! All in a second it seemed..I grabbed his arm and shook him yelling his name, my mom turned around of course and is when she swore and yelled to my father to ""step on it""! I looked behind us and there indeed was a hughe circular ufo with lights all around it..hovering behind us. I was screaming to my brother who seemed to be in a trance like, and I knew intuitively to not ""let them get em"", and kept shaking him. This I now beleive is what others refer to as electomagnetic.. My dad did step on it, but I never realized to now, I don't remember the rest of the ride home. This thing was huge! It didn't make a sound. My brother was ok and ""woke up"" at home..and we've never forgotten that. My mom phone Logan International Airport to report this..she was a complete wreck, and turned out many many ppl did report the same, from the same area.  I am a beleiver...for sure.  Turns out a few weeks after that I'd gonen to a sleep over at a girlfriends house and we all decided to go outdoors and as late around 1pm i think. We laid on the grass in her yard, and talked away bout things in young girls lives.  Out of nowhere above us, were many, I would have to say eight ufo's..dangling..jetting very fast and rapidly appearing and disappearing, but above us.  When we noticed this we all were shocked and ran as fast as we could inside screaming. I don't know or recall if anyone reported that from that evening, but was shortly after my fist sighting. I couldnt h! elp wonder and still do sometimes, if it was directly related to me for having been witness to the earlier sighting, and I was being ""followed"". I didn't talk to much bout it to my friends, was embarrassed. I am a believer for sure...I can't speak to any long term effects this has had on myself and family, especialy my brother who is now 36, but I know he prefers not talking about it. I have shared this story with my daughter and other relatives, but I certainly do think it's worth reporting...back in those days we didn't have online accessibility, or the open minded approach to this issue of UFO's that we do now.… ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1976 is approximate.

We had gone outside of the tent and sat down to stare at the stars and the mountain, it was approximately 23:30.  Then all of a sudden we saw a very bright light that started out small and just got bigger, the light lasted for about 8 seconds.  It was above the horizon and was due west from where we were camping.  It was so bright that my friend saw it because it was reflecting off of my face.  The thing about the light was that it was a very clean, white almost clear light, and was amazingly bright.  Since the moon had not risen yet it was very dark, this light illuminated the ground and lasted for 8 seconds.  Right before the light vanished it moved up slightly and disappeared.  About 10 minutes after that we saw two more lights that were under the horizon also due west of our position, they looked to be a little ways out from the base of the Tetons.  They were small but bright and were moving rapidly from south to north.  Then all of a sudden the lights started to move towards us from west to east, they were moving very rapidly then disappeared.  About 2 minutes later we saw them again moving south to north, then again they turned and came straight at us again.  By this time the lights had made it to the base of the hill that we were staying on.  The lights vanished again for another 2 minutes then reappeared.  They were hovering and moving in a figure 8 type movement, just back and forth behind the trees.  They vanished again for another 2 minutes and then reapeared.  Altogether we saw these two smaller lights 4 times.  It was very strange and somewhat scarry.  When they got closer our skin was crawling, it was like we could feel the presence of another being.  After the 4th time we saw these lights I just couldn't take it anymore and got inside the tent, I was to scarred to stay outside.  Just for your information there was an Indian gathering down the hill from us, it was a big pow wow that this tribe p! uts on every year.  the Indians were camping to the south of us about .5 miles away.  We do have 3 other witnesses for the first big bright light, but no other witnesses other than my friend and I on the two smaller lights.  If you need any more information or need me to be more specific in any way please let me know. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be quite logical about his sighting, and very credible.  The first light the witness observed was not the ISS or the flare from an Iridium satellite.  The latter would not illuminate the ground noticably, and it would not illuminate the face of the witness, such that another person could detect the illumination on the observer's face, as apparently happened in this case.  The lights seen later could not have been satellites, if they were below the observer's (effective) horizon.  In addition, aircraft generally are not allowed to fly over national parks.

I guess that makes it Monday morning.  I live in California due east of the small town of Cotate in Sonoma county.  It is betewwn Santa Rosa on the north & Petaluma on the south, off Highway 101.  We live up on the side of Sonoma Mt. at 1,700 ft., 3 miles NNW of the mt. top.  It's about 23 mi. from the ocean.  I stepped out on the deck at 01:45 and was looking at the sky--some clouds & having had about 200 drops of rain!!  I could see stars between the clouds.  Looking west at (on clear days we can see the ocean--not lately tho') I saw a flashing light & watched it to see if it was an approaching airplane.  It seemed to not move, then seemed to come closer & too bright & big for even a large plane.  I am 5' 2"" tall & holding my fist at arms length it was about 20 deg. above my level, and about 30 deg. south of west.  At its closest at arm's length it was about 3/16"" diam. (at least).  I could see no form except the horizontal flashing including a green on the south side.  It flashed about every second then in an instant (less of course) it moved right a fist (extended) length & then appeared below about 1/2 a fist.  Then back to the original position.  It did this a few times with out my seeing it move.  Just appeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness illustrates how the thin, disc-shaped object appeared to ""jump"" in a triangular, clockwise pattern.  PD))  Then another appeared, maybe a fist to the left.  They alternated rapid flashing, then synchronized maybe 3 x's, then alternated again & the 2nd one was gone without visible movement.  (Both look alike.)  The first began to move north slowly with a few more erratic appearances & then went slowly, flashing, to the north & west getting smaller until I couldn't see it for the trees?  Time of viewing...??  That's a hard on...a guess is a few minutes.  I have seen other flashing lights farther away & a bit brighter than stars that were probably UFO's...not a plane  One was erratic in movement but I sort of doubted my eyes afterwards.  This time I had the edge of the umbrella as a steady point.  Great stuff!  Thanks for all your good work.  ((name and contact data deleted))   P. S.  I am 77 years old & of sound mind.  And hope to continue to be!  Which you may now doubt since I put the stamp on the envelope to open it upside down.""",2003-08-01T00:00:00,,

I was watching the object from the side of Camino Pablo (the road which runs under the BART station) about 1500 feet from the station.  While I gave some thought to stopping a car driving by and asking them to take a look, I did not do so, since they were going about 45 mph.

It was about 6:30pm central, not sure on the exact time, give or take an hour, no more. I was out side on our brick deck, grilling, when I heard a loud rumbling jet in the sky, curious I wandered in the grass to get a look. It was a regular airliner jet, blue in color with silver or gray wings, fairly low in the sky, about 15,000 feet? Flying an east to west flight path. Moments later, another passenger jetliner, red with white wings, intersected the path of the first jet but at a lower altitude of 9,000 feet, at a South to North Path. I was fascinated they did not hit each other, it could be considered a near miss. Suddenly after the two jets safely started making their way from what appeared to be  over lapping each other,  I saw a glowing white outline of a sharp peaked triangle fly inbetween these two jetliners with a slightly Northwest to Southeast flight path Going the same speed as the 2 jets.  The bottom portion of the triangle did not appear to be there, there wasnt an outline like the two sides, which formed directly into the steep nose to the craft as if it did not need wings,  and the middle of the triangle appeared to just be plain blue sky. The glow of the outline did not appear to be a form of light, just a hazey opaque white that gave the illusion it was glowing. Kind of what a piece of frosted glass looks like,  If I were to estimate, it would be a 30-40 degree angle in the triangles shape makeup.  It was not cloudy in the portion of the sky, directly above my head where all the sightings took place. Altough there were High, white puffy storm clouds on the eastern horizon. Not at all distorting any view of the events. I instinctively ran in the house to grab a camera after an adrenaline rush from fascination, and came out to be disappointed with awe, as I could not find the flying white triangle any more.  The 2 pilots of the jetliners HAD to have seen this craft, Visually, AND on radar. So I am counting them as witnesses. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the white, triangular object might have been a delta-winged, turboprop pusher, e.g. a LearStar, or a similar aircraft with swept wings.  Just a guess.  It is very difficult for an observer on the ground to determine an accurate range to a object of even known size.  PD))",2003-08-01T00:00:00,41.766329451137885,-88.14466599732262

As you can imagine, the damage done to the city was severe and extensive. At this writing, over a quarter-million homes and businesses are still without power, and there is much wreckage and many damaged buildings throught the city.  When our power went out, I switched on our battery-operated radio and listened to one of the few stations on the air, a sports-talk call-in show. Of course, no one was talking about sports. People were calling in to tell which streets and highways were blocked by debris, etc.  I listened for a while then became preoccupied with completing my morning routine without benefit of electricity when I became aware of a caller who was reporting ""something strange,"" that he'd seen. The caller sounded like a mature man, with a rural accent. He seemed very concerned that no one would believe him. The only description that I caught was that he had spotted one of ""them circle-crop things"" up in the air,  and he never believed in them before, but he swore he saw it, etc. He sounded completely sincere, and I must add, he was met with a stoney silence by the show's host, who offered no comment at all. The host and co-host merely chuckled and went on to the next caller.  I'm reporting this for a couple of reasons. First of all, Peter has mentioned that sightings are often associated with storms. Secondly, I wonder if anyone else heard this man's report and could offer more details about what the man said. (It may seem absurd to refer to a UFO as a ""circle-crop thing,"" but he sounded excited and perhaps even a bit upset by what he'd seen.)  If anyone else heard the report or saw something UFO-related before, during, or after the Memphis storm, I hope they will report it on this site.

The object was traveling in an Eastern direction, coming from the West.  Suddenly the object stopped.  It started to move again, but on a different course.  The object was soon almost directly overhead.   As the object was overhead, it rapidly flew in circles, zig-zag patterns, and hovered.  I noticed there was a sort of hazy halo around the light, and that it left a slight hazt trail as it moved.  After a few minutes of said displays, the object started moving rapidly North.  Suddenly reversing directions, the object began traveling Southward.  It was at this time that I noticed the object was not one white light, but three distinct lights composing one object, or very tight formation.  The lights were colored green, red, and white.  These are the colors used on commercial aircraft, but the did not appear in the correct configuration to be such an aircraft.  As the object sped Southward toward the horizen, it stopped briefly.

It seemed to hover and follow the train for 10-15mins, I just watched it mesmerised. The sky was crystal clear, full of stars and one of the clearest I've experienced in recent years.  I was traveling with another passsenger - I went to fetch him to confirm, but when he got to the window it was gone.  If it was a helicopter I would have heard it - it was that close.  Later in the journey South (near Garelochhead) the sky was full of helicopters. Seeing the way they moved and observing their lights was in total contrast to the amazing light I had just experienced.  Over the next few days I had nightmares about the experience. These eventually subsided, although I still occassionally have strange dreams about this night.  I do not feel comfortable thinking about this and the whole memory has an ominous feel to it.

Just above the top ridge line of the mountains to the north of us I saw what appeared to be a very large bright light, stationery in sky, but hanging low over the ridgeline.  I joked to my husband, ""there's a UFO.""  He immediately saw it, too.  As we drove, we discussed what it might be, as it was so large and did not appear to move at all.  As we got closer, we could see that it appeared to be less a light, and more an oval-shaped object that was reflecting the sun's rays.  It was very bright, but also had color to it, as though it was reflecting not only the sun's rays, but the colors of the landscape below.  My husband was driving, so he was not watching it as consistently as I was.

I was looking up at the sky for falling stars and I noticed the planet Venus (at least I think it was Venus) to my right (South). Then as I turned to look in front of me (East) I noticed a very brilliant scintillating round, kind of almost diamond shaped looking object. It was very bright (like lights through a crystal) and colorful red, blue, yellow, purple and green. I stared at this object for a little while and I noticed it began to move rather slowly then stop( it moved a distance of about 24 inches if I measured the distance an arms length in front of my eyes) it also would get brighter then dimmer. I thought it was a weird sort of star at first until it moved, what really freaked me out however was what I saw next, something caught my eye to the right (South) not to far away from the position of the planet Venus. This was a small bright pure whitish blue light which was moving toward me and at a low altitude almost to the top of a tall tree in my neighbors yard. This light was round, about 6' in diameter and very bright. It was able to start and stop at incredible speed it was moving side to side sometimes in a circular motion starting and stopping like it was looking for something? It stopped almost over where I was at I was scared somewhat by this time because I thought I was losing my mind and I did not know what this thing was and it was coming toward me! The light stopped almost over my position for about 1 minute maybe a minute and a half. Then it began to move East in the same type of start/stop motion I described this is where it got weirder it moved right into the big scintillating thing and came out like twice moving around the larger object. Then it went back into it and the larger object then slowly moved off to the Southeast until it was out of sight. I have not told any of my friends except one because I thought they would think I was! a nut or something! The friend I did tell knows I am not crazy and I think she accepts the possibility of life elsewhere. She is more open minded than I or was I don't know what to think about what I saw but it really shook me up. By the way I have a highly technical occupation am a college graduate and have gone to many an airshow. I have logged quite a few hours flying and have seen aircraft, satellites, balloons and falling stars on many an occasion both day and night, these things were not like anything I have ever seen fly before. I wonder if a human pilot would have even been able to endure the acceleration/deceleration and turns the smaller object made? The G's would have been pretty scary from what I saw!

Hi Peter. This is Brian Adams of the Missouri Investigators Group (UFOMIG.com) and I was assigned to do a followup investigation of this NUFORC sighting report>  Occurred : 5/8/2003 00:45 (Entered as : 05/08/03 00:45) Reported: 5/16/2003 8:20:26 AM 08:20 Posted: 5/27/2003 Location: Clinton, MO Shape: Circle Duration:3-4 minutes circular object with 5 lights seen in Henry county  I reached the witness finally by phone on July 15 the after leaving two phone messages and emails that previously did not get a response back in June.  The witness, a female hospital worker/student, then apologized saying that she was busy with her wedding and honeymoon last month.  We then discussed her NUFORC report and the specific location where she on May 8th she described her UFO encounter on Highway 13 south of Highway 2 just inside Henry County, Missouri. She was driving home from work in Warrensburg back to Clinton, Missouri after getting off her hospital shift just after midnight.  When she first observed the craft lights that she assumed was a life flight helicopter over a field to the west heading north to Warrensburg but it suddenly moved right over to the side of the highway as she drove towards it.  She said she slowed down to less than 10 mph keeping the object in view through her windshield as this craft hovered above.  She said that the craft was hovering no higher than a large tree above the west side of the road but no trees were nearby.  The size of the craft was as big as a house but she really only saw the bottom left side of the craft perimeter.  She said that the perimeter reminded her of an octagon shape as it curved with four small yellow/white lights on the perimeter.  It had a larger nonpulsing red light in the middle underneath and she could tell of a metallic structuring at her vantage almost underneath it.  It was at this point she decided to call somebody to rationalize what she was witnessing.  She decided to use her cell phone to call her supervisor whom she new was still on duty at the hospital.  She explained to her what the craft was doing and her supervisor asked if the craft was making any noise.  So she turned off her car radio that had been on and rolled down her window but she didn't hear any noise at all.  She then kept describing the following moments to her supervisor.  A yellow/white beam of light came down out from the red light shining first in the roadside grass then it moved across the road.  It was at this point she said that the craft actually began to sway slightly back and forth causing the light beam to go back and forth across the highway 5 times.  This is when she noticed an approaching car from the south as it stopped just in front of the light beam in the road.  The craft then began to move back the direction it came from slowly heading over the field then it suddenly vanished like the lights all blinked out at once.  She was still driving slowly forward in her car and drove past the stopped car with  a man in the other car looked over at her as she drove past.  She didn't stop to ask him any questions and drove on home to Clinton.  For some reason she didn't mention her sighting to anybody and had to be reminded later by her supervisor about the incident again.  Thus resulting in the delay to report it to NUFORC eight days later on May 16th.  She said that now she keeps watching the sky and she has a camera in her car just in case something strange is possibly seen again.  She promised to complete a questionnaire that I emailed to her that may give some more details of her encounter and return it back to me.

I had been watching the object for at least 10 minutes. I could not believe what I was seeing. Things got interesting. The object came to a final stop and kept rising higher and higher in the sky.

I believe it was in early September but I'm not positive about the date only the occurance.  It was either '75 or '76 and had to be late in tne year because it was cold!  We had a small camp trailer there and also an old bedstead which you could put a mattress on so you could sleep outside if you wanted.  The girls chose to sleep in the back of our new Datsun pickup and we clamped a sheet on the roll bar to the tailgate so they would be warmer as the wind was really cold.  They were sleeping and we were hanging a sleeping bag over a clothes line which hung above the head of the bed where we were going to sleep as a sort of windbreak also. It was about 11:00 P.M. and a crystal clear night.  All of a sudden the sky lit up like it was 12:00 noon! We looked toward the east to which we had a perfect view of the mountains of Yosemite amd sailing across the sky at a rapid rate was the biggest fireball I have ever seen in my life!  Not thart I have seen any before or any since this thing was HUGE and it was whistling and had a huge, long firey tail!  At first I thought it was lightening until we saw it!  I litterally thought the sun was falling out of the sky!  It takes some time to register these things because you don't believe your eyes!  I am glad someone was there to see this with me. So this huge fireball sailed from the east to the north towards Mariposa and we watched it for about 20 seconds or less even until it HIT somewhere over the mountains to the north of us.  When it hit the whole ground shook!  So as we were watching over where it had hit with our mouths hanging wide open before we could say anything here comes right over the top of us three lights in a triangle pattern.  We could not tell if it was one huge object or three fkying in formation.  I finally spoke first as by then I was totally freaking out and said what the ! F--- kin d of plane is that but I knew when I said it, it was no plane.  It or they or whatever made no noise what so ever and they were almost grazing the tops of a couple pine trees next to us.  The light in front (one in front and two behind) glowed bright white and the two behind were an odd blue green color. As they flew over a couple oak trees going from north to south, we ran along side through the trees which took us about 5 seconds till we reached a clearing where we could see the whole sky and all the horizons and they were totally gone!  No noise, no nothing!  We spent the whole night trying to decide what to do.  Should we tell someone?  Should we call the cops and what the heck are they going to do?  We asked a lot of people if they saw anything-it was so hard to miss as it was lit up like broad daylight!  During those years, though, the area was very sparsely populated.  I have always wanted to know if anyone ever saw the same thing becauyse I know something hit the ground in that area. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-03-11T00:00:00,37.3961,-119.7345

The hull changed color like a soap bubble but the color was the light source instead of a reflection of light.  It appeared to become more transparent when there was more light behind it and more light producing when there was less light behind it.  It made no noise and the inhabitants which I could see as profiles appeared to be human and it wouldn't really surprise me to find out that it was from earth as in a special air force plane. I could see the platform that the riders were standing on and the instruments appeared to be mostly centrally located except for one or two short panels nearer the outer edge of the ship. It also would not surprise me if there were no other reports of this because even though it occured in downtown L. A. anyone who has seen anything like a flying saucer is rediculed from the outset and not having proof ignored. That was my husband's report  . He was taking me to work on Figueroa and I spotted it behind a hotel on Olympic & Figueroa. It was on our left and I was able to look into the craft and they were staring back at us. I was on the back of his Honda 450 motorcycle and got a great view.I am willing to be hypnotized to give better details. I gave a report to this site last year but I wanted to share my spouse's perspective. It was strange to see a UFO downtown but that was years before they developed the land. It was probably 75 or 76. But it was Oct.31st because I was working at 1200 12th st and there was a Halloween party that nite at work Morrie's Ballroom. It was only about 15-30 feet off the ground. There was 3-4 men that were leaning over what looked like a console at us. I don't know where they were from but I'll never know if I don't submit this form. It's been a mystery for a little over 25 years and I need to know if anyone has seen a Ufo that reminded them of a soap bubble that they could see through when the sun hit it just! right. It occured around sunset going westward.,2003-03-11T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

I was ten years old and I believe it was early March/late February when this all occurred. My mom is a fairly hokey person who believes she sees things all the time (spirits etc.) so when she woke me up in the middle of the night to look at spaceships my first reaction was ""go away.""  My dad and sibling wouldn't get up either.  So she came back to me.  I felt bad at this point and out of sympathy got up to go to her room and look out her window.  She handed me bi-oculars and pointed south of our house over the cornfield.  ""There,"" she said, pointing in the east.  I saw nothing for a minute or two, but she insisted that I stay.  Believe it or not I saw it zip across the sky and stop suddenly, as quiet as a mouse.  It was like it was playing a game.  I saw it zip back and forth between it's starting and ending points a few times. We where looking south from northern most part New Lenox which at the time was pretty rural. I tried to wake my dad up.  ""If they're out there I don't want to know,"" he said and rolled over to try to sleep. My mom and I came to realize that there where two ships.  The one in the eastern part of the sky started to 'eject' small 'ship like' things to the west of it.  I have more detailed records of all of the 'ship like' things and am going to send in the orginal record of this event as soon as possible.  In the west sat another ship across from the eastern ship. At this point the Eastern and Western ships started to ""do"" geometrical patterns. This is hard to explain- but we definately saw geometerial patterns in the sky- moving and changing color. It was eerily silent and beautiful. As it started to become light they seemed to stop. The next day we made records of these patterns and everything we had seen.  I got on the school bus and looked to the east for the main ship and it was there! I wasn't a very social child at the time and besides who would believe me so I watched it as long as I could in awe of its sleek silver oval shape. On the bus ride home I saw it again in the Eastern sky.  A plane (a regular plane- not a jet or anything) started to approach it from the Northwest and I became fearful that someone would find it- but instead the UFO seemed to ""turn"" from the bottom up and blended in with the sky.  The plane passed as if the UFO had never been there. I got off the bus and walked to my house backwards keeping my eyes on the UFO which had reappeared. I entered the house and told my mom they where still out there.  We tried to talk my sibling and my dad into watching them with us that night- but they refused.  They didn't believe or want to see. So my mom and I watched the ships for two more nights.  I never saw the Eastern ship in the daytime again.  But I always look there when I drive through town- just incase. We haven't seemed one since, but I find my self looking at the stars hoping to see a dash across the sky and a sudden quiet stop by a silvery ship. As I said earlier I will try to find the orginal documents and send them to you ASAP. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-03-11T00:00:00,41.5129,-87.9605

We were comming home in my van on a dirt road. I looked to what I believe to be N/E at a large hill in the distance. Above that hill floated the object. If you held a quarter at arms length that is how big it appeared. It looked like a round ball of fire with small flames comming off in all directions including straight at the viewer. Every once in a while it would dip behind the hill and then back up. I blew it off at the time as a military flair, but what flair suspends that long a period of time. Here is the clincher. It did not look ""HOT"" at all it gave off a dull orange color but I did not get the impression of heat or light. Intense light like a flair would make.

Also referenced in the 50's Sci-Fi classic ""The Giant Tarantula"" they referenced the base in the movie. To paraphrase ""they were going to send to  Victorville""(for air support). This was George AFB. I also can add for a reference point that when the town folk tried to blow it up(the tarantula) it was traveling toward Victorville on Highway 247. My sighting was a few miles behind the spider away from the direction it was traveling and far to the left  of the highway. I intent to look at the California map and draw a pretty good location and picture of the sighting. I believe the direction I saw the object was toward ""China Lake"" military installation.

That house was always really strange, but I was young so I thought it was ghosts or something like that. But know that I have read about abductions, I know it wasn't ghosts. I was looking for my parents, and I realised that they must have gone out ito the yard. I walked into the kitchen, and saw that the wall in front of me was rippling like water after you drop a pebble into it. I watched this for about three seconds before the wall totally dematerialised. I walked into the room beyond the hole in the wall, and my mind seemed to slow down - everything slowed down, and the walls, the ceiling, the floor, every surface in the room was covered with wooden floorboards. There were absolutely NO shadows anywhere. In the middle of the room there was a floating 'Rectangular Prism' shaped craft with alien script scrolling down the walls on the inside. And there were plasma effects... gotta go ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-03-11T00:00:00,,

They began to move in a strange way across the sky still linked together like a sidewinder snake.

Years ago,  while serving time at Calipatria State Prison. While we were returning from the chow hall after the evening meal was served we noticed bright orange glowing lights off to our left (towards the east near the arizona -california border) they seemed to just hover there.  My first thought was that they were helicopters but to my knowledge choppers can't stay on station that long and to just hover there seemingly motionless.  Even helicopters on station will move laterally to some degree these did not we heard no noises either. Due to the proximity to the Yuma weapons testing ground and other military installations in that area we assumed it was some type of new flares or something along those lines. but To my understanding flares don't stay up in the sky that long. I'm not sure exactly about the exact month of this sighting.  Also if they were helicopters they would have been to close together in formation to just hover it would seem that their rotor blades would have colided with one another.  It was strange indeed and there were alot of us prisoners that saw this incident. We were not allowed to stay out side and watch them as long as we wanted to as we were being herded back into our buildings/cells but we witnessed them for at least 10 minutes or so and heard reports from other inmates as they returned back to the building so they had to have been out there for some time. Also it should be noted that this occured for several nights consecutively at approximately the same time. ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary date so that the report sorts to June 1995.

The main change is the date.  Please revise date from 12/20/93 to 12/23/93. <---- Updated Report (not many changes besides the date) I also emailed photos ----> Date of sighting: Thursday, December 23, 1993 - approximately noon Location of sighting: Valencia, CA @ hilltop near I-5 and 126 interchange (34° 26' 50N"" Latitude 118° 36' 10W"" Longitude) I only have one sighting to share but it has kept me thinking for many years now. I think a sighting can be very informative if the observer notes not only what was seen but also the circumstances under which it was seen. I used to work for an amusement park in Valencia, California called Six Flags Magic Mountain. I was a senior in high school at the time and worked the summers, weekends, and holidays. This week the forecast called for thunderstorms and a high probability showers. It was only a few more days before Christmas and one of those days when I knew the park would be empty. That day I was on my lunch break when I sat in my usual quiet spot not far from where Batman the Ride would later be built. It overlooked our employee facilities in the foreground and the intersection of the I-5 freeway (north/south) and the 126 (east/west) in the distance. My view was to the east and toward a small range of mountains on the other side of the I-5. The mtn peak is about 200 feet above the I-5 freeway. At its base now sits an extension to the Valencia Industrial Center and the northbound I-5 to 126 off-ramp. On the other side of this mtn range is a field of gas wells in what is called the Honor Rancho Plant (owned and operated by Southern California Gas Company). At lunchtime there was a thunderstorm moving from north to south. It had already passed where I was but I could still see the lightning in the distance and the sky was entirely overcast. About 15 minutes after I sat down I had finished what I was eating and looked out at the freeway, at the range beyond, and then to the clouds. I was just passing the time I had away from my work when I saw something moving in the lower layer of the cloud formations. It was situated across the freeway and just above the mtn range (about 100 ft above the hill's peak). At first I thought it was a shadow. As it came into clearer view I thought maybe it was a helicopter even though I didn't see a tail and its shape wasn't quite the same. It was in nearly zero visibility because of the clouds and was inching southward (left to right), much slower than the clouds around it. This is probably why it caught my eye. It was a grayish tone (maybe metallic), elliptical in shape with the long axis parallel to the horizon line, about 25ft in width, 12ft in height, and had no distinguishing extrusions. If it had any markings on its surface I couldn't see them from this distance (1.4 miles). Patches of cloud would make it appear and disappear over what was to be 2-3 minutes. I watched almost unblinking at what I couldn't identify. I might add that the only sounds I heard included a light thundering to the south and the hum of the traffic on the I-5. I would normally have also heard the occasional yell from someone on a ride some distance away, but because today was a few days before Christmas the park was virtually empty. Then at one point clouds passed in front of it, obscuring it completely. I thought I'd lost it, but I kept watching. 15-20 seconds later it reappeared the cloud having passed it. Now it was clearer than ever and it hadn't hardly moved. I still couldn't see any detail and my mind was a blank as to what this object could possibly be. It was kind of small to be a blimp and kind of big to be a balloon but I guess it could ha! ve been one or the other. Then it did something no blimp or balloon I've ever seen could do. After 2-3 minutes, the object shot up into the clouds instantaneously, like it had been attached to some long extended rubber band that I couldn't see. The speed was so fast (and the fact that the object was already nearly engulfed by the clouds surrounding it) that, had I blinked, I would have certainly missed this last maneuver. There was no deformation in the object that I noticed in the 2-3 minutes that I watched it. What I did see however was the deformation of the misty cloud as the movement of air suddenly displaced it. This was the one key piece of information that convinced me what I saw was actually there. A fraction of a second before the object lurched upward I also saw it drop ever so slightly like it was ""changing gears"" or transitioning from one mode of operation to another. The speed of the final maneuver convinced me that what I was dealing with was not a object of any kind I had ever seen and I thought this maneuver was the last of this sighting and that I'd never see anything this unusual again. I was wrong. I immediately looked at my watch hoping to record the exact date and time of the sighting, but all I could manage to remember was the placement of the second hand and only for a moment at that. This is why. I continued to look in awe over the freeway for some hope of an answer. Then, about 10-15 seconds after the object had shot into the clouds, a small bolt of lightning that I couldn't hear at that distance struck EXACTLY where the object (above the hill's peak) had been situated. I was sure this was no coincidence and I've thought about this sighting (the only sighting I've ever had) for years.

This was a family restaurant where no liquor is served.  Just a regular night out with family members in their 40's & 50's and a couple of kids.   I went out to the parking lot to get some family photos I left in the car, when I looked next to me I saw a couple & another woman, not with the couple, looking up in awe & when I looked up I saw a round red pulsating ball just hovering right above us (wouldn't move, like it was watching us) facing north, s. of Miami intl airport close to our home in Coral Gables. It looked alive, like a red plasma of sort - no other colors, no tails & no sound. It was about 2000 feet up in the air & it was big & beautiful red blob. It was about 4 full moons in size. I was in total awe & wanted my husband to see this so I ran inside the restaurant to get him & he sensed my desperation & came right out(took about 2 seconds)& the red ball was moving west (towards the everglades) becoming smaller & smaller until it was the size of a little red pinhead & it disappeared west somewhere.  Well, I'm glad I had my husband witness this with me so he didn't think I was crazy. We were sort of in shock and casually walked inside,remained silent & didn't say anything for fear of the family thinking we were nuts.  We have kept this to ourselves for about 5 yrs.

STANDING IN THE VEHICAL WAS WHAT SEEMED TO BE A MALE FIGURE , HUMAN IN SHAPE, LEANING ON A LEDGE WITH HIS HANDS ON IT, LOOKING AT OUR HOUSE. WHEN I CAME TO THE WINDOW AND HE SAW ME LOOKING AT HIM HE DID NOT MOVE AND JUST CONTINUED LOOKING AT ME. I WAS FACINATED. BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT FROM THE CITY BEHIND IT I COULD SEE THE CRAFT JUST FLOATING AND GENTLY ROCKING AS IF A BOAT ON WATER. I STARTED SCREAMING TO MY HUSBAND, WHO WAS ON 2THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE IN OUR BEDROOM, TI HURRY AND COME SEE THIS. JUST THEN THE CRAFT GENTLY TILTED SO THAT I COULD SEETHE BOTTOM AND STARTED TO MOVE SLOWLY TO THE EAST. BY THE TIME MY HUSBAND GOT TO THE WINDOW IT WAS ABOUT 50 FEET OFF THE GROUND AND 50 FEET AWAY AND ALL YOU COULD SEE WERE THE RED AND WHITE BLINKING LIGHTS ON THE BOTTOM. HE TRIED TO TELL ME IT WAS PROBABLY A HELICOPTER BUT I EXPLAINED TO HIM THERE WAS NO SOUND SO IT COULD NOT BEEN A HELICOPTER BECAUSE THE NOISE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY LOUD THAT CLOSE TO THE HOUSE. A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THIS THE CITY HAD TO REPLACE A LARGE TRANSFORMER THAT WAS IN THE AREA THE CRAFT WAS IN . A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS INCIDENT I NOTICED CITY TRUCKS IN MY PROPERTY CHANGING TH! E TRANSFORMER AGAIN. I HAD NOT CALLED THEM THIS TIME. THE FIRST TIME IT WAS CHANGED I HAD NOTICED THE TRANSFORMER HUMMING AND CALLED THE CITY AND THEY CAME OUT NAD REPLACED IT.

"A formation of hundreds of pulsating white lights, moving slowly parallel to the road",Ladson,SC,2000-05-15T21:30:00,other,10 minutes,"Occurred : 5/15/2000 21:30  (Entered as : 05/15/00 21:30) Reported: 3/31/2003 7:58:37 PM 19:58 Posted: 4/22/2003 Location: Ladson, SC Shape: Other Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28280.html,"A formation of hundreds of pulsating white lights, moving slowly parallel to the road My fiancee and I (now my wife) had left my mother's house after visiting with her on that Mother's Day weekend. It was about 9:30 p.m. We stopped shortly for gas before continuing home. As we pulled out of the gas station to turn, I immediately noticed a large bright object that was nearly directly in front of us in the sky, just across the road from our position. At first I did not notice any particular hard shape to the object -- it appeared to be a formation of hundreds and hundreds of white lights, pulsing, and moving slowly parallel to the road that lay in front of us (approx 45 -55 mph). It was roughly the shape of a cut diamond-- a flat top, angling out to two points, then down to a point at the bottom center. The lights were continuously pulsing -- not being extinguished, but alternately growing bright and then dim. They did not pulse in pattern, but seemed to be random, but quickly and continuously. Other than the white lights, I did notice at least two red lights - one in the center mass of the object, and one, perhaps two, at the bottom edge. This object was quite close; we were within just a couple hundred yards. It was flying over treetop level, so I would estimate it was several hundred feet in the air. The object by my estimate was 50 to 100 feet in length. There was no sound whatsoever. The night was dark but clear. Exasperated by the sight, we quickly turned right to follow the object. As we followed the angles of the road, the object was in front as we trailed to follow. I did not notice a ""change"" in shape, but perhaps from a different viewpoint, the object then appeared to be somewhat oval in shape, and I picked up a distinct pattern to the lights - the object seemed to be divided into four equal quadrants of white lights, and was ""hollow"" in its center. That is to say that the quadrants seemed to meet together around a small hole in the middle that had no lights. We continued to follow the object, but its pace began to pick up. At one point, it seemed to stop and hover over the road in front of us for several seconds. It then continued to cross the road to our right, and we turned off to follow. We followed its trail for several minutes, intermittently losing it in the trees and then sighting it again. The last sighting of the object we had, it was moving away at a very high rate of speed; in a few moments, its spectacular lights were indistinguishable from the nights' stars. Traffic on the roads that night was not particularly heavy, but there had to be a dozen or more witnesses. I called local television stations and the Air Force Base just to ask if anyone had reported ""something weird"" in the sky without relating my own story. No one had. I did hear, from the base's public affairs, that a commercial blimp had flown in the area earlier on the same day. But with the flight characteristics, it's shape, the hundreds and hundreds of pulsing lights, I just don't see that I could mistake a flying balloon for what in my own estimation was an unkown object. I'm an Army veteran and have flown in all sorts of aircraft and helicopters, but I can't say that I've ever seen an object like this, and I haven't seen one since. But ever since that day, I do spend quite a lot of my time with my eyes toward the sky, hoping that I get to see one again. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was very late at night/early morning, about 2:10am. I hadn't been in bed long when my mother called me to look at something out the window with my friend, who was also witness. I looked out of my bedroom window and seen a hazy orange glow - it was obscured by the screen, so I went for a closer look out of the living room window, from which it could be seen in perfect clearness. The sky was clear with a few clouds, none of which were near what we seen. It was a round orange ball in the sky across the road and field to the west in front of our house, above and diagonal with the treeline. Not at all like a meteor, which most people would think of when I describe it, as it wasn't a ""ball of fire""; It was bright and light orange; the edges were even brighter, a red-orange. My mother, who had been watching it for longer and when it was higher in the sky, said there was a half-ring of darker flickering 'fire' on the left side (I couldn't see this, because it was hidden very partially by the trees). It was very smooth, lacking any pock-marks or lights, metal sheen or anything at all but smooth orange, unlike most ""UFO"" sightings I've read about...it was nothing I've heard of before. It was perfectly solid looking, emitting no glow. It was large, or seemed pretty big, although to give a description of the size is difficult. Looking through binoculars, it was a definite sphere. At first, I thought it might be the moon -- but then I realized... the moon isn't full. In fact, it's only in first quarter. The majority of what we seen would have been the side that is DARK. Later on that night (morning), my mom seen the moon nowhere near where the orange circle was, high in the air, and white, to boot. It was moving... very slowly, diagonally downwards and to the right, further into the trees - it didn't look like it was moving unless you watched closely. When it was in the trees, it noticeably paused. Although it was difficult to tell, it looked as if along with the trees in front of it, the circle also obscured the trees behind it, but it's hard to say for sure. It stayed there for a moment...an orange glow in the forest (though it didn't actually glow)...and then went *staight down*, quickly -- not light-speed, but about five or six times faster than the sun sets and disappeared out of sight. As I was thinking of running for the camera, that's when it went down. In retrospect, it was rather pretty, but at the time, it gave off no such vibes... there was an eerie quiet and still. None of the traffic that had been going by drove down the road the entire duration of the sighting, but started up again only minutes after it disappeared... probably a coincidence, but it added to the feel of there being something wrong here. We contacted the coast guard and they reported no other sightings.",2003-03-21T00:00:00,,

This object was traveling very slow & left no contrail. I compared this object to surrounding air traffic which all were leaving contrails at 35k feet. I watched as the object moved in a NE direction but not in a linear direction. I watched as it appeared to stop & ascend upward until it vanished out of sight. This entire event lasted about ten minutes. I don’t know of any aircraft that moves like this. I was able to capture some photos & upon zooming in on them w/ my computer, it certainly was not an airplane. My guess is that this object was at a very high altitude because even using 9x zoom, it was hard to make the shape out.

I later had her draw a picture and she depicted a crescent-shaped object with porthole-like objects along the bottom. She also remembers a reddish glow around the object that then changed to either green or blue. This was a daylight sighting with little or no wind, and my daughter said it was ""not as high as a jet but way higher than a bird up in the sky."" She also admitted that she watched it for quite a few seconds in stunned silence before she was able to open her mouth and call for me.

This is a report of something that happened to me and a co-worker on a warm summer night that change the way I see things. We worked the late shift a resturant we got off in the early mouring hours and we talked in the parking lot and threw around a football I had in the car for a while. We left (I was taking him to his house in Madsion) and we where driving down US 119. There was never any traffic on the road that late at night and we normally stopped at a gas station. When we went by the 24 hour gas station it was closed. We wonder why and made mention of the clerk problay was taking a nap. As we drove on we began talking about something and then I said that car is on the wrong side of the road. It's light were off and it was parked. It should not have been facing towards us on the four lane road. Then he said my dad use to work there(refering to a coal mine) and then I sort of blacked out and when he said something to me it was like I was in a dream. When I came to I realized the car was going about 10mph on a 55mph road. My foot was of the gas. I ask him what happened and he said he couldn't remeber what he was saying. I pointed out the speed we were traveling and the parked car. He said that was weird and he felt funny. We talked the whole way home about something else. That is when at his house I noticed the sun coming up. I said it not time for sunrise. He agreed and we assumed the time had changed. His wife said it changed in the spring and that we were crazy. I was still a young adult living at home. So I called home to tell my mom that I was going to be late. Somehow that night we lost 45 minutes to an hour. He refused to talk about it at work the next day. He tried to turn it into a joke. Years passed and I saw him again and asked him about it. He said I don't know what happened to us out there but something did. That is the truth , we were afraid to talk about it. As time went on I can no longer remember the date or the exact time of departing w! ork or arriving at his house. One thing I can assure you is that it did happen and somewhere out there is the lost hour of my life. I don't know what happened to that time we lost and one thing is for sure I don't ever wish to feel that way again. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-05-27T00:00:00,,

My husband and I were headed North on Hwy 39, just outside of Plant City, FL, at about 8:30 pm.   Suddenly there was a bright flash of light which drew our attention to the sky where we saw an orange-yellow oval object which appeared to be on fire racing across the sky.  It's fire tail disapated and the object continued to glow that orange-yellow color. We have seen many such objects but this one appeared to be in distress.  It just didn't look right.  Fearing that it would crash we headed East on the nearest side road.  The object was on the North side of this road, but its path took it across the road as it was headed in an East/SouthEast direction.  We estimated where this object would ""fall"" or intended to land, and raced East down Hwy. 60, to the city of Mulberry, about 12 miles away.  We saw nothing else that night, but what we saw the next day will make me wonder just what we saw for the rest of my life.  Just outside the city of Mulberry, we saw police and military personnel manning the perimiters of an abandoned phosphate mine and trainyard(across from IMC Rainbow Phosphate Co.)   There were over 20 marked police vehicles(state and local), atleast the same number of unmarked police/federal vehicles, and four canvas covered military cargo trucks.  There were over 60 soldiers in fatigues holding M-16's securing the area.  I know a woman who lives in that area, and on her way home that day she was turned away and asked to take another route home due to an enraged man with a gun that was threating to take his own life, and the life of his daughter.  None of these activities were reported on any of the local news channels.  I am convinced that what we witnessed was a UFO crash recovery. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

No sound. Aprox size of basketball held at arms My mom and I were walking to the library around 7pm on a weeknight when we spotted a circular shaped object coming towards us from the south (I was 7 yrs old, my mom 27 at the time). It stopped over a transformer above us a few feet west of us and maybe 500-700 feet above us. It just hovered there for a few minutes. We thought it was either waiting for a plane to pass by or drawing power from the transformer. After a few minutes of hovering it slowly moved going east, passing over us heading east towards Lake Michigan. The thing that I can not explain is how quiet the object was. Nothing I know of can move, stop, change directions and move again so quietly, not a sound. The size of the craft was about the size of a basketball held at arms length, and I'd guess it was no higher than 500 or so feet. I remember the color being a yellowish changing to orange color that changed back to yellow, then orange. My mom remembers more lighting on its edges, like a ring of lights (I remember when we were looking at the object her saying that to me, and I never did see the ring of lights, she said it might be because of our height difference, I was a short 7 yr old then). My mom also believes that we lost as much as an hour that night. We went to the library to pick up a book and come home. Normally a trip like this would take 30 minutes at the most, but we were gone over 2 hours. My father asked what took us so long, and we didn't think we were gone more than 30 minutes and didn't know what to say. The next morning my mom contacted the Air Force and filed a report. She was made to feel like she was seeing things or saw swamp gas or an airplane. Now 40 years later, we still remember that night. I have a college degree with honors, a pilots license, a scuba license and am an amature astronomer. Nothing in my education or experience can explain what I saw that night. I've seen bright Venus, comets, planes, weather balloons, hot air ballons, flocks of birds flying high over the city at night that looked ! like a flying triangle, but nothing that can move so quietly like that object. Currently I'm involved as a volunteer searching for SETI with my computer at home. I find it interesting that so many people have seen UFO's and we prove them. It's as if they don't want to be proven. If we are dealing with a species more advanced than us, it might be impossible to know what to look for, since we don't know what it is we need to look for. It's like the indians looking for the calvery on horses, but the calvery come by jet instead, here and gone before you know what's going on. What my mom and I witnessed has yet to be explained, it was a UFO in every sense. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We will invite the witness to have his mother submit a report, as well.

Elmont is a rural area of Hanover County, Virginia, about 10 miles north of Richmond, Va. It was in 1977 and I lived about a quarter-mile from the school and was walking to get there early to do some activity in the school library before classes started. I was with my friend and we were in the second grade. We were walking along some pine trees on the side of the parking lot toward where the school office and cafeteria were. I looked up across the parking lot and saw a disk that was silver and glinting in the sun just over the top of some oak trees that were in a horse pasture across the other side of the parking lot, which is not very big. The lights around the side of the disk may have blinked or changed color but I'm not sure. I just recall being in shock like I was rooted to the ground and we stopped walking and just stared. The degree of shock at seeing it was almost like an electrical shock and I was terrified. The disk made no noise whatsoever. It was just hovering in one spot. Then, and I don't remember how long it was exactly, it was just gone and nothing was over the trees anymore. We went in and later that day I told my second grade teacher who punished me for lying. I have never forgotten seeing that and I know I did not imagine it. I still wonder what in the world it was. My friend at first denied seeing it but when I asked her a few years later she said she remembered it too. I have a law degree from the University of Virginia and am not making this up.

In November of 1995 I left work about 8 p.m.  I had to stop over at my parents house and decided to take a ""back road"" because it was quicker, the road is 7 miles of uninhabited state land, it is a winding dirt road, I had traveled it many times before and was very familiar with the road and terrain next to it.  The night was overcast so there were no stars or moon visible, about 2-3 miles down the road I came around a sharp bend and saw an object hovering above the treetops straight ahead (where the road takes another sharp bend).  At first I was confused about what I was looking at, it didn't make sense what I was seeing.  I stopped the car and put it in park, and rolled down my window, I heard absolutely nothing, the craft was about 50 ft down the road from me, It had 4 rows of orange or amber lights, and it had a whitish-green mist around the it, the bottom of the craft lit up the branches of the trees it was hovering over, the lights around the rim were NOT pulsating or changing colors, they remained constant and didn't seem to shine very brightly.  About this time I completely freaked out! I didn't feel I had time to turn the car around so I threw the car into park and gunned it, I went straight towards the craft and hoped to hell it wouldn't start following me or shine a light on my car, (I had heard the stories), Good God it was terrifying.  When I got just about under it I had to brake to make the corner and I remember glancing up, I don't recall exactly what I saw, but I do remember a small bright ""neon"" green light somewhere on the bottom of the craft, I drove like a bat-out-of-hell until I got to my parents house, I could hardly walk into the house my legs where so weak, and as soon as I saw my mom I started bawling like a baby, She didn't really know what to say when I told her what happened.  And to this day my family gets uncomfortable if! I bring it up. After that experience I had terrible nightmares, I'm not saying I was ""abducted"" but the nightmares were along that line. and I would have panic attacks when I drove at night, especially since I live in a rural area. Well I could write more, but I think this will do. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; date is approximate.

In the days after the events of 9/11/02 I knew the skies were empty of civilian traffic so I thought I would keep my eyes open for possibly any military traffic. After not seeing anything on the night of 9/11/02.  I stopped over a friends house the following evening (9/12/02) and after talking about it we headed outside at approximately 20:00 to 20:10 hours the skies were completely clear with quite a few stars and by luck within a few minutes of heading outside we both at the same time sighted (2) two lights moving in tandem with the southern light trailing the northern light at a distance of about one inch in relation to a thumb and forefinger of an out-stretched hand, I approximated them to be at orbital heights and speeds moving from East to West.  I immediatley considered them to be satellites due to their speed and brightness but thought it was odd that they were traveling in such close proximity to each other and at that instance the trailing southern light grew much brighter almost blueish in intensity than the northern light and suddenly burst ahead of the northern light.  Following this, the northern light also grew brighter and jumped ahead of the southern light,this occured at about the 1 o'clock position and as they crossed to about the 2 o'clock position they both began a counter clockwise spiral rotation around each other as if they were playing follow the leader.  We first picked up the objects up at approximately the 11 o'clock position and followed them through to just past the 2 o'clock position before loosing them in the light pollution of our city.  The entire time my friend and I were calling out to each other verifying what we each were seeing to be sure we were really seeing these objects and I specifically recall the excitment from both of us when the spiral maneuvers began.  I am an aircraft mechanic and a longtime aerospace/aircraft buff and have been employed by NASA since the mid 1990's, so I consider myself to be somewhat knowledgeable regarding aircraft/aerospace and I have on many occasions located, tracked and viewed various satellites and the Intermational Space Station this is why I had determined the objects to be of a orbital height and speed in relation to the time it was taking them to cross the night sky.  During the entire duration of this event there was no detectable noise and at the estimated heights it was impossible to determine if there was any type of shape associated with the two lights.",2003-08-04T00:00:00,41.47117691601652,-81.65460330426801

A witness called to tell me his story of what he and his wife saw. We live alongside the Skeena River which runs through Terrace, British Columbia. Our home is located high up on Mount (deleted by HBCC UFO), from here we have an excellent view of the surrounding area. We sometimes turn the lights off and just sit around with a coffee looking at what is going on below us. As we watched the traffic traveling along highway #16, entering the town of Terrace. (Terrace/Kitimat Junction), we saw a large glowing/oblong shaped object moving slowly along side highway #16 heading north. We thought at first it may have been a aircraft as the object paced some of the vehicles on the road. But then realized that whatever it was had to be way to low for any plane to fly at night in this area. Eventually the object made a sudden move, or jerked across the highway to the opposite side and came to a stop. (HBCC UFO Note: I asked the witness what he meant by the object jerked. He told me it looked as if it would either stop for a split second, then start moving again, or as it moved a head it would side back just a bit from where it was coming from and then travel a head).  As the witnesses watched it sitting in a stationary position on the west side of the highway, he said it looked like it gained a little altitude and then short off towards the west at an incredible rate of speed. Matter of fact the fellow who watched this take place said, ""if you were watching close when it sped off, you would have missed it due to how fast it was traveling"". The witness guessed the two of them watched the object for approx: a minute before losing sight of it completely. He went on to tell me that this was not the first time he had saw something rather strange over the Terrace area. Last year (2002) his children dropped by for a visit, and one of the kids grown and now married, gave out a yell and all of them watched a huge glowing/golden colored ""thing"" moving over the town of Terrace. He said it moved fairly quick, but again stressed that whatever it was, was enormous. He had read articles on myself (HBCC UFO) in the Terrace Standard newspaper last year, but felt funny about coming forward to tell the story. But this year he said, I had to talk to someone over what we both saw, as it was just so strange.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  (Witness personal information deleted by HBCC UFO).

I am hoping he will have some of the others telephone me and make a report. Hope this helps a little.   Take care Brian   Enderby, British Columbia (follow-up)   Date:  July 25, 2003 Time:  8:30 p.m.   This is a follow-up to the Enderby, B.C. sighting which was reported to Mr. Peter Davenport at the NUFORC.    I telephoned one of the witnesses who reported a sighting for July 25, 2003 to gather a little more information on what the witnesses saw at 8:30 p.m. at Gardom Lake. The story is actually rather interesting.    The gentleman I talked with, told me his wife was the first to notice one large single object sitting stationary in the blue sky. She gave out a yell and pointed into the sky. This is when a total of 6 people saw the unusual object. But by the time everyone else was observing the it, it had already broke (separated) into two sections. Both section after the break up were the exact same size. (I asked if there was any type of explosion which may have caused the object to break into the two section, and the witness said no. The single object basically spit into two parts).   After it broke up, the folks said the ""objects"" went in separate directions, one heading north and the other south. The fellow I chatted with said the craft was sitting at approx: 30,000 to 40,000 feet at his best guess. Also they noted after the craft separated, and holding their hand up to get a rough idea how close the two section were to one another at the height they were at, they guessed them to be approx: one inch a part. The witness also noted that the two parts did not pass one another (stayed close to one another), but did slowly drift a part going in different directions until they lost sight of them.    He mentioned that it was like looking at the chrome bumper of a car with the sun reflecting off it. The brightness to the objects were extremely bright. There was no sound detected, no contrail from any of the them. He also gave a approx: size each of the objects may have been. He estimated they might have been 1/4 inch in length, this using your finger nail at arms length. (Note: If the estimated size is even close, the objects must have been enormous in size).    The sighting lasted for approx: 4 to 5 minutes.    I am still hoping the other witnesses will call. Also the witness said he would get a drawing of what they saw to me, and there exact location.

Puget Sound)on my boat. I was star gazing. Saw one good Meteor and one Satellite. Night before, I was sitting with friends on the west shore of the inlet and we saw 12 satellites in about 90 minutes. Have seen many over the years, but the object I saw at 10:41 PM was much brighter than any satellite I have ever seen. It was brighter than any of the stars visible to me (perhaps 3X). It was traveling in a straight NE direction. There were a few high clouds, and the object (light) was higher than the clouds, but either it was the intensity of the light or it just wasn't as high as what I would expect a satellite to be which really makes me wonder what it was. I first saw the object about half way across the sky. It was ahead of me about, and 65 degrees above the NW horizon. What made this different than an ordinary satellite was its brightness and the speed of its traverse (faster 2X), but also that I was able to view as it went well towards the NE horizon (15 degrees) with little change in the intensity of the light. There might have been a slight tail to the object when I first spotted it, but it was passing behind the high clouds, but was still visible, hence that might have given me the impression it had a short tail. The event lasted long enough for me to look at my cell phone to check the time and ponder who I could call to see if they could see it. I would say close to 2 minutes ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Dear. Mr. Davenport,   RE: Shelton siting.   Thank you for your reply. After reviewing the ISS tracking plots I am left doubting that what I saw was the ISS. The reason for this is that the track of the object was towards the NE and not the SE as would be indicated by the web site you sent the link for. The other issue was the fact the object remained lighted (reflecting?) well towards the horizon to the NE. The ISS website indicates that the ISS would not be lighted as it passed that far to the NE at the time of night (infact it indicates that the ISS would not be lit as it passed over the coast line of N. America. Perhaps you might get another inquiry about this. Just wanted to let you know.   Regards, ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  We are still exploring the possibility that the sighting might have been caused by the ISS.

My nephew was spending the night with me and my parents.  He's 11 and I'm 20.  He likes to come out at our house, sit on our deck, and stargaze and watch the bats we have in the area.  I like to do the same things, so I always go out there with him.  My mom got up early since she was off of work that night.  She joined us out there for a while, but decided to go in and brush her teeth, so she never saw it.  It was between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m. CST when this occurred.  We had seen aircraft flying overhead that night and saw lights that we always dismissed as satellites.  About a minute, or two after my mom went inside I was looking westward in the sky and saw a bright blue light that looked just like a star, but it was moving.  I thought it was just another satellite at the time, but I noticed right away that it looked brighter than the normal satellites we see in the sky.  Most are usually hard to see, but this was clearly visible.  It was going north to south.  I told my nephew to look at it, so we both were watching it.  Then about 10-15 seconds after I first saw it, it turned from blue to a very bright yellow.  That's when I had my first real doubts about it being just a satellite.  In about 5 seconds period it slowly turned a very bright yellow and then dimmed back down to blue and then continued out of sight past some pine trees.  I say slowly since it was like a dimmer switch being turned on and not like an explosion, or something that happens suddenly.  It flashed a little bit when it turned yellow.  It also doubled in size, or got brighter.  It never stopped on its path, slowed down, or sped up, it just continued on the same path, going to same speed.  It wasn't going extremely fast, about normal for a satellite, or plane.  It didn’t appear to be a meteor, since it didn't streak across the sky, leave a trail, or break up.  The light just changed color and got brighter.  There were planes in the area, but it's normal for this area, but this didn't act like the lights on a plane.  It ! also made no sound.  My nephew went back in side to get my mom, but it was already gone by the time she got there. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a tumbling rocket booster would be the first possibility to be ruled out.  When then catch the light from the Sun just right, they reflect it so that an observer on the ground sees a flare of light as the rocket continues on its way in orbit.

To the person who reported the sighting on the same date in knoxville, IL...I agree, it couldn't have been a shooting star.  I was sitting on my front porch, waiting for my wife to get home from work.  The sky was clear and there were quite a few planes flying around the area.  I was watching the sky as I always do at night, when I saw a very bright blue light to the south of town.  It was falling from the sky at a very slow speed.  It had a tail behind it made up of different colors.  I have never seen anything like it before or since then.  I felt very disturbed by this, uncomfortable.  It may have lasted longer than what I saw because I watched it disappear behind the building across the streat from my house.  The sighting in knoxville the same night was in a different location but the same discription.  I found this website and started reading sightings in Illinois and when I came across the report from knoxville couldn't believe it.

It did not start to move until lighting up time at approx. 4.48 hours. Even the the sky was lighting up, I could still not detemine the shape - which I thought unusual. It seemed to ascend higher into the sky once the planes started to take off from the local airport. I thought to myself, surely the pilots of the planes must have noticed something or that it would have been picked up on radar. I was particularly intrigued to watch it this time for as long as I could because I witnessed the same thing about a week earlier and dismissed it as being a police helicopter in the distance, even though I heard nothing.

The object came out of the west as a bright object but as it traversed the sky it dimmed in brightness which I found odd as it was approaching the sunrise.

I sighted this object during a daytime hike in the Sierra Nevada, on a trail above Saddlebag Lake, just east of Tioga Pass and west of the town of Lee Vining, CA.  I was standing on the trail, waiting for my husband.  Looking to the southeast, I saw what appeared to be an oval object, placed at an angle, and appearing to leave a short trail behind it.  However, it was not moving at all.  It is possible that there was no trail, but rather that the object was larger than I thought at first.  The object was an odd color - sort of a dirty brown.  It occurred to me that it could be reflecting the landscape below it.  I watched the object for nearly a minute, and it seemed odd to me that it was not moving.  But I had the impression it was fairly distant.  I glanced away only for an instant, and when I looked back, it was gone - no trail, nothing.  I told my husband about it while I was watching it, but by the time he turned around to look it had gone. This was the second strange sighting for me in three days.  And I have never reported a UFO sighting in my life.  Possibly because the objects had certain similarities, yet were sighted in two quite far-flung spots in California, I felt compelled to report them.  Both objects were sighted in daylight, hung over mountain ridges, and seemed to be reflective.  I would be very interested in whether anyone has reported similar objects during this timeframe.",2003-07-16T00:00:00,,

The time of the event is approximate - it may have been an hour or more later. I spotted the object to the northwest of my Renton location in the direction of downtown Seattle. My first impression of the dark object was that it was perhaps a dirigible in place to observe fireworks displays, but if it was something the size of a dirigible it would have to be at an altitude at which dirigibles are not normally seen.  My curiosity piqued, I grabbed my binoculars to get a better look. What I observed for the next five minutes or so was simply puzzling. The shape was similar to a blimp but rounded on each end - an egg shape that is elongated somewhat on its horizontal axis. The color was dark , there were no appendages. I wondered what I was seeing as the thing drifted slowly to the south , apparently wind born. Only once did the thing seem as if it could possibly be under some control when the larger end turned into the wind, but that motion would be consistent with the action of the wind on its shape. I took particular notice of an odd coloration on the smaller end a couple of minutes into the observation when it was about due west. Might this have been a reflection of the sunset?  At any rate I lost the object when I moved to the front of my building. It was then to the southwest. My impression was that the object was three to eight feet in length.   I didn't call the sighting in because it seemed to be some very odd type of balloon.  It turned in the wind as a balloon would. The similarity in appearance of the object to that shown on your website was so great that that I deemed it noteworthy, especially if there were other observers.",2003-07-16T00:00:00,47.477841722972975,-122.15758902027028

The view from the back of the parks department building is beautiful and peaceful. Plus the view is clear to the horizon, which is very rare in Brroklyn.  While I was looking out over the Marsh, I saw a flash of light from the sky.  I looked up and saw the usual planes comming and going because I live close to JFK and La Guarida Airports. But there was an object comming up from the south and heading in a Northerly direction that did look like or act like a jet.  This object which I watched for 15 minutes was spherical in shape and had a light gray metalic color to it.  It was high above the clouds which made it impossible to see any other features on this craft.  I did not see any flashing lights on it either. At first the craft was comming up from the south in a straight line.  What made it different from the jets is that is was wobbling as it was moving and it wasn't on the same path as all the other jets were. The weather this day was clear with a few fair weather clouds in the sky.  I know that it was high up because a cloud passed in front of it and I lost sight of it for a moment, while all the jets in the area were flying below the clouds.  After watching for several minutes, the craft went off its course and started following one of the jets that was heading in an easterly direction. What bothered me it that the craft descended a bit while doing this and I thought for a moment it was going to crash into the jet. As this was happening a cloud was passing by and I noticed that the craft went behind the cloud and the jet was in front of it which means there must of still been some height distance between the two. Then the unidentified craft switched directions and start heading away from the jet in a westerly direction.  It did that for a couple of minutes, then turned into a northerly direction.  The craft was getting closer to me, not straight above me but still ! on an angle when a large cloud came by.  It took a couple of minutes for the cloud to pass.  When it did the craft was gone.  As a said earlier I watched this craft for 15 minutes before it went behind the large cloud.  It was not moving fast at all, more like a slow meandering pace.  I am somewhat interested in UFO's and have visited this site in the pass to see what's going on in the tri-state area.  I probably  would not have filed this report if I hadn't seen two other reports from my area on the same day.  I've never seen anything like this in the 43 years I've been alive.

In 1997, I was watching a meteor shower on Clearwater Beach. When I saw 2 glowing, amber-colored lights out over the ocean. I pointed them out to my friends but they all just dismissed them as being planes. UNTIL...they started to get closer. One stayed behind, and the other started approaching the shore, where I was standing. It seemed to just glide right to me. I was so excited that I said to my friends, ""this is definately a ufo"". After I had said this they all took notice and became very scared. It did not take long for the four of them to take off running towards the pier. The craft was about 500 ft offshore when it sent down some kind of light beam that lit up a boat that was anchored right in front of me. I was not the least bit worried for some reason. Once the light beam went off, the entire craft was no longer lit the orange-reddish glow that it was before. It looked as if it was reflecting it's surroundings. I could see the water and the sky's reflection on the craft. It hovered above me and I remember feeling as if I was reporting to headquarters, so to speak. My head was tilted back all the way I was looking up at this object telling whoever everything about myself. I have no idea why I was doing this. I was mesmerized. Then I felt like I was given a telepathic message or picture of them. It was 2 beings that were facing each other. They were very tall and dark. My memory of this picture is not very clear. I know I thought they seemed to be some kind of reptilian creature. I really can't say for sure if they were dark green or black, if they had scales or what. But I do know they had just introduced themselves to me. This introduction must have taken some time. My friends had already reached the pier which was very far from where I was. It was about a half an hour to walk that distance. After the encounter ended the craft just headed over the neighborhood, with no sound at all, it was lurking over certain houses, and I decided I needed to follow it. I ran back to where my friends were. There were Clearwater Police Officers at the pier who had also seen the object. They were all discussing what it could be when I showed up. I convinced a friend to come with me, and we followed this thing from Clearwater all the way to Tampa. It was so bizarre. When we were leaving the beach, watching this thing in the sky, was very eerie. It was as if time had stopped for me, like everything changed. My whole world had changed forever. There was not a cloud in the sky and we both followed it to the Courtney Campbell Causeway. Once we were side by side, it started to created a cloud or fog around it, so it became impossible to see it. After about 10 minutes the entire sky was just fog. So we ended the chase. Even though I wanted to try to find it still. I have had several more encounters with EBE crafts. Two years ago I went to Sedona, Arizona and I saw many in the sky at night. Also in Gulf Breeze and Panama City we have seen interesting lights that hover around like bugs? Buzzing back and forth. I do not want to be afraid of these things. But I really would really like to know what they are. This type of thing, people do not want to talk about. They will either think you are crazy for talking about it, or they just don't believe you. So I hope to know more as to what they are and why they are here, and what they want. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))",2003-03-11T00:00:00,28.0316,-82.8214

It came in from the east and circled three times before it went west toward the Pacific Ocean where it split into two distinct lights. While circling Lake Gregory there was a jumbo jet in the back ground that appeared to be standing still in the air with its flashing tail light only because of the unidentified ""light"" those of us on the ground were observing. Because of my stunned state of being at the moment, I could not accurately gauge the time in seconds for which the object was moving but did use the distant airliner as a measure. Unlike the other eyewitnesses I will say that it took approximately 30 to 40 seconds for each pass that would have encompassed at least 4 miles in girth. In addition there was no sound barrier broke. Professionally I'm a ((deleted--military)) Analyst and have been in the military for the last ((number deleted--decades of service)) years. I've worked around aircraft during much of this time. I'm not one for believing in concoctions or conspiracies but I know what I witnessed that evening. The speed at which this ""vehicle"" was moving at would have made it impossible for any human being to stand against the velocity of force required. I've come to three conclusions as to what I personally witnessed: 1) It's origination is from this planet from technology that must provide an anti-gravitational device to allow it's human occupants to survive; after all, the SR-71 which comes from our 50's technology had the ability to have it's skin 'stretch' during high velocity speeds. The Aurora project comes to mind. 2) There truly are beings in which God has created that have the ability to extend past their worlds. After all, it would be rather arrogant for us to believe that God wouldn't create life other than our own here on earth. 3) There is the possibility that time is being manipulated here. We've proven that time can be slowed as one approaches light speed so why could it not be stepped out of. Our mathematics shows us there are at least 42 dimensions in space yet we can only realize 4 here on this planet.

From my vantage point it appeared to be at around 500-1000 feet in altitude. There were no navigational lights and I could not decern a shape but there appeared to be burnt orange light swirling around it. at first i thought it was a reflection from the sodium lights on a nearby building on the window of the car.  I exited the vehicle and still saw it. I could hear no sound (jet or propeller). I then removed my glasses, thinking it may be a reflection on them but could still see it. I watched it until it was out of sight. the sky that night was clear and there was very little humidity. (unusual for our area that time of year) and there was no Moon.

They did not blink or flash. The lights were either three individual craft moving in perfect triangular formation, or they were attached to one indistinguishable craft. All moved exactly in unison! The craft covered about 40 degrees of sky in less than ten seconds and maintained a constant velocity. No noise accompanied this sighting. I shouted over and over at my wife to ""Look at this! Look at this!"" She was closing the door behind me and turned and observed the craft for about seven seconds.

We are familiar with these roads and drive along there occasionally just to enjoy the ride.  While riding down a straight part of this section of dirt roads we observed an orange glow behind us following at a distance and the car headlights were dimming by themselves.  I was driving and it felt like the car was held to the grounds by a magnet and didn't want to move.  We thought we imagined it so we drove back up the road and affirmed that there is no light source that could be seen from behind on that road.  We turned back around and after a few seconds the orange glow could again be seen following us.  In the meantime, there appeared a circle from the ground which encircled our view of the moon.  There were thick whispy clouds blowing in quickly, in a matter of seconds.  We went around a curve in the road and up to a clearing.  For some reason I backed the car up and my friend said, ""Oh my God, look at this!  You are missing it! I jumped out of the car and flying 50 yards away from us and desceding to the height of the treetops was a bell shaped object completely covered in round white lights, separate but close together.  The light was a pure white with the effect of silver mixed in. The object floated slowing just beneath the treetop and then started ascending back toward the way it came from and then off to the right at and flew across the trees toward Highway 20.  The object seemed to float in a wobbling fashion for just a moment when changing from the descent to when it ascended.  In other words it hovered in a wobbly way.  The object was completely silent.  I am in the habit of taking my binoculars with me.  When I looked through them the object seemed to be alive, a living flying object self illuminated.  I am pondering, angel or ufo?

It appeared to be only hundreds of feet above the ground, and my first impression was that it looked like someone hangliding but what was hanging beneath appeared too big to be a person.  As i am approaching I am looking up and traffic is building and slowing in front of me, not sure if they are looking or something else causing slowdown because rte. 22 has many businesses on both sides.  Any way it passed practically directly over me appeared to float on the wind and was a dull orange 2-tone.  I pulled in to a business parking lot to continue watching.  Yhe top shaped like kite or hanglider estimated 15 feet across or more and 10 feet or more from front to rear hanging from it but connected was a cylindrical shaped part that i estimate was at least 30 feet long and the last 7feet or so was curled up in the rear like a seahorse's tail.  In spite of the unusual nature and size of this object it was just about to snow storm and the sky was grey and it looked like it could very windy up there.

Our experience has definitely changed our life.  I always thought it was other people who saw those types of things (i.e. comets and things flying in the sky).  It felt really good to know that there are people that we could call after having that kind of experience.

In a very surprising instant we both observed what appeared to be an astrological event in the eastern sky. A large, bright object that seemed to to me to be a fireball was descending rapidly from left to right starting at about ""12 o'clock"" and disappearing at about ""5 o'clock"" in our field of vision. The object basically followed a very slightly curved path approximately 30-40 degrees from a perpendicular line drawn from the horizon directly in front of us. The size of the object appeared 1/2-2/3 the size of the full moon overhead. It changed color while in view, from bright white to firey yellow to a brilliant iridescent blue/green. My first thought was that it was a large shooting star or meteor, but then I was shocked to see it change it's size (it become larger) and color. About half way through its descent it begin projecting a tapering trail as its color changed to bright yellow, almost as if there had been an explosion and acceleration in speed. The trail remained yellow as the object then took on a beautiful greenish-blue color just before it disappeared from view. It was not clear whether the object disappeared over the horizon or simply self-extinguished. I estimate the entire elapsed time of viewing was less than five seconds.

Please see their website at http://www.mufonga.org/   PD))  Investigation of multiple unknown objects by MUFON of Georgia This case was investigated by MUFON of Georgia beginning on 10Sept01, culminating with on-site interviews on 15Sept01, and with subsequent witness contacts thereafter.  The investigative team consisted of this writer, Tom Sheets, State Director for MUFON of Georgia and retired Chief of Police, and MUFONGA's George Lainhart, a Police SWAT Rifle Marksman, who served with this writer during past years in law enforcement.  INVESTIGATION  On 8Sept01, this writer received a call from a former witness and reliable source of information located in Murray County (north) Georgia.  The source indicated that a friend of his family living in central Georgia had phoned a mutual acquaintance and described an unusual event experienced by his family during mid-June. Apparently the witness wanted to vent the experience, but was unsure of what group might be available for such action.  This writer obtained the ID information and established contact with the witness that evening, scheduling an interview and event site inspection for 15Sept01.  Two evenings later, and several days before the planned sit-down, the Primary Witness (PW), contacted this writer and stated that he thought that the unknown objects had returned, but were much further away, and that he was trying to watch them through binoculars. This writer proceeded to the PW's home, about a 1+ hour journey.  Upon arrival, the PW stated that the objects had departed before my arrival.  A surveillance of the area was conducted until 3AM with negative results.  (Event Location------500+ acre tract of land consisting of woods and fields with the Chattahoochee River as the eastern boundry. Home of PW is a former antebellum plantation house in excellent condition, sitting up on a prominent rise overlooking the tract to the N, NE, and E. The PW is the resident care taker of this property for a well known Georgia political/business family.)  The interview(s) took place on 15Sept in the PW's home.  PW indicated that on or about 15June01 at about 10:30PM, his 18YOA son came into the bedroom and stated that something was going on, that there was a strange craft over the property that had lit up the house and surrounding area. (Clear, mild weather).  The PW said he went outside into the front yard and observed what appeared to be a glowing oblong object off to the NE hovering just over the trees near the river at what he thought was about 500 yards distant.  (Due to what happened later, PW described this initial location as the 2 o'clock position). He stated that he got his binoculars and looked and rather than seeing just a glowing object, he observed what appeared to be a ring of red and white lights around a center line, the white lights VERY BRIGHT, with the red lights blinking in sequence around the object. The PW stated that at this ""2 o'clock"" position, the object seemed to be about 1/2 inch long at arms's length, and it appeared to illuminate the tree tops in that vicinity. At that point, the other family members came outside. PW then took his large high candlepower spotlight used for night fishing on the river and shined the beam toward the object, receiving a dramatic reaction.  PW said that the object immediately flew SW (more or less toward them at an angle) at an incredible speed and stopped to hover over a large lone tree in the front pasture or field. PW described this second location as the ""10 o'clock"" position, indicating (when asked) that it appeared to be about 2 inches long at arm's length at that time. (Estimations were made using a ruler provided by this FI).  At this closer location, the PW stated he was able to determine that there was apparently some solid structure behind the lights, appearing to be a dull gray as near as he could make out, like one of the old DeLorean sports cars or a Greyhound bus.  Shortly thereafter, six additional similar craft appeared with the first and began flying and zipping around the LARGE tract of land, faster, then slower, but never again with ! the incredible speed first noticed. PW added that at one time, three objects were stacked up in a hover, one above the other.  This display continued with no sound and at relatively low altitude for about 30 minutes, then suddenly all of the craft simultaneously vanished.  Interviews were conducted with the 18YOA son, 14YOA son, and the wife of the PW.  The fifth witness, the daughter-in-law, was not available. Their statements were similar to the account of the PW, with only enough difference to indicate that the secondary witnesses were being spontaneous i.e. seemingly NOT having ""cooked up"" their accounts. Example;  18YOA witness noticing that four of the objects were side by side before vanishing; 14YOA witness disagreeing, stating that the red lights his father had observed on that night looked orange to him;  Wife of PW stated that she was more aware/fascinated of the mid-line lights, and that she became VERY upset about the episode, something totally outside of her experience......further indicating that she was very tired the next day, perhaps from being up late.  (Side bar.......Several weeks before the events described herein, the PW stated that one of his friends, an advertsing exec and private pilot, had come for a visit. He camped out down by the river to check out potential fishing and deer hunting. The next morning as he packed up to leave, he laughingly accused the PW of sneaking down during the night and shining the big spotlight onto his tent to scare him.  The PW was sort of perplexed at that time, as he had done no such thing.  After the events of mid-June, the PW was no longer perplexed about that statement).  Description of unknown objects;  Appearing oblong in more distant profile, but sort of lens shaped profile close up; dominating BRIGHT white lights, with less bright sequencing red lights, all along a mid-line; fuselage structure barely glimpsed behind the lights, dull gray;  apparent size appearing 1/2"" to 2"" at arms length due to changing distances from PW.  MUFONGA's George Lainhart conducted an inspection of the land tract and noticed nothing out of the ordinary.  Lainhart also brought along his laser range finder used in his SWAT Marksman duties. George zeroed the trees near the river, the trees indicated by the PW as being 500 yards away (initial 2 o'clock position of object), and found them to be 336 yards distant. He then zeroed the lone tree in the front pasture (the later 10 o'clock position of object) and found it to be only 74 yards away from where the witnesses were standing.  Using the mathematical process of computing the appx. length/width of an object AAL, measuring length of arm, hand from eye, distance to object and applying these measurements, the approximate size of the object at the 2 o'clock position (336 yards) is estimated to be 18.66 feet long; from the 10 o'clock position (74 yards) to be 16.44 feet.  A variance of 2.22 feet.  Of course, estimates by the PW were used to calculate this, and the body measurements could not be exact as if done in a lab, but we consider the resulting sizes to be in the right ball park.  During the interview, the PW had no time to calculate correct changing ratios of size from the object's two different positions/distances and the 2.22 foot difference is not out of line for estimations, and in this writer's opinion, indicates credibility.  During detailed conversation, the PW was found to have grown up in the South Fulton County/South Metro Atlanta area where this writer served as a homicide detective and later Chief of Police.  It was discovered that this writer, while not knowing the PW personally, was acquainted with his other immediate family.  This writer recalls nothing that would indicate the PW was of a negative character or anything other than a hard working citizen, husband and father.  These investigators later checked with the local ""beat cops"" and Sheriff's deputies in that area and found no citizen reports to law enforcement regarding similar recent events.  The FAA was not approached due to their 15 day recorded data process being exceeded.  There is a LARGE (!) power generating facility within one mile of this tract of land, and this type of facility MAY play an important part in some of the more dramatic UFO experiences reported by witnesses all around the country. Unfortunately, this plant was under HIGH LEVEL SECURITY LOCKDOWN due to the 11Sept01 terrorist attacks of four days previous.  This writer was not allowed access to the plant, being turned away.  Later calls to the facility security office were unsuccessful in developing further information.  One further note regarding the PW.  His position as an employee of a Georgia political/business family of VIPs would be in extreme jeapardy if any unusual attention was drawn to that family holding.  This writer knows that family, and the matter was discussed with the PW, as he was concerned about the same thing.  I mention this as another reason I feel that he and his family were relating the truth in this matter.  The PW witness has not recontacted MUFONGA, and conversations in the weeks after the field investigation revealed no further activity in the area.  This case report was originally posted to MUFON's World UFO Database (WUFOD).  MUFON of Georgia wishes to thank Peter Davenport, Director of the National UFO Reporting Center, for allowing us to share this investigation with the large number of researchers and citizens who depend on NUFORC for up to date information.

3 objects take off from mountains near Big Ears site,Big Pine,CA,2001-07-04T22:00:00,disk,7 1/2 hours,"Occurred : 7/4/2001 22:00  (Entered as : 07/04/01 22:00) Reported: 5/24/2003 9:41:06 PM 21:41 Posted: 5/27/2003 Location: Big Pine, CA Shape: Disk Duration:7 1/2 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28925.html,"3 objects take off from mountains near Big Ears site For the 4th of July my girlfriend and I went camping at Owen's River in Owen's Valley near Big Pine and the Big Ears station.  Our campsite was on the eastern bank of the river approximately 150-200 yards north of the Taboose Creek river crossing.  At around 8 P.M., we watched the Independence firework display (approximately 30 miles south), as well as the occasional displays over Bishop (approximately 25-30 miles north).  At around 9 o'clock, when most of the fireworks had stopped, my girlfriend sighted a strange object in the sky east of our camp.  By my reckoning, the object was about 3 miles east and between 500 and 800 feet in the air.  It hovered just above the top of a peak in the White Mountain Range.  From our vantage point, near the easternmost side of the valley, the object appeared to be about the size of a dime, and had a three-layered disk shape (the top and bottom sides more narrow than the center layer, similar to a hamburger shape).  Around the middle of the object were a series of revolving lights. They turned in sequence...  YELLOW-ORANGE-PINK-RED-WHITE etc., etc. Thge object hovered over the mountains for about 30 minutes, in which time it sporactically darted from place to place, excelerating rapidly then gliding to a stop in diagnol, horizontal, and vertical movements.  At one point, the object came closer to our campsite, growing to about the size of a quarter.  From it, several beams of white lit up the mountain side and base.  The pattern appeared very clearly on the ground, consisting of about 20 to 30 white circles spaced out and forming a hexagon in it's entirety.  This light moved over the ground and the side of the mountain like a search light, and at one point actually lit up the tree just above where we were sitting in the bed of my truck.  I think it is important to note here that my rottweiler Tank was also aware of the object at this time.  He sat at the tail gate of my truck in a guard position and watched the desert around us to the east.  He did this! fully alert for some hours.  It may be equally important to note that at this time we were yelling back and forth to some other campers about 100 yeard up river to our north who were all watching the same event.  Sometime after the the white lights stopped, the object retreated back towards the mountain, at which time it emitted a second series of lights which included a red horizontal beam which hit the mountain side at regular intervuls.  This sequence was always followed by a series of vertical lights which scanned over the same area.  It appeared to me like a grid.  It was during this time (about 1 hour), that my girlfriend noticed another light go up from the mountain.  It appeared to have the same shape and spinning lights at as the first, but was much smaller in comparison (if it had indeed taken off from the mountain top, then it would have been a few miles behind the original object.  It is very likely that they were actually the same size).  Shortly after the second object started to gain alttitude, a third object took off from the mountain from the same area as the first.  It was also the same shape as the other two with the same lights, and was the same size as the smaller of the two others.  This object drifted straight up while the one that had gone up before it drifted diagnally to the right (or south).  The time between the two take-offs was somewhere between 2 and 3 minutes, at which time the grid-like lights from the first object had ceased and it darted upwards to a great height at great speed. The lowest of the objects (the last to ""take off""), stopped climbing for about a minute.  It was at this time that we saw a red beam flash beneath it to the mountain top, followed a second later by a strange rushing sound.  After this, the three drifted upwards in unison for a few more minutes, then one by one, the revolving lights of each stopped turning and the objects became solid white lights against the black night.  It occured to me at this point that they looked remarkably like stars.  W! ith the exception of the largest object, they were almost indistinguishable from other stars, almost.  They drifted straight upwards in a triangular pattern which they held for hours.  The only way I could keep my eyes on them (my eyes were beginning to become confused by the abundance of stars that night and focusing on just one or two lights became increasingly more difficult), was by comparing their drifting movements to that of other stars (the three moved significantly faster than other constellations).  I watched them drift upwards until early morning, in which the light of the sun made them impossible to see.  I did, however, catch a glimpse of the a metallic reflection high above before the sun broke fully into my eyes.  It might be important to note that in the morning, I could see the area where the two had taken off from, and there seemed to be a trail of smoke or vapor which started at the top of the mountain.  I fell asleep sometime early in the morning, but was awakened by the sound of two jets (F-16s by the look of them) flying low through the valley and circling the mountain top where we had seen the objects just hours before.  The fighters left and came back many times during the day (assuming that they were the same planes), until it started raining around 5 in the afternoon and after that they never returned.  It was a very strange 4th of July for me and one that my girlfriend and I will never forget.",2003-05-27T00:00:00,37.1801,-118.1838

I live down the street from Patrick Air Force Base and Cape Canaveral, so I know air and space craft/rockets. It was past the hours of passenger air traffic time. And there were no launches from the Cape or base. It came from the ocean (East,S.East) at (4:30 am)and traveled (West,N.West). Patrick AFB is 4 blocks to the North and Canaveral is 20 miles North.  It was approximately 4:30 am. I work late and was winding down. I was outside, behind my house,in Satellite beach,Fl. staring at the FULL moon, looking South. (2 blocks from the ocean) . IT WAS LIKE DAY TIME! All of a sudden a rocket shaped object was flying across the sky. I called to my friend to look, and she saw it too. It Had a cone nose like a pencil. Like an early US rocket that launched to the moon. It was larger than any commercial jet. It was silver/blue looking like brushed metal from the reflection of the sun off the moon. It had no markings. It had no lights at all. It was silent. It had a singular con-trail following the craft. It had no wings. If you put the rocket shaped craft in front of the moon It's length woud be about 2/3 the circumference. We watched it for approximately 10 seconds.  It was like DAYTIME! Clearly visible! It came from the, (East-S.east) and traveled, (West-N.West) 2 fighter jets followed shortly after but could not come close to catching, or keeping up with it. We could see the 2 fighter jets glow of the engines. The rocket shaped object had no glow of any engine and was 6-10 times as big as the fighters. All were extremly high in the atmosphere. You could clearly see this craft, but it had no sound. The jets were just specks, but you could hear them. EXAMPLE OF SIZE......  UFO ( ---- )     USAF JETS  ( . )  It was close after Sept 11.

We just saw the jets flying around in the sky N.west in the distance for a while.  Never called anyone if PAFB Picked anything up on radar. Jets were in the air and in pursuit, so I figured there was no one to call. I am still curious but do not know who would give me any information on the said evening.

It seemed to be moving in an erratic pattern, sometimes drifting in a circular fashion and other times it would jump from one place to another.

THIS IS AN UPDATE TO CORRECT SPELLING... As a spectator at the annual hydroplane races, several ""airshow"" performances were offered for Saturday and Sunday, July 27th and 28th.  On Sunday the 28th, at 11am a pair of ""trainer"" jets had just finished their demonstration and flew off to the West up-river and over Richland, WA.  I followed them with my binoculars (Pentax 8x42s) thinking that they may turn and make another ""run"" for the spectators.  They didn't.  Instead they turned ""south"" as if heading toward Oregon.  They were in level flight and apparently taking a direct route to wherever their destination was.  As I followed them in my binocs, a black shape passed through my field of view from south to north.  For a moment I thought it was a large bird, so I stopped tracking the jets and turned back to the object.  It couldn't have taken more than one or two seconds, at most, to find the object.  However, it had turned from black to a silver color, no black was visible.  The object maneuvered in a manner I have described as a ""hawk"" scanning a field looking for prey.  The hawk will glide and turn, tipping its wings such that the observer can see the back (topside) of the hawk for a moment, then turn the other way and expose the underside of the bird.  This was very similiar to the movements of this flying machine.  As I steadied my binocs as much as possible, I could make out more and more detail.  The object was a very distinct disk.  There were no ""bat-wing"", ""delta-wing"" contours.  In fact it appeared to be a ""classic"" flying saucer shape.  That notwithstanding, I continued to observe.  When the bottom side was turned towards me, I could see that the disk was perfectly round and perfectly black with a very thin ring of silver or white around the edge of the disk.  The blackness of the bottom obscured whatever details might have been present (other than the ""ring"").  When the disk turned on edge I could see the craft had some thickness.  And as it continued to rotate to the topside I could see a distinct transition from the edge to a raised ! middle section and a ""cockpit"" in the center of the disk.  The cockpit appeared to be of a ""teardrop"" shape - not symmetrically round as the rest of the craft appeared to be.  The ""pointed"" portion of the cockpit appeared to be the ""front"", but that was more of an impression than anything else.  As the craft continued to maneuver, with the view transitioning from black to silver and back again, it generally drifted in an easterly direction.  When I first spotted the craft, I estimated it at about 240 degrees azimuth and maybe 25-30 degrees elevation.  By the time I lost sight of it, it was probably at about 210-220 degrees and maybe 30-35 degrees elevation.  When I first spotted the craft, I immediately thought that it was part of the airshow and was ""waiting"" off in the distance for its turn for a demonstration.  The pilot of the craft looked as though he was having ""fun"".  Lazily sliding and gliding up and down an imaginary slope of some kind just enjoying the ride.  But as time wore on, I began to think it might have been some kind of super-secret military prototype that the pilot was putting through its paces - sort of just practicing.  Further, since I had no frame of reference from which to judge the crafts dimension, I could not absolutely determine its distance from my observation point.  The two other witnesses sitting near me looked at the craft both with the naked eye and with my binocs.  It was difficult to see the craft with the naked eye because of what appeared to be its great distance.  One witness after looking through the binocs and then observing directly commented - ""...man, that thing is really up there..."".  Oserving with the naked eye was difficult.  The observer had to know ""where-to-look"", but when we looked at the right spot, the black disk was easily discernable and the silver side would flash brightly when the sun hit it at the right angle.  It was an altogether amazing experience, and an amazing object.  Finally, after observing for so long, I began to feel fatigued, and put my binocs down to see if I could arrange a more comfortable and steady rest from which to observe.  I may have spent 5 minutes re-arranging things and when I returned to observe, the object was gone.  As I thought about what I had seen I tried to imagine the possibilities.  First, it could have been a UFO, I guess - whatever that actually means.  Secondly, I think the most likely explanation is a secret military plane of some kind.  And finally, I have to admit that it could have been some kind of a ""model"" or ballon - perhaps a hovercraft of some kind that could maneuver as it did.  The only thing that makes me hesitate to believe this possibility is that it appeared to be incredibly high for a model and it stayed in position for a very long time.  Also from my position and given the size of the Columbia river, the model would have to have been at least three miles away.  That seems very far to have been able to see what might be a 2-3 foot diameter model disk.

It was nothing unusual but I was entertained for a brief second and started looking for more.  There really is a lot of stuff flying around up there.  At any rate after a couple of minutes my eyes caught a very faint light that appeared to be a satelite traveling NW-SE at the speed any typical satelite would.  At first I thought nothing of it but then my eye caught 2 more lights, just as faint as the first, forming a triangle.  The lights (I presume a satelite or group of satelites) appeared to be flying in formation at the same speed and altitute or outlined a very large craft.  How I saw this with all the light pollution around Seattle was pure luck.  Two others also saw it after I pointed it out.  I believe what I saw definitely originated right here on planet earth but what exactly it was is a mystery.  It could have been something very unique.  I've never seen anything like this before and I'd love to know what it was...  3 unrelated satelites that by chance ended up in a triangle formation?  3 related satelites flying in formation?  Some sort or communications array?  A secret spy/weapons/science platform?  Who knows?  I definitely consider these objects (or the object) I saw last night ""Unidentified.""

I suspect you witnessed the three satellites which are seen to fly in formation, and which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy ""N.O.S.S."" satellite surveillance system.  We have received reports of them since 1996.  They are visible for several weeks, and then they disappear for a while.  Then, months later, they, or something identical, will appear again.   They are in an orbit that is approximately 90 minutes long, so you can plan when, and where, they will pass overhead, or within sighting distance, and watch them on the next orbit.  Thank you, again, for sharing the information with our Center!  Cordially,   Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE)) Hey,    That's interesting.  I figured it probably was something military.  There sure is a lot of stuff flying around up there...  It's really amazing that more space flight accidents (such as Columbia) haven't occured considering the amount of debris smaller than a satelite we can't see in orbit.    Anyway, I like your web site...  It's interesting to see what is reported an where.  Alien or not I think it's all interesting.  There is plenty of technology that is made right here on planet earth that borders on science fiction.  At any rate, nice work. Thanks!

The witness had jumped into bed ready for a night's sleep when something caught her attention, her bedroom window faced the northeastern portion of the sky. She saw a extremely bright white light flying at a low altitude and it shot across the sky. When she first noticed it, the light/object was traveling in a straight line, but then before she lost sight of it the object it zig zagged and disappeared. (The witness is going to give me a sketch of what the event looked like).  No tail was observed trailing the object, no sound was heard as the witness said she had her window open due to it being very warm out. The witness said the object was approx: the size of her finger nail. Another interesting thing about this sighting was that the light/object had a number of lights running around the outside of it, and all white in color. The event lasted approx: 4 seconds.

Greylock in Adams, Ma.  While parking in an area by the top of the mountain they heard what sounded like some kind of machine running. My father-in-law and his friend took a short path to the top to investigate. What they saw was a UFO that was surrounded by people.  The people spotted them and gave chase. The two men ran back to the car to find the women crying. The car acted like it does in the movies, it kept stalling down the mountain. While on their way down, the men asked why the women were so terrified and they had said they saw a white light come up to the front windshield of the car. They did not understand what this was because the front of the car was parked up against a wall with a drop off on the other side. They did make it to the bottom and noticed the clouds above the mountain were illuminated pink. They never reported this because they said they thought nobody would believe them. Not too long after, My Mother-in-law was at a friends house when this same (long) white light appeared outside the bedroom window on the second floor. There was a garage next to the house with a small alleyway between where she saw the light.  One night, around the same time, my in-laws were parked at Onota Lake parking lot in Pittsfield. They were watching another couple parked in the lot who appeared to be arguing (The other couple had their dome light on) when all of a sudden they felt like they were hit from behind, The only thing was is they were backed up against the woods. And just as sudden there was no longer that other car in the lot, but they said they never saw it leave. (Maybe missing time?) They both said they felt like they were knocked out. They inspected their car but there was no damage to it.  My in-laws are now divorced but will tell exactly the same story. They are not the type to lie and my mother-in-law still does not like to talk about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On or near Aug. 12, 1965 a couple/few days before graduating basic training at Fort Ord, our company was to udergo live-fire obstacle course on or near the firing range area.  Prior to the exercise, following lecture the sun had already settled and it was quite dark.  The cadre got us ready to go and yelling gung-ho style, then surprised us recruits with a sudden firing of 3, 30-caliber machine guns.  The tracers flew from right-to-left over the range where we were shortly to crawl over.  During that live fire, I noticed the track of the tracer rounds as they hit into the rocks to our left.  Some of the rounds richocheted up and away from our location where I could discern what appeared to be the ridge line, estimating 60-100 feet up and 1000 yards away.  Suddenly, the machine-gun fire stopped, and each of us recruits became silent in awe of what we had seen, and extremely scared at what we knew were to undergo.  The lecture, to a now quiet audience, continued.  A few minutes, later, my eyes returned back to where the tracer rounds had been landing.  I noticed the stars over and behind what I thought was the ridge of a hill no higher than 100 feet, but still about a thousand yards away.  This is when I noticed the first light come over the ridge; no noise, nothing to overcome the voice of the person presenting instruction.  I had expected to hear a helicopter but heard no noise.  The light slowly drifted above the ridge line, I believe amber in color.  When the second light appeared, I still expected to hear a helicopter but there was no noise but the voice of the lecture.  If was about the time that the final light of the triangle made it over the ridge.  It should have been a helicopter!  But no, it began to ""turn"", more of a slow rotation, as it might have been ""peeking"" over the ridge.  The ""craft"" was at an estimated ""pitch"" of 40-50 degrees as if it had followed some contour up to and over the ridge.  If I was to estimate its size based on its distance from me, I would say 60 feet on a side, and not quite equilateral; The angle between the two ""forward wing edges"" might have been about 50-60 degrees. I do not know what was over, or what it looked like over the ridge.  Shortly after the entire ""craft"" broke the ridge line, was when I noticed its triangurlar shape as a black triangle blocking of the stars in the background.  It continued to quietly rotate/turn back and down behind the ridge.  None of the approximately 100 recruits I was with made any sign of having seen the same.  I was eighteen years old at the time, fresh out of high school, no job, just entering the military so that they would not draft me.  Following my basic training, I went to work as a radio-specialist in the Army Security Agency and finished my military career three years and 11 months later.  No more UFOs after that....  This inforamtion was provided to support, and possbily time, a previously posted witnessing of a ""round"" object between 1965 and 1967 in the same area.  I wish someone could support mine after all this time… ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,,

I was sitting in the back set of the car heading towards Orange, about one third of the way past Molong towards Orange when, while looking out the window to my right(towards the oposite side of the road here) i noticed a bright shiny onject, very large, if you wherent looking you would not notice them, it was saucer shaped with a dome on top, along side of it on the left was a very tall 'person' dressed in an outfit which glowed the same as the ship, about the centre of the craft and walking towards the road(the ship was about 20-30mtrs away from fence line which was about 5mtrs from the road) till he was about half way between the fence and the craft and another one was standing on the right of the ship near a dead tree, all had the same 'cloths'on if you could call it that, with like black visors for their eyes to look through, it was like absorbing the sun light but didnt reflect it, the closest i can describe it is like haveing a fluro light on outside in sunlight but brighter looking. they where very tall, it is i would say at a guess about 8ft. tall, mind you i was only young at the time but i see it now as if it was only yesturday and in slow motion, it may have only taken 10secs from the time i saw them to the time we drove past, maybe less. it looked like they where collecting things and looing at the cars going past, i am sure the one walking down to the road saw me as he turned his helmet and followed our car with his black looking visor. I never said a thing to anyone becuase by the time they looked around we would have past them and i would have been told not to tie. I know what i saw and to this day can show exactly wher! e they where although the road has been changed i am sure last time i was past their the road had not been widened on that side of the road. I have always believed in UFO's since i saw this even though some people i have told never believed me, i only say this now becuase i want someone to tell who will believe me and get it off my mind at last. I am sure if the area was tested even after all this time it would show signs of something being their. the craft looked like it would have been twice as high as the 'men' and about 6times the wide/length. and parked between two dead trees, i remember the detail so much becuase i had stared at it from the second i saw it just before we got to the corner until we drove around the corner so it may have been more than 10sec's. i made sure i got as much deatil as possible. I did have a plastic camera in the car but it was no good. I dont know if anyone else saw it as i never asked, someone else driving past would have seen it if they looked in that direction.

This can be verified by checking with two newspapers.  The Record Courier in Portage County and the Akron Beacon Journal in Summit County.  Sorry I didn't keep the clippings.  My 10 year old daughter and I were departing my parents hillside home after a tremendous blizzard had layered three to four feet of snow over the ground.  As we pulled out of the driveway onto the street I looked back up at the house marvelling at the clarity of the sky after such rotten weather, and saw a small bright white light descending slowly toward the horizon.  I stopped the car and pointed it out to her, thinking it might be a shooting star, but realizing at the same time it was traveling too slow...appearing to be a controlled approach.  As it approached the treetops it decelerated more rapidly and the bright white light took on an increasingly blueish tinge that appeared as a ring of light below the craft.  It slowly settled behind the treetops probably not more than 1500 feet behind the house in a woodsy uninhabited area that we used for riding horses.  There was a large treeless hill back there which must have been where they landed.  I was late getting home to fix dinner so I didn't return to my parents home but drove straight to mine in Twin Lakes.  I immediately called my parents and spoke to my mother telling her something landed behind the house and to send my teen age brother out to investigate.  She just laughed and said he wasn't home.  I said send pop.  She said no way will he wade through this deep snow.  In my frustration I didn't think of calling the police.  Rather I called a reporter friend, John Fowler, of the Record Courier, and asked if he'd had any other reports of a similar sighting.  He also laughed (I'm getting used to it by now) and asked if I was sure it wasn't the moon.  (Note:  I am a licensed pilot and have several other sightings at various times).  When I assured him I knew the difference between a controlled craft and the moon he asked if he could report it in the paper.  After all this laughter I acceded but qualified it by saying just don't use my name. (I was running my own business at the time and there are closed minded people you know!)My little news article appeared on the front page the following day headed, ""Twin Lakes Woman Sights UFO"".  The following day, as I picked up the Beacon Journal and read the front page report in the local section of large numbers of people in Shalersville watching a large cigar shaped mother ship hover over them for over an hour at the precise time I saw the scout ship, I wondered how John felt missing out on that news?  Those folks watched the scout ships leaving and arriving the mother ship, entering and exiting.  What puzzles me is the total lack of reporting on the investigation of incidents such as these.    We all know the famous case of the sheriff's deputy from our County Seat...Ravenna, Ohio, sighting and pursuing a craft into Pennsylvania for a couple of hours chase.  That poor guy, when he tried to provide the information he had at hand, was ridiculed and eventually lost his job...and maybe even his sanity.  I understand he had lots of problems in his life thereafter.  You can check on my report through the newspapers' microfiche files.  Sorry I'm not positive about the date. It's approximate.  I have other sightings and experiences that occurred at different times and other locations if they would be of interest. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is currently a very experienced pilot.

My friends and I were playing in the field that we always played football in, in back of our houses. When we first saw this thing we kind of just tried to figure out what it was. One of my friends' older friends son was a pilot of some sort and had a type of cb setup or such in his basement that the old woman would let us kids see, so my friend said he would try and see if its locator could tell us what was in the area at the time. Everyone but me took off for dinner, and I just wanted to wait for my other friend to come back and tell me what it was. Everyone said our parents wouldnt believe us anyway, so whats the use? It was just hovering like over me and kept changing shapes, and one minute you could see it clearly and the next it would fade in and out. I thought they were all chicken-shits, and tomboy that I am I just studied it. My friend was taking too long, yet it was like it could tell I wasnt afraid of it and it didnt really want me to tell anyone. Then it backed up like a zoom and vanished. None of us ever said a word except me, it was like no one else remembered or something, and it was very strange. As it moved though, I remember that it did change not only its looks but shape and color of its windows also. I did not see any aliens or anything looking out, but when it was almost transparent, I still knew it was there and sometimes you could see an outline of sorts. There seemed to be a crystal kind of effect in there whan it was changing almost like it could radiate electricity of info that was bouncing on it or off it, like it could absorb info like that. And the windows sometimes went around the body in a certain shape fast then slow, slow then fast, and extremely fast at that. And those colors were like they werent really there either, like they were playing with them or making them up as they went until they got it right. Maybe they just liked the game we were playing and wanted to analize why we were. And maybe the lights were our score....or t! heir excitement, or that I was not afraid. I did not at any time feel afraid of them either, it was like I knew or should know who they were, or why they came to see me? I only know that just recently I have had the pleasure to see them up close checking me out in my sleep. And when I felt their presence I awoke to see a connect the dots kind of starman bending over me, and then a smaller one walking towards him, touching his arm telling him it was time to go now, and they did. I wish I knew if this was real. There is no history of anything weird in my family on both sides, and my friends will not talk about it further. When I mention it they sort of go blank and act like I never mentioned it. That is bizarre! Well, I hope that someday, when I go wherever it is we go & if we do, that I find out instead of just dwindling into the vast universe with no answer either. That would suck. Thanks for looking at this, enjoy, and I hope others can be there with me if they do seem to be nice....C-Ya  Me   P.S. Till this day it is like I still dont believe it myself what I saw like I am deprogrammed or jumbled or something like that & it feels weird to recall or try to but at the same time is still fresh in my memory- just plain wierd feeling.

As I was looking downward, an intense white circular beam of light shown down from straight over head encompassing myself and only a few inches around me. I was startled momentarily and then looked up to see the source of the light which ceased as my head moved upward. Total time from light on to light off was no more than two seconds. The beam was stationary. It had strong edges as a stage spotlight would when striking the ground. I began looking in all directions for the source and witnessed a vertical column of light being emitted from an unknown source, approximately ½- 1 mile to the north. Duration was similar to the first ,two seconds. Again, the beam of light was stationary and didn&#8217;t appear as if it was from a moving aircraft.  It appeared to originate from two to three hundred feet in altitude. Time from my encounter to the second beam was no more than ten seconds(probably less).

The cluster was moving to the west more or less as could be seen as it passed by known stars. The lights were not overly bright, about the same as what one would observe on a comercial airliner at normal cruising altitude from the ground.

I am a former State Section Director for MUFON. On Saturday night, July 26th, at approximately 10:55 PM, I was sitting on the outdoor patio of the 4th floor of the Crescent Hotel. It was a beautiful, clear night and I was looking up at the stars. I noticed a barely discernible white light moving in a northwesterly direction at a speed and altitude that seemed consistent with commercial air traffic at cruising altitude (30,000 to 40,000 ft). The light was fairly close to being directly overhead, at about 85 degrees above the horizon. I watched this light fly a straight line course for about five to ten seconds when, to my surprise, it suddenly increased in size and brightness. It went from being a pinpoint of light to being about the size of a match head held at arm's length. It also went from being a very faint light to being the brightest thing in the sky. The light became so brilliant that it almost looked silvery. It reminded me of a brilliant diamond. At about this time the object slowed to almost a standstill and rapidly faded from view. The impression I got was that it had shot off into space at a steep angle and at a high rate of speed. This would account for its apparent decrease in forward motion and the rapidity at which it faded from view. The total duration of the sighting was about 15 seconds. I am very knowledgeable in regards to aviation and astronomy and can not think of any prosaic explanation that would account for this sighting.

Knowing the location and the time of night we were probably the only people on the beach for many miles in either direction.  My friend and I were sitting on rocks smoking a cigar that lit up our position on the black stretch of beach, watching the sky, and talking.  No more than 5-10 minutes after we got to the beach did we start seeing stuff. It is probably important to mention when we pulled up to the parking lot behind the beach the radio station we were listening to, 93.1... a very large Southern California radio station with a powerfull signal located close to where I live and really never prone to static or disturbance, cut out completely making very strange non-static disturbance sounds that resembled strange and loud medium pitched humming for about 5 seconds two seperate times as we were driving through the parking lot.  The radio station hadnt cut out once the entire time until we got there and the extended and very strange sounding 5 second periods where the radio cut out COMPLETELY and abruptly stuck in my mind. Also I would like to mention less than 1 minute before we actually saw craft shooting across the sky something happened to me, physically. Im standing up enjoying the ambience of the waves and the night when I exhaled and attempted to inhale .. all of a sudden out of the blue I couldn't breath or inhale a single breath. It was like somebody disabled the use of my lungs or shrunk them to 1/10th the size for 5-6 seconds, a truly frightening and startling experience ive never had once in my life.  I have no asthma nor any in my family and I've never had even the slightest shortness of breath or problem breathing, let alone the complete inablilty to expand my lungs and breath for atleast 5 seconds.  During the 5 seconds i just stood there trying very hard to breath thinking both my lungs have somehow collapsed and contemplating how long i should wait to tell my friends im sufficating.  I've been reading alot of ufo reports since trying to find somebody else who had a similair experience and so far haven't found anything so I dont know if it really does have anything to do with what we saw but it's timing was VERY strange... not to mention I have never had anything REMOTELY like that happen once in my life. Less than a minute after i had my strange chest episode my friend and I both spotted the craft simultaneously as it streaked southward across the sky, stopped in front of us, and back.   It came in what seemed like 200-300 yards off the coastline at medium-low altitude from the North at speeds that made the fastest shooting stars we saw that night seemed half as slow.  It traversed half the sky in a small fraction of the second and stopped INSTANTLY directly in front of where were on the coast a few hundred yards out.  The most incredible thing to me was the speed, what seemed like 10,000mph... much faster than most video cameras would even be able capture.  It hung around for maybe a second then shot back North up the coast in what seemed like the exact trajectory it came in on, parrallel to the horizon, not to mention it accelerated instantly from where it had stopped and shot accross half the sky in a small fraction of a second. Over the next 15 minutes we see what we figure is the same craft making guest appearances in other parts of the sky North of us, where it first came from, flying horizontally here and there back and forth up the coast line to the right of us.  I might mention that the craft we saw had no lights on it and was black against the sky when it briefly stopped out in front of us and we would never have been able to point it out stopped in the sky if we hadn't seen its trajectory coming from the North. In fact aside from stopping out in front of us we only were able to see it when it shot across the sky at mindblowing speed and lit up.   The second it would stop the light around it would disapear and unless you had it outlined against a lighter part of the dark sky that night you never would of seen it stopped.  It seemed to move so incredibly fast it was making the air around it glow giving the entire object a dull glow slightly brighter than the stars around it and easy to spot if you're watching the sky the fraction of a second it takes for it to shoot across it.  We stuck around for about 30 minutes afterwards watching the sky and saw the craft two more times to the North of us light up as it shot around making brief one directional and less dramatic appearances. My radio was perfectly fine on the way home at about 4:35am and I haven't heard that kind of disturbance before or since.  When i am able to i am actually planning on going back to the beach with a friend and a camcorder in the early hours of the morning again to see if i can capture what we saw last time.",2003-08-01T00:00:00,33.60235384615385,-117.65907692307692

I saw it fall at a high rate and slowing towards the ground.  It turned from a bright white color to a blue then greenish color before disappearing on the horizon.  I thought it was a meteor which landed in a sub-division about a 1/2 mile ahead since it was so large (as it appeared to the eye).  After driving in the subdivision for 10 minutes, I decided to call a friend who drives a taxi on the beach and see if he heard or saw anything.  Sure enough, he saw the same thing.  We were both kind of embarrased to call anyone since it would of course sound like we were on drugs or something so when I called him and told him that I saw something he would not believe, he told me what he saw... it was the same thing!  He was less than 1000' from the gulf coastline and saw it over the water so I knew it was larger and landed or went much further west than I thought.  I met up with him and we went to a local pier (Reddington Pier) and asked the gentleman who was tending if he saw anything.  He told us he was fishing and saw the same exact thing and pointed to the general direction it went.  There were also 2 boats there and he said they were not there prior to the incident.  The boats had pretty bright lights on board and were at least a few miles out.  The gentleman had stated that he, like us, had lived in the area for his entire life and never saw anything like it.  I then got a call from a friend who was with me about an hour prior and told him what I was doing, and coincidentally he saw the exact same thing.  He was at least 7-10 miles northeast of my location when I saw the object.  There is no doubt in my mind something landed in the water or fell/flew very fast towards it.

No sir, you are not nuts, and I guess I'm not either, should this be the only consideration. Aproximately 9 years ago, my wife and I were driving on Coquina Key  late at night when I saw, seemingly just beyond the skyway bridge, to the SW, a very bright green ""meteor"" head apparently into the gulf. I remember thinking it might be a flare, due to the odd colour and the startling brightness,... but I considered the speed, (meteoric), the size, even if it was nearer than I suspected which is unlikely, and concluded that it was indeed some extraordinary low atmosphere event. It happened so quickly that my wife missed it, much to my consternation.""",2003-08-01T00:00:00,,

There are hot air balloons around Del Mar some miles to the South, but none fly low over houses in the dark, nor do they fly that far North. I called the golf course below it (4 Seasons)off of Poinsettia Lane to see if they had a promotional balloon up but they said they don't do things like that. ps Could you perhaps include a space to ""write in"" the UFO shape on yr form?

Several people from Farmville to the southern tip of Pitt County reported an odd light racing across the night sky.  J.K. Butler, a former Grifton volunteer firefighter, was sitting in the old Red and White parking lot about 11 p.m. Friday. He was there with three fire department friends when the sky around them lighted up, coloring everything from the ground to the trees to themselves a strange shade of green and blue.  The light passed over them, he said. And when they looked up, it was so blinding they couldn't identify the object.  ""We all just looked at each other like, 'What in the world was that?'"" Butler said. ""I've seen meteors and space junk and satellites. I ain't never seen anything that color.  ""It had some good size to it, too, and it was up in the air pretty good,"" he said.  His first thought: the light had come from a UFO. His second: another country was firing missiles in the direction of Pitt County.  ""Maybe it was government-related. If it was, we'll never know,"" he said.  Over the fire-rescue scanners mounted in the volunteers' trucks, calls came in from Ayden and the Pitt County Sheriff's Office. Butler heard patrol cars being dispatched to check for something that had fallen from the sky in the area of Jolly and Abbott Farm roads.  Sgt. Marty Burroughs sent three of his deputies to survey for damage, or possibly, a spacecraft between the Ayden Police Department and the two rural roads. They didn't find a thing, not even a small piece of space tin.  ""The main thing we checked were houses to make sure nobody had been hit by anything,"" he said.  Deputies found the houses to be safe and left the area.  Burroughs had a dispatcher contact Lenoir and Greene county sheriff's departments to see if a craft had crashed beyond the county line. But nothing was reported.  A deputy in Ayden and several Greenville officers reported seeing the peculiar light near Pitt Community College at Fire Tower Road and N.C. 11  ""They just said it was moving and it appeared to be descending,"" he said.  Asked if he thought the light was a UFO, Burroughs said, ""It could have been. I don't know. I can't explain it.  Sheriff Mac Manning jokingly chalked the sighting up to the work of a shiny red sled and nine flying reindeer.  ""I thought it was maybe Santa Claus making an early run, but we ruled that out pretty quick,"" Manning said.  Apparently, he said, the light was bright enough and big enough to attract quite a bit of attention.  Manning said the sighting of whatever-it-was isn't a big deal. Deputies patrolling remote areas of the county report seeing things in the sky all of the time, he said.  Whatever it was, it scared J.K. Butler — and his buddies. For two hours they watched the night sky, looking for something, anything that could help complete the puzzle to what they had seen; whether that be little green men or a plane with similar lights.  He was asked if he'd recently been watching the Sci-Fi channels series on UFOs called ""Taken."" He said he'd never heard of it, and after being informed of the show's angle on alien abductions, he said there's no way he's watching it now.

Strange energy field emitted, making it difficult to see clearly. Date: 10/27/2002 Time: 17:00 Weather Conditions: Clear late afternoon, no breeze Temperature: 60-65º F Location: Lower East Side of Santa Barbara, CA Number of Witnesses: 3 Description of Event: Three of us were taking a break from work on a Sunday evening outside of our software development company.  I noticed something reflecting in the sky that hadn't moved in the last 30 seconds.  I have spotted many satellites in our skies but this was different, due to the intensity of the reflection and the time of day.  It was 30 + minutes from sunset, the time that satellites are spotted in our skies.  Also, unlike satellites, it was oscillating between reflections, as if it were spinning.  This struck me as strange and highly unusual for skies.  Something else of note is that we had all just commented on how much ""activity"" was in the sky.  Not vehicular, but almost as if the sky were alight with an energy that was beyond the usual intensity.  It had almost a vibration to it. I called to my co-workers to have a look.  It took a moment for them to spot it and once they did, they too commented on the strangeness of its pattern.  I had a pair of 20x binoculars in the car so I grabbed them.  I fixed on a stable surface and peered into the bright blue sky.  What I say was the unexpected.  It was a disc angled in such a way as I could see the bottom as well as a good deal of the top.  To best describe it, it looks very much like the typical ""UFO"" that has been depicted many times, by many people.  The Disk had a slight warble to it and it stayed in a fixed position.  There were dark spots around the upper half; they looked like what would be windows or some form of exterior ventilation.  I described what I saw and the others decided to have a look.  As a little background, I have extraordinary vision.  It has been rated at 40/20.  In other words, I see at 40 feet what most see at 20. They stared with amazement.  Though they couldn't see the full clarity as I could, they could make out exactly what I was seeing.  We continued to take turns looking at it with the naked eye and through the binoculars.  As the minutes passed, the previously mentioned phenomenon of the increased energy in the sky began to grow stronger.  It was almost as if the color of the sky intensified significantly.  It became increasingly difficult to focus on the portion of the sky that the UFO was located.  We had to avert our eyes many times due to the power emitted.  Then, all of a sudden, it was gone.  There wasn't a trace.  The sky also resumed its normal brilliance though to our eyes everything took on a glummer hue. This may not be the most fantastic form of a tale but it really did happen.  After that, the three of us shared a couple of stories of previous encounters, or at the very least, we thought them to be encounters.  To this day, we talk about the strangeness of the event.  Was it some form of US military operation with a new high tech tool, or was it in fact what we really think it to be.  We may never know, but we figured we would share it, in the event others saw it too.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,34.317038103448276,-119.72054137931035

The small village (Novo –Mikhailovka, 30 miles West of Tuapse) positioned in the center of the small sea gulf and our camp (summer camp of Polytechnic Institute of Leningrad) occupied the shoreline right behind the pebble beach of the Black Sea. My girlfriend and I walked down the beach about ¾ of the mile towards the narrow shore and tall cliff with very rocky beach. Not too far from the beach (2-3 meters into shallow water) there was a square shape rock about 2x2x2 meters. It was really fun to climb on that rock and sit on its warm surface, slowly giving away its warmth accumulated during hot and sunny day. Typical for that area and time of the evening, sky was almost black and stars were bright and vivid,  no city lights. The horizon was barely seen against the sky, almost black against black background. The landscape of that area consist of hills and valleys, on the left (from my position on the rock facing the camp and gulf) I was able to see the beginning of the cliff. Straight ahead in the distance of 1 to 3 miles were hills, covered 1/4 on the horizon. At the foot of the hill I could see some lights from the small buildings and from our camp, stretched along the shoreline. It was dark, but I could see some elements of landscape and was able to judge the distances, thanks to the bright stars and very small lights from the camp. In addition I was well familiar with this area, it was my third summer I spend at this camp as the member of scud diving team. It was no wind and very calm. No sounds, except really faded sounds of music from the dance court in the distance. Suddenly, I noticed rather bright object, moving silently from the left to right below the hilltops. The object I can describe as the ""fireball.""  It had the size of the medium size moon. It was glowing and had the reddish in the center and yellowish colors to the outer diameter. It was slowly moving through the sky and was visible on the backgrounds of the hills. But it did not illuminate any area under it.  It had a visible diameter and shape of the round ball. I can roughly estimate its diameter as 4 to 10 miters Therefore the distance from me and to the object, and the fact that it was seen against the hills (known distance of several miles to the furthest hills) could be determined as 2/3 to 2 miles. It was slowly following the descending trajectory, slow and steady. It than quietly disappeared, I would say landed, in the woods within the hills, 1-2 miles from the shore. (The hillsides are covered with thick and mixed southern trees and bushes and it was practically impos sible to get to that area. The next day we made an attempt to find the place of where it could fall or lend, but could not find any signs of object.) The most unusual in movement and appearance of the object was the position of the tale of ""flames,"" which if it were a normal falling object or burning meteorite would follow the trajectory of the fall.  In reality the tale was turned about 10 -15 o counterclockwise, pointing the end of the tile to 8 o’clock position, and DID NOT FOLLOWED the trajectory like blown fire tale would normally be. That was very strange to watch such an unnatural movement. The tale size was about ½ of the diameter of the object in length and 1/3 of the diameter thick. The whole object had a shape of the mirror image of the punctuation mark, colon, rotated with the round point to the right and the tale to the left. The object, at my opinion, was obviously not a meteorite: it moved too slowly for the falling meteorite. The distance of couple of miles or less from the moment I register it in my field of view to its disappearance in the hills this object being seen for 2-3 minutes. It moved really slowly. It also had a visible diameter and shape. And the most important, the position of the ""flaming"" tale,  it should follow the direction of the trajectory, but it was not; it was rotated down, counterclockwise 10 -15 degrees.",,,

Peter- Thanks for getting back to me oon the missouri sighting.  I will read about you experience at NUFORC.   This experiene happened off the coast of Vietnam in the Tonkin Gulf during the Vietnam war. At the time I was in OI division (Operational Intelegence).  I was a Radarman/Electronic counter measures and also trained as a lookout, so I had good observational skills.   I was on duty on the 010 level, which is as high as you can get on the ship.  WE were standing down that night so there was no flight operations.  There were other aircraft carriers in the gulf doing flight operations but I know what other air craft look like in the night sky.  I was on port lookout duty that night and another person was on starboard lookout duty.  We both observed a light, that changed colors, off the port side of the ship a aproximatly 15 miles away and 20 degrees from the horizon.   I called CIC, Combat information center, to see if they had anything on radar. They reported that they did not have anything on surface or air radar in that area of the sky. The light seemed to hover in place for about 1 min then shot over head stoping off the starboard aft at about 10 t0 15 miles and about 30 degrees off horizon.  The speed was so fast thar it left a streak of light as it traved through the sky.  The distanced traveled was, we guessed, about 20 to 30 miles in about a second or two.   Being in ECM I knew what air craft the U.S. and U.S.S.R had at the time and nothing could match the maneuvers this light was doing.  We called down to the bridge to see if they had anything on there radar and to report it to the duty officer.  They reported no contacts in that area either.  The light hovered there for a few seconds then came toward the ship, it got about over-head and then shot straight up and disapeared within a couple seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My mother realized that my brother and I had not put out the garbage yet and it was getting late.  It was about 10 or 10:30 at night.  so we put on our winter coats and headed out.  My younger sister wanted to join us she was 9 years old I was 10 and my older brother was 14years old at that time. As we walked in the snow covered ground and slippery ice the night sky was beaming with stars. We had too walk down the long driveway to place the garbage cans out for tomorrows pick up by the garbage trucks. enroute we ran into a friend of my brother who lived two houses behind ours.  He would take the short cut home often cutting threw our backyard.  He helped us finish throwing out the trash, but there was one can stuck in the deep ice. My brother kept chipping away at the ice with his boots to free up the garbage can as we three were talking about school.  my sister than tried to get our attention.  She said there was something over head flying towards us, but we payed no attention to her. Again she said I think you three should look up to the sky theres something flying towards us.  But we were so focused in trying to free the garbage can that we payed her no mind and said it's probably a plane.  Her voice then became alarmed and she screamed! Look straight up above us.  We looked up to see a craft hovering above us it was maybe 100 yards over us 16 ft. in diameter with a reddish pink like lights that flashed around it with a blinding white light at the center of it that would flash on and off as it hovered above us it seemed to get closer too us and it would pan up and down slightly causing the perfect circular lights to appear as a semi circle.  Now from that time on we don't remember what happened.  All I know is we found ourselves looking around for the craft.  It somehow disappeared on us.  Until our friend said there it is, it's right over your garage roof.  The craft hovered over away from the garage roof took a slight altitude flight. made like a letter z ! formatio n and shot out of sight into the night sky with a woosh sound with such velocity that no jet plane till today could achive leaving behind a trail of two flourescent green laser like lights with a red and white light ray within the two laser green lights that slowly dissolved in the air. ((NUFORC Note:  Interesting report; date is approximate.  We have requested that the witness attempt to have his brother and sister submit independent reports of their recollections of the event.  The case is very similar to a report we received in December 1994 from a mother in Traverse City, MI, in which she described how her children, who had been out sledding, came rushing in the house in their underwear, babbling about the disc they had seen hovering over them.  The next thing they knew, the disc was in another part of the sky, and they found that their outer clothing was neatly folded and stacked on their sleds.  The mother was alarmed by the situation, and reported that she knew something peculiar had taken place, because it was unthinkable that her children would fold and stack their clothing in neat piles.

I was glancing at the stars when I notice one of them began to move.  At first I thought it was a satalite, so I motioned to my girlfriend to get her attention, then I look back up and two other lights of the same brightness (which was a little brighter than the surrounding stars) were behind the first star I saw in the shape on an acute triangle.  Perfect in balance.  The only lights on the craft were the three lights, one in the front with the two in the rear at each corner.  If this was one solid craft, not three in a formation, it was huge.  At least the size of a football field. The craft moved at a slow constant speed overhead us.  The height seemed less than a normal commercial plane.  There was no noise at all.  The reason I think it was a solid craft is because how all three of the lights moved.  All of them stayed at all times and equal distance apart from each other.  The craft was in no hurry and I could see it for at least three minutes.  The way it disappeared blew our minds.  The craft moved across the sky to reach a point to where it simply disappear.  When I say point in the sky, that is what I mean.  I watch the lead light disappear at this point while the back two continued on the same path to this point and disappeared as well.  There were no traces of the lights past that point and have not seen it since.  I live on the outskirts of town.  A simple description of what I saw is three lights in the sky in the shape of a perfect acute triangle, and because of the darkness I could see any detail between the lights, cruise slowly across the sky and go into some ""wormhole"" and disapper.

The largest of the circles measure about 50 yards in diameter. It showed up overnight on Saturday in a field at the corner Suisun Valley and Rockville roads, and the onlookers showed up nearly as fast.  Many of the visitors say they believe the circles carry mystical powers. Some had other theories.  ""We were thinking that our friends did it, but we could just tell ... like ... it's too elaborate for someone to think of something and just do it,"" a visitor said.  One woman traveled from Ukiah to lie in the field, hoping the circles' power could bring relief to her bad back.  Crop circles began showing up in English fields about 30 years ago.

He thinks the circles are the work of someone with too much time on their hands.

Well, I just thought it might be the humidity or the load popping noise from the fire works. So, I sat in the car for a bit to regroup, then I saw it, it was at a distance approx. 2 miles at first I thought it may be a helicopter, or a plane. then the object split into 3 different lights, one was a teal green, the other a purplish blue, and a flash light color(really bright) just like a helicopter spot light. It was coming up on us like a roaring semi-truck, at a height of about 150 yds above the ground. I really thought it was a Sheriff helicopter. Within 1/2 mile distance my friends, who were still funning and carring-on, stop and took notice. Then all of a sudden, it was as quiet as a whisper, nothing.....then a boom the lights split into 6 different lighted objects, the size was breath taking. We stood in ah, no one said anything, just with dum expressions. The light just hovered there for 5-6 minutes and POW the took-off in 7 different directions. One of them came right at us, passing overhead, I ((was frightened.))  I have never been that scared before in my life. So, we hopped into the car and speed out back into town.

I had seen a craft very close up no less than 24 hours ago. I decided to grab a camcorder, a digital camera, two walky talkies and a friend and return to the same spot that I had seen the craft the night before. At about 20:25 we began walking towards the area that I had seen the craft. We were in a large open field and I began looking towards the sky. There were no stars out, and the sun was going down. Soon I saw a small white dot far off in the distance. I showed it to my friend, and we sat and watched if it would move, thinking it might be a craft. It was moving slightly and soon blended into the sky. Then I noticed another odd thing in the sky, close to where the first craft had been. This one was much larger, possible closer than the first and it resembled a cloud or as if it was reflecting the sun's color. It was orange and did not move. We became aware it was not a cloud for the fact that it disappered. Now something was definitely strange about this part of the sky. We were still a bit hesitant to if we had seen anything out of the normal. Another white dot much resembling the first appeared under another cloud than the others, it soon disappered. So we knew something paranormal was happening and I started to search the sky for more objects. When suddenly, I looked directly above where me and my friend were sitting, it had a triangle shape on it, and a circlish-ovalish part on it. It was hovering and wasn't too far in the sky, definitely no star, which not one was in the sky. It started moving slowly away so I pulled the camcorder out of my backpack and recorded what I could of it before it completely disappeared. We packed our camera up and started heading back towards my friend's house where I had seen a craft the night before. I then noticed a rocket had appeared in the sky, it was probably military craft. I decided it was important to record this. Then, out of nowhere ANOTHER ROCKET appeared, this one had much stranger activity. I recorded them both. They were heading toward! s the same direction, where the first white dots were in the sky. The second craft either stopped, changed direction or was going really slow, because it was suspended in midair. Soon, it went behind a cloud. The only thing I recorded was the UFO that was hovering above us, and the two military rockets that were pursuing them or that just happened to be passing the area. From this second incident, I have decided to do more and more UFO hunting. I will report here if I see anything else during my huntings.

It was 8:00 p.m., clear skies (daylight) and he saw a silver, round shaped object traveling at an extremely high rate of speed coming from the west heading east. The sighting took approx: 4 seconds before it disappeared from his line of sight. He also mentioned that it took him totally by surprise to see something move so quickly. No sound was heard due to the distance from the object. He said it was no ""darn"" aircraft we have, as to the speed the object was traveling. I asked if he might be able to give some details to what the object looked like, but he said it happened so fast he could not get a proper look at it.  Thank you to the witness for his report.    A witness reported seeing a strange object sitting stationary over the mountains to the north. He was traveling on Highway #16, just crossing the bridge over the Kalum River. He pulled over to the side of the highway to get a better look at it. He said the object moved from side to side, and up and down ever so slightly. (HBCC UFO Note: At this point of the conversation I was thinking what the gentleman had witnessed was nothing more that a star, until he gave me the rest of the story).  He watched the object stay in a stationary position for approx: 5 minutes before it exploded/or flashed brightly. He said at this point it stared to move downwards  and ended up losing sight of it when it dropped behind one of the local mountains. He described the color of it as being neon green in color, with a whiteish aura surrounding the object. He also noted seeing a neon green and blue twinkling lights at the bottom of the object. He also said he believed there were a number of white flashing lights that were more to the center of the object. The witness said he did make a report to the authorities.

But I managed to take about 40 minutes of video before my battery died. I had a hard time zooming in on it because of the moon being so close and so much brighter my auto focus kept zeroing in on it.

I was at home enjoying a beer, when a friend of mine suddenly came in and yelled ""Richie, come take a look at this!"" myself and two others came rushing outside to see what he was so excited about. we saw something that appeared to be a star in close proximity to the moon. We didn't think anything of it for at least an hour. It just seemed something cool to look at while we passed the time away. I stood there staring at it for a few moments and then told my friends (at this moment, the group comprised of myself and four others) ""It's moving."" They, at first, didn't believe me. We then ran in to retrieve my girlfriend's telescope and I quickly got it centered on the object. It appeared perfectly circular (which is to be expected from viewing something through a home telescope at such great distance), orbiting the moon at what I thumbed out to be at least 500 miles (I was always good at math and spatial orientation). When it first was brought to our attention, it was in the 7 o'clock position in relation to the moon. What made us realize that this was no planet, star, or earth orbiting craft was because of these reasons: 1- it stayed approximately equidistant from the moon at all times in an orbital path(it is at about the 2 o'clock position as I type this. when we first saw it it was in the 7 o'clock position as stated above.) 2- any star that close to the moon when it was full but 4 days ago would be occluded by the sun's light refracting off of it. I know this to be fact. 3- I know of no moon orbital sattelites posessed by any nation at this time(of course, there could be some that I am not aware of!) 4- no planet or star could maintain such a perfect relation to the moon. The object in question exhibited a yellowish tinge and produced coronal light discharge that completely differed from any heavenly body I have yet encountered. To me it somewhat of a mystery, but I have no doubt that what I saw was very doubtfully made by human hands and exhibited behavior clearly indicative of an orbi! tal path around the moon.

His words were something like  take a look at that! That aint no @#$# plane. We looked up into a clear blue sky to see a stationary object at about a 55° angle, south southwest from our location. The object appeared to give off a ""silvery"" reflective light. The object looked like it was undulating or rotating in an irregular fashion because of the variations in light emissions. My first thought was that it was a typical small helium balloon that had been let go and was rotating and reflecting light as it climbed. But as we watched this thing it became apparent to us that it was not. This thing appeared to be very high. Its really difficult to say without any references, but I would take a guess at 50,00 ft. A lot of planes are coming and going at PDX and they all appeared to be way below this thing and it didn’t seem to be moving. It was breezy on the ground and I suppose it would be windy up there also, but this thing seem to stay in place with no apparent movement from wind, (as with a balloon) or slow movement by rotation (as with a planet or star) We finally had to move on, as we had golfers behind us. I watched the object in between golf shots as we played for a little while. About an hour and fifteen minutes later as we neared the last hole, Chris again brought the object to our attention, It appeared to be in the same area of the sky, but was even smaller (or higher) than before. I took my eyes off of it for a second, when Chris said it just saw it move to the right about eight inches (at arms length) and is now quickly climbing away. He tried to point to its location in the sky as it climbed, but it was too small for me to pick up. I would have loved to have some binoculars right then. This thing was very puzzling. Could it have been a weather balloon or an atmospherically distorted viewing of a! planet?

If someone can read French you'll see that I've put more info, well it's not really info about the sighting, but my personal experience with flying ""objects"" as I've worked for several years at Brussels Intl. AP. Thanks Bonjour Mr. Bougard, Ceci est un mail que j'ai envoié à la NASA à propos de qqchose que j'ai vu en ardennes (Barvaux). Il n'y a pas grand chôse d'explications, parce-que il n'y avait pas grand chôse à voir. Mais ce que j'ai vu était quand même bizarre. Je vous envoie le mail tant que je l'ai envoié à la NASA. Dear Sir, Sorry to bother you with this question. On sunday, July 21th at about 02am, I saw above the ardennes in Belgium 02 lights moving in different directions (cannot tell you if north to south or ...). They both were high in the sky, moving at tremendous speed. I've worked for more than 04 years at Brussels Int. Airport, night and day, so I know for sure that they were not airplanes. On airplanes, even at 30.000 feet, you can see lights blinking, what was not the case that day. At that moment I saw an airplane crossing the sky, at (I think) about maximum height : I saw the blinking lights and it didn't move by far as fast as the 02 lights I saw that night. The light was pretty clear, a bit of a yellow-orange colour and moved both in a straight line. Now I don't believe in ufo's, so I think I saw (a friend of mine saw it aswell) 02 satelites passing by who were reflecting sunlight. Is this possible? Can you see from earth with the bare eye a satelite flying by? If not, what could it be? Sorry to have taken some of your precious time, but you guys are the only ones I can think off who could give me a clear answer. Thank you very much, Jo DEBUSSCHER 1500 HALLE Mail : Info@abibat.be or MacRasta@hotmail.com ps : I really would appreciate an answer, even if it's only 01 sentence. Thanks Comme j'ai écrit ici, je suis a 100% sur que ce n'etait pas des avions, les lumières étaient tres claires, mais impossible de définir une forme. Concernant autres articles : les ""triangles"" durant la nuit : il est tres facile de confondre une forme ""trainglulaire"" quand en réalité il s'agit d'un avion : comme à l'arrière de l'avion il n'y a pas (ou tres faible) de feux, on peut assumer de voir un triangle. Mais il faut en tenir compte qu'on a presque toujours une source de lumière en proximité de soi-même, donc en regardant vers le ciel, les lumières les plus faibles sont en première temps ""invisible"" parce-que l'oeuil human doit se aclimatiser au noir. Si on continue a regarder ces ""triangles"", apres un certain temps d'aclimatisation, on commence a distinguer la forme d'un avion... Mais je vous le jure, ce que j'ai vu ce jour la, ce n'etait pas des avions.

Walton Beach 1st sighting of the night: -------------------------- 9/12/02, on a work-related trip, I spent much of the evening relaxing on my hotel room's ocean-side balcony.  Mostly just relaxing, watching the stars at other times. Approx. 9:30 pm, I noticed an unusually bright light in the sky (to the East). I then noticed that it was moving, and rather oddly at that.  Slowly, a second faded into view above the first.  The first dimmed, extinguished, then another light faded into view above the second. This occurred several times, slowly.  After a while the two lights stopped the vertical motions, and began moving around very slowly (independently) but still staying close together.  No fast motions, but they would move, stop abruptly and pause, move somewhere else, then stop... This went on for about 5-10 minutes.  My view was not extremely close, but they seemed to be much closer than high-flying commercial aircraft, and they were further out horizontally from my view than vertically. Description of lights: . Each was triangular. . Entire triangle was red (no other external lights). . Color was very deep red, deeper than lights on large tv/radio antenna. . Lights slowly pulsated in intensity (brighter-dimmer, ~2-3 second period). . Lights did not seem to be directional.  No matter which way they moved, the lights did not stop showing (as plane lights would as the plane turned). . Motion was not fast, but not extremely slow either. 2nd sighting of the night: -------------------------- I was so edhilerated/excited/scared/blown away by the first sighting that I was not about to go back in the room if I could catch another glimpse of these things.  My patience paid off at ~10:15pm local time.  Again, two of the pulsating red triangles came into view - this time from my left.  They went back out to approx. the same spot they were in last time.  Their motions were the same as the first time, short and straight paths, abrupt stops, nothing too fast about any of it.  Moving independently, but staying relatively close to each other.  After 10-15 minutes of this, they began a slow steady path to my left with no abrupt stops. That was the last I saw of them for the trip. Other details: -------------- . I was staying at a hotel on the 6th floor which allowed me to see over some of the haze that was coming in from storm Hanna. . Ft. Walton Beach is located between 2 U.S. Air Force bases - Eglin and Hurlburt. I was doing some work for my company  at one of them.  I wanted so badly to ask people at the base the next day about experimental aircraft in the area, but I was representing my company and could not go around asking about glowing red pulsating triangles flying about. . I watched the skies every evening for the rest of the trip (when not working). I saw airplanes and helicopters fly over at other times.  Each of them was clearly a helicopter or airplane no matter how far away it was.  I am absolutely certain that the red triangles were not planes or helicopters. The characteristics of their lighting and motion were not even close. . I am providing a sketch of the scene since I did not have a camera.

When I refocused my telescope on the objects I saw that they were flying in a triangular pattern. They looked like thick black stop signs. The lead ship was flying very sporatically moving up and down and sided to side like it was survaying the ground. All three ships stayed very close to each other. When they past the moons light I lost them. I waited about an hour following the moons movement and sure enough they passed going in the opposite direction. I though maybe it might have been a satalite but I ruled that out when I saw them again in the opposite directions. They were moving fairly quick. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The reason I am sending this to your database is that I did not know it existed until I got the book, ""The worst case Scenario Survival Handbook: Travel, in it is the phoine number and e-mail address of your web site.  I had written the entry on the page about Alien Abductions which was humorous.  Anyway, the fire ball travelled from North by Northeast to a Southwest by Southerly direction, initially it was bright red like the Japanese WW II symbol only on fire with a fiery tail.  It then turned a bright Light green color which was flourescent.  This all lasted 2 minutes near the town of New Salem of of I-72.  I was travelling east bound and the sky was relatively clear with many stars.  But what really caught my eye was the fact that it was slower than a shooting star.  Lats it was BIG, I mean I estimate the head end to be at least 100 feet in diamter and the tail to be 200-50 ft long.  There were no sounds.  I was heading to my brothers house up in Peoria, IL that evening after having left a company meeting in KC.  I was looking forward to thanksgiving and spent an evening pointing some celestial bodies out to my relatives, brothers sister in laws, nephews and nieces.  I am an amteur astronomer.   I am a mathematician-statistian by training and did not believe UFO's until I saw this.  This was definitely not of earthly origin. ((NUFORC Note:  The date is a few days after the annual meteor shower, which peaked on November 18-19 in 2002.  However, a meteor would not last for 2 minutes.  They usually last for just a few seconds.  Moreover, the witness identifies self as an amateur astronomer, so he almost certainly would be able to identify, and quickly rule out, any type of pedestrian celestial event, we suspect.

When the lights dimmed, I saw a triangular shaped objects with color lights. The incident occured on November 26th, 2002 at 9:58 pm.  I lived at the time in a beach Condo in Oceanside, California.  I was alerted by my security light going on down below my beach condo which is on the beach.  I went out onto my deck and could not see any person or thing that triggered the security light.  It was a clear night full of stars.  I was attracted to a brilliant bright light about 35 degrees to the South West out approximately 2,000 yard out over the beach.  All I could see at the moment was the bright light.  At first I thought it was a star but then realized it was too large and too close.  It hovered for a few minutes then started to dim.  As it dimmed I could see all kinds of colored light eminating out from the center.  As it dimmed I could see a diamond shape object that immediately took off directly to the West over the ocean.  A few seconds it returned and then I saw two objects the same size and brillience.  I grabbed my digital camera and started to take pictues.  I then grabbed my 35mm Cannon and took the remaining pictues on the roll.  The second object seemed to dissapear and the first object staged stationary for the remaining of the 35 minute period.  The last object then dimmed, I saw the color triangle and it just took off at an angle and dissapeared to the West.  The size of the triangle object appeared to be the size of a full moon from my vantage point. The next morning I talked to a contractor friend building a home next to mine.  He told me he was out flying in his Cessna 174 around the same time the previous night and said the object headed directly for him and caused him to dive down to the ocean level and return to the Oceanside Airport. I sent the digital pictures to a company in Irvine to be analyzed.  I was amazed to see the color triangle and a what appeared to be a beam of light from the object to the ocean.  I developed the 35mm pictures but there was nothing but a bright light image on about six pictures.  I sent them off to Irvine and I was told that the same light eminating from the object to the ocean appeared to hit the lense of my 35mm camera. No specific images on the 35mm pictures could be ascertained. Immediately after the incident I had a significant headache for about three days.  No other reactions have been noticed.  The object did reappear about two weeks later for an a few moments late one night. I and my wife had wittnessed object on two occasions in the previous month.  One while driving down High-way 1 from Monterey and the other driving back from Reno, Nevada near the Sierra Nevada Mountains.",2003-03-11T00:00:00,33.247651756440284,-117.33448852459017

Hello Brian, It is nice to hear from you and would be glad to help you all I can. The day I had taken the picture there was nothing else that I noticed different on my walk. It was a very nice day about 28 deg Celsius with an occasional breeze.  The picture that I'm sending you is a copy of the original. It was taken with a Fuji Finepix 1300 digital camera.. Upon later viewing the images in my camera, I noticed this short dark line on the right side of the sky area in one of the pictures. The apartment building in the background is the building that I lived in at the time and was taking a picture of it. I was standing on the bridge and the vehicle traffic was passing behind me.The camera was new at the time and had few pictures taken with it. Also there are no other marks on any of the other pics that I had taken that day. I really was amazed when I viewed the pic on my computer. I have no idea what that is on the pic. If you are ever in this area visiting I can show you the exact spot the pic was taken from if it would help you investigate things that I may not be aware of. Hope to hear from you again.

I had a witness call from Smithers, B.C. this morning. She mentioned to me that her husband thought she was seeing things, but it sounds like she was certainly witnessing something rather strange. The woman was up with her baby at 2:40 a.m. and has a great view of Hudson Bay Mountainand the ski runs, (which is located in Smithers). Actually the witness sits at the base of the mountain. Her blinds were semi open and allowed her to see a very bright light crossing the mountain, and then coming to a complete stop over one of the largest runs, which is called ""Cold Smoke"". She went on to say the light was dead center of the run, and wondered if it was just hovering, or ""maybe' it had landed. She also reported hearing a clicking sound from the direction of the object. (HBCC UFO Note: My son lived a while back in the very same area as the witness lives now, and I know many sounds bounce off the mountain which allows everyone to hear different noises much clearer). The object moved from east to west before coming to a complete stop over the run. Approx: 5 minutes went by and a train could be heard coming in the distance and the object disappeared. ""Her words, turned off"". After the train had come and passed, and approx: one hour later , the object once again showed up. She knew the times for certain as she was up with their baby. After the second time the light showed up, she said I got  frightened and closed the blinds. I asked if she could describe the color of the light to me, she went on to say it was a extremely bright white, with an orangy light coming from the center. The light moved quicker than a helicopter, or any small plane that she knew of. (keep in mind that this light was spotted travelling some distance just below the peaks of the mountain and came to a sudden stop above the ski runs). When the witness observed the light the second time, or after the train had long passed. She did not notice the light moving, but just showed up in exactly the same position it was observed before. The second sighting only lasted a couple of minutes. She reported her cat, which was also sitting on her bed, perked it's ears up looking in the direction of the window. I asked her an appro: size to the light. She said it may have been half of her thumb nail and round in shape. HBCC UFO Note: After I received the telephone call I called the Smithers Ski Hill in Smithers to ask if any equipment was working on the runs around the time of the witnessed sighting. I was told work was being done on four runs throughout the early morning, and would be continuing throughout this week and over the weekend in the wee hours. This sighting may be the result of grooming equipment working on the ski hill, ""but"", what puzzles me is that the object was spotted travelling an appro: 3 kilometers along the mountain before it came to a stop. I also just called the witness back to clear up one point about this sighting, and that was, did she see the object before it got close to the ski runs?? She said yes, I observed the light as it traveled over rough terrain, then got to the runs and stopped. So still puzzled at what was seen.

It was on a Thursday evening at about 9:00 pm.  I had a rendevouz to meet my girl friend after night school in the parking lot of a local bank.  As we were chatting in the car and making jokes. I was sitting in the drivers seat and she was lying her head on my lap, looking up towards me and also the window was in her frame of vision.  She suddenly ask me "" What's that!, I replied.  ""WHAAAT"".  Then she started pointing directly overhead at the sky from my window and told me to look at something in the sky.  She said the stars are moving in the sky.  That's when I try to look at what she was refering to.  But from the way I was seating, I couldn't see anthing. So I got out of the car and started looking up to see if I can see anything stars moving.  She also got out of the car and came on my side of the car and started pointing at the sky about an angle of 87 degree directly over head.  That's when I notice Three star like object moving in the sky.  I couldn't believe it.  So started staring at it for like 30 seconds the see what it was.  The three objects were just as bright as the other stars in the sky, if not fainter then some.  They were traveling in a triangular pattern.  One in the front and two in the back, but in a triangular shape pattern.  The were moving fairly slow, enough to see the sighting for about over a minute.  As the lights continue to move in the same direction.  The one on the left side, moved diagonal towards the first light, which was leading the way.  as it moved towards the first light, it came very close to it, nearly touching it and went back to it's original position on the left side.  Then about 20 seconds past and the objects were at about a 60 degree angle, thats when I started noticing two other fainter lights appearing along side the two brighter lights on the sides.  One fainter light appeared on the left near the original light that was on the left side and same thing happened on the other side on the right light. Now the objects were at about a 45 degree angle in the! sky hea ding due north, cause the highway which was near me runs east to west and the objects werent heading in that direction and I knew for sure that they werent heading south.  They must have been traveling somewhat due north-north east.  Suddenly after the other lights appeared, they were a total of 5-6 lights visible, but strangly what happened after was that the original three lights started to dim away as the other lights started to appear, as that was happening, I started to notice they all were fading away one by one and out of sight.  At that time I looked at the time in the car and it was 9:32PM.  My girl friend and I were amazed to see that, but she mention to me that when she first notice them right overhead they were more of them, maybe around eight lights were visible she mentioned.  I wanted to share this with everyone and let them come with they own conclusions.  As for me I witness these lights as they were traveling in the sky.  They didn't look like planes nor shooting stars and I'm positive that they weren't some meteors in the night sky that was burning in the atmosphere.  Please let me know if there is any explaination for this.  I'll be happy to get any feeding and also answer in question that anyone may have. ((NUFORC Note:  The three lights that dimmed may be U. S. Navy NOSS satellites.  PD))",2003-03-21T00:00:00,40.8191,-73.2102

The next thing I can remember is being alone on a cold hard table with people in Docter like masks above me. I can swear they were at least 8 feet tall.  They were slimy.  I knew this because they touched me in places I'd rather not share.  They stuck a needle in me but for some reason I felt no pain.  In the backround there were more people that appeared to be the female versions of the people.  The people talked in a foreign language that could not be understood.

It was about 11pm and it was dark out.  Some time passed until I spotted a circular white light above me to the left.  I could tell it was very high up in the atmosphere.  I would have to say about the height of a satellite or higher(If you have ever seen a passing satellite, you would know what I mean).  I pointed it out to my friends and they quickly saw it too.  At that point I started to get a little scared because I was actually thinking ""yea right, a UFO"".  The circular white light then flashed 3 times and moved to the right about the length of your finger in comparison if you held it up.  I could tell right there, that no craft that I know of from this planet had those capabilities.  Because at that height, it had to have moved a good 500 miles(possibly more).  When it flashed 3 times and moved to the right, it stayed their for about 1 second, then flashed 3 times again moved back to the left.  Again it stayed their for about 1 second and flashed 3 times.  But instead of it moving to the right again , it just flat out disappeared.  I looked back down at my two friends and they looked at me and I said, ""You did see that right?"".

They all gathered in a group and just hovered really close to each other.  I told my dad to go inside and get a pair of bonoculars so that I could get a closer view of the objects.  I kept them in my sight until he returned, but by the time I looked through the bonoculars the had vanished.  ***The size of the objects were about the size of a toothpick if you were looking directly down at the point end (so the circumfrance of a toothpick, which is very small).",2003-05-27T00:00:00,,

We arrived at the beach shortly before midnight. The water was strange that night. If you placed your hand under the surface and churned the water it would glow a light green. Treading the water with our feet caused the same effect. I felt like I was witnessing a miracle. Shortly before dawn(about 5am)all of us simulataneously looked to the sky and noticed what looked like a falling star. It descended into the atmosphere and headed straight towards the bulkhead of the thunderstorms hovering over the Gulf that had been threatening to rain us out.  The three of us watched quitely as this object pulsed and spun at an amazing rate of speed, flashing colors of red, blue, purple, white. This object then began to ""play"" with the storm, circling the bulkhead. I told my husband it appeared to be drawing energy from the bulkhead as it would grow brighter when it would approach the storm. Several times it disappered into the storm. After about 20 minutes we noticed a second object hovering near the storm. It never approached the storm, but was the same size, pulsing with the same colors as the first object. We watched these objects for about an hour. When sun's light began to fill the sky all of the stars disappeared, but these two objects remained faintly visible. We continued to watch them until even they were no longer visible. On the ride home we all agreed that it felt as if they knew we were there and had allowed us to witness this event. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Dear Mrs. ((name deleted)),  Thank you very much for your interesting report!  The illumination coming from the water probably was due to a phenomenon called, ""phospho-luminescence.""  It is caused when micro-organisms in the water are disturbed at night...they give off a soft, whitish-blue or greenish light, and it is beautiful.  If you ever take a cruise on a large ocean vessel in waters where luminescence is present, for a beautiful view of the phenomenon, I suggest you stand on the fantail and look at the wake behind the ship.  It is beautiful!!   With regard to the streaking light, it may have been a meteorite, although we will never know for sure.  The hovering bright lights may have been celestial bodies...stars or planets.  There are some very bright, quite colorful ""twinkling"" stars in the morning sky during the fall, so that may be the explanation for those objects you saw.  Generally, a genuine UFO does not hang around for an hour, or so, although there are exceptions to that statement that we know about.  Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!  Cordially,  Peter Davenport ((END)) ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) Thank you very much for your response to my report, however I have witnessed at least five meteorites enter our atmosphere, throwing off a bright florescent green tails behind them as they came.  One of them was only 500 yards above our heads and fell into a Ryder Truck parking lot, a chain link fence topped with razor wire being the only thing that kept us from retrieving it.  The ""falling star"" I spoke of had no tail  At first it was the size of the stars, moving in an arch across the sky, but it soon descended into Earth's atmosphere and headed straight towards the thunderstorm.  A planet or ""celestial body"" does not whirl about in space, pulsing and appearing to grow larger/brighter as it approached the bulkhead.  If Mars would be the size of a grain of sand, what we saw was approximately the size of a lintel/pea held at arms length.  We distinctly saw the oval shape of the object and that it appeared to spin on an axis and pulsate between and oval shape and a circle, flashing colors of purple, blue, red, and white.  I hadn't browsed through sightings listed on your website before I filed my report, and now that I have I realize that what we witnessed doesn't even compare to most sightings, and due to your response to my report I fear you won't post it on your sightings page.  Which is why I would like to revise a few sentences in my report if possible, adding that the ""falling star"" had no tail and I said ""star"" because when we noticed it, it was the size of the stars, but grew larger as it entered our atmosphere.  I would like to thank you for clearing up our questions about the water that night, this phenomenon being the second most beautiful thing I've witnessed during my life.  Please respond and let me know if I can revise a few of my statements or re-file the report with the statements I've added here.  I would hate to think one of the few people in the world who would believe in what we saw would discredit our report due to my inability to express the moment as clearly as possible. Thank you very much for your time and patience.  ((e-mail address deleted)) ((END))",2003-05-27T00:00:00,,

It was a block or two away, and it was up a bit higher than the treetops.       I stared at it believing it must be tethered to a used car lot or something, but it looked way stranger than anything like that; it actually looked like a fat flying saucer - almost like a little, tiny Saturn - however, it wasn't silver, it was covered with very bright lights, a light gold color.  The ""ring"" around it was also lit up and much smaller than anything in the old sci-fi movies of the fifties.         I couldn't pull over as there was nowhere to go and I would have caused an accident, so I kept my eye on it for the next several seconds till I lost sight of it due to trees and surrounding buildings.

At approximately 12.30 pm on Saturday 2nd August I was observing aircraft flying on final approach into Luton Airport (about 5-7 miles to end of runway). I was suddenly aware of a bright object in the sky at about 60 degrees from vertical from where I was standing and just slightly higher than the flight path to Luton. At first I thought that this was a silver child's balloon that may have been released by someone gathering at the nearby Knebworth Rock Festival (Robbie Williams). The sky was clear and sunny with only the jet streams of high civil aircraft breaking an otherwise cloudless sky. I carried on with what I was doing in the garden but kept looking back to see if I could see the light and each time I was able to find it, unmoved from the first location. I started to think that a balloon would have drifted out of sight by now and watched the light for a minute or so more when a second light drifted very slowly across from the direction of the Knebworth festival. This second light passed close to the first light before suddenly accelerating off in a North Easterly direction at a speed I could only guess to be in excess of 2000 mph. It was closely followed by what appeared to be a haze, or very small cloud travelling at the same speed. The first light then began to move before this too took of in the same direction at high speed. There was no noise associated with these objects. During this time I think at least two airliners were on final approach to Luton Airport, one of which appeared to be heading straight for the light before banking left to take up final approach to Luton, and I would say that the flight crew of this plane must have seen the stationary light. In a clear sky I could see high level passenger aircraft taking forever to cross the sky, speeds that were easily much slower than the objects I had seen. In addition, helecopters were going in and out of Knebworth all day and these objects were not helecopters. Coincidentally enough the following day, a school fete took place close to us where a number of silver (and blue and gold) style childs balloons were released into the sky and instantly it was clear to see that the movements of these balloons was completely different to the objects I had seen the previous day. The balloons also disappeared from vision a lot sooner than the lights I had seen which I had been able to see disappearing off into the distance a few miles away.  I have to draw conclusion that the mass gathering of 125,000 people at Knebworth for the Robbie Williams concert had something to do with the appearance of these objects, particularly as two of them were seen coming from that direction. They most certainly were not balloons, not high level airliners, not helecopters and not flares.  Personally, I am a currently unemployed Computer Programmer aged 39. I have lived at the same location for over 30 years. Stevenage is a town of some 110,000 population so I would be very surprised if no-one else saw at least the stationary light.",2003-08-04T00:00:00,,

This object, through the binoculars , was flattened, perfectly disc shaped and was wobbling and rolling side to side and up and down.It did grow a little closer to us and it reflected sunlight as it turned. Positively metallic, smooth and disc shaped. We watched it for a while and I ran in and got the camcorder and digital camera.

I looked over to the N/NW and saw a bright starlike object. I saw a falling star off to the right of the object and noticed that the object had made a swooping motion as if to avoid the falling star. It then continued to keep it's position in the sky where I had first witnessed it, yet constantly in motion. I began to think that I was perhaps imagining things so I went to get my wife who was already in bed asleep. She came out on the balcony and watched this phenomenon along with me. It continued to make swooping and other types of motion that I can say without a doubt was not the kind of motion you would expect at that altitude to be an aircraft of any kind.

The exact location was about 1/4 mi. S. of CA 78 and 1 mile S. of Camp Pendelton. The light slowly cruised over the freeway at which time I noticed it was composed of 4 roughly faceted egg shaped objects in a very tight diamond formation. Immediately, I suspected a helicopter of some sort, since they often cruise the highway to observe traffic or Marine helicopters out and about. The configuration did not register as a helicopter or any other conventional aircraft. What was observed were the 4 egg shaped objects bobbing up and down with respect to each. The altitude was low, less than 1000 feet. This estimate was due to the fact of the clarity of the surfaces reflecting the sun and the object's sharp outline against the clear sky. They appeared to be strongly metallic colored ranging from gray to black to strong sun reflection. Each one was alternating in these colors and reflections on different parts which also supported my estimation this was not a single craft. I followed them as they crossed my field of view high in my windshield until lost from sight as they flew overhead. I didn't hear any typical aircraft sound. There were many cars around me as I stuck my hand out of the window and pointed up. Someone else must have seen it too. After a short time I decided to look into my rear view mirrors and I was then able to see them once again in the same tight formation on the West side of the freeway directly over the city of Oceanside. I am hoping others who had seen this will report it since it was so easily viewed. Perhaps there is a logical explanation since it was so close to a major Marine base.

I was 7 at the time.  We left the KFC that was on Northwest Hwy going NW in our car.  As we got closer to the intersection of Northwest Hwy and Euclid, I spotted an object that hung in the sky and was getting brighter.  It was ""dropping"" out of the sky in the north.  I pointed it out to my sister who was in the car.  She then asked my dad to look at it.  I then replied that it was a UFO.  My father, refused and brushed it off as an airplane.  To quite us he turned at the intersection prior to Euclid as to keep us from jumping around in the back seat since the streets he was taking had trees that over hung the road and obscured our view.  As was were going down Sigwalt St. the craft was now closer to the ground, 100 ft or so.  as we drove west on Sigwalt St. to the 7-11 store to get soda pop for dinner.  We pulled in and my father still refused to look up and cater the whims of his children.  He went in and as we stayed in the car, one of the other children and her frien who lived up the street from us saw the UFO, hovering with no sound, only the wind had picked up.  The wind was strange, blowing almost upward in direction and in a circular motion.  The face that she made was horrific, as in disblief that this could not be happening.  Her knees caved in and her friend dropped to the ground.  What I thought at the time was a ""neat"" thing now was burned in to my memory forever as a horror.  My sister and I were now wanting to go home, not in a panic, just a rush to get home.  The disk moving slowly was now above the intersection of Sigwalt St. and Wilke St.  My father exited the Store, as did the attendent.  My father finally looked up to see the disc and was amazed and puzzled as to what he was seeing, as we all were.  It moved over Rolling Meadows and slowly climbed upward, as fast as it came down.  It was about the size of one and a half houses (for the area I live in) it was black on the underside, blacker then the nig! ht and not reflective of any light, other then the lights that it had moving on its edges.  All diferent colors, but mostly yellow, red, orange.  As it climbed it the night sky, it was tilted in a way we saw the top.  It looked like a classic ""Bell"" shaped saucer, and the top was reflecting the lights on the edges so we were able to see the surface reflecting and giving away the top sides shape.  It never moved quickly and as far as I know no one else saw it.  At the time in Arlington and Rolling Meadows when evening came most people were inside, I am not sure if this was covered at the time in the papers.  My father pasted away in 1991, and my sister being sick, I thought I had to at least post this somewhere and see if anyone else knows of this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I thought it was a car engine but it didn't stop.  I then took my flash light and went out to find the sound, being the little dectivce I was back then.  It took me about 25 to 30 minutes to arrive at the source of the sound.  I was looking over the side of a hill and saw it about 30 feet below me, a egg shaped UFO.  Needless to say I was shocked!  It seem to be about 40 feet wide and 60 feet long.  It had strange colored lights coming out of what seemed to be windows and a opened door of some sort?  There was a odd mist coming from below  it that was yellow in color and the sound seemed to be coming from that area, I suposes it was the vent from the engine of the UFO and the source of the sounds I was hearing.  I then looked over the object and then was able to see to my astonishement 3 Greys!  They where about 3 feet tall, very skiny bodies, oval heads with black eyes, 3 very long fingers on there hands.  I was one of them, that I now believe must hav been he leader ativate some sort of silver sphere in its hand.  The sphere then lifted off the grey's hand and hovered near a dead Ox and then shots out a red ray and started to cut the Ox open.  I then started to get very scared and back away as I did a rock feel off the hill and hit the top of the ship leaving no dent, but the 3 greys look at me.  I will never forget how dark they eyes are, it seemed like the where looking right into my soul.  I then ran as fast as I could away.  I got lost in the woods and as I stopped to take a rest I heard foot steps!  I then his inside a hollowed out red wood tree.  H cryed and prayed whatever was out there would just leave me alone.

I remember opening my window and pulling over to get a better look and it was just there-I heard no noise and the one thing that stands out in my mind was that this thing had lots of beige colored lights going around it-and some of them were not on. My younger sisters started to cry and I was scared so we continued driving down the road and when I turned into my neighborhood, it had moved over an area of houses in the neighborhood. again the same thing, no noise-like a plane or a military jet. it was very large and after that we just went home. and I was afraid at the time bc the tv show ""V"" was very popular and I thought they would come and get me. My parents werent home and I did not call the police for fear of them thinking I was crazy. We lived close to McGuire AFB so I thought maybe it was a test plane-but it did not look like a plane.

I also had a friend who had mentioned seeing something similar in the same town a year or two before me.

PD))   Red, green and gold light amazes multiple witnesses over Santa Clara Valley I was talking to several friends in the parking lot of Lynbrook High School in San Jose, Ca. when I noticed a big, bright, red light swinging back and forth like a pendulum about a few thousand feet up in the dark sky behind them. It was similar in size and brightness to a large crimson one I'd seen before on the back of a helicopter, but whatever it was made absolutely no noise whatsoever. I looked closely, but couldn't see any type or shape of an aircraft body, just the round, unblinking light. It then suddenly stopped swinging back and forth, remaining motionless for a second and then began slowly moving to the right in a straight line into a cloud bank. When it hit the clouds, the light turned to green, and then gold and then back to red again. It then disappeared into the clouds.  I called the local TV station and reported it when I got home, and asked the anchorwoman that actually answered the phone if anyone else had called in . She said '""No, you're the only one""'. Another newsperson semi-jokingly reported it later on the air on the eleven o'clock news.  About a week later I saw the following article in the newspaper ( I kicked myself for not cutting it out at the time!), and then realized that there were other witnesses besides myself that had seen this object on or about the same time that I did. Mine was the Tuesday night sighting because I was taking a Tuesday-Thursday college class at the time, and we had just gotten out of class and were getting ready to leave when I spotted it. I found the article again recently listed online, so I thought I'd include it for historical reference:  Mystery Lights Return To Saratoga  By Kathy Holub  Mercury News Staff Writer  A beautiful apparition has been glowing in the night sky over Saratoga ,leaving viewers baffled and entranced. About 15 people, all agog, called Santa Clara County dispatchers on Tuesday night to report a mysterious bright red light that hovered in thesky from 8:15 to 8:30 and then disappeared.  Dozens of callers described a similar phenomenon on Oct. 16, same time, same place.""It was very exciting,"" said ((name deleted)) of Los Gatos, who watched last week's display during a break in her real estate class at West Valley College.""It was very bright, much larger than the lights you see on airplanes. At one point, something burning or flickering dropped from it. It was just a tiny little flicker that came down. We all went: `Oooh, what was that?'""  No one seems to know.  That includes ((name #2 deleted)) of Saratoga, who spied the object Tuesday night while lounging with her husband in their backyard spa.Yauger said the light appeared high in the northwestern sky, first moving toward them, then away. Through her binoculars, the apparition became a cluster of lights. ""It was scary. When it started get- ting larger, it seemed to be coming down,"" she said. Yauger didn't see the object fade from view because she had just gone into the house. Her husband told her the light turned green and slowly disappeared.  Spokesmen at Moffett Field Naval Air Station said nothing flew out of their airfield Tuesday that looked like that. And officials at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc said they didn't launch a thing Tuesday night. Ditto for Oct. 15.Other watchers of the night sky - air traffic controllers and astronomers at Lick Observatory - said they saw nothing unusual.",2003-06-18T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

I hadn't been there but a couple of minutes when I saw what looked like the most amazing meteor entering the atmosphere. It was very bright and distinct and traveled from east to west almost traversing the entire sky. When it got to the far western region of the sky it began to dim and then it did something I wasn't ready for, it stopped cold.  At first I thought I had lost it behind a bright star or that my eyes had picked up a star instead. And then the ""star"" moved again. From an absolute stopped point, it streaked from it's resting point in the west to a point up and behind my head in the south (I was sitting facing due north). At this point I had to sit up and had turned my head to follow this ""Star"" as I had not been prepared for this event. Amazingly, right after stopping for about a count of 3 to 5 seconds, the ""star"" moved very abruptly from it's position in the south to one to the far north eastern sky and stopped again. At this point I remember thinking that this wasn't right. Stars don't do this. It was new to me to ever see anything like this and I don't think I was aware yet that I was seeing a UFO as it were, I just was so blown away. After a few moments where it was, the ""star"" shot off to the south again aand was gone.  I was so blown away that I just sort of slumped back down and lay there stunned. I actually remember feeling very scared and felt like I wasn't supposed to have seen that or something. People always say that they want to see a UFO and it had never occurred to me that it would scare the crap out of me. I was so scared, lying there exposed on that rooftop, that I remember I couldn't move for what seemed like a long time. It may have just been minutes, but it seemed like a very long time. A deer in the headlights effect I guess.  I finally got my wits together and left the roof very rapidly and went inside to tell my friends what I saw. The most frustrating thing about it was that I had been alone and that every single person looked at me with this very condescending smile that made me very angry. I wish anybody else could have seen this amazing thing.  I don't now what I saw but I do know that it wasn't birds in the night lights, or a jet, or anything I have ever seen before or since. It moved very fast and in a way that made no sense. It went from absolute still to absolute motion across the sky in a moment, and stopped just as fast.  Whatever it was, either we have very amazing machines in thhis world that no one knows about or it was something else. But it was something and it was real. In some ways I hope I never see anything like it again. It makes one feel very small.  I hope that thsi report isn't too old or anything but it was an amazing thing to see and I felt compelled to tell you this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

My name is ((name deleted)). I am a retired police ((deleted--senior officer)), 4--- years old. I have some info about an experience with a spherical light probe that entered my van some years ago. I am not some nut or some glory hound, I am a level headed person that had an unexplainable experience. I had taken my ex-wife ((wife's name deleted)) with me to a training class held by the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy (OPOTA) held in London, Ohio. I recall it was a one day session. My certificate for 1989 show 2 dates of one day long training, May 30 & July 10, 1989. I don't know which date this occurred on.I was driving on US Rt. 30 between Mansfield, Ohio and Wooster, Ohio. Actually I was closer to Mansfield. It was at night time, late between 11pm and midnight. My wife asked me the time, I looked at the clock and told her. Immediately there was a blinding flash of light. The bright flash occurred in the sky. The light was a very bright lightning flash. It filled my whole field of vision, filled the whole windshield of my Ford Econoline van.  My wife screamed and I looked at her. This is when I saw ""it."" The ""it"" was a white-bluish bright ball of light that appeared to be floating in midair in my van. The ball of light was floating right in front of the abdomen, over the lap of my then wife (-now ex-wife). As she screamed the ball of light became more agitated. It clearly was reacting to her screams. It rapidly moved back and forth as it floated in front of her. It then moved to her right and vanished THROUGH the door panel of the van. It actually went through the door panel. The window was up and there was no sound. Within in a second or two the ball appeared back in the same location in front of her. I didn't see how or from where it appeared. It did exhibit the same properties and behavior as the first light ball, with one exception. I got a long and hard look at the ball. I stared at it and watched it. It appeared to be a ball of whitish-blue light (similar to the light of an arc welder). The ball was about the s! ize of a grapefruit with about 6 smaller light balls circling its equator. This ball of light moved back and forth in sync with ((wife's)) screams. It was then observed to float through the door panel, as before. What is interesting is that from the time this experienced occurred until it ended, I figure 30 seconds had went by. In reality, when I looked at the dash clock 15 - 30 minutes had gone by!! I had never stopped driving the van. I never pulled over to the side of Rt. 30 or stopped. I have no memory of what I was doing during the experience. All I know is that I kept driving but I was looking at, staring at, studying the light balls. How this occurred, I have no idea. ((Wife)) did sketch the lights when we got back to Canton. We had divorced in 1988 but were friendly. So usingou dvorce and my training certificates, I have narrowed the occurance to two dates. I have not seen my ex-wife for  over 10 years and I don't know what she did with the sketch. I am a trained observer, 2- ((twenty +)) yr police ((senior officer)) and I know what occurred. I just can't account for the missing time and how I kept driving.

It looked as if it was cruising very high in the sky and there was no sound. This second “satellite” moved steadily for about 10 seconds along its path perpendicular to that of the ISS, and then suddenly started to fade. Within a few seconds its magnitude fell (in an orderly fashion) from brighter than the ISS to zero without changing direction. It had vanished before its path crossed that of the ISS, which remained visible until disappearing in eastern direction behind the trees at the other side of the garden. According to the “heavens-above” website there were no other satellite passes or iridium flares that could have explained this observation, neither was it an aeroplane. In view of the light intensity involved and provided that the respective heights match, the ISS crew may have observed the phenomenon. ((NUFORC Note:  We have inquired of the witness whether he thinks the second light might have been a tumbling rocket shell (""ullage"") in orbit.  We are awaiting a response.

Very fast, but seemed to be low in the sky - large object.  My sister was with me and by the time I yelled at her to look up, it was gone.  Within the minute, we saw a large plane (didn't look like a passenger jet plane at all) with more lights than 'normal' travel in the same direction as the object.  Then the plane circled back as if in search (?).  Very strange - I have never seen anything like this.  I have seen meteor showers - (small, white streaks, high up), and the space shuttle entering the atmosphere....comets....but nothing EVER like this!

We were driving south on Rt. 295 in New Jersey, and were maybe a mile north of Exit 31 (Lawnside, NJ). We were returning to Maryland and Virginia.  I was in the front passenger seat, and it was approximately 1:30pm..  Driver saw something to the left and ahead of us, and called my attention to it; it would have been in the southeast quadrant of the Rt. 295 and White Horse Pike/Rt. 30 interchange (Haddon Heights, NJ).  I got to see it for perhaps at most about three seconds; I feel if I had gotten to see it for even a few more seconds, I would have been able to decide more definitively how anomalous it really was. What I saw was a large, dark rectangular object, oriented horizontally, just above the trees, about 1.5 miles away.  It was the length (left to right) of two of my thumbs held at arm's length, and it was about 1/4 as wide (up/down) as it was long (this estimate of ""thumb width"" was done later, not at the time).  It was either black or very dark gray, and it was somewhat ""fuzzy"" in its outline, in a way I can't quite describe; it looked strange, unlike anything I've seen before.  We were currently driving down a hill, thus the object, which I happened to see as the bottom of it just started to go below the treeline, continued to descend below the treeline (being on Rt. 295, we couldn't stop or slow down, of course).  The driver, who saw it for a few seconds longer, said she thought it was moving horizontally and downward, very slowly; I had the impression it was moving downward as well (since WE were moving horizontally and downward ourselves, it made it hard to discern how much of the object's motion was from it, versus us, but we both had the impression that it was moving itself, but very slowly).  We had our windows closed, so we would not have been able to hear any sound from it even if there had been any.  It was definitely not an airplane, nor a conventional blimp, and certainly not a helicopter; there were no wings of any kind, nor anything hanging down from it, such as the cabin of a blimp.  Had it been a human-built craft, it had to be landing, and quite slowly (far more than any plane could), and it appeared to be going down in an area that was fairly dense with trees. We were startled enough by this sight that we pulled off at the next exit, Exit 30 (Lawnside, NJ), which was only about a mile ahead of us.  Of course, it was impossible for us to tell exactly where it had been, but we drove though an old residential area to about where we thought we had seen the object.  Naturally, we saw nothing.  We pulled into a large shopping center (the one having the tall tower with the White Horse on top; no, the object we saw was NOT this well-known landmark that I knew even as a child growing up in NJ).  We looked around the skies in all directions, saw nothing.  After looking for about seven minutes or so, we got back onto Rt. 295 at Exit 29a, and continued southward.  For the next ten minutes, I kept looking out the back window of Sue's car, scanning the skies for any object, but saw nothing (not even any planes).  The weather was a bit chilly, but the air and sky were very clear, with visibility of (I would guess) tens of miles, with some very high clouds. As to the estimation of the size of the object: it was the length (left to right) of between one and two of my thumb widths, held at arm's length.  My thumbs are approximately 2cm wide; the distance from my eyes to my thumbs, approx. 60cm.  Using simple geometric proportion, the following table estimates the range of possible lengths of the object (ObjectLengthInMiles=ThumbWidths*2cm/60cm*MilesAway): Thumb Widths (2.0cm): 1.0 1.5 2.0 1.0 Miles Away 0.0333 0.05 0.0667 1.5 Miles Away 0.05 0.075 0.1 2.0 Miles Away 0.0667 0.1 0.133 Taking the middle estimates of 1.5 thumb widths, with the object being 1.5 miles away, gives us a UFO length of 0.075 miles, times 1600 meters/mile equals 120 meters, with the range being between 53 and 213 meters.  The 747 jets that NASA uses for the space shuttle program are 71 meters long, so the middle estimate puts the object at being 1.7 times the length of a 747.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,39.8804,-75.0654

The white light was not moving and at first I thought it was a plane coming into the local airport.  After a few seconds I noticed that it was not moving. I then watched the white light as it made a complete circle in the sky.  The light seemed to move a large distance while making the circle and was smooth in its movement.  Then when it had came back to the same spot, it took off at a great speed heading straight up.  I used to fly as a flight medic in a helicopter and have flew in planes, and I have never seen anything move so fast in my life.  I also must add that I did notice a plane fly at or about 30 thousand feet heading west.",2002-12-23T00:00:00,39.9598,-88.4157

WA. 3 witnessed rocket shaped UFO emmitting orange sparks. My girlfriends brother in law age 30, my daughter, and myself 31 were driving down hwy. 395 headed west through Kettle Falls, WA.   The time was around 5:30 11-11-02 when when my attention was drawn to the sky I saw a reddish orange object emiting what looked like orange sparks, and it had a tail.  It seemed to just appear, and then seemed to almost stretch as it flew off to west (like you see the enterprise do when it hits warp speed).  It looked like it stopped as it entered atmosphere, then shot to the West.  It was shaped like a 50's rocket toward the front (round nose, not pointy), but it had a tail emmitting what looked like orange sparks.  It had what looked to be an area in the front that was free from sparks in the center of what I would call the nose (clear bubblelike but outlined in orange sparks)   It was in the middle of town, with alot of activity, there were surely more witnesses.   During the sighting we were all quiet, and it took a moment , or two for me to ask, if anyone saw what I saw.  My girlfriends brother confirmed what I saw as did my daughter who asked what it was, I had no answer. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
