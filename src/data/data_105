We got an iPhone photo that caught 4 or 5 (one dot is questionable) of them.  The others had gone beyond our field of view before we could get a photo.   While their formation wasn't a regular shape, like our military pilots fly, they were moving in sync with each other.  They were small red dots, but not blinking like an aircraft's lights.  We followed as best we could, but within ten minutes, we could no longer see any.   Because Country Club Way is a residential street, we could see them much better than people driving on a main street, because of relatively less light pollution.   One of us is a retired Army Intelligence Officer, with service at NASA on the Apollo Program, and a lot of other aerospace industry experience, and a graduate (masters) engineer.

On the night of September 6th, 2015, I witnessed an object I couldn't explain.  As I was watching a show on my phone whilst laying on my patio furniture, I saw a small orb of light out of the corner of my eye.  It grew to the size of an eraser on the end of an eraser, relative to my vision of course.  There was considerable distance between myself and the object, probably around the same altitude an airplane reaches during the middle of their flight.  The object did not move, it merely hovered and pulsated.  When I finally focused om the object, it swelled to its full orb-like appearance, then slowly receded into nothingness.  I searched the sky for the next 5 minutes, waiting for it to reappear, to show me that it was just a plane light, but it mever did. The object was the shape of an orb, or possibly a fireball.  I found myself describing it like an explosion contained by a very strong, yet clear glass. It was a burnt orange color with a white core, as far as I could tell.  It produced no discernible sound, no engines, motors, rotors, anything. Just the light. The sky was clear, no cloud coverage or much smog.  I could see the stars, which is why seeing this orb confused me so much.  This occured above a suburban apartment complex near a main thoroughfare.",2015-09-11T00:00:00,37.28045681818182,-121.95654772727272

The “satellite” then changed course and began to move around irregularly. It would move in loops and swirls, staying in one general area, changing velocity occasionally.  Every now and then I could see a faint shimmering in the area and would sometimes see what looked like another “satellite” moving in a similar fashion, but only for a second or two and then disappear.  At one point the object turned red for 2 or 3 seconds then returned to normal. At one point I saw something flash out in my peripheral vision.

I spoke with Peter Davenport after making the report, and was even asked to speak on ""Coast to Coast A.M."" but have not seen the report in your archives. While the negative can not be properly analyzed by e-mail, the image's anomalous nature can be conveyed.  The image is anomalous for several reasons.  For one, the image should be nothing more than three points of light in the center of the frame, and possibly a dim reflection.  Instead, the image is a large and blurry representation of the UFO, and crosses OVER the photo frame.  One can only imagine the mechanism responsible for affecting the film where light could not reach.  Stranger still, a similar image was burned into two other frames that had been taken earlier.   One of these other two was sent to MUFON, but not returned.  I took three photos as the craft passed over to thoroughly document the sighting. When developed, two of the sighting frames were blank but for a night sky; the other  frame has the large image. So there are three negative images of the UFO, but two of them are superimposed on earlier frames rather than those on which they belong. A better understanding of the mechanism involved in producing these photo anomalies might reveal much about the mechanism behind the UFO's propulsion or operation. The anomaly might have resulted from simple cause-and-effect because of proximity, or might have resulted from some action related to concealment.

Pulling onto my street, around 9:30pm on April 15th, 2015, which is located in a very nice and quiet neighborhood on the outskirts of Newark, Delaware, by the border of Pennsylvania, I happened to look to the left in the west and up into the sky as I usually do, driving home.   I noticed some bright and what I thought were distant lights moving slowly towards my direction eastward.    My first thought was that it was a commercial airliner coming straight towards where is was on Bristol Lane in Cotswold Hills.  I don’t usually see lights this bright or commercial airliners for that matter moving in this direction over top of my neighborhood which slightly sparked my interest. The  PHI Airport is a little over 35 miles NE from me and I do see lots of air traffic at night when skies are clear and this was a clear night.   The Dover Air Force Base is about 50 miles south of me. As I looked up and saw the aircraft, I thought is was far away and might have been low flying because it didn’t appear to be high in the sky.  I was still driving and slowed to stop and watch the aircraft as I saw it approaching fairly quickly.  Within about 30 seconds of spotting it in the distance, it was now almost right on top of where I was.   I quickly rolled the windows down, shut the car off, and stuck my head out of the window to listen for any engine noises.  I heard nothing.  It was still silent outside.  Looking up I could now see that this craft had three large randomly pulsing white lights underneath of it with one red light in the center.  The white lights were not all pulsing at the same time.  They were pulsing independently of each other.  The red light was a solid and consistent brightness.  As the craft went directly over top of me I noticed it was still making no noise at all.  My neighborhood is very quiet and I can usually hear, jets, propeller p! lanes and helicopters.  There is a farm field behind my neighborhood and no bright shopping centers or main roads are very close to me to create noise or light pollution. Looking straight up I also noticed that the body of the craft is in the definite shape of a large dark triangle because it blocked out the sky in that area which was full of stars this night.  I also noticed now that it was moving very quickly because it was very far away at first but within seconds it was on top of me.  As it went overhead, I could see one more small red like in the very back center of the triangle.  It quickly, silently passed over top of me and over the house to my immediate right.  Still no noise at all.  I put my head back into the car and started it up again and then quickly pulled forward to track the object after it was blocked by the house.   When I saw the object again, which was only about 5 seconds later, it was very far away moving in the same eastern direction.  It might have been at least a mile away at that point and quickly and steadily moved away and out of sight in the next minute until I couldn’t see it at all anymore.  That was the last I saw of it.",2015-10-02T00:00:00,39.65195779310345,-75.71214262068966

I have decided to share these experiences given (a) the extraordinary nature of the various sightings; (b) my fear of forgetting details, with no written record; and (c) the non-response from MUFON of Ohio in taking down these details, following an e-mail submitted weeks ago.. I will present these sightings in bullet fashion, with emphasis on brevity and unique, distinguishing details. August 31st, , @ 21:15: I stepped outside to our covered back patio, and “heard” a thought that said:  Go to the yard and look up at the sky.  With no hesitation, I acted on this thought and with clear view of the sky, I looked up and proceeded to witness something remarkable.  One star, in stasis with other stars, went from a notably idle state to, suddenly, scanning across the sky, east to west.  It proceeded to slow down, and then took a 90-degree turn to the right, heading north.  As it went north, its body’s light exponentially increased in velocity, until it appeared approximately 10x brighter than its initial glow.  Then, it disappeared. Sighting duration: 10-12 seconds. ((Note: I remember seeing two other interesting things that same night, but given the nature of, and my focus on, subsequent sightings, I cannot recall their defining characteristics.)  September 1st, 2015, @ approx. 21:00:  From same location, I (and a few family members) observed a glowing orb of light, low in the western sky, which interchanged between colors of orange, red, yellow, and white. Lights pulsed.  The object barely moved, but did venture downward re: our line of sight.  Sighting duration:  15 minutes. September 3rd, 2015, @ 21:30 – 23:30:  Given the nature of recent sightings, I developed new interest to taking a look at the night sky.  On this night, I saw three quick flashes of light –imagine lights flashing once from three points of a triangle–around Sirius.  On this same evening, I saw something fly much lower, and it pulsed multiple (15+) lights at once, with lights varying in color with each pulse. Colors were of warmer nature.  Sighting duration(s): 3 Flashes: 2 seconds; “Pulsing” craft: 1 minute.  Please note:  Over the course of these evenings, I do indeed see multiple planes, helicopters, and accumulatively, about 10 shooting stars. September 8th, 2015 @ 18:30:  As sun set in the West, I watched as a plane descended, heading east from west, and I took it upon myself to observe its lighting patterns, in an effort to further inform myself on possible plane ID factors for nighttime observations.  It was low in altitude, and its descent east was done to prepare for a loop-around to land at the airport, south of my location.  As I watched the plane go to the east of me, I saw – quite clearly, unambiguously, and with complete surprise – a white “cigar” craft, “hovering” at about the same altitude as the plane.  It had no wings, no windows, and it resembled a white stick, traveling from north to south at leisurely speed.  *I could see both the plane and the cigar in the same “frame” of sight.*  It went behind some trees, and I did not think to keep track of it, as I was in a state of surprise and amazement.  Sighting duration: 15 seconds.  Note: While the video is not the best, the cigar I witnessed looked and moved exactly like the one featured in this video I found after a search online, about one week after the sighting.  In my viewing, it was closer to me than it was in this seemingly-sound videoed sighting.  Link:  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=1eb_1434824886   September 8th, 2015 @ 22:00: I observed a “star” – similar to my first sighting – scan across the sky, going from north to south, to the east of me. It traveled quickly, but not at any immense rapidity, and I managed to make a call to have another person come outside and see it. Just as they stepped out, I lost sight of the “star” behind a backyard tree, and could not locate it when I rushed to other side. After this person returned inside, an identical light quickly crossed from south to north, in the western sky, before disappearing. Sighting(s) duration: 1st star: 40 seconds; 2nd star: 10 seconds.  September 16th @ 22:00 - September 17th, 2015 @ 6:00: With another witness, we watched as three lights slowly rose (two to the north of us, and one to the east). The eastern light pulsed with very strong flashes of color, and at one point, a “bloated-seeming” airliner passed underneath it at what appeared to be very close proximity. Of the two northern lights, one seemed rather stationary, while the other moved closer to it, but farther in the northern direction (as in compass, not upward height) than when we first saw it.  Later this evening, or rather in the morning, at approx. 5:00, I saw two lights (larger than the “stars” but not by much) which appeared to travel north to south, east of me, and then “phase” out, in a way I can only describe as if they moved beyond an invisibility cloak – in other words: when their body passed respective fixed points, they disappeared, but not all at once, and quite unlike the shooting stars I had also seen that night (which would streak very quickly, and disappear quickly). Sighting(s) duration: approx. 7 seconds, and 3 seconds.  Then, at approx. 5:40, a light to the east rose slowly (but quickly compared to the rest of the sky’s scan). I have heard mention of Venus appearing very brightly this past month, and with respect to this single sighting, I do make room that I may have been looking at Venus. However, a few things to point out: (a) This light was easily the brightest light I have ever seen in the sky, excluding the sun during the day; brighter than the moon. (b) There was no definite shape to the light; its glow was a very bright, very concentrated golden light, and it hurt to look at it (similar to the sun). (c) My cell phone can barely record the moon when it is full, and it cannot catch the stars at night, nor any of my other night sightings, but it was able to register this object, with ONE major exception: the light, as I saw it, was an amorphous sunshine-like light; my phone’s camera’s capture has it as a rounded orb, which flashes every single imaginable color. *I am very curious as to! why this may be, and if this is the case with Venus or other planetary cell phone video captures.* A few other locals whom I have spoken to have made mention of seeing this very bright light once or twice this month. Sighting duration: 30 minutes.  A note on the observer: Until August 31st, I *never* claimed to have seen any Unidentified Flying Object. I am in my mid-twenties, and with my field of work and studies, I am prone to engaging my imagination's muscle. However, I would say say that this does not mean I cannot control my imagination's affect, but rather that my awareness of my imagination has given me a good grasp on what I may make up, as an artist, against what I have now seen with my own eyes, for the very first time. I do hope that these are not the last of my sightings. This month's activity and sightings can be summed up, for me, as quite extraordinary, and, already, privately treasured.",2015-10-02T00:00:00,40.13236180904523,-82.90826582914573

I walked up to the hill (4 steps off the deck) and i looked up to the sky (the sky was that blue night sky not dark black) i see this huge what appeared like a star but was massive and so close.  I knew 100% this isnt right and just then all these pink tesla ball tentacles started coming off of this "" star "" looking thing and within a second - it seemed as if this "" star "" turned inside out of itself and i could see orange and blue lights merged together and WHAM!  I see this dark shape with lights (not blinking) coming towards my house.  I never once took my eyes off of it and as it went over my house i could see the bottom and full shape of the object.  It was in the shape of a row boat /bullet. It 100% had no wings or tail.  The lower bottom had two lights that were peach orange and in the shape of those cement park barriers that lay on the ground in a parking space - they were vertigo - one on far left and other on far right.  Above these two lights was a large circular ball light of blue.  None of these lights blinked at all and stayed on.  The craft gave off a sound that i unfortunately can not describe because i have never heard a sound like that to compare.  I thought there was something wrong with it mechanically because of sound but perhaps that is the way it sounds normally..  i really don't know. It was the size of a large building and moved slow but steady over the house. When the object went over me i could feel a numb sorta tingly feeling within both arms, neck and my head.  What i found strange is that i knew it was a UFO but i just all calm like walked back into my house looking at my arms and thinking "" they are real "" I felt this sensation for 1hr and 9mins. Also, when i came in the house i looked at the time and no more then 2 mins had passed. I drew the craft and wrote some details within a minute of being in the house. I have been feeling since that night what must be post traumatic stress.",2015-10-02T00:00:00,44.25612258064516,-76.94746129032258

V-shaped formation of moving lights similar to satellites or faint stars.  While standing on my porch, I observed a formation of about 7-10 lights moving across the sky.  At the time that I observed these lights (approximately 22:35), they were approximately 30 degrees from directly overhead, and they were in the middle of the sky.  They moved in a straight line, maintained the V formation, and faded near the horizon.  In my life, I have seen many meteorites and falling stars, and I have observed a handful of satellites.  The speed of this V-formation was somewhere in between that of a shooting star and a satellite.  The lights did not ""burn out"" like a shooting star.  After seeing these lights, I thought they may have been satellites; however, it seems odd to me that they would orbit so closely together.  I had no way to gauge distance or altitude-but the size and brightness of the lights was very similar to satellites.  I know that the typical ! orbit time of satellites is about 90 minutes, so I went back outside after about 80 minutes to see if I would see the lights again.  At 00:03 on 10/14/15 (approx 88 minutes after first sighting), I saw the lights again.  This time, there appeared to be fewer lights, but I did not have time to count.  Unlike the first sighting, these lights were not flying in a perfect V formation.  They flew in an imperfect line, with some dots momentarily pulling ahead of the others before falling back.  The position of these lights during the second sighting was different than the position during the first sighting.  They were almost directly overhead.  Interestingly, they were moving it what seemed to be a nearly parallel direction to the initial sighting.  Due to this parallel direction and also the fact that the sightings were nearly 90 minutes apart, I was inclined to believe that the objects were in orbit.  Still, several things don't seem to mesh with this notion: (1) the objects we! re very close together, (2) during the second sighting, the li! ghts did not maintain a perfect formation - some would briefly move faster than others before slowing down and falling back in line, and (3) the speed of the objects was definitely faster than that of satellites.  I watched the sky again from 01:20 to 01:40 on 10/14/15, after waiting for another 90 minute interval to go by.  During this time, I did not see the lights again.  Another important note is that I did not hear any sound during either of these sightings.  Below, I have copied the raw notes that I made immediately after each sighting:  10:35 first sighting -V shaped lights similar to the specks of light you see when a satellite passes -slow moving -not as bright as shooting star, and slower moving -one branch of the V appeared slightly longer than the other branch - maybe by 2 dots -seemed to move slower than shooting stars, which I have seen many times -did not burn out like shooting star -no sound like you would hear from planes flying overhead -seemed to move faster than a jet and faster than satellite  11:22 -shooting star spotted -single light -perpendicular to first sighting -flared and burnt out  00:03 second sighting -some dots would pull ahead momentarily then fall back in the space of about a second -fast moving, not a perfect V -almost directly overhead -faster moving than first sighting -different position in sky from first sighting but same direction",2015-10-16T00:00:00,41.52599743589744,-109.02363205128206

I was about 6500 feet elevation and as far as I knew I was the only one camping for many miles.  I had a campfire going at the edge of a large open meadow. It was about 8pm and I saw a bright white light in the night sky above me and a little to my left.  The light was bright then it would dim down to where it was completely dark. The light would appear again around 30 seconds later, then dim down each time.  After a dozen times of it doing this I started timing it, but the flash of light was intermediate....at least 30 seconds to a minute before it would flash again.  The light did not appear to be moving as I positioned its location using trees and a star.  I ruled out a helicopter or any conventional aircraft as they have lights that are either on constantly or flashing. there was no light at all on this object other than the one bright flash of light, then it dimmed down to darkness.  There was no spotlight going to the ground either.  Two of the flashes though were very bright...maybe 3 or 4 times brighter than the others. After 30 minutes of so it had moved just east of me as short ways.  After another 10 minutes it stopped altogether.  There was no noise. When the light dimmed down just before going off I thought I could very briefly see the reflection of the object.  It was elongated, but not real long.  No wings either and the light was on the end facing me.  There were no other colors than white.  I had a powerful spotlight, but I didn't want to turn it on out of concern that I might get a ""visitation"".  Seriously it was amazing to watch, but I was glad when it was finally gone.  I don't why it was there except for it wanting to watch my campfire.  With one more burst of light it moved on in an easterly direction.",2015-10-09T00:00:00,,

My sister and our neighbor were heading out to the porch to watch the lunar eclipse or blood moon. The night was overcast and the moon was mostly hidden by the clouds, but you could get a glimpse of it from time to time.  My cocker Spaniel and I had crossed the field and were approaching a maintenance shed near the church’s parking lot, when I glanced back to see if I could see the moon. Suddenly I saw 3 orange lights in a perfect triangular formation flying from Southeast to Northwest. My first thought was that they were planes or maybe helicopters, but there was something strange about them… There was no sound whatsoever, they were traveling at a steady speed (faster than an airplane), and seemed to float across the sky almost like a Chinese lantern or something. Then two more orbs appeared behind the first three like two points of a triangle, only this time the orbs were red instead of orange. The orange orbs remained in triangular formation with the two red orbs trailing behind somewhat. All 5 of the lights seemed to be moving at the same speed and trajectory. By this time, I was a little scared and had moved close to the shed as not to be detected by aliens or whatever I was seeing. At this time they were almost directly overhead and to my North passing directly by. I could see their elevation increasing as they floated further Westward, never changing speed or breaking formation. As the last red orb was moving away from my location, and I was certain there were no more coming behind, I came out from hiding behind the maintenance shed and walked swiftly home to ask my sister and our neighbor if they has seen the strange lights.  How could they have missed it?  They were sitting right out front looking up at the moon right? Sadly, they didn’t see a thing and probably think I’m making this up, but I assure you I’m not. I watched the local news at eleven with no mention of the phenomenon, then came upstairs to see if I could find anything online about it.  Surely someone else must have seen this.  Then I found this site and decided to leave a report in hopes that someone else will corroborate my sighting.

There was a white light at the front of the craft, another behind it, and three more white lights along the back.  The blinking red light was in the center.   It glided at about the same speed as a plane across the sky, and was flying pretty low. I would say it was more or less gliding than flying.  It was also about as loud as a normal commercial jet if you were maybe 200 feet away from it.",2015-07-17T00:00:00,43.0441,-78.6949

I left the house and he called my cell phone to say he wasn't ready.  My husband was grouchy and sitting next to me in the car.   As I was talking to my son I felt a pang in my eyes from an extremely bright light.  I looked ahead on the road to see if I needed to dim my headlights for another car but the angle was wrong so I looked up.  There was a bright white circle jetting across the sky. It wasn't too close but I could tell it was large.   The light did not blink and it moved amazingly fast at a curved angle.  I could not distinguish any rotation.  There was no trail behind it and I didn't hear any noise.  It wasn't any kind of spotlight.   I was talking to my son and I pointed to my husband urgently.  I asked did you see that light but he hadn't seen me pointing because it was dark. There was complete cloud cover over the road I was traveling.  You couldn't see any stars.  It was a good bit above the tree line but it had to be flying low enough to be under the cloud cover.   I looked in the local paper to see if anyone else had noticed it or written about it but I haven't heard anything.  It made me so excited but also made my stomach ache.   I know I saw something AMAZING.   I was really disappointed my husband didn't see it because I would have liked to share the excitement with him...so I'm sharing it with you guys instead.

First seen from the south, moving in a wide back and forth (meandering?) motion, ultimately disappearing in the east/north-east skies of the valley.   I thought it was a plane or helicopter at first, but it made no sound, had no blinking lights, and moved oddly for a craft carrying people.  It was too bright, and didn't fly in a motion similar to satellites or the ISS.  When directly overhead it appeared extremely high in the sky.  As it moved north-east of my position it headed towards a small, very high cloud formation that had that ""wind swept"" look to it and I expected it to go under the cloud.  Instead, it disappeared into the cloud and emerged a few moments later.  I lost view of the object soon after, due to the distance from my position.  The entire time it took to travel over the valley took about 15 minutes.

I have seen some strange things over JBER, so I tried to forget it.  It was SO CLEAR and interesting.  I tried just to forget it. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE)) Addendum:  the person that saw exactly what I saw reported on 08/10/15, not 08/15/15.  It is also interesting that we both live only miles from a large military/Air Force installation. ((END ADDENDUM))",2015-08-27T00:00:00,61.18196014109348,-149.84252680776015

There was a storm today in Minnesota and a grandfather figure of mine and myself love watching storms so we were hanging out in his garage to observe.  Occasionally stepping out to observe the sky better. We stepped out to look more and were focused on a morning dove on the power line.  But then we saw this strange, black object gliding across the sky.  There was no sound, no visible lights, it did not look like any known object to me or the person with me, it was clearly not a weather balloon, and it was under the storm clouds. It seemed to be just a black sphere-like object, but then it made a slight turn (or it was spinning the whole time) and we saw curves on it and it had a metallic silver color on it as well.  We kept our eyes focused on it as long as we could until it got too far away for us to see.  Immediately afterwards, rain started pouring on us.  It's almost as if it was riding straight in front of the storm. My grandfather figure used to be a helicopter engineer for many years and he said that in his fifty-four years of living that he has never seen an object shaped like that in the sky.  The way it glided across like nothing and made absolutely no sound seemed so unusual.  Me and him both strongly believe that we have seen a UFO. I, in no way, have had as much experience as him when in comes to aircrafts, but I want to be an astronomer, so there has been many nights were I have observed the sky with my telescope and I have done a lot of research, but I have never seen anything quite like this.

My bed headboard abuts a large window allowing me to gaze almost directly upward.  It is common for me to waken about every two hours or so, as I did this night. I saw what at first I thought was a falling star, a dot of light, but it was slower than normal.  After a brief arc it blinked out.  Following the line of sight ahead, I was surprised to see a dark charcoal triangular shape moving along the same line and at the same speed as brief dot of light. In disbelief, I grabbed my glasses and looked again.  Along the same line, I saw the same shadowy dark charcoal triangular shapes against the black sky, one after another, equidistant apart.  I did not count but guess I saw six or seven in a row.  At the end, there was a group of five or six in a symmetrical formation. As these objects passed, background stars were blocked from sight.  There was no sound. I have no idea what to make of it.  I was not dreaming.  Indeed, after searching the sky for a couple more minutes, I turned on the light and with an app on my smart phone took a compass reading of the direction.  A close approximation was a heading of 206 degrees (plus/minus), or south by southwest. Location and Conditions:  I live in Lakebay, Washington, about 2 miles southeast of Key Center, a small community.  It is a wooded setting with no outdoor lights close by.  My house was dark with no lights on.  I am surrounded by high fir trees, distant about 30 feet away from my bedroom window, and about 80 feet away in the direction of the objects.  There is a screen on the window out of which I was looking. Considerations:  Because of the initial observation of light, as a meteor, I have dismissed the thought that this could have been a flock of Canadian geese.  Further, geese are noisy when they fly, constantly honking.  Everything was a tad too symmetrical in any event. Had they been planes or jets, I would have been able to hear them.  It was absolutely silent.  And because what I saw had size and shape, not just specks, planes would have been close enough to easily hear. I cannot speculate on size, distance or speed.  I have no idea what I saw.  But I was awake and did see what I have described, definitely there but very dark.  Again, the objects were a dark slate gray, just barely lighter than the background black night sky, covering stars as they passed by. I am divorced, 65, and live alone. Not an UFO kind of guy, I am not keen on publicity and prefer relative anonymity.   Nonetheless, should you wish to contact you may, discretely.",2015-07-03T00:00:00,47.2833,-122.7747

On Friday, July 3rd, 2015, at 9:20pm, as I was leaving the Nice-n-Easy parking lot in Phoenix, NY, I saw a stationary object in the southern sky above St. Stephen’s Church.  I extended my left arm toward the object and raised my thumb as a reference for size.  This object was the size of my thumbnail.  I estimated it to be approximately eight hundred feet above the ground.  I based this estimate on the objects location in relation to the peak of St Stevens Church below it, and the cumulus cloud cover behind it.  I would describe this object as a ball of light.  It was bright red, and twinkled orange to yellow at its core.  I had determined at this point it was not an airplane, helicopter, drone, or fire work flare.  It was stationary.  There was no sound associated with the object. I drove out of the parking lot on to Culver Street and traveled west intending to cross the bridge to lock island.  I continued to view the object.  I slowed down in order to observe the object for three or four seconds at a glance.  The object was now moving west parallel to my line of travel.  It had matched my speed of fifteen miles an hour and was visible at sixty degrees to my left as I traveled South West.  While I was on the bridge I again compared the object to the landscape and my thumb nail.  The cumulus cloud cover remained a reliable reference in the background.  It was now just above the trees located in the area of the old paper mill.  I estimated the object to be approximately two hundred feet above the ground.  Its size was still consistent with my thumbnail. I continued on Lamson Road and turned onto Pendegast Road. After traveling only a short distance, I pulled to the side of the road.  The object was behind me.  I stepped out of my truck.  At this point the object passed very close to me, approximately fifteen degrees off my zenith.  As the object moved in front of me I began to record it on my cell phone.  It was now in front of me traveling in a Northwest direction.  The object climbed steadily and maintained a trajectory of approximately sixty degrees above the horizon. The length of my recording was forty-one seconds.

We were about 300 yards away from the firework display, and randomly noticed 2 green lights with a single white flashing light on the object that we could not physically see outside of the light display.  We had found it curious, as it seemed to literally be spectating the fireworks while hovering/sitting over the show.  My friend and I actually went into debate as to whether it was a UFO or a helicopter.  I originally put it off as a helicopter, because generally speaking, that's what sane people believe. It started to catch our attention more as the green lights both turned red.  It was unlike any normal aircraft that we could think of.  Obviously, since it was sitting over the fireworks, it could not be a plane.  And usually the lights displayed on a helicopter stay consistent and do not change at random. What happened next is what truly makes me believe that we saw a UFO.  It went from sitting in one place to my friend and I watching it dart across the sky directly east of where we were stationed.  It quickly changed direction and again, changed color from green to red, and turned from left to right.  Again, it changed to green as it looked to fly into the tree line about 5 miles away.

Location was east of Munising, and north of Shingleton, in the north central Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  Duration was approximately 7 minutes. At about 10 pm Eastern I went outside in an open area with my two dogs to watch the full moon rise in the east above the spruce trees in the distance.  As I turned to the north I was startled to see a surprisingly bright object flashing extremely brilliant red and white lights.  The lights were much, much larger than any star, a satellite, or the lights of an aircraft, so much so that my mouth literally dropped.  It was approaching me, silently, and gave me the impression of slowly floating. I have no knowledge of the altitude. I will describe the red color as attractive, pleasing, not fire-engine red nor candy-apple red, a cool-ish red but not pink. The red color was more dominant than the white lights. As I watched it drift closer, I was stunned at how beautiful it was and I was riveted looking at it.  My Sheltie at my side did not agree.  She barked at the bright lights and then she and my Border Collie ran for the door, wanting to be let inside.  I was wearing on my forehead a Petzl headlamp on the highest beam and I decided to switch it off. The object gently turned in a southeastern direction, still gliding silently.  I had my little palm-sized Fuji camera with me (since I had planned to take some pictures of baby toads) so I attempted to take a short video of the object as it moved southeasterly.  I saw there was a faint, quite dim, white light following the red-white flashing object.  If I were to hold my hand straight out, the distance between the red-white object and the following white light would be about one of my hands across. As I was watching it, somebody suddenly ""turned out the lights""--and it was gone!  The dim light that had been following I could see for another 3 or 4 seconds, until it too disappeared. The geography the object had to have come from is Lake Superior and then over wilderness northern forest with very little to no population.  My sad attempt at a video turned out to show only a difficult-to-see, pin-point, red flashing light, so like others I have viewed on YouTube. I will add that I took a college course in astronomy years ago and I enjoy the night sky, so I am not a stranger to planets and constellations, various satellites, Iridium satellite flares, nighttime aircraft, and so forth.  This experience was unique. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF ORIGINAL REPORT)) If I may, I would like to add some information to my report of August 1, 2015.  I did not originally write it into my experience thinking it was too fantastic to be believed and also leaving out my personal feelings at the sighting.  But it has bothered me consistently since.  If you judge the following to be important facts, please do include it in my report, editing however you consider best.  I apologize for adding inconvenience to your already heavy workload.

The object appeared to be composed of multiple splendid glittering, shimmering lights cascading and independently moving, which also gave it a vertical oval shape.  None of the lights fell to the ground.   My distinct impression was that its intent was to be noticed (and how could anyone not?).  I clicked off my Petzl light because I myself wanted to avoid being noticed. ((END ADDENDUM))",2015-08-06T00:00:00,,

Three of us were sitting on my porch in Franklin, NC, when one of us saw the fireball come over the mountains from the west.  We all looked at it and I thought it was a comet of some sort, but it didn’t make any sounds, didn’t leave any kind of trail and it was moving much more slowly than it should have been I thought.   It moved from West to East just south of us and it took quite a long time to do so.  It was glowing like it was on fire but again, no tail.  It seemed like a giant hot ball of iron glowing after being pulled out of the fire.  Compared to the size of the planes in the sky it was either quite close or very large.   After seeing it move through the sky and behind the mountains on the east, it felt more like it was something that was made to look like a comet or meteor.

There was no sound though, even when a jet passes at 30,000 feet overhead you can hear the roar of the engines after it has passed, so it was quite strange that there was absolutely no sound at all.

Early on the morning of Thursday, July 23rd, 2015, I was house sitting in a rural area of Pacific County, WA, and had gone to bed.  Lying facing the window with my eyes closed, I could see light coming in the window.  Figured it was a car coming up the road, not totally unheard of, even out there.  I realized I did not hear an engine, though, and the light barely fluctuated, so I got up to look. What I saw made me grab my glasses so I could see clearly.  Returning to the window, I saw two large white lights, about the size of the full moon, perhaps a bit smaller, quite a ways apart (perhaps 100 feet or so), traveling very slowly from W/NW to E/SE, in a descending manner, behind a stand of trees.  When the white lights were behind trees, I could see red lights (much smaller than the white ones, maybe double the size of Venus), none of them flashing.  The only sound I heard was similar to a lone passenger car out on the highway, about half a mile away.  It was very quiet, and descending into an area that is nothing but marshland.  After I could no longer see it, I just sat staring at the window.  I saw no further activity, no other occurrences.  I have seen things before, but never this big, or this close.  I remained awake, unable to sleep, for at least another 3 hours. It was very dark out there, being rural, without exterior lights, and cloudy that night, so I could not see anything but the lights themselves. The following day, I let the dogs out, and they went into the gully that leads to the marsh.  When they returned, the black lab suddenly stuck by my side and would not leave me, she HAD to be touching me, though this only lasted about an hour.  I did not report it elsewhere, to police or media.  I did not go into the marsh myself. I did not get photos or videos of the object, but I did take pics of the area, and via Google Earth, to give you an idea of the area. ((NUFORC Note:  The case has been shared with Mr. James E. Clarkson, MUFON State Director for Washington State, who has offered to follow up on it, and perhaps perform an investigation.  PD))",2015-07-31T00:00:00,,

4 red light in sky over Glenmoore Pa. 8/1/15  at 11:30 PM.,Glenmoore,PA,2015-08-01T23:30:00,unknown,60 seconds,"Occurred : 8/1/2015 23:30  (Entered as : 08/01/15 23:30) Reported: 8/1/2015 9:35:43 PM 21:35 Posted: 8/6/2015 Location: Glenmoore, PA Shape: Unknown Duration:60 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/120/S120813.html,"4 red light in sky over Glenmoore Pa. 8/1/15  at 11:30 PM I was sitting on my front porch in Southeastern, PA, facing southeast at approx.11:30 pm on 8/1/15.  Their was a nearly full moon and the sky was mostly clear with no discernible surface wind.  The high clouds were moving very slowly, almost imperceptibly suggesting light winds aloft.  I was watching distant lightning (50-60 miles away) from a storm passing near the Cape May/Delaware Bay, NJ, area that I was also watching on my Accuweather radar app. I saw a bright red object flying by to my right, and assumed it was an airplane, since I live directly under the approach route for Philadelphia International Airport.   Immediately, I saw an identical red object about 1/4 mile behind the first object, and slightly to the right of the first object.  This second object appeared to be gaining on the first object and moved to the right.  It looked like 2 planes flying in a loose formation.  I judged them to be about 2 miles away.  I would estimate their airspeed at somewhere around 200 mph. I am a 19 year licensed pilot, and I immediately noticed 2 unusual things about the  objects; they were completely silent and they weren't ""strobing.""  This is unusual because all aircraft are required by the FAA to have a green position light on the right wing, a red position light on the left wing, a strobe light on the underside of the aircraft, and a white position light on the tail.  These objects I observed were just glowing a steady red.   Also, I see aircraft at this distance every day and there is always audible engine noise, especially with 2 planes that close together on a quiet night.  These objects were silent. I immediately picked up my binoculars and was able to observe the objects for about 10 seconds.  They were glowing steady bright red, then they slowly faded for about 3 seconds before completely disappearing. About 10 seconds after this I saw 2 more identical objects flying in exactly the same area of sky at the same speed and at the same distance from each other.  I watched them through my binoculars and they disappeared in exactly the same location as their predecessors. I have an app on my Iphone, Flight Radar 24, that shows all the air traffic in the sky.  I immediately looked to see if their was any traffic in the area at that time and it showed nothing at all within miles of that area. I have another Iphone app, Sky Guide, which shows where all the satellites are in the sky and it showed nothing at all above my home.  I see satellites, meteors, and objects like the Intl.Space Station all the time.  These 4 objects were very different. So I'm really perplexed.  What did I see?",2015-08-06T00:00:00,40.1002,-75.7562

It was approximately 10PM on 9/26/15.  I was out in the back yard smoking a cigarette and checking the hot tub.  I saw an object approaching from the Southeast.  Cloud cover was cumulo-stratus, and there was a full moon.  This is why I could see the triangle shape.  I can’t estimate speed but it was jet aircraft type speed or greater.   I was in Navigation in the Navy, and am an expert boater on the great lakes.  The craft had an amber colored light on its starboard side and roughly half way down the leading edge of the its wing.  It made absolutely no noise and the light was steady with no flash.   Typically, you observe a green light on your left wing and a red light on your wing on approaching view.   I was stupefied, as the steady light remained visible as the object went by CPA, and light remained visible as it went away.  I thought this was all very peculiar and impossible.  The object must have been slightly climbing as it disappeared into the clouds as it went over Lansing, Michigan.  It was heading on a direct Northwest direction in terms of Cardinal headings and in TRUE degrees and not magnetic. So, about the time the first object fades into the cloud,; another identical craft approaches from the Southeast and roughly on the same line as the first but slightly on a path to the right of the previous object.  Same thing, steady amber light, no flash and no noise.  The second object appeared not to be ascending but on level flight just below the cloud ceiling. The third object was exactly the same as the previous two and it approached from the Southeast as well and was on the same line but slightly to the left of the other two objects.  At first, I thought UFO, but the silhouette was more like a stealth fighter.  Trouble is, I am guessing cloud ceiling was about 10,000 feet and visibility was unlimited and these were much too big to a stealth fighter.  I estimate size at jet airliner scale or slightly larger.  One last thing; that amber light was particularly large.",2015-10-02T00:00:00,42.7042,-84.4098

My friend filed her own separate report on this incident. On September 27, 2015, at approximately 8:30 p.m., my friend and I drove to the Narragansett Town Beach on Route 1A, in the state of Rhode Island, to view the lunar eclipse. We were looking at the moon over the Atlantic Ocean.  My friend was looking off to our right and she asked me what I thought was in the sky. I sat up and turned around to face towards Lake Canonchet and saw the flying object. The flying object was colored more gold than orange. The very outer edge of the object looked like a lighter gold than what the rest of it was. The edges were a little bit hazy, that’s what made the little bit of color difference on the outer edge.  The object was not rotating or spinning.  It had to be at least 500 feet or more away from us.  It was moving very slowly. It was heading North-Northwest.  It took at least 2 or 3 minutes to go out of sight.  It was during the same time that the moon was ¾ covered by the eclipse, actually it was more like 7/8 covered by the eclipse. It did not stay in a straight line as it flew, instead it kind of rocked back and forth, but the rocking was not visible unless you were really staring at it.  The rocking was very hard to see. It continued rocking until it was out of our sight.  And it was not an airplane that we could tell because it had no airplane lights blinking. The object was slightly round and then it turned into a tear drop shape and looked a little narrower, like a tear drop laying on its side.  But my friend described it as an orb, and did not see the tear drop shape happen.  The point of it was on a 45 degree angle from us.  The point of it was the tail end. At some point I told my friend to look at it through the telescope. We had an old Tasco F=600mm D=50mm telescope, but she couldn’t line up the view because she said she couldn’t keep up with it, it was moving too quickly. It just looked like a tear drop going through the air, on a steady course, it just had a little sway to it.",2015-10-02T00:00:00,41.4501,-71.4495

I downloaded 3 applications that would possibly have a telescopic or zoom affect on my phone for odvious reasons..the camera is terrible for far away pics.  During this period of pics taken I did not use my friends telescope to capture photos ..only my phone. The applications were a telescopic for telescope pics( can attach cell to telescope physically) and a so called filter or night vision app. and an app that flip flops dark and light..whatever the object being photographed the whiter or lighter colored object is reversed to black and the black object is reversed to white (easier to see in dark conditions).

In the beginning I thought maybe it was my camera reflecting the brightness of the illuminated moon. I wiped the lense over and over.  The object was still the same shape and continued to become clearer.  It appeared to look like a star when I looked by eye and when I looked through the camera on my phone, which was magnified it looked to be a clearish blue-tinted bubble and then turned a pale pink. I believe there were two objects but the other disappeared and I was only able to really capture this single object.  The photos are taken with 3 seperate apps but same cell phone. I cannot say what this was that I saw and I have no opinion to voice. My friend and I were wondering if anyone else could shed some light on this ""very cool"" occurance.  So glad I was able to share my pics. Thank you.",2015-10-02T00:00:00,34.121670833333326,-117.45998511904762

It was the same day there was an eclipse/blue moon.  My friends were driving me home.   On my way there I saw lights in the sky occasionally.  I then saw a UFO with blue lights in the air next to a house.  I told everyone in the car but they just laughed but one of my friends saw something blue but he wasn't really paying attention.  I was really frustrated that they didn't believe me.  I got dropped off home.   When I went inside I heard a strange noise coming from a block away.  I decided to go check it out since I knew I saw a UFO.  I walked over to where I was hearing the noise. It was coming from an alley in front of my friends house.  I saw a UFO!  I got scared so I went inside my friends house without permission.  I stayed there watching it from the door.  This UFO was a different one from what I saw earlier.  This one was white and it was shaped weird.  And had different color lights around it and on the bottom it seemed to look like a ! orange and blue light/flame sort of thing.  I was so in shock.  1st thing I thought was too get someone here to see it!  I called my friend that lived there but they didn't answer.  I decided to go closer to get a better view of it.   As I walked to the road all its lights turned off!  The only thing you could see was the orange/blue light flame thing coming from the bottom of it.  I got kinda scared and started to back away.  Then it just stayed there and so I went closer to it again.  And this time it started to fade!  Like it was disappearing but I could see where it was.   ran back to my friends house.  I looked and it was there again.  I tried calling my other friend but she wouldn't answer.  This was now like 2:30 am.  I stepped outside my friends house and stayed by his garage.  All of a sudden I see lights to my right. I look over and I couldn't believe what I had seen. It was an alien!  But it didn't look like the type of aliens people picture.  This looked like a super advanced te! chnological robot. It was a dark grey/silver with like a stick body and it had two lights as eyes.  And it was moving in one spot. I stood there for a bit observing it. It would just move it's head. I decided to get a better look at it by moving away from the fence and so I did.  I walked slowly towards the road and that's when it saw me and froze! It's lights turned off and it stood in one position and did not move. I backed away to were there fence was in between us. It remained that way. I went again and this time it became invisible. I went back to the fence and when I looked at it, it was there again. But still remained frozen. It knew I was watching it. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I was in shock scared excited and nervous all at the same time. I needed to have someone see what I was seeing because I knew nobody would believe me. So I decided to try to call more people to see if anyone would pick up! I called a friend. He answered! I told him to come ASAP. He asked why what happened?? I told him not to ask and to hurry and come. H! e came and parked in front of my house. I slowly ran over there hoping the thing wouldn't see me. I kept looking back to see if I would stay there and it did. I went up to my friend and from where we were I pointed all the way where the thing was standing by the alley in front of a garage. I asked if he sees a silver thing over there and He said yes. That's when I told him what It was and everything I saw. He looked at me and was like shut up. I said I was being dead serious. He just stared at it. He had a worried/nervous face on. I told him I could take him to where he could see the UFO but he didn't want too! He was scared but he just didn't say it. All he said was no it's nothing. And that he didn't see anything over there. I'm like you just said you saw the silver thing over there now you can't say you didn't because you already admitted to it. I tried to convince him to come to see the UFO in the alley he didn't want to but at the end he did. I took him to the side of ! my friends house and pointed at the alley. I told him if he sa! w the bl ue and orange lights and he said yes I'm like okay that's the UFO. It was kinda distant from us. But he said those are probably lights. He was trying to convince himself that it was something else. He went back to his car and I followed. I'm like wow you're really not going to do this with me? I thought I could count on you. He said no sorry. I'm like why???? You saw everything. Are you really that scared? He said yeah..I'm scared of aliens and all that stuff. I'm like okay I understand I guess I'm just going to find someone else. So he left. I went back to where I was and just watched. I was so amused at what I was seeing. My phone was dying so I went back to my house to charge it. Then I went back to where I was without my phone. Everything was still there. I was by the fence seeing this thing just frozen there. Then all of the sudden i see it's eyes (two lights on the head) start turning on. It was blinking and it looked like it was just waking up. And it just started to ! move its head around and his arms up like it was stretching. It then looked worried and sad. I thought. Is it lost or stuck here? I just stayed there and observed it. I went a bit forward again and I think it saw me trying to get a better view of it so it turned off again and remained frozen. I was upset that my friend didn't want to help with anything. I really needed someone to come. I went back inside to grab my phone to see who I could call. I called my friend and she picked up! I told her to hurry and come and so she did. I did the same and pointed at the silver thing and asked if she saw that she said yes I'm like okay are you sure you see it. It's right there. My finger pointing at it. She said yes what about it. And I told her everything. She came with me to show her the UFO. Shes like are you sure that's it. This was now like 3:30 am. She said what if maybe it's lights from another house or something. I'm like nope it's not. Let's go check it out?? She said that I ! was crazy and went back to her car. I followed. I'm like pleas! e!! She' s like we can go in the car but I'm not walking over there. I'm like fine but it knows and it will probably go invisible. So we went and drove around the block and passed by and then it disappeared and that's when my friend was like wow I give you props for this one. Then she dropped me back off and left. She wasn't much help. I needed someone to have interest in it and explore this with me or I needed to get it on camera or something because I knew nobody would believe me if I told them. I just wanted evidence of what I was seeing. I then thought of my moms video recorder! I 1st went back to see if it was there and it was. So I went to go get my moms video recorder and I went back and tried recording it but it was hard to tell since it was dark out but it had the bottom lights on so you could see that part of the UFO. And I couldn't get the alien robot thing since it was off and it was dark. I then left. And I regret not doing anything else about it. I regret not doing more! further research or anything. Because I knew this was a once in a life time opportunity. I maybe be the 1st one to ever see this. Maybe nobody will believe my story.  I was indecisive on wether I should do a report on a UFO sighting page or something because what I seen was crazy and maybe nobody will believe me.  They will think its a joke or something. But what I seen was real and I may be the 1st one to ever see what I saw.  I may be the 1st on to have discovered another alien species from the galaxy.  Either way if my report files or not I know someday. Someone will come upon this.  Maybe in 4 years or 100 or 8 or 5,000 years but someday someone will rediscover this and everyone will see I was right.

This was the largest, brightest, meteor I’ve ever seen, and it appeared to travel in slow-motion compared to other meteors I’ve witnessed in the past. I counted the duration of the event as 10 seconds. For me, the meteor traveled from south to north, almost “into the harvest moon,” before disintegrating. It had a short, bright red tail and very large, brilliant white, spherical head.

Literally within 3 minutes, a storm came from nowhere.  As hard rain began to fall and the high winds caused all the trees around us to bend, we all turned back and headed for home. Upon our arrival home, my daughter and I ran into our home drenched.  Laughing, we ran into my husband who had been watching t.v.  We tell him to run and look outside.  It’s incredible how strong the winds are!  Just as he looks outside, my other daughter phones me and she sounds frightened over the phone.  “Mom, I’m scared…you won’t believe what I’m about to tell you.   As I drove home I saw a light I’ve never seen before.  It was a green/blue light that lit up the entire sky, but as it lit up the sky I felt a weird sensation in the car”.  She tells me she is out front of our home but too scared to get out of the car.  We open the door and just as I run to assist her out of the car, a greenish blue light electrified the Arizona sky with a sound that I can only describe as if a live wire hit water.  This light was seen 4 times in a 5 minute period. Although this storm didn’t last very long, the damage was quite severe.  As an Arizona Native for 49 years, I’ve never witnessed such a storm.  Later that evening I decided to catch the news as I was certain they would report what this green bluish light was.  There was nothing!  I immediately went to Google to see if anyone had witnessed what we did.  Sure enough, there were several stories posted.  One in particular caught my attention.  A gentlemen was on the outskirts of Arizona standing outside of his home when he saw something green.  What he described was something quite large in the shape of a ball with blue fire behind it. Another person who was on a military base said he and 2 other gentlemen witnessed this green lightening in the sky.  But they go on to say that they saw an object flying.  It didn’t have the regular white and red lights.  They said there were strange blue lights.  That this object gave off short circuits and arc sounds. The next morning, I called a friend to see if she saw any of this.  Unfortunately, she didn’t see anything as she was inside working.  So, I go back on Google to read her these stories I saw and read last night.  Oddly, I couldn’t find any of the stories I had read.  Not one!  Is it possible that someone removed all these?  I read these stories to my husband the night before…where are they now? It’s odd to me that suddenly I cannot find anything I read on Google that relates to what we witnessed.  Is it possible that these stories were removed?  By whom and why?  Our local news never reported any such sightings.  But I can tell you that both my girls spoke with co-workers who did witness the green lighting and the arc sounds. The United States seems to be having strange storms occurring, tsunami’s, earthquakes, etc….are these caused by UFO’s or our own Government, but something strange is definitely going on…",2015-09-17T00:00:00,33.5422,-111.9679

Noticed a green light coming from the West Mountains directly over Kennecott copper mine, heading east.  My friend and I noticed it and stopped where we were, and watched it come towards us.  I never heard a sound  coming from the craft  until it was almost directly above us.  The only sound I heard was a kind of buzzing or rumbling and you could almost feel it going right through you, sound that is.   Once it was directly above us we argued a little bit about how high it was and how big it was.  We both agreed it was probably somewhere between  500 to 1000 feet high.  I remember it was hard to gauge how high it was  because of its immense size.  We also guessed it to be about 1000 feet long and approximately 250 to 300 feet across.    There were three distinct separate cigar shaped crafts, not visibly or structurally joined but  moved as one vehicle the entire time.  Each one was separated from the other by about 25 to 50 foot spaces.  We lived in the flight path to Salt Lake international Airport, so I have seen planes come in fairly low, but I have never seen anything  close to this size in the sky, even down low.   I am guessing it took about 15 to 20 minutes for the craft to go from the Oquirrh mountains in the west to disappearing over the Wasatch Mountains to the east of the Salt Lake Valley,  Mountains in the west to disappearing over the Wasatch Mountains to the east of the Salt Lake Valley,  probably about 15 miles across.  It never changed speed or course and pretty much stayed the same color kind of a greenish blue to a bluish green.   After it disappeared over the Wasatch Mountains, we discussed some things in amazement and wondered what we have seen.    We started walking towards my friend's house again, when a friend of mine that was about a year older than me came down the street towards us pretty fast, and asked us if we had seen something In the sky.  We both said yes! and began talking to him about it, he said he was at a friend's house near Herriman, Utah, and had been chasing it towards the east until it disappeared over the Wasatch Mountains.   About a minute or two later a Salt Lake County Sheriffs car turn onto our street with its lights on, pulled up alongside the three of us and asked the same questions.  He stated  there have been several calls about it and he had also seen it for a short time but did not know what it was either.  This took place about 30 years ago and I do not remember much more.  I do remember talking about it with my mom and I do remember her saying that she had talked to several friends that either seen it or heard about it also.   My friend and I did not discuss it much either after that night and I had thought at one time I had probably just imagined the whole thing.  I ran into the same friend  about 10 years ago and we both kind of brought it up again then.  We both said kind of the same things about thinking we may have imagined it all these years, but after our discussion, we both remembered the same story  in detail.  Neither of us still have any idea of what we had seen but it was nice to get a little bit of confirmation from each other that it wasn't just something we imagined. Thanks for listening.  I hope there has been others that may have reported this.  I would like to hear their stories.  By the way even though the sheriff said there was multiple reports, we watched the local news for a couple of days, which is not something 15-year-old boys do and there was absolutely no reports.

Simply put – I was taking a series of pictures from the top of Skinner Butte, elevation 645 feet, in Eugene, Oregon.  One of my photos was zoomed into Autzen Stadium (Ducks) the others were of the downtown area.  There was quite a bit of haze from lingering fires on the horizon which made it difficult to take any quality photos. About an hour later I was viewing on my PC when I saw a disk – UFO – pretty clearly over and past the stadium.  I did not see or was aware of this object whatsoever when I took the picture. My camera is a new Sony Cybershot DSC-HX90V.  I had the zoom almost all the way out but was still able to capture a freeze shot at 1/320 of a second.  I was fortunate to have it on Program Auto mode with the ISO set to 80.  I used Cyberlink Photo Director to clean up the image by increasing the contrast and edging effect some.  With those simple adjustments it becomes quite obvious I have captured a large Saucer Disk.  You can use the cell tower to get an impression of the size as it is beyond that.  Maybe 60 feet long and 25 feet high. (That is purely speculative of course) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was outside the university watching the blood moon/super moon.  There were over 50 students present watching the moon.  It was still in the process of being covered since it was only about 10 pm.  I am a loner so I went to watch it alone on one of the benches meanwhile everyone else was sitting around 150 feet from me. There were 2 girls sitting on the other bench near mine to my left.  Everyone was preoccupied in their chatter and I was cold and bored with nothing much to do so I kept looking around.  The moon was to the right and so were the big crowd of students.  However when I looked to the left a very large aircraft went by.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing since I have lived near the airport for 18 years and am very aware how aircrafts look and could easily identify them at night.  This was different though since it was triangular in shape and upon closer inspection it was made of a black metallic object.  I thought I may be overexagerating which is why I I spoke up and asked the girl next to me if she thought the plane looked odd. I pointed the plane out to her and she agreed that it was in fact unlike anything she has seen before. I had my IPad in hand since I was taking pictures of the moon and quickly took pictures of the object. At the same time I was focusing on the sound it was sort of whizzing but it made no sense because there was no way you could hear an airplane in Salem.  It was a hard sound to make out because of the loud chatter and laughing of the students.  It was going too fast my camera couldn't focus so I tried to do the best I could go get one picture that could at least make out the light formation that I was seeing.  Although I could see the plane in decent detail my camera only picked up five lights in a triangular formation.  The sort of formation that birds use when migrating.  I could only get two pictures in poor quality because of how quickly it had happened.  I presume no one else saw it since there was no one freaking out like me or the girl next to me.  Eve yone was occupied looking the other way towards the moon.,2015-09-29T00:00:00,42.5195,-70.8967

My friend has also lived in R.I. all of his life, is self-employed and is also in good health.  We both go to the beach quite often as we live only 10 minutes away. On the night of Sunday, September 27, 2015, my friend and I went to the Narragansett Town Beach on Route 1A, in the state of Rhode Island, at approximately 8:30 p.m. to view the lunar eclipse taking place. The moon was perfectly positioned out over the ocean for this viewing.  The parking lot for the Narragansett Town Beach was a little more than half full of cars.  There were not as many people at the beach as I had anticipated.  My friend and I easily parked, and found a nice place on the sand to spread out our blanket.  We choose a spot between the South Beach Pavilion and the entry to the Town parking lot. We laid back, used rolled up blankets as pillows, and viewed the moon, and the stars, and watched the lights from boats in the Atlantic Ocean, and saw the lights from planes flying overhead in the night sky.  We pointed out somewhat faint and unspectacular shooting stars to each other; we saw 4 in total that shot a seemingly short distance across the sky, out over the ocean, and very soon disappeared. After laying back in the same position for so long, I felt the need to move to a new position.  The moon was only approximately ½ way into the eclipse, more or less. I did not check a clock when I was moving, so I can only judge the time, after my arrival to the beach, based on the approximate lunar eclipse progress. And so I sat up and turned, and as I did, I turned my head and torso towards the general direction of the parking lot as I moved.  The parking lot was behind us, and towards our right. A gold orb in the sky caught my attention.  Amazed, and jumping up to kneel in the sand, and without taking my eyes off the orb, I alerted my friend to the orb. Pointing in the correct direction, I said, “LOOK AT THAT! A GOLD ORB!  DO YOU SEE IT? DO YOU?”  He responded, “That’s not a plane.  Could it be a drone?”  I said, “ITS GOLD! DO YOU SEE GOLD?”  He replied, “Yes I do.” We had brought a red amateur telescope with us to view the moon.  He said, “Try to see it with the telescope.”  I grabbed it, and tried to see it, but this was not so simple for me because I have no experience using telescopes, and this is just a cheap telescope my grandmother was getting rid of, and gave to me, which I had never used.  Second, despite even the large size of the moon, trying to find the moon with this telescope and set the telescope in place, so we could take turns viewing, was hard for me and my friend. I quickly stopped searching through the telescope for the gold orb for these same reasons, and continued to watch the last few moments of the orb with my naked eyes instead. I observed the orb for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. It appeared to be a nearly perfect sphere. It was glowing the color of gold.  The center of it was the same color intensity as the edges of it. It was uniformly colored. It did not change color. It appeared bright, like it was emitting light. The emitting light was uniform across the entire orb.  The very edges of the orb along its fringe were well defined. I don’t know if the visible edge of the object was the object itself or if that was the edge of the light, either way it seemed fairly well defined. It did not appear to be lighting anything up around or beneath it that I could tell from where I was. It made no sounds that I noticed, but there were other people at the beach talking and watching the lunar eclipse, and the beach waves make their own sound, so these sounds may have interfered with my ability to detect additional sounds. I do not know if it was rotating, there was nothing discernable visually to me that would indicated that it was rotating or spinning. It was flying steadily and smoothly across the sky, neither slowing down, nor appearing to speed up. It traveled along in a horizontal path. It seemed to fly in a nearly straight line. It seemed to be flying in a linear direction. It did not seem to change course as it flew, except it might have gone on an ever so slightly more westward path than a northward one as it flew along, but this slight change in direction would be very difficult for me to be certain of without a compass. It seemed to be going towards the North, North-west. It did not appear to go higher or lower in the sky.  It was coming from my far left towards the general direction of my right, as I faced it. I was faced towards Route 1A with the Atlantic Ocean and the moon at my back. The flight path I saw the orb take appeared to begin towards the left side of Lake Canonche! t, past the general direction of Little neck Pond, towards the general direction of Pettaquamscutt Cove, until it flew out of my view. It appeared, from where I was, to be much larger than a star, and much smaller than the moon. I do not know how big it was or how far away it was. The best perspective I can offer is if I held up a softball, positioned it at arm’s length, and lined it up next to the flying gold orb in the sky, both the softball and the gold orb would have appeared to be nearly the same size if you stood next to me and then took a photograph. Some limitations of my observation are: I wear glasses, but did not have them on at the time. I am near sighted, with a astigmatism, but feel only a small improvement in my vision when I wear glasses, so small that I often go without them for just about everything. My friend does not wear glasses and has good eyesight.",2015-09-29T00:00:00,41.4501,-71.4495

After a few moments, my eyes started to wander off to the left (westward) towards the bike path that is provided to us by our municipality.   As I started to look that way, I noticed something in the sky.  I glanced up and instantly dropped my cigarette. Above the tree line on the bike path, there were two red objects hovering.  They glowed a bright red light and seemed to flash and change colors from red to white.   After a second or two of standing there, I ran inside to grab my iPhone so I could record this event.  I work in television production and have been around drones for a lot of that work.  I also fly weekly for my job.  I'm in and around planes and airports and have been for the last 12 years. These objects were not drones.  They were not planes. I took 2:30 mins of footage before my phone's battery started to die.  It was inside on the charger initially and was only around 5% charged when I took the footage. The two objects hovered for awhile, then one took off and flew away. Far away.  They were both pretty large at first.  Smaller than a full moon but much larger than a star.  The one that flew away though did eventually become small enough that it looked like a star. After a few more seconds, 20 maybe, the one that flew off - which was the one situated on the right hand side - reappeared on the left hand side, lower - again by the tree line and much larger. The two hovered again for about a minute. My phone was dying. I ran back inside to charge it and after a few minutes, I came back outside with my 3 year old son.  We recorded another 20 seconds of footage and he - though very young and being a child - was able to identify the object and you can hear his voice call it ""the flashing star"". I'm well educated. I work for a Fortune 500 company. I have a child and I'm an excellent father. I've been around drones and planes for my work. This was neither. My very first reaction was to run and grab a camera.  That wouldn't have been my reaction if I had ever seen anything like this before.  It's also important to note that Northfield is a very normal and pristine little borough outside of Atlantic City.  The area here is quiet and family oriented and filled with decent people.  This is not a hoax or a gimmick or some weird thing. I saw two UFO's.  These two objects hovered, flew, flashed bright red and appeared to travel great distances in very short time.  I have a video that is worth watching.

It then proceeded to move alone back the way they came (northwest, towards Irondequoit) after a couple of seconds it stopped and a 4th ball of light moved into view from behind trees heading in the same southwest route the original 3 were taking.   The now 2 orange lights moved in what looked like a parallel formation, with one leading just a little in front.

These were moving and orange.  The first two were about five degrees apart and the third back at ten degrees from the second and a little lower in the sky maybe by one or two degree.

Okay, have never seen anything odd/ufo-like until tonight.  I even got video because I’d been taking shots of the nearly full red moon.  Was only doing that because I’d been taking pics of fireworks going off in the area and noticed the moon.   Suddenly, I noticed this red/orange ball of light that was tracking across the sky sort of my direction and came from my line of sight to the moon.  Thought at first it would just die out as being the end of a firework.  Nope.  It stayed steady at first in its travel, although it seemed to be spinning.   I then thought maybe I’m seeing my first drone.  But the more I watched it literally seemed like fire causing the light, and yet I didn’t think a lantern would travel like this.  My eyes aren’t great, so I just filmed it come closer, not exactly going the same speed or evenly and then fly overhead past the overhang on my balcony… then I went back to taking pics of the moon. Maybe 2 minutes later (of course I had the camera put down by then), the sucker is back, traveling basically the exact same route.  Only I didn’t see how it GOT there.  Did not see it circle back around.  I was only able to capture some of the 2nd sighting on video. Was curious to see what I’d filmed, so instantly downloaded it to the computer.  Now, my camera takes excellent shots and the ones of the moon were a great example.  It wasn’t that large in the sky and yet I’m able to get the craters, all the features (and oddly, some other lights near the moon which I also couldn’t explain because they changed frame to frame and I don’t think satellites move that fast).   Anyway, the fireball was definitely fire inside.  It appeared to be inside something and that something would rotate end over end and or sideways.  I captured the texture of the outside and its freaking weird.  The word ‘blob’ comes to mind, but there were kind of like puffy layers to it and I strongly believe the fire part only came out of one end, which had sort of a torn appearance.   From the movement, no way was it a lantern or it would’ve caught fire and gone down quickly – certainly wouldn’t have returned either.  From the video I feel like I saw something that belonged in the ocean, except it was fire-propelled and in the sky for anyone to see.",2015-07-06T00:00:00,41.8044,-88.347

We could feel a large amount of energy that made all ((deleted--2nd woman's)) hair stand on end and cause ((deleted--1st woman)) to be nauseous. We looked at each other with wide eyes, and both said simultaneously, “What the hell is that?”  Then a very bright white light appeared outside the window.  The light seemed very low…barely clearing the top of the 2 story hotel.  It was angled down toward the ground.  We thought it was finished going over, but then a second round of the very loud bass sound began crossing the ceiling.  We determined that there were either 2 objects or on very large object with 2 engines.  There was no light accompanying the second sound. Things that were hanging in the room were swaying.

At first I thought it was the sun but it had already set. Also, the sphere seemed to be self illuminated.  Upon assessing the estimated distance from my vantage point to the object, the sphere appeared to be approximately 9 or 10 feet in diameter and highly reflective which seemed strange, as at the same time it seemed to be self illuminated. As it appeared to be rising slowly from the pond my first hypothesis was that it was a mylar balloon, but after watching it for about 10 seconds I came to the conclusion that it was a) too large, b) too bright, and c) it seemed like hard metallic object, not mylar.  I would also like to note that it was self illuminating as bright as the setting sun would be, but as I previously stated the sun had already set.

Note:  I know the exact time and events because I recorded it all on my phone's notes. At 0:44 in the morning my friend sent me a message about how he just saw a odd light that changes color from time to time on the sky and is not moving.  I went to my balcony, and noticed it on my left side, glowing green and would sometimes become red. The object moved slightly right and I noticed i see it better and brighter if i don't look directly into it. At 1:02 AM i noticed another light above the first one, and they slightly faded out and would only flash up for a milisecond in perfect synchronization with each other. At 1:04 AM, I noticed there are at least 4 of them making a accurate rhombus on my left, and we're mostly green. 1:08 AM, I accidentaly aimed my phone's lighted up screen (i was communicating with my friend about this) at the lower light of the now not moving rhombus. The (green) light instantly started flashing red extremely quickly.  I moved the phone away and it stopped. I repeated this 3 times, always the same result.  (So i assume they have light perception similiar to us)  Soon after i tried pointing my phone's light at the (now red) light, it started to slowly move out of the rhombus and started getting closer and closer to my home (or in this case, 4 floor residential building).  I could clearly see a small, pale red light always going behind the bigger red light that was coming closer to me. Slowly, at 1:20 AM it completely went out of my sight because of my balcony's roof.  The other 3 we're somehow harder to see, usually white likr they are trying to pretent they are stars, but very bright and would become red for a few seconds sometimes. 1:21 AM, the 3 lights dissappeared, and the one that was hidden from my sight by my balcony roof could be seen again at my right, slowly changing from red to white and sometimes green. 1:25 AM, it is still right of me, slowly moving left and made a blue flash of light. Until 1:48 AM the random activity continued and the light would mostly change colors every few seconds to a minute.  It suddenly flashed a dim white, red then white again light. There we're a few small flashes later on, but nothing noteworthy. At 2:22 AM the lights dissappeared. I decided to stay for some time, see if anything happens. Finally, at 3:04, the biggest event happened.  A bit left of me, at least 7 lights appeared and slowly spread out. A several more light appeared at the same spot and also spread out covering a huge part of the sky.  They rearranged into a odd position, making 3 lines consisting of 3 lights, one line left, two in the center, and above and right of them making random shapes.  They didn't move later on, and we're mostly just green, occasionaly flashing red.

The light did not brighten the sky as a whole, just a remote area that was about double the size of a typical full moon.

It was to the left and below the sun's high noon arc.  This made it impossible to capture on camera or video, it was a very bright and sunny day.   The object appeared to be within our atmosphere and its size was approximately equal to that of a silver dollar from my vantage point.  The orb appeared to have at least 2 bands (forming a plus symbol), which surrounded its outer shell.  Those bands appeared to have several dark spots, or port holes.  The most comprehensible description of this object would be very similar to 2 of our modern observatory's attached together to form a ball, while adding an additional band to that circumference. Object never appeared to move and was far brighter than sun.  It appeared to be a blue-white orb of light, very much like the white flame of an extremely high powered torch.  I used field binoculars and a telescope, in an attempt to view the orb, but the combined brilliance of it and the sun made that impossible also. I was able to clearly view the object for 15 minutes before minor clouding eventually moved across field of view.  The object was gone upon the clouds passing.

I live close to the local airport, so my first thought was that it was a small plane in a landing pattern, but realized that this was a single bright orangish colored light rather than the bright white landing light or the smaller red and green navigation lights on planes.   I then thought that maybe it was a helicopter but again eliminated that for the same reason.  The sky was perfectly clear so there were no clouds to get a good reference of how high or far away the light may have been but I felt like it was maybe a thousand feet up and maybe a mile or so away.  I heard no sound that would be associated with a plane or helicopter, but again I really wasn't sure how far away the light really was.  As the light traveled slowly towards the south it got smaller and higher in the sky until it disappeared.  I don't think it blinked out but rather just got out of my sight due to the distance.  I was able to see it for about 5 minutes.

Driving home on Hwy EE, heading North/West, with my wife following me in car behind me, when saw Red Light straight ahead of me.  We were 1/2 mile from private road we live on.   The light appeared several times brighter than what you see on close fly over from a helicopter.   We turned onto our road heading north; the object was to our left and getting larger.  I drove 1/8 mile and stopped 100 feet before my driveway got out of my car to try to identify object.   My wife stopped behind me and watched object while staying in car.  While looking towards the North, the object went by from West to East.  At its closest point object was 45 degrees up in the sky while looking towards North and was Red Glow (call it red glow at this point for too big to be a light) around 1/2 size of the moon.  It was 9:15PM, Sun had set but still dusk out, mostly clear, warm and humid, and moon was out.  There was no wind and Silent.  The locusts were done for the day and night life noise hadn't started yet.  While watching object pass by did not hear anything, had the impression it was close for the size of the Red Glow, but really didn’t know.  Appeared to be moving at the speed of what a helicopter would be moving that would be between 1/8 to 1/4 mile away.  I know this for Defence Contractor called Emerson has a Resort Compound 1 mile to the north west of my home and has a large helicopter that transports people to and from the St. Louis Facility that flies by my house.   While watching the Object head away from us to the East, when it was at 30 degree angle the Red Glow flickered out (off, on, off).  While looking at the spot, it flickered out I saw what appeared at first to look like an Oval Shape Gray Cloud about the size of 3 full moons lined up side by side.   I stared at it for a few seconds and the Oval Shape Object then started to slowly descent straight down below the tree line.  I was able to watch the descent for 5 seconds.   I know the woods go back about 1/2 mile so the object, if didn’t land in woods, was at leas! t 1/2 mile or further away.  Looking that direction beyond the 1/2 mile is a mix of woods and open fields up to 2 1/2 miles away before you come to a road with some houses on it.  I think the object was at least 1/2 mile away for the distortion from humid evening takes away any detail that may have been seen, just like looking at large buildings in distance or distant hill and all you see is a gray shade.  At 1/2 mile away I think it would be many times bigger than a house.   I calculated that it took 15 seconds from time object past me to the time the Red Glow flickered out at 1/2 mile away would have made it traveling approximately 120 miles an hour.  If 1 mile away than 240 miles an hour and 2 miles away 480 miles an hour.   When it quit glowing red I was looking at the Oval Shape Object at 30 degree angle so I was looking at a side view, so would not know the actual shape of the Object.   Looking back on this Encounter watching the silent red glow go by was impressive and unexplainab! le, but seeing the physical object after red glow flickered out leaves me with no doubt what so ever UFO’s are for real.   I got little sleep that night trying to understand what my wife and I saw, why could not hear nothing, how big it could have been, how fast it was going, and did anyone else see it.",2015-09-02T00:00:00,38.9905,-90.7789

When I realized there was no valid explanation for these lights, I dashed to the house and began to yell and bang on the living room window to get my 2 kids to come outside and see.  I turned on my iPhone 5S and began to record.  Unfortunately it did not pick up anything, except for the sound where my 13 year old daughter says, ""I am so confused.""   My daughter, son and myself stood in shock as we witnessed these lights/orbs just sitting in the northern sky.  We were throwing out ideas as to what these lights could be. Fireworks and Chinese lanterns are not a possibility as all of these lights seemed to be connected like it was one extremely large craft and the lights were not moving by the force of air/wind, nor were they falling so space debris or falling stars are not options either. When the lights ""went out"" we stood outside for minutes looking for them to reappear somewhere.  After a few minutes, we all came inside and we each drew a picture of what we had witnessed. We did not speak about it beforehand and I told them we would not discuss until after we drew what we seen and compared drawings.  Needless to say, the 3 drawings are nearly identical. From that night forward, I have spent quite a bit of time outside at night looking in the sky.  When I used search engine to see if anyone else had witnessed this, I came across this website which have way too many similar sightings reported but none on that night.  I can also tell you I witnessed a few more very strange occurrences since that night.   I am puzzled as to what all this could be.  There are no local Air Force bases that I can think of for this to be explained.  Besides, these lights were way to big and not moving at all for these to be explained with what we know about today with aviation and Gravity.",2015-09-02T00:00:00,39.935,-75.9632

I then noted in my peripheral vision another bright object in the northern sky, at about 70 degrees elevation.  Initially, I assumed it was Jupiter, being yellow-white in color and bright, but this object’s magnitude (brightness) was actually somewhere between Jupiter and Venus when I looked directly at it.  Then I realized that Jupiter/Venus had been in conjunction in the western sky lately and could not be the object.  I am also familiar with the appearance of stars, other planets, and the time of year they are visible. This was different, in that the object appeared as a steady orb and to my surprise was moving downward in a northerly linear/ballistic direction with relation to the building overhang.  There might have been some slight wobble side to side, but being familiar with auto- kinesis, I could not rule this out as the cause.   I looked to see if the object had any lesser peripheral lighting such as aircraft position/navigation or anti-collision lights, but none were apparent.  I thought it strange if this was a landing light of an airplane that it is usually not totally and consistently visible at that angle when moving away (plus it tends to waiver due to aircraft movement and atmospherics).  I could not tell the exact altitude of the object, but it seemed as high as an aircraft might traverse or maybe even higher.  It was visible while moving for perhaps 20 seconds before disappearing behind a cloud and not re-emerging on either side.  Frankly, for lack of a better description, it! reminded of the scenes from the movie “Close Encounters of a Third Kind”, which depict the spacecraft crisscrossing the sky at altitude, albeit in this case at a little slower speed.  A friend suggested that it might have been a commercially available drone flown by an individual, but it seems unlikely as it was at least at about 2-3 thousand feet in altitude in order to pass behind the prevailing cumulus clouds (which were forming about 1-2 thousand feet at the time), and they would have probably lost track and control of it.  Additionally, the lighting was not pinpoint, diode, or laser like. Strangely, no noise was noted, which would usually be heard from an aircraft/airliner, as the back side of the building is normally quiet. Furthermore, the closely adjacent low mountain ridge (only a couple of hundred feet away) and our building form sort of a bowl for collecting sound.  Surface winds were light and would not have distracted much from any sound. I also thought maybe it could be a weather balloon being illuminated at high altitude where the sun was still striking it, since it was only 2020 and the sun sets later in summer, so I cannot totally rule this out.  I do not know what the prevailing high altitude winds were at the time.  However, I do recall when I previously observed such balloons and even satellites in the past, that they tend to oscillate in brightness due to the changing sun reflection off the envelope or shifting hard surfaces. This is the first time I have experienced something like this in all my 58 years and believe that if others in the east Oahu area of Hawaii Kai (City & County of Honolulu) were looking in the same direction at the same time, they would have easily seen it.  I am contemplating contacting the Honolulu Star Advertiser local newspaper on this matter to see if any others reported this.  I now have a greater appreciation for those who say they didn’t have time to take a photo or get other witnesses, as I was just outside my apartment and briefly contemplated rushing to get my wife and son to come out, but now realize that if I had done so, it would not have been in time and I would have missed part of the event. With respect to my background, I have a past that includes aviation (private pilot single engine land & sea rating, licensed FAA aircraft mechanic with ratings for airframe & powerplant, former FAA air traffic controller Tower trainee, including National Weather Service observer training, did some aviation accident investigation for worldwide aircraft insurers through AirClaims in Hawaii & Alaska, and have a bachelor’s degree in Aviation Administration from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University-which included coursework in flight physiology).  I have also been an avid amateur astronomer since childhood, having built and owned various telescopes and taken several formal college level courses in the subject (including astrophotography). I most recently worked the last 23 years as an acute inpatient psychiatric RN at a major hospital in Honolulu after getting my nursing degree.  I also completed some graduate level education in nursing. Given the aforementioned, I believe that I am somewhat familiar with aerial and astronomy phenomena and have been able to be clinically objective in my appraisal of anything I have seen, but this episode was unusual and unexplained.

He had tickets to attend the Hollywood Bowl Friday 8/21 to see the rock band Heart. We arrived around 6:30pm and sat at his box seats in the garden section in time to eat our picnic dinner before the 8pm showtime. Just before 8pm I was looking around because I have only been to the Hollywood Bowl once before and I was excited to be there again. Behind me was a half moon in the SSW sky. By now the sky was dark but it was a clear night and the weather was perfect. A bit cool but I was comfortable wearing a sweatshirt and long pants. Just before the show began I happened to look up. There were Klieg lights crisscrossed right above the stage where they intersected creating a giant ""X"". My eyes followed them to where they met above in a crystal clear sky and I was amazed to see this UFO!  It was right above the ""X"" of lights and stationary. I could clearly see two round red lights to the right and two round green lights to the left. I could not see a craft but I felt the lights were part of the same structure. It was about the size of my thumbnail held at arms length. I was amazed. It was so obvious that I wondered if anyone else saw it. By 8pm the Hollywood Bowl conductor Thomas Wilkins took the stage and led us in the National Anthem. Afterwards he introduced the first act before they took the stage. I could not keep my eyes off this UFO. I wanted to watch the show but could not help looking up. Then it dawned on me to take some video with my iPhone 5c. I lined up the image and hit record. This is when I recorded the first video at 8:07pm. I recorded the second video at 8:08 which was zoomed in to the lights and gives you a good idea of how it looked. Since it was shot with an iPhone at night it is a bit blurry. I have submitted two very short videos of the object as well as a still shot. You can hear the conductor in the background speaking to the audience in the videos. The unusual thing for me was that I was sure I recorded at least 10 minutes of video but when I looked later I realized I only captured less than 20 seconds between the two videos. I use video all the time so I was very surprised this happened. I must say I was VERY excited because I have seen UFO's in CA before but they were not this impressive. I almost felt as if this thing was watching us. I must admit I was also a bit nervous and tried to pass the lights off as a drone or balloon yet it was neither one of those. It was stationary most of the time right above my head, facing North about halfway up the sky. Because It was above me I had to strain my neck to watch it sitting there. After a while my neck hurt so I began watching the show instead. When I looked back up again I was surprised to see it gone! I searched the sky and saw it moving toward the NNW horizon. It was moving rather fast but as I watched it, it stopped, again I felt it knew I saw it. I got goose bumps. This is when I thought I recorded another 10 minutes of it. Just below the lights in the WNW are large trees and through the trees I saw a strobe light flashing on & off. I thought it odd but it could be manmade, the object was heading in that direction. After about 10 more minutes it fell behind the trees and that was the last I saw of it. It was in the sky for about 45 minutes!  I feel it was too large to be a drone and the fact that it stopped and started on it's own would rule out a balloon. Also the eerie feeling I got watching it watching me was uncanny. There was a sellout crowd at the Bowl that night and I wonder if anyone else saw what I recorded. I went on the internet to see if anyone had posted anything on Youtube and found this video which is very close to what I saw. It also was shot in CA so maybe what I saw was indeed a UFO. You can watch that video here http://youtu.be/JRr3bFWfO6o  Thank you for your time.",2015-09-02T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

My experience took place on August 22nd, 2015, at about 2:00am in Newport, Oregon.  My husband and I were sitting on the balcony of our fourth story hotel room, enjoying each other and the ocean.  I saw what appeared to be a shooting star appear from the side of our hotel and said, ""Look!  A shooting star,"" so my husband saw it also.   After a second, I realized it was white and disc shaped.  It appeared to be smaller and a whole lot closer, maybe about the elevation a drone would have been at.   It was angled downward and slightly towards the ocean as it slowly fell.  We kept watching as it as it changed angles and speed, darting directly parallel to the ocean.   As it continued to travel, it slowed again making a boomerang type movement, then darted up to the shore.  It was nearly directly in front of my hotel room and approximately 3 feet above the ocean, it moved slowly back and forth over a few feet of length directly parallel to the shoreline.  It appeared to fade in and out of vision a few times, then reappear a short distance ahead of where it was.  It was as if it kept travelling the same speed and distance, but was fading in and out.   Directly underneath, it appeared 3 beings with white faces that appeared to glow.  They were very visible, even in the dark. After about a minute, the disc disappeared, but the beings remained, and they were directly aligned. From the fourth floor I could not judge size exactly.  These beings had dark bodies, it was easy to see their movements.  They would bend down to the sand, or sit down, then get back up, all at the same time.  They stayed in formation, most times a line, and pretty soon they multiplied.  Nothing flew in or out, they just appeared. 3 became 6, 6 became 8 and at final count there were about ten.   My husband had decided to go out and see up close what was there.  I watched as he made his way down to the ocean.  The beings appeared to become smaller, my husband said he saw that as well.  He said there was a strange energy as he got closer to them.  What he saw were about 10 large birds that were not sea birds.  He was able to walk up closely to them, but they did not startle.  He then shooed them, and they flew off.  When he did that, from the fourth floor, I was able to see that as soon as they moved they were flying.  That means if anything would have flown into view, I would have seen it clearly. I am not looking for scrutiny or publicity, so I would really appreciate if this post could be kept confidential.  This event lasted about 40 minutes in total, but i did not want to take my eyes off of them to go and get a camera.  I figured they could have vanished any minute and I wanted to see as much as I could.  I have additional details that I did not put in this report.

((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the lights were part of an advertising display at a nearby gambling casino.  .  PD)) I was leaving work and walking to my car, which can be seen in the lower left of some of the pictures:  the silver colored Chevy Volt. While it looked like the moon was shining through some clouds (it was overcast that evening), the shape of the lights caught my attention: they looked disc shaped and they didn't appear to be moving or changing shape which is what you'd expect them to be doing if it was the moon shinning through clouds:  as the clouds move, the moonlight shining through them will change shape too... but the shape of these lights didn't change for as long as I was watching them, which was approximately 5 minutes. My first thought was that it was just the moon poking through some clouds and so I fired up the star-chart app on my smartphone, and sure enough the app indicated that that's approximately where the moon was located.  But... the next night (or it might have been a couple of nights after) it was clear outside and as I was leaving work -- at approximately the same time as before ( 9 pm) --, I noticed that the moon was nowhere near where I had seen that strange series of lights, it was approximately 20 degrees higher up in the sky. In fact, upon paying closer examination to some  of the pictures I took, I can make out exactly where the moon was that night: the moon's directly above the storage building, it's in the top 1/3 of the picture and looks like a bright dot of light (my car is in the lower left), and you can see that the disc-shaped anomaly is much lower in the sky, and from where I took the picture it appears directly above the rh side of the storage building off in th! e distance.  From where I was standing ** at the entrance to RFA Engineering and looking south **, the disc-shaped light anomaly didn't appear to be moving or changing shape. I thought it might be spotlights too, but as you can see there's no spotlights shinning up at the disc-shaped anomaly. After observing it in the RFA parking lot, I wanted to try to snap some pictures where there was less light pollution, and so I drove over to the nearby Wells Fargo and snapped a picture from the parking lot there -- the disc-shaped anomaly still had the same shape as before and didn't appear to be moving. Because my smartphone star chart app told me that that's where the moon was -- and as I already mentioned, the app was wrong (because I hadn't calibrated my phone's compass before using the app) --, I just dismissed what I was seeing as a curious play of moonlight and really slow moving clouds. But why would the moon only illuminate this one particular bank of clouds and not anything else, especia! lly considering that the moon was so much higher up in the sky. I was really intrigued, and if I hadn't dismissed it as the moon poking through the clouds I probably would have paid much closer attention to the disc-shaped anomaly, including trying to take better pictures of it, and I would have watched it for a much longer period of time. After dismissing it as the moon poking through some clouds -- which it turns out that it couldn't have been --, I left for home. What I saw is a dead ringer for what other people witnessed on August 9th, 2015 in the southern Minneapolis metro area.

I said ""look at that flock of birds or maybe it's ducks.""   My husband responded ""that can't be birds, they're too big for birds.""  The formation was kind of round to the left and gradually & sparsely dwindling to the right, kind of like the tail.  The formation was made up of black shapes, some large, some larger and some smaller.  Their shapes were bigger on one rounded end than the other rounded end and the sides were straight lines.  Some of these shapes were moving and the smaller ones in the tail section were fading. So, right before Clovis Ave, the winery storage tanks cut off their view until you're almost under the overpass.  At that point the sky opened up again and the shapes converged into a larger mass (left) that still had the shapes, but they now were much darker and they were NOT moving, but kind of hovering in the air (the tail, for lack of a better word, had disappeared).  It is hard to describe in words, but easier to describe verbally.  I think it was kind of hard to look at, meaning hard to describe something that made ""no sense!""   They disappeared again because of the freeway embankment, but my husband said we'll catch them at Hwy 41 where the road climbs and the embankment disappears.

Thursday October 8, 2015.  At 10:05 am, my wife and I were traveling on Freeway 180, between Fowler and Clovis Avenues, about a mile south of Fresno-Yosemite airport in rural Fresno, CA.   In the clear sky about what we thought to be  a mile or two west of the airport, out of our front window we saw about thirty to forty black objects maybe more stretching across the sky. We viewed them for about ten seconds until our line of sight was blocked by huge winery tanks off the freeway.  As an estimate this fragmented formation could have been up to a mile in length moving across the sky in a slow hovering motion.  The largest body of the grouping was closest to us and narrowing down in size as it distanced away.   My first impression was a mass parachute dropping near the airport?  A few seconds later driving past the tanks the sky opened,  and again we saw them but now they were clumped together in a tighter formation.   After again losing sight as the freeway dropped behind the trees I rushed ahead for about a minute, to where the freeway was above the trees giving us a full view of the north west  sky.  To our amazement there was nothing, only helicopter circling above and a black SUV off the freeway with the two occupants looking up with one pointing to the western sky.  I assure you these were no parachutes or birds, but something I have never witnessed before.   If my judgment of distance was correct they had to be at least the size of a small airplane.  If they were actually farther away they were then much larger.  This formation was not like one you would normally see displayed by an air force flight but that of a semi-scattered group in closer proximity to each other but yet looking fragmented and not necessarily pointed in exactly the same direction.   Trying to determine their shape and size was a bit confusing as they first appeared to be more square on the left end and sloping down on the right.  Like a fat eyebrow to even perhaps a delta look, but their shapes, though seeming somewhat uniform, were not.  Trying to get my mind to focus on them was strange to say the least, as if they were trying to change bits of their shapes as I watched.   I called the airport tower spokesman asking if they had seen anything as such and he said he wasn’t on duty this morning and there was no report.  The Tower spokesman then gave me the number to the UFO center and encouraged me to call.   I am a 1967-69 Army veteran and retired fire captain and have never before witnessed such a sight.

Along the ride, I noticed with deep compassion the moon’s beauty.  The ride home took me no more than 10 minutes. I parked my scooter onto the drive-way, noticed my father had company over, open the garage with a garage door remote located in Parents’ car.  I remained in my room from the moment I got home until 9:45, when the last of my father’s company returned to their vehicles parked outside.  While I was in my room I visited and engaged with several websites as well as read several articles pertaining to what time the lunar eclipse would be occurring and was under the impression that I would not settle myself outside until around 1am on the 28th (when I thought the eclipse would start as stated in the articles that I read).  After I was assured that each of my father’s guests had left, I made my way onto the back patio to take a quick glimpse of the moon and was shocked to find out that the eclipse ha! d already started.  More than half of the moon was submerged in darkness and only a small quarter of light on its right (my right) remained visible I quickly returned inside to retrieve my notepad, phone, glasses and a thin sweater. I retuned outside and positioned myself facing east towards the eclipse, where I sat for approximately 15 minutes.  During this time I was able to note at most 3 airborne objects (what I believed to be ordinary planes) taking steady course across the sky.  A final craft (4th) rose above from behind the trees in my backyard in a motion I can describe as STAIGHT UP but NOT  TOWARDS the NORTH. I did not focus on the object until it made a complete STOP well above the trees.  The object was sitting plainly in the CLEAR night sky, with a sliver of light from the reflecting moon.  The object, which I no longer thought could be a plane, had the same pattern of lights one of the three previous airborne objects that I noted in about the sky. A CONSTANT BLUE BASE LIGHT ACCOMPANIED BY ALTERNATING WHITE AND RED LIGHTS ON EITHER SIDE. My focus was transfixed on the airborne object and I remained a spectator until fear overcame me due to the unnerving sounds that were coming just off from the left side of the patio (my mother near the trash).  During the period I remained present, the airborne craft moved horizontally to the west*right (A maneuver that to my knowledge, present day crafts were incapable of maneuvering) then horizontally to the east*left and finally centered itself back to where it had originally STOPPED.  This horizontal motion occurred at least twice before I rushed into my home to call the first person that I could show while the airborne object was still in the air in its STOP motion. My mother, was the first person I made contact with after the sighting and I asked her to come outside and witness the airborne object.  SHE DID SEE THE OBJECT IN THE SKY located above the trees and at that time it was in its STOPPED motion.  I made her wait with me as we starred at the object that was STILL (nonmoving)   in the sky.  I was hoping the craft would maneuver horizontally as it did before, for my mother’s witness, but it did not motion at all while I and my mother were both gazing at the airborne object.  She attempts to assure me that it was “just a plane going in an SLOW upward motion”. I attempted to bring forth other spectators such as my little brother and older sister, while my mother remained watching the airborne object in the sky. I returned to the patio no more than 1 minute later, while the object was (to our eyes) ini the same area I initially spotted it doing its STOP motion.  My mother told me that the craft had simply “continued its upward motion” whi! ch would still have been visible to see because the clear and open sky.  My mother returned inside to report the news that “I THOUGHT I saw a UFO”, sharing a laugh with my older sister and my little brother.  I then pulled my little brother outside in spite of the current ridicule and attempted to tell him by words and pointing where I and mother had seen the object and I attempted to describe to him about the horizontal motions I witnessed. My brother made his final remarks and returned inside, siding at the end to ridicule me along with the rest of my family. I remained outside hoping that the object would return to its positioning but to no avail. I started my voice recording of the sighting.

The three circular crafts moved rapidly in looping patterns around each other, behaving erratically and flashing yellow and orange before departing in a straight line directly behind each other. The UFOs were witnessed in the eastern skies at a hill in Benedictine Park in New Hampshire–they caught my attention with what I thought was a camera flash.   I continued to watch them as then made wide loops and diagonal lines around each other, speeding up and slowing down while giving off bright flashes of yellow and orange lights before dimming again.  I could hear many others noticing and commenting on the UFO's as time passed, trying to get a better look.  Some flashes were very bright and others weren’t so dramatic.  Their pattern of flight was very irregular until they began to travel away, moving in a single-file line very close to each other. The crafts rapidly sped up and took off beyond the treeline.  It may have not been related, but there were loud booming and rumbling sounds right after the crafts sped up that lasted for about 15 seconds.  There were two planes that traveled nearby the crafts immediately before the UFO's lined up and left. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

The location I observed these objects was one half mile west of the Marathon Oil Refinery located in Garyville, Louisiana.  I was parked at a local salvage yard on highway 61 facing south.   These objects began rising from the distant tree line due south of me at a distance of approx. 12 to 15 miles.   The objects were flickering in and out of various magnitudes, the brightest being close to the planet Jupiter at present time.  I ruled out the possibility of aircraft or balloons due to the lack of navigation or beacon lights on the objects and the speed at which they were moving.   Also the objects seemed to be interacting with each other, flying a pattern that indicated some type of control and deliberate change in direction as they ascended.  They were orange in color however, some of them did transition into more of a reddish hue.   As they rose they were following each other, all moving in the same general direction and then flying towards and then away from each other in an eccentric pattern. at times they seemed to cross each other.

My dad related this story many times over the years. I will relay it as accurately as possible. In 1970  Dad was a city police officer in the small town in southeastern, Ky.  He was on duty one night when he received a radio call from the only other officer on duty to meet.  The other officer was patrolling the other side of town. They subsequently met and the other officer told my father that he was very tired, and didn’t think he could stay awake any longer.  Dad told him to go get a nap and he would cover his patrol.  He told him to go to what at the time was an open field just outside town. He told the other officer to head that way and he would follow him to make sure he found the place and made it ok. While following him in his own patrol car, they both noticed a bright light appear in the sky ahead of them.  It grew steadily brighter and it became clear that it was heading toward them.  Dad yelled over the radio, “It’s going to hit you!”  He said he was sure it was going to take the lights off his partner’s car, however it just missed.  The object flew over behind a line of trees and landed.  All this time, they were talking back and forth over the radio. They stopped, got out and begin to approach the object.  My father told many times how frightening this was, and how when his partner drew his weapon he was shaking so bad he could hear the bullets rattle in the cylinder.  Dad told him to put it away before he let it off and hurt one of them, and that it would most likely be of no use. They approached within 35-40 yards of the object.  It was sitting flush on the ground.  There was no apparent landing gear.  It was discus (Olympic) shaped, about 25-30 feet wide, and 15 feet or so thick at the center.  It made no sound.  It omitted mostly white light from the entire object very much like a fluorescent light bulb, however there were different colors swirling within.  They were about to try to get closer when it lifted up completely silently above the tree tops, paused for moment and then took off in a flash straight up and out of sight. They decided not to make a formal report out of fear they would not be believed and be ridiculed. He said the “strangest” part of the entire incident was while they were talking car to car when they first sighted the object, dispatch never heard any of it, and in fact wanted to know why neither of them had been responding.

I was possibly abducted. Firstly I did not see a UFO I contacted one.  I was lying in bed thinking about the transporter system on the fictional starship Enterprise and after comparing it to other technology  I thought that perhaps they can do it and if they can they must have starships.  It was at this point that I spoke out loud and said, captain kirk, if your really up there,and you can really move matter around, can I at least have my front tooth back. I went to sleep and when I went into the bathroom in the morning.  I looked in the mirror and seen that my front tooth was restored and I remembered what I had asked the night before and to this day I still feel overwhelmed by what happened. I have given the incident much thought over the last 2-3 years and I think that it is a possibility that they heard me  because I was on a harbour at the time and said (captain), and the place where I was staying was an old hotel called ( the Anchor) and the organization running the old hotel as a hostel was the salvation army and among their ranks they have  a (captain). So what I am saying is that there must be some kind of surveillance systems that links up information that has similar content and passes that information on to related people. And yes after this happened to me I believe that captain kirk is a real person, and perhaps he always was and the secret about him and the starship got out and the powers that be made up star trek to cover the truth.  What I now know for sure is that  all sound  especially words are being monitored by persons unknown and they definitely have the power to move matter around. When I asked out loud for captain kirks help someone answered and gave me back my front tooth.  But the question now is do you believe me and what do you think.

I am a very open minded person who intelligently considers various explanations before coming to a conclusion. On multiple occasions from 2013-2014 I personally have witnessed flying crafts and orbs of light that linger, glide closely overhead and abruptly change direction then accelerate and speed off into the distance.  Front Royal, Va, has a lot of airplane activity daily and is not uncommon because there is a small airport in the town.  I KNOW the difference! Especially growing up in Washington, DC, where we have planes flying over almost every 15 mins.   I am currently back in the DC area and have furthermore verified that what I was seeing was not a manmade craft or hoax.  That town is in the Shenandoah valley and fairly secluded.  It definitely needs to be investigated if only for a week or two.  I assure you that a sighting will be made.  The most disturbing sighting was on a cloudy night as I was on my front porch smoking a cigarette.  A dull metallic object caught my eye as I looked up at the sky as I often did to appreciate the view of the stars.  We don't get a great view here in the city so I made a point every night to enjoy the beauty.  As I looked up, as God be my witness no more than 30 ft directly above my head was a cigar shaped metallic craft gliding completely silent over my head then behind my house.   I rushed cigarette still in hand which is odd because there is no smoking allowed in my home to the back deck to find the object nowhere in sight.  I was petrified to say the least.  Usually I would see multiple orbs of light far up in the sky,but this was literally right above me and absolutely NO NOISE. It was enough to keep me awake for nights on end and for me to be writing this message.  I always wondered if they would come, logically we can not be the only ones out there in our universe.

Approximately 3:30 am on 8-23-2015, Sunday Morning, Paradise Valley, Arizona, I work as a Protection Specialist (bodyguard) for a wealthy family that lives at the base of Camelback Mountain in Paradise Valley, Arizona.  Currently I work the night shift and conduct night patrols around the perimeter of the property.  Here in Arizona the desert nights are very still with a sky that is crystal clear, the stars are amazing.  It’s so quiet that I hear the small desert rats rustling in the low lying bushes as I walk by them.  I have even walked up upon a bobcat stretched out on a nearby wall. Sunday morning, I was about half way finished with my patrol.  I was walking down a path on the side of the house and had my flashlight out shining it into a dark corner of the house. Right then, a bright flash from above caught my attention.  The strange thing was that I only saw the flash with my left eye as if something was trying to get my attention, although nothing lit up around me.  Another strange occurrence was that I knew to look straight up into the sky.  The light caused the hairs on the back of my neck to instantly rise up. I stopped and looked straight up to see a round bright ball of light above me.  After looking at it for about 30 seconds it disappeared, then moved to the right and lit up again. It was moving slow and methodical.  It was going way to slow to be a falling star or satellite.   As I watched this thing move, it was as if I was trying to talk myself out of what I was witnessing.  When it would reappear it looked as if it was falling a bit and then would stop.  I served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where I have witnessed flares, and this was not a flare, but when it would appear it looked like it was falling like a flair, then would stop, stay still then go dark and move to the northeast.   During the entire time of watching it, I tried to convenience myself that it was something I could explain, until I watched it do something very peculiar. After observing the object for about 5 minutes while it moved slowly to the Northeast towards Fountain Hills, it did a button hook maneuver to the left and headed in the opposite direction of travel.  Almost instantly after the button hook, it conducted another 180 degree turn just as fast and headed towards the Northeast again.  I watch it for about another 2 minutes and then it disappeared. It was something I could not explain.   To remind you this was the area of the famous Phoenix lights.  Camelback Mountain was a prime observation point for people here in the Valley that witnessed the Phoenix lights.

The Moon, which sat high in the WSW sky, was shrouded by the low clouds and cast a diffuse glow.   A couple of minutes later, due south and about 30 degrees above the horizon, another diffuse light appeared behind the clouds.  It was white and looked similar to how the Moon looked, but it was a little smaller in diameter.  It gradually grew brighter, and as it did, two other similar looking diffuse white circles of light appeared, forming an equilateral triangle. At this point I yelled for my wife, called her on my cell, and knocked on the pane glass living room window to get her attention.  She came running out with her i-phone and saw the triangular formation just before it faded out.  As those three lights faded out, a brighter and less diffuse white light between where the other three lights were appeared and grew brighter, casting a bright glow against the surrounding clouds.  All of the lights were perfectly stationary.  She managed to catch that final light on video before it faded about 30 seconds later. All of these lights were perfectly stationary.

I never have seen a plane this bright, so I went to look.  It moved at the speed of a fast single engine plane.  The direction was going towards New York, across lake Champlain.     I opened the door and I heard nothing.  No noise.  I watched it fly right over and just in shock a little.   I walked back in and another one started  to come from the same direction.  I ran and woke up my wife who went to sleep with the kids.  She ran down only to see it get out of sight over the tree line.  ((expletive deleted..))  to my surprise, another started to come over again.  This time she ran and grabbed my phone and watched it with me.  My phone wouldn't focus so I gave up and watched it with my own eyes.   My wife also couldn't believe  it.  I have two very short videos of the lights.  It looks fake to me, or just a light in the sky.   Another one started to come over and I ran and got my keys, this time I followed it to the lake so I could see what happened next.  The light went towards Plattsburg, New your ((sic.  New York)).  I could see it going towards where they are shooting fire works off.  It was brighter than the fireworks, I cant understand why its not on the news or all over the internet.  The light was incredible.   My wife said she would have called me crazy if she didn't see it her self.    One last note.  I live in the landing, and take off path for Burlington Vermont airport.  I noticed that no planes landed or took off for hours.  Its never been so quite in the sky.   Later that night, planes started coming over and the normal noise begin,  nothing out of the norm.   Not flares, not skydivers.  If it was an electric engine, it was amazingly quite, and the light was bright.   I woke up and went to the news channel watching to see and nothing.

A large tree blocked most of my view of the sky to the left of the moon.  Through the tree branches I noticed a very large, bright ""star"", or so I thought at first.  I moved several feet away from the tree to get a better look.  ""What a big star!"", I thought.  ""I wonder if that is a planet, maybe mars, that is closer than normal.  But I've seen mars many times and it's never THAT big.""  It was big and roughly circular, though hard to tell the shape because it was bright.  After looking at it for a few seconds I saw it start moving.  It was a sort of dirty orange or orangish-brown color.  More orange than brown, but not a neon orange.  It did not blink or pulsate at any time.   I've never seen aircraft with lights of that color and aircraft lights usually blink.  When it started moving I at first thought maybe it was some sort of sattelite that was! very close.  But then it didn't move in a straight line.  This was definitely not a meteor or an airplane.  I doubt a helicopter could have moved the way it did, and again, I've never seen helicopter lights this color or helicopter lights that don't blink.  There would be no reason for a helicopter to move in this fashion and I've never seen a helicopter move this way, though I suppose it might be possible.  A helicopter is the only craft I know of that can fly in a non-linear way like this.  Also, I never heard a helicopter noise, or any other noise during this sighting.   After roughly 15 seconds of watching it, the craft ""disappeared"" (hard to describe).  It seemed as though it flew away from me (not to the right or left, but directly away from me) and sort of looked smaller as it did so.  This happened quickly.  I was left wondering what I saw and if anyone else saw it and if there was anything I could or should do.   I stood around looking all over the sky for! a while to see if it would reappear and so far it hasn't (I'm! typing this about an hour after I saw it).  I was hoping it would come back so I could be ready with my cellphone camera.   I should also note that there were a lot of fireworks earlier in the night, but this was definitely NOT a firework.  There was no noise, it could fly any direction it wanted or stay stationary for a few seconds at a time.  After looking at the sky for a while I went inside and looked up ""how to report a ufo"" on the internet and found this site and called the number.

The (presumably) same object was seen in two different locations at two different times by the same observer. Driving east on Route 37 I spotted a rectangular object to the east. My position was near the intersection of Hooper Avenue on Route 37 East near 149 Route 37 East in Toms River. The object was rectangular, white, and moving southward relative to my position. It was very small leading me to believe the object was a mile or two from my current position. My first impression was, ""This was just a large banner someone's flying over the Seaside Heights beach.""  Beach banners tend to be red letters on black netting, rather than presented as a large bedsheet.  What convinced me to contact MUFON was not seeing a plane towing it.  My father-in-law was in the car with me, I remarked, ""That's strange,"" but he was oblivious or thought I was talking about something else.  Before I approached the Stop and Shop on 353 Route 37, the object was now low on the horizon and difficult to observe. The distance between the two points is a little over a mile. We made a stop and drove south down Coolidge from Bay Avenue. While heading south on Coolidge, and passing Raider Way, time approximately 17:05, I saw the white rectangle again. No plane was visible towing the object.   After (maybe) two minutes, the object went behind trees while heading south.  The rectangle was a bit larger from this vantage.  The object was hidden by treetops before I reached the light on Windsor Ave.  This time I pointed out the object to my father-in-law, he remarked, ""Huh,"" but made no further comment. I believe there's a chance this might've been a case of mistaken identity, this being a banner, but banners tend to be much longer rather than having the dimensions of a postcard.  It's strange enough to report, and I'd like to know whether or not there's a prosaic explanation.",2015-07-06T00:00:00,39.98447272727273,-74.19884456762749

I had been sitting and talking with my friend who is a medical doctor at an area hospital.   There were a number of small aircraft flying around the area, which is typical around here on July 4th, but one aircraft really stood out.  Instead of the typical red and green blinking position lights as seen on the surrounding aircraft, this particular aircraft had one amber-orange light.  It appeared to be the size of a large, bright planet…possibly a bit larger.  It moved in a west to east trajectory north of Redlands in the direction of Mentone, California.  My friend and I watched it for 30-45 seconds.   As I continued to watch the light, I kept saying to her, “That doesn’t look like an airplane.”   It appeared to be moving about the same speed as the small airplanes in the area, but unlike those other aircraft it maintained a constant altitude.   My friend looked away briefly, but I kept watching it.  Then before my eyes it abruptly disappeared.   When it disappeared, I exclaimed to her, “It disappeared!”  She looked back at me and said, “That must not have been an airplane!”  I am kicking myself because we had a yard full of people, and I didn’t say anything to anyone else but my friend.

This object was emitting red and blue lights pulsating lights, not the standard red and green lights you would see on a helicopter or airplane.  This immediately caught my attention since I'm an Airline Pilot, and knew that blue lights should not be on an airplane.   I got out of my car to watch this thing and it started to move really fast and at 90 angles. Too fast to be a helicopter because I estimated it moved from atop of Cranston to over Narragansett Bay in less than 10 seconds.  Too fast for a helicopter.   But then it stopped in Mid Air and started moving down vertically for a landing somewhere over the water of Narragansett Bay.  Something that an airplane can't do either.   I took a pic of it but I'm afraid it looks like just another airplane because of the quality of my camera phone, and the distance from the object.  I had to have been 10 miles or more from this object the entire time. I'm still submitting a pic to the site to give a frame of reference.  I also made an attempt to video tape the object. but a street light got in the way, and the object was in the process of landing vertically out of sight, before I could get the frame in focus.

Earlier this evening, around 9:30 pm (just after the sun had set,) a fellow gardener and I were standing in the community gardens of Valley City, ND, and casually talking.  Out of nowhere, a bright, intense object (best I can describe it, would be to say a white light sitting on top of a red light,"" faded into view of the southern sky, and began swooping around, quickly changing elevation and direction.  I say quickly, but the movement was also very fluid.  The object then proceeded to stay stationary for a brief moment, and then made a final swoop (in the shape of a backward letter ""J"") and faded out.  This first sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds. As we sat there in amazement for a minute talking about what we might have just seen, a different object of the same characteristics appeared in the eastern sky, in the same manner, except remained stationary for approximately 5 minutes...long enough for us to assume it was a star or planet coming into view for the evening.  But, then the object began slowly dancing left to right (in this case north to south.)  The object began ascending into the sky, seemed to hesitate for a brief moment, and then descend below our line of sight. We sat there again, talking briefly as to what in the world we were just witness to, and then parted ways. When I arrived home about 5 minutes later, I informed my roommate, and we went for a quick drive to a better vantage point just to take another look.  Before we made it up on the hill, another similar object appeared in the eastern sky.  This object made similar movements as well, including low swoops, changes from left to right (north to south,) until finally soaring into the sky, hesitating yet again, and then descending below our line of sight. We sped up to get on top of the hill and look around, and saw nothing...until one final similar object appeared in the northern sky.  This object, although appearance was very similar, did not behave as erratically as the other three.  It simply glided along the horizon, heading east, pausing for a few brief moments.

On Thursday night, 9/24, in the E. Mesa, AZ, area I was outside with my telescope viewing the moon and Saturn in the southern sky.  At about 22:15, I noticed a bright flashing light up in the southern sky in the area just east of Saturn.  There are lots of planes flying high overhead all the time but the bigger ones generally have 2 or sometimes 3 bright lights while smaller planes tend to have a white and red flashing light and helicopters sometimes have 3 or 4 lights of different colors but they all to go across the sky and disappear in a few minutes.  However, this flashing light was just one light and it was staying near the same place in the sky, which seemed odd. After I noticed that it wasn’t moving out of sight I started to watch more closely and it seemed to be just floating on the wind, darting to the left and right and sometimes zooming up and down a little or going in small circles.  After I decided that it probably wasn’t a helicopter hovering up there I moved the telescope over to see if I could get a better look. It was hard to keep in sight with all the small movements and at first all I could see was the light.  I thought it might be a drone being flown at night and the movements looked a bit like a drone trying to hover and stay in place in the wind.  There are drone flyers around that have lots of lights on the craft to fly at night and you can actually buy bright white light to put on them but I’ve not seen one hover this long so far up in the sky. After a few more minutes I noticed that it was getting closer and I could see it better. When the light flashed it would light up something dangling down underneath on what looked like some ropes.  I kept watching as it got closer and I began to see some kind of what looked like debris tangled up in the ropes but it was swaying back and forth and being jerked around so rapidly that I couldn’t tell what it was. I suppose the light could have been on a parachute or balloon but I don’t know what was holding it up since I couldn’t see anything above the light or anything blocking out the stars but there weren’t many stars visible in that area.  It looked like it was actually coming towards me and as it got closer it also started to loose altitude and after about 30 minutes it got so low that is went out of sight behind the houses South of me and must have crashed to the ground somewhere near Rt. 60 and Signal Butte Rd. in E.

There was no noise like there would be from an aircraft.   The way they moved was amazing, it looked liked they were going to crash into each other.  Then they started moving zig zag, up and down but it was all really fast.  Like the way a bird would move.  With no limitations on the direction it wanted to go.   My partner and I was watching this with our jaws dropped!  Then as quick as they were moving they just vanished!    I even rang the police emergency number go report it, but they just basically said that they wouldn't know who to report such a thing too.  No help whatsoever.

In retrospect, however, we realized virtually every passing aircraft has strobing lights, whereas this light was steady.   Later, we deliberately observed aircraft on different nights and indeed all exhibited clearly strobing lights, normally red and/or white.  At no time did we observe any aircraft exhibiting a single bright green light. We have also frequently observed satellites passing overhead, and this bore no resemblance to them, nor was its behavior or speed anything like meteors we have often observed.

I have no idea how he’s going to pay me for this one but I’ll go at it slowly.   As for me, in addition to my most abject apology, I ask you how I might make it up to you?  I’m so very angry in addition to my mortification.  I had asked him early on if he was using an app but he didn’t respond.  He was at work so I thought he was busy.  Sometime in the middle of the day he sent me another photo.  Later in the afternoon, I had the chance to look at it and I think it is after your call telling me you said it was most likely an overlay, and found it was strange both pictures had the “UFO” at the same angle and the same amount of the vehicle was showing.  Later even I looked at the third photo and it was the same as the others.  When I picked up my son, he admitted his “joke”.     My son has no idea how this affected me.  He doesn’t know what I’ve seen and wouldn’t believe me if he did.  Actually, I wouldn’t either if I hadn’t been with a person who was not connected to me in any way.  I’m not afraid, sir, I’m respectful of the information and implications.  These are real events that deserve careful research and consideration.

It seemed unstable or experiencing “turbulence” and was making an almost twisting motion.  The surface texture seemed rough, not smooth, and the craft was obviously experiencing some sore of turbulence.  I took it at first to be some sort of meteor or rock type of thing.  It was almost unreal, honestly.  After taking notice, I alerted my wife and she too witnessed the perceivably large unidentified object twist through the air.  The craft then receded to the clouds, of which we could still see the shadow of faintly.  It then was gone. There were no lights, and the craft of whatever kind had to be huge to be literally inside the clouds.

It was not hurling to the ground, so it wasn’t a meteor or anything of the type and there was no tail.

I placed my hand on my daughter’s arm (she was driving) to ask her what it was.   Suddenly, it started moving towards us very quickly, until it was directly in front of us over the highway about 100 yards in front of us.  We could not discern a definite shape, but we felt it was triangular and had an angled top which narrowed in what appeared to be the front of the flying object.  There were three sets of bright lights, with several lights in each set.  My daughter thought the bottom of the object was slightly rounded.  The entire sighting took approximately 15 seconds.   As the object reached the Western side of the freeway, it appeared to hesitate and “wobble”, continued into the desert about 50 feet and completely disappeared.  It was a very bright night, with a full moon.  There was no visible propulsion; the craft simply disappeared.

I was in Tilton, NH, (elevation 443 feet) visiting some friends with my former co-worker and her boyfriend.  We were out in the front yard in a wooded part of town.  It was approximately 1:30 am on July 12, 2015.  I was facing south.  I was looking not directly upwards, but rather with about a 15% declination from perpendicular (so at about an 85 degree angle).  Throughout the evening, I was looking up at the stars.  First, I saw a shooting star.  Then, I saw a satellite.  And then, I saw another satellite. But then I saw an object that blinked almost like a plane.  But then it skipped across the sky at an incredible speed, and blinked again, then it blinked a third time, again in a mostly straight line.  Then it quickly changed directions and blinked again, and then it was making a tight circle in a clockwise direction.  It blinked again, blinked another time, and then blinked one last time completing the circle, and then it moved on. The object was moving from East to West, was uniform in its strobe lighting, and was not a circular object, but rather angular or diamond-shaped, when it blinked.  It was at an extremely high altitude (possibly in the upper atmosphere or even in space), and covered a span of my vision (standing.  I was in a field approximately 100 yards wide) in a matter of approximately 10-14 seconds.  The duration of the blinks lasted about a half a second.  The movement from one position to the next position took approximately 2 seconds. The range in space could have had the visible object having covered dozens of miles in a matter of a few seconds, finishing in a circle before it disappeared behind the trees to my right (in the West).  Had I stretched out my arm and put up my right thumb, the object would have built the circle in a clockwise formation in the sky, starting at the top of my thumb to the bottom of my thumb, and as if one were to make a circle with the top and bottom of my thumb (at the joint) being part of the circumference of the circle.

I waved for my neighbor to come off her porch and see.  We looked together for a minute toward the west, talking about how it has not happened in 2000 years since Jesus was born. I turned to go back to my home and she said, ""What is that?""

The bright blue and red lights were paired together in four places like where the wheels would be under a car.  We did not see the rectangle object, only the lights.  These were large lights, not tiny pin-sized lights. They did not blink, only glowed cobalt blue and bright red very vividly.  At first it was just hovering, then it went up, away south, around and back again and that is when I realized it was not a helicopter.  Nothing could travel or turn that fast that I have ever seen before. We watched until it went up and disappeared into the east. I had a strange feeling while watching that it had been looking at the stars as well, knew we were looking at it, and was trying to get away from us.  I don't know if that is true, it is just a sense I had.  I did not feel afraid, just calm and curious.  I brushed it off, since someone I later spoke with said it was probably a drone.

It seemed quite large, a fireball, with no discernible flashing lights,.. Report received by the Missouri Investigators Group. http://ufomig.yolasite.com. BBecker ufomig@yahoo.com. I had spent the late afternoon, early evening, at my mom's house, with family, at Lake Timberline, Bonne Terre, MO.  I would not attend the evening's fireworks display there, as I had a prior commitment to walk my friend's dog by 9pm (my friend was staying out of town that evening...he lives just west of Highway 67 in Farmington, MO).  Because of my commitments, I was paying particular attention to the time.  I left my mom's house for Farmington by just before 8:30 pm, heading north to my friend's house, and arriving at around 8:45pm.  I took out his dog for a walk in the yard.  We finished by 9:00 pm, and I remember hearing what certainly sounded like very large fireworks going off in the east, toward Farmington.  I assumed it was their annual display.  As the dog seemed increasing nervous at the sounds, I took her back in the house and left for my home in Farmington.  I got on to Hwy 67 south, hung a left on Hwy H, headed east into Farmington.  I continued to hear the ""booming! "" of what seemed to be Farmington's fireworks display, now behind me as I entered the city limits.  There was some traffic that had passed on Hwy H heading west, and I was looking ahead at another oncoming vehicle, when just over the treetops appeared what I initially thought was a small plane.  It is not uncommon to see small aircraft in this area as the pilots descend and make their way toward landing at the small Farmington airport.  I suppose my immediate thought was that it could be dangerous perhaps for a small plane to be out, at this time on the July 4th holiday, so close to a large fireworks demonstration.  The craft did not seem to be heading in a straight line, but sort of a ""bee line"" to the west-northwest.  It took only seconds to realize that there were no flashing lights or beacon on this craft, it seemed very low, but very large, glowing brightly in an orange-red hue.  I realized that this was unusual and I found my self startled.  Quickly, I glanced! in my rear-view mirror, saw not traffic behind me. I slammed ! on the b rakes, and backed my car up twenty or thirty feet into the nearest drive, and parked, with my car facing north. I looked out my windshield and viewed the craft headed west. It seemed quite large, a fireball, with no discernible flashing lights, as with a plane or helicopter. I whipped out my cell phone and attempted to film the light. As soon as I got the recorder operating, I realized that filming through the windshield could interfere getting a ""clean"" recording, so I exited the vehicle quickly, with the phone in my right hand. I stood outside the car, between the open door and the car, leaning on the vehicle to steady my hand. The craft seemed to have moved further to the north of me, and as I filmed, it ceased to move, and hung in midair. I looked like Venus would appear in the night sky, but was as twice as bright as Venus, burning in that orange-red hue. While I watched and filmed, it seemed as though the craft appeared as a ""V"" shaped, but I cannot! be sure. After minutes, the object began to move due north, disappearing gradually from my line of sight. I recall stopping the camera record feature on the cell phone, and climbed back into my car. I was excited to see what I had filmed. I then realized that only ten seconds of video existed of this sighting, ending as I began to exit the vehicle, with no visual of the light I attempted to film from the windshield. I thought perhaps I ""jostled"" the phone upon exiting the car, but I cannot account for the fact that I remember stopping the camera record feature on my phone when the experience ended. Because there was no video to prove what I had seen, needless to say, I was extremely pissed off. I drove the rest of the way home, and explained to my waiting wife, what I had seen. I put a post on Facebook at about 9:34pm, asking if anyone else had seen this. Surprisingly, only a few responded, and some with skepticism. I was probably ranting at my wife for hours abo! ut this. How can tens of thousands of people be sitting outsid! e watchi ng the sky, and no one saw what I had seen? In retrospect, and this is purely speculation, I was left feeling that this object was responding to the fireworks in town, stopped within a short distance to observe, and then tracked slowly northward. I was extremely agitated after this experience, and in the following week, I would go outside around the same time of the evening to see if this craft would return, and I could get another chance at filming it.

On Sunday night or Monday morning at exactly 11:30, my girlfriend and I went to watch the stars over Lake Michigan at Racine Veach.  As we were looking at star patterns, we noticed a very bright star above Lake Michigan.  It twinkled so brightly, we had to check it out.  Lately we've be3en using binoculars.  We saw what appeared to be a stationary star, but it looked as though it was making small loop patterns when you focused on it, but it never left that position very much.   When we focused the binoculars on it, we noticed flashes of bright green, almost a plasma type color.  In addition to the green, there was a sliver/gold light always and red every once in a while.  I am familiar with flashing lights on planes, helicopters, etc., and it wasn't a safety strobe or anything like that.  Besides, this object just sat stationary and every once in appeared to move.  The colors were distinct and always showed green and gold/silverfish color.   Through the lenses, we assumed this object was in motion but staying in a stationary or ""Star-like"" position.  Planes passed by many times so we could refence the light against known aircraft passing by into Racine airport, and the colors from this object were very bright, colorful and brilliant.  So, basically one of the stars low in the distance twinkled so much it attracted our attention away from the others in the night sky.  When we looked closer with the binoculars, we saw strong green and gold colors, plus sometimes red, but only every so often and never in a pattern or anything.  It looked like a craft pretending to be a star, but it gave off such brightness and colors, it was the only thing we looked at besides 2 shooting stars at 11:59 p.m. and 12:06 a.m..  So it was a bright star, that was twinkling green, goldish/siver and red while it sat in a stationary position.  Every once in a while when we would see the red, it would appear to move in very fast,erratic movements like a distant,fuzzy,bouncy object.  We were too far and the lights were to bright to id a def shape. It was strange, I spot satelites all the time.  This was a stationary star looking abject that appeared green,gold and red, flashes or pulses, and we got there around 11:30 pm and left around 12:15 am, and the star/object generally stayed in the same spot the whole time.  It was still there when we left, and I didn't want to leave before this thing did something, but I had to get home, I was there for around an hour maybe more.   I will go out at the same time tomorrow night to check for the object against the reference of the star patterns.  If it's still there, I will report back.  No tail, or sounds but it was way out over the lake, so no sounds or anything.   Object might have been spinning or something like spinning,popping while it hovered, almost as if it had to in order to stay floating at a stationary spot.

We had just passed thru the town of Chester, SC and were about 6 miles south of Chester on Hwy 121.

The object was traveling parallel to the ground with possibly a very slight descending projection although it did not appear to be in an emergency situation.  No erratic movements or speed changes like portrayed on UFO sightings were seen.  The object was heading in a northwestward direction.  The altitude although hard to estimate, seemed to be what one would expect from a helicopter flying at its maximum height capability, but again distances can fool you and I cannot verify.  I can state however, that the object was blocked for a few seconds from the tree line.  I was able to get out of the car to observe this phenomenon, but did not hear any noise whatsoever.  The speed was consistent, the path relatively straight.  My daughter did mention that at times she tho! ught she observed pieces following each other, she described much like a train.  My wife and I did not share this description, but she has far better eyes than either of us. Although I am not a meteorologist, this did not resemble a typical meteor burning up in the atmosphere, and it lacked the excessive speed and downward projection of a “falling star”.  It had a consistent path and offered little change in its course or speed.

It slowly moved west, circled back and flew directly overhead again, a little higher up and a little faster, then flew west again and disappeared.

Disc or cylindrical craft moving at very high speed,Chapel Hill,NC,2015-06-29T12:30:00,cylinder,5 seconds,"Occurred : 6/29/2015 12:30  (Entered as : 06/29/2015 12:30) Reported: 6/29/2015 5:53:45 PM 17:53 Posted: 7/3/2015 Location: Chapel Hill, NC Shape: Cylinder Duration:5 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/119/S119893.html,"Disc or cylindrical craft moving at very high speed On June 29, 2015, about 10 miles outside of Chapel Hill, NC, travelling south towards Charlotte, NC, I witnessed an object that looked very much like a disc or possibly cylindrical craft.  It was apparently a considerable distance away, so it was difficult to ascertain whether it was truly a disc, or whether it was a cylinder; however, it appeared to have no wings and did not have any type of propulsion mechanism that could be seen. It was clearly a silver or gray color.   I cannot provide an accurate distance of the object from my vantage point, but it seemed to be somewhat equidistant between the locations of frequently sighted high-flying commercial jets and lower flying, small, private airplanes.  I realize this estimate is not very helpful, but it was just too difficult to give a good estimate of distance.  Although based on the uncertainty introduced by the distance of the craft from my vantage point, one could perhaps attempt to explain it away as some type of mundane craft; however, it was the observations regarding the apparent shape, coupled with the speed of the object that made me decide to report it.  The speed truly caught my attention.   I originally sighted the craft directly ahead of my vantage point looking south and at about 30deg up from the horizon against a clear blue sky.  From the time I spotted the object until it moved across the south to western span of the sky to below the tree line on the western horizon, only about 4-5 seconds passed, maybe a little less.    As I watched it move, it was clearly far faster crossing the sky than the apparent movement of a high-flying commercial jet (which appears to move very slowly as most anyone knows who has seen a high-flying jet followed by its contrail).  Likewise, it was much, much faster than the apparent speed of low flying, small, private planes.   It appeared to move across that expanse of the sky even faster than the speed of some lower-flying military jets that I have seen in the past.  From the time I saw it until I could get my daughter's attention to try to look at it, the object was already out of sight behind the trees on the western horizon.  If the distance I had estimated was accurate, then this craft was moving at an extremely high speed.  It was truly moving faster than any conventional aircraft that I have seen. So, in summary, it was not only the apparent disc or cylindrical shape of the craft that caught my attention, but also the speed that made me think it was something truly unusual. Although I was unable to take a photograph, it looked very much like the object in the photo of the High Plains, Oregon, sighting of June 14, 2015, at 1230hrs (Pacific), which is shown on the NUFORC website (although the object I saw was quite a bit more distant and probably a third of the apparent size as seen from my vantage point). Furthermore, I was in a car when the sighting took place, so I cannot make any comment about the possible sound of the craft. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Thank you for your interest.  Your work on the NUFORC site is admirable. First, the size, as compared to the moon at that same location (on a hypothetical full-moon night), was estimated to be about 1/10th the size of a full moon (at a 30-35 degree location and not exaggerated by atmospheric effects).  Again, I estimate this based on envisioning a cylinder/disc sitting over a full-moon and deducing the amount of the moon covered. The following is my best estimate regarding movement: As I stated, the object originally appeared to be about 30-35 degrees above the horizon, directly in front of me.   When it went out of sight about 4-5 sec later, it was hidden because of the interference of the tops of trees on the western horizon.   Those tree tops were approximately 10 degrees from the horizon.  So, I suppose one could say the object traversed an expanse from 30 degreess to 10 degrees in about 5 seconds.  Does this help answer your question?  If you need more detail, let me know, and I'll do the best I can.  Remember, I have a chemistry background, not physics.  Ha!  I will leave the heavy lifting to you. And to the last point - no, my daughter was never able to see the object.  It simply moved too quickly. Best regards, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((ADDENDUM #2)) Dear Mr. Davenport, I hope my contacting you so soon after my response to your inquiry about my initial UFO report does not damage my credibility as a witness; however, the more I think about my response, I believe I have let that Oregon photo on your site cloud my objectivity. I simply do not believe the object I saw was as large as 1/10 of the full moon.  Please pardon my excitement and erroneous description in response to your question.       To explain, I responded by saying that I thought the object I saw was 1/10th the size of a full moon, but the more I consider it, I believe this quick response is not accurate.  Considering my difficulty in judging the shape of the craft (disc vs cylinder) leads me back to a more reasonable estimate of size as 1/20th the size of a full moon.   I feel that this is a far more accurate reflection of what I observed.  The object was quite small, but still clearly a disc or cylinder shape and apparently not a plane or commercial jet due to its speed. It becomes clear to me, as I honestly endeavor to provide accurate information, how difficult it is to obtain reliable witness testimony, especially when there is only one witness.  I so wish that my daughter had also observed the object, so that I would have some confirmation of my perceptions. Please consider this updated information as an addendum to my initial report. Best regards, ((END ADDENDUM #2)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #3)) Dear Mr. Davenport, I recently reported a sighting (Chapel Hill, NC on June 29) and was perusing the NUFORC database to see if any other similar reports had been made on that day.  I noticed at the bottom of my report entry there was a NUFORC note saying that we had spoken by phone and that I describe myself as an aviation expert.  That information is incorrect.  I am writing simply to inform you that I believe you are mistaken and possibly have me confused with someone else.  We never spoke by phone, and I am a chemist and polymer/chemical patent research professional - nothing to do with aviation.    I assume you might want to correct this data entry for the integrity of the report. Thanks for all of your great work. Best regards, ((END ADDENDUM #3)) ((NUFORC Note #2--The witness's third statement is correct, and the error was ours!  We confused this report with another witness.

On a night when you'd expect to see an array of lights, my family / group and I never expected to see what we saw over the trees to the southeast of our driveway. Seven of us, my wife, two daughters and three of their friends, all grown, were over and enjoyed the 4th's activities, when at 9 P.M. we went outside to watch the fireworks. I noticed one of our company looking into the nighttime sky to the southeast, when I looked up and saw a lit up object that seemed to be something other then fireworks.  It was just hovering bright and blue-green in color at first, then it moved ever so slowly and I thought it was a helicopter, meanwhile it had all of our attention by now, except my wife who went inside for something. It was then that the airborne craft started to move and made a sudden turn and as it did it began to fade and reappear as a bright reddish-orange color, turn back to the direction it had been visible as a blue-green object and darted back to it's original position in the sky that we had first noticed it.  There it turned back to to the blue-green and started to maneuver through the sky as something very different then fireworks or helicopter or anything that I've ever seen. I called for my wife to hurry back out side and look at this object. I called to her twice and finally asked her to drop whatever she was doing and please come now! (Meanwhile fireworks are going off all around us and this craft has our rapt attention)!  My wife came back out and immediately started to film it on her smartphone, we ended up with approx. seven minutes of video but during that time all we could do is watch this object in between the burst of the fireworks celebration which it seemed very int! erested in as it seemed to be drawn to the larger explosions. It continued to change color between the blue-green to red-orange as it changed direction or sped up and slowed down. It had a range of speed from just hovering to darting through the sky in an instant, ascending, descending at times and changing course at very unusual angles, sometimes slowly, other times quickly. We all thought about what it could be, a very different firework, a helicopter, a blimp, a drone, a prank somebody conceived because everyone in the neighborhood would be watching up into the nighttime sky and what a dupe or ""viral-video"" that would make but in the end none of these made any sense. As in the end it darted out a bit of instant, returned half the distance and started to descend beyond the trees and went out of sight. We all at some point thought it was a UFO and explained what we each saw and all agreed it wasn't anything like any of us had seen before. My wife later uploaded her video to her computer and we both understood why 99% of the videos you see of the UFO sightings are so grainy, you just don't expect to see something like this and when you do you use the best tool available to you to record it and in this case it was a smartphone. Aliens, I don't know. UFO, meaning that none of us in our group could identify it, yes. I'm just hoping to see something about this on the news tomorrow to verify what we saw wasn't a July fourth event the city of Las Vegas put on to wow it's citizens! We're hoping others saw this as there have had to be dozens of witnesses with it being the 4th of July and so many would have been looking into the sky enjoying the firework celebrations.

I went out to pet the dog, and was looking due west, when I spotted 3 large and bright, turquoise, oval lights.  They appeared as though the light was blocked by a cloud, the color was foggy and diluted.  They where very large and bouncing about darting across the sky in an irregular and excessively speedy flight pattern.  The three lights appeared to be  all the same and very close to me.  The visible aspects where only the large (dime sized) turquoise balls of fading light.  The three always staying close to each other making irregular circles around each other.   I went inside to freak out (the dog was unfazed) and grabbed my boyfriend and told him to come look.  He was convinced they where drones, but I'm not convinced at all.  I went inside and brought my iPhone out and took a video, but the ovals where not bright enough.  As I took this video, a plane was flying directly overhead, much higher in the sky and clearly and airplane, you can hear it in the recording.  This only showed a greater and obvious comparison between the two, I compared them on my video.  I also witnessed a strange phenomenon of light reflecting off of the plane passing over head, very high above, and much higher than the 3 ovals.  As the plane passed over my roof top directly next to me, a bright white light reflected off my house-I think it was unrelated but also something I had never seen before.  I tried again with to video it with my Canon rebel, same struggle with a dark image.   I then went back inside to ask my boyfriend to check them out again at about 23:26 and they where gone and the sky had gone dark.",2015-08-06T00:00:00,,

I noticed that there was a light off in the valley, it looked as if it could have been a big bonfire but I am still not sure exactly what it was, as there were some orb like lights seen there too (perhaps headlights).   As I was looking I saw a big white orb light appear from nowhere, above the trees, in the valley.  It was white and slowly floated and flickered out.  I saw no lights that indicated drones of any sort that I know of.  I went inside and asked the front desk clerk what was out that way, and she told me it was a residential type area she believed, but it is mostly surrounded by wilderness.   I decided to be curious and sit and watch for awhile, went up to my room and got my long lens dslr camera just in case.  I sat out on the porch of the hotel for a good 30 minutes, or so, and got some great footage of these lights swirling about in the trees.  They would slowly become bright, and take a path, then die out a bit.  When they are in two's, they would fly at each other.   They are not lanterns as they seem to form in the sky.  Mostly they were white, and would come one at at a time, but I also caught an instance of a white orb and an orange orb together.  Some orbs seemed to form together.  They would blink, but they do not seem to be the type of blink that you see on military or drone craft.   Also it being so late and actually dark, I would figure a drone light would stay on, rather than just flicker in and out.  The ones I caught on camera were closer in the valley, while the first one i saw was certainly in the sky.   My footage is taken at night, but it would be easy to cross check it with daylight footage to pinpoint where the lights were.  I would love to figure out what they are.

"Several clusters of red, blue blinking lights in the sky moving in strange patterns over 3 hour period",Lebanon,OR,2015-09-09T20:30:00,flash,3 hours,"Occurred : 9/9/2015 20:30  (Entered as : 09/09/15 20:30) Reported: 9/10/2015 10:14:09 AM 10:14 Posted: 9/11/2015 Location: Lebanon, OR Shape: Flash Duration:3 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/121/S121858.html,"Several clusters of red, blue blinking lights in the sky moving in strange patterns over 3 hour period Last night (9/9/2015), I walked out of my house at about 8:30 pm to go close the door on our chicken coop for the evening.  As I was walking back up the driveway towards my house I saw a red, blue, and white cluster of lights traveling up from the south.  The cluster flew directly overhead (traveling in a northerly direction). I initially thought it was a plane.  Where I live, it is not uncommon to see red flashing running lights of commercial airplanes flying south to north.  My guess is that these planes fly up from California heading north to the Portland airport.  So they are often visible in the Willamette Valley (where I am located).  The planes stick to a regular pathway, and I see them on a fairly regular basis (sometimes during the day and sometimes at night).  Nothing unusual about it. I am not an aviation expert, however I am convinced the lights I saw last night were not airplanes.   For the following reasons: 1)	There were at least 12 different sets of these flashing lights visible over a period of three hours 2)	Several times they stopped moving, clustered together,  and then changed directions 3)	The lights were brighter than a commercial aircraft and appeared lower in the sky than the planes I sometimes see in the night sky. In addition, the paths that these lights took did not conform to the regular pathways I see commercial aircraft travel.  They were predominantly moving south to north, however not all of them.  Some came from other directions (out of the west moving east, or out of the east moving north. I was very intrigued by what I was watching, so I went into my house and asked my wife to come outside.  She came out onto the lawn and we both watched at least four different sets of these lights traveling in a south to northerly direction over the course of about five minutes.  She shrugged and said she didn’t know what they were and went back into the house. So after a few minutes, I went into the house too.  About 30 minutes later, I went back outside to see if the lights were still around.  And they were.  Over the course of the next two hours I watched them travel around the sky.  It was kind of cold (upper 40’s, low 50’s) so I didn’t stay outside the entire time.  I’d watch them for 20 minutes or so, go in the house to warm up, then go back out again. I took about six short videos of the lights with my cell phone.  However, none came out very well.  The video caught a few blinking flashes, but the quality is pretty poor. At about 11:15 pm, I went back out to check again and they were gone.  So by my count they were in the sky from about 8:30 (just after dark) and hung around for almost three hours. The general pattern of travel and behavior of the lights were as follows: a)	They traveled from the southern horizon (like at the tree line) then traveled north-northeast to basically the other horizon.  So I would look south and watch them come up, fly overhead (or in some cases say 10 degrees off the eastern horizon) then I’d have to turn 180 degrees until I was facing north.  The lights would come to rest above the northern horizon and hold that position.  That wasn’t the exclusive pattern.  Sometimes it was the opposite (coming out of the north, then coming to a stop on the southern horizon).  I also saw them coming out of the east (as if they were coming over from the direction of the City of Bend).  Others would came out of the west.  However I would say 85% of the time the pattern was south to north, then coming to a stop in the northern sky.  Then they would either blink out or keep moving north until they were out of sight.  One cluster seemed to sit there the entire time I was watching.  Most of the others seemed to move around, come and! go, but this one seemed to remain in view constantly.  b)	  The speed of travel wasn’t particularly fast.  I would say slightly faster than what a commercial aircraft speed looks like in the sky.  They certainly weren’t zipping around, darting from one corner to another at high speeds.  Just sort of a lazy, steady speed moving from one side of the horizon to the other. c)	  Over the period of time that I watched these things, a few of the light clusters approached each other.  At one time—I saw three clusters come fairly close together and hold their position for a few minutes.  Then they moved back away from each other.  That really convinced me that something about this was quite strange and certainly not an airplane. I suppose they could have been helicopters.  We’ve had a lot of wildfires in the region this summer and maybe there were helicopters moving equipment around?  That’s the only explanation that I can think of. And I think that’s a bit of a stretch since I didn’t hear any sound whatsoever.  Again, I’m no aviation expert—however it would seem dangerous for helicopters to fly so close together in clusters at nighttime. At one point, I tried contacting a friend of mine who lives in the neighborhood to see if he could see them too.  Unfortunately, it was late by then and I wasn’t able to reach him.  However, I was glad to see on your web-site that there was a couple from Lebanon that reported something similar on 8/19/2015 and on 8/11/2015. I wish to remain anonymous, however would be glad to talk by phone or exchange info by email if you would like any additional details. Thanks for your time.

I was about to start sunbathing.  Temp was about 87, partly cloudy day in South end of Knox County.  As I noticed a huge high cloud came across the sun, my eyes focused on something rectangular shaped, at the edge of the cloud height. The object appeared to have a louvred appearance, much like that of a laundry room door or the kind of windows one sees on older homes in a beach area--louvred.  The object appeared to be black, and was headed due North in direction.  It wasn't blown on the wind, in a ""wafting"" type direction, it was on a steady path.  No variation in its path, as I said, just at the edge of the lower level of a white cloud and at that height, it would've had to have been easily 50x100 ft, but looked really tiny from the ground.  To place perspective, when we see a jumbo jet pass near a cloud, it looks like a period on a huge paper.  This object had to be approximately the same dimension, as it was cloud level, just under a huge cloud blocking the sun, had louvres, and was black. I could see that half the louvres went in one direction, the other half in the opposite direction. Very perplexing, and moving quickly.  I couldn't begin to estimate speed, but I know it was definitely going pretty fast, kept its height (no sinking) and kept going due North.  It came from the direction of Maryville and crossed the sky heading toward the NE side of Knoxville City, across the sky. I've never seen anything I could compare it to, except one of those old louvred type doors with horizontal slats running back and forth across the height of the door...matter of fact, that was my first thought when I looked up and focused on it. There's an air-base in Maryville, approx 15 miles from here as a bird flies, but there's no way anything could gain that altitude from lifting off there.  There's an AirForce base there, too.

Sightings  Report:  I swear/affirm the statement made by me is factual, truthful and made without any duress or promises of anything in kind. On 08/10/2105, at approximately 19:13 hours; I was sitting in a chair facing a south-westerly direction in my backyard in Hartford, Alabama; in the county of Geneva.  While I was watching my dogs as they were utilizing the potty/restroom.  I then notice that a passenger jet airplane was flying over from the south-westerly direction heading north-easterly over my residence.  As, the airplane was passing you can hear the thrust of the jet in the distance.  The airplane’s altitude was approximately 27/30,000 feet and it was leaving a contrail in its wake as it passed overhead.  I watched the airplane's trajectory and contrail for approximately 2 or 3 minutes. Something caught my peripheral vision on my right side, and I noticed that something else was in the sky following the passenger jet airplane.  I immediately called my wife from the bedroom where she was changing from her work clothes to lounging clothes.  I wanted her to confirm to me that I was not seeing things or my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Upon her immediate arrival from the bedroom to the outside back concrete deck where I was now standing and watching the sky; I asked her what she was seeing in the sky, and explain it to me in her own words.  The object was approximately 3½ miles behind the jet airplane and traveling at approximately 13/15,000 feet in altitude and following the same trajectory as the passenger jet. The object was triangular in shape, it had no wings, it had no rotary attachments, it was not  leaving any contrail in its wake.  The object was white or of a silver metallic color and material.  The object was traveling at a constant speed and had no noise associated with its flight.  As we both watched the jet airplane travel in the north-easterly direction; we called our son via cellphone who lives 6 houses down the street and asked him to come outside his residence and look to the sky to see what we were seeing.  The object was still traveling as if in tow towards the jet airplane’s direction. As we watched what was happening over our home, our son called us back from his cell phone and informed us to look back towards his residence that there were 2 more triangular, white or silver metallic objects traveling at the same altitude and trajectory as the first object pacing the passenger jet airplane.  All of these objects were traveling at the same distance and speed of each other and approximately 4 to 5 miles apart.  These objects were like the first triangular object in which they to made no noise, had no markings, left no contrail and had no wings or rotary devices attached to them, either.  All three objects were all similar in shape, height, color and descriptions. I am from New York City.  I am 48 years old.  I have a BS-CJ and a MS-SHRM from Troy University.

At first they created an isosceles type triangle, then as one orb moved on top, it created a scalene type triangle.  After watching for a few minutes one orb faded out and disappeared only to flash back on a few seconds later.  The lights were not of constant brightness but glowed brighter and dimmer as they hovered in the slowly changing triangle.   We needed to leave on 10! 1 South, so asked mother if she still saw them.   she said yes as I was driving.  The at that time had moved into a straight line.   We stopped for doughnuts at Krispy Kreme @ Mountain View and did not see lights when we stopped.  As we got back onto 85 North the lights reappeared over the Saratoga area above the mountain range there.

The were 1 to 1 1/2 miles away initially traveling toward me.  They were moving slowly without any noise.  At first I thought it must be a plane but there were no flashing lights or noise. The objects appeared a few hundred feet in the sky and appeared to be as if on fire (red).  It was different than a Chinese lantern, for I have seen them.  They had a red glow about them and much larger than lantern.   It appeared to be a small craft of sorts.   After observing them travel about a 1/2 mile they each made a 90 degree turn to the North.  They were under the cloud cover  & clearly visible.  After turning North, they seem to simply fade away, but still being under the cloud cover. I turned the block and saw my 2 neighbors in front of their house looking in the same direction.  They asked if I had seen the object as they described the same objects.  They said 2 similar objects had come over in same direction a few minutes earlier.  These earlier objects did not make a turn as I had seen, but continued in a straight line over their house before fading away or vanishing.  They said the could see an outline of a larger dark object than the reddish light as it passed over before disappearing. As we were talking another reddish object appear coming from the same direction which we all 3 observed.  It faded away without turning before it came much closer.

One observer, night. the light went out and on again. Thanks for this service. Surroundings:  Goleta Beach State Park, between 10:10 pm PST and perhaps 10:30 – not sure of the exact time.  (No watch.) This park is on the ocean, and also within approx. 1 or 2 miles of the local airport. I was facing the ocean, which is southerly here, looking towards the west. I was on a bicycle and riding slowly. There was – I’m not sure now – I believe a small plane behind me; it was headed out toward the ocean, away from the airport, which is in the northern direction from the beach and the ocean. I believe this plane had flashing lights. Suddenly, directly above the horizon and relatively near -  a bright light came into view.  It was travelling at an unusual speed – not extremely fast and yet…steady, i.e., not slow.  This light flashed on very bright and NOT on a plane.  It then went out.  It then – within seconds – came on again.  And then…went out again.  This was from my left to my right – it travelled.  And also, it was headed north to south, towards the ocean. At first I thought the lights from the small plane had illuminated a seagull.  But it could not possibly have been.  It was flying too fast, and it was emitting its own light. Then,  I thought perhaps it was a comet.  However, it went out – which may have been like a comet.  But then it came on again. And then went out again. This happened the night before last night.  I was tired and did not have your call in number at home, when I arrived home.  Also, my tendency was to explain it away.  However, at the time, I kept telling myself.  “Look – this is different.  You have seen something that you don’t know what it is.”  Also, the lights from the plane…I don’t think they could have lit up a seagull.  Also, it was a little too fast for a seagull. To me, it was completely anomalous.  So, I made a note to write to you.  Unfortunately, I didn’t keep all of the details in my mind.  There was no visible craft – but it was its own light.  Anyway, if it was an object – such as a small meteor – I don’t understand how it could have gone out and then turned on again.  It was just not normal.

At about 625-6:30 AM on August 28th, I was sitting at the bus stop on HWY 179, which has view of Airport Mesa.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a bright flash that caught my attention, and for the next 3-4 seconds after, I viewed what my logical mind first said was a 'meteor' or a 'downed plane.'  This was two hours after dawn, much too bright to see a meteor with the naked eye.  The object was glittering, metallic, and almost seemed as though it was on fire because of how lit up it appeared.  There was no smoke trail, or streak as it fell.  It was fluid and it appeared with the flash, and then fell in a downward arc, but disappeared before hitting neither the ground nor rock cliff. It was seen between two rocky, small mountain peaks, visible from where I was sitting to seem as though they were right next to Airport Mesa, but actually the rocks are best seen on HWY 89A, right after the 'Y' junction in Sedona, AZ, just past the post office. From my viewing perspective, the peeks seemed next to airport Mesa, so I called into the police suggesting a downed plane, but there was no smoke, and the object disappeared without impact.

I was facing east as most of the fireworks were going off that way, but some were also being set off to the south, as well as to the north of my spot. At one point I noticed several reddish orange lights that were moving to the east-southeast. They were directly south when I initially noticed them. At first I saw two that appeared to be a little higher, thus smaller. I would estimate them to have been 4000 to 4300 ft in altitude, but it didn't seem clear how accurate that might have been. Lower than those and seemingly a little larger (apparent size) were two more with one above and leading the other, also moving to the east. These I estimated to be about 2500 – 3000 ft altitude. I thought of how helicopters would be flying while I was watching. Within a minute of noticing them, the first two disappeared although I felt at first they just went out of range. Three more appeared to the southwest and moved similarly to, and at the same apparent altitude, as the second two. The higher of the second set had disappeared by this time, then shortly after that, the other one also disappeared. As the third group moved directly south of where I was, another two became visible to the southwest. I returned my attention to the set of lights south of me and two of them disappeared as I watched. The third of that group continued on to my southeast, and it was possible that it changed direction toward the southeast at that time. The upper of the next set of two disappeared somewhere to my southeast but the other continued on as the single remaining one of the previous group had done. Two more sets of two became visible in about the same timing and location, also moving to the east, and one of those four also remained to follow the others that stayed visible going toward the southeast. To recap: several groups of similar to identical reddish orange lights moved from southwest to southeast relative to my position. Most disappeared but three total appeared to continue visibly to the southeast. The movement seemed to be how helicopters would have been flying but there was no sound. They might have been 1.5 – 3 miles away. There were no strobe lights or red beacons I could see, but if traditional aircraft, the port red light would have been visible. However, the color was more orange than I would have thought. The lack of standard aircraft lighting was strange as where they were is the approach to Detroit Metro airport ; we live directly under the westernmost approach and aircraft would be flying toward the southwest right into where these lights were. No aircraft made an approach during that time, however. There seemed to be a shape to the lights, sort of an irregular trapezoid on its side, base to the rear, and the top segment at more of an angle than the bottom one. This, though, was an impression and not easily discernible. After the first 4 groups had gone by I had the idea to try my smart phone video to capture images, but the quality is pretty poor. I offer it anyway, if desired. I am a retired US Navy Aerographers Mate (meteorology and oceanography) with 20 years service.  I have a private pilot's license but haven't flown since 1992.
