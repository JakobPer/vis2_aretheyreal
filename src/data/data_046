This is my second post on here, but today there were more witnesses and this time we even got the footage on camera!  After the sighting lastnight we decided to do some research to see if there have been anymore sightings in our area. Well what we found was a surprise. It came out to be over 50 sightings in our same area since 1985. First sighted in 1940. All the records reported back then describes exactly what we saw the past two nights.  Walking down from the same house, we looked in between the two houses where the first sighting was. This light stayed for quite a few minutes, then it slowly began to move left. While it was moving it dropped out another light.. like fire. Then the light that was dropped faded. The orignial light continues to flow left and then it slowly fades away itself. Due ot the fading away we believed it was a flare. Expecailly since we live next to the military base (fort hood). Thinking it was training of the soldiers we called the MP's and they told us that there was no trainging happening at that time. Making us more curious we stayed outside to watch for the lights. Eventually we saw the sky light up red. After afew flashes of red came the original objects appeard in the original spot. Only this time around it was 4 in one place at one time. Each time one light would fade another object would appear... but yet in the exact same location as the others. Each time one would fade, another one would drop out fire. Not knowing what this was we dug out the binoculars. To our surprise it came out that the objects were NOT flares and yet the stuff that was being dropped was fire. After awhile the objects themselves exploded. We decided to chase after the lights to get our answer on what it was. As we got closer and closer we noticed that the fire would just drop behind the hills. We got to the point where we were too close, and being alone at night in one car we decided to go home. When we got home we looked up videos online of UFO's and came upon videos of exactly what we have recorded... Now you tell me what it is?  Yet when the police here says its flares. We want an answer. And yet until we find it we will sit out everynight and get this on camera.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

Sun has totally set for about one hour. Traffic was of moderate density.  My speed was roughly 25 mph.  I was heading in a north easterly direction.  My attention was drawn to a rapidly flashing light (15 - 30 flashes per second) moving quickly from left to right.  The object was approximately 20 degrees above my apparent horizon  As I tried to track the flashes while still watching traffic it appeared to be farther to the right than I had anticipated every time I looked back up. It also passed behind trees which were between the object and myself and just became lost in the trees and buildings.  I did not have a wide horizon at this time but the speed at which the object traversed it was impressive.  About a quarter mile after the sighting Kenwood Ave. makes a 90 degree right hand turn.  About another quarter mile past the turn I momentarily caught another glimpse of the object as it disappeared over the horizon, heading directly away from me. At no time could I detect anything other than the flashing light.  The light was very small.  Not much bigger than a BB held at arms length.  The flashes were primarily white  but I think I may have detected intermittent red flashes.  The part of this episode which has me baffled is the speed of the flashes.  It was actually almost a solid light.  Not at all a standard nav light.  And, the speed at which it traveled.  I also had the impression that the object was spinning, but I can't really say that for sure.  That may have been an illusion caused by the flashes.  My driver window was down but I heard no sounds other than traffic.  As it disappeared the second time it was heading roughly toward Martin State Airport from which both Baltimore City and Maryland State Police operate their helicopters.  I see both helicopters daily and I don't believe that this object was either one of them.  I probably would have heard either helo and I can't picture them making that kind of speed even if they had a malfunctioning strobe light.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

Neighbors dog barking on the east side of my house, looked in that direction and noticed a large boomerang formation between 5,000 - 7,000 ft. altitude, 45 degrees above the east horizon about 300+ yard across.  Moving from north to south along Beltway 8 corridor from Westheimer to Hwy 59 south before I lost sight.  Clear night.  No sound.  At first thought it may be one large single object but as it moved along, noticed some of the 20+ lights moved out of formation slightly so figured they were independent objects moving in formation like a flock of geese.  Having seen geese migrate all my life, quickly ruled this out.  Lights had an orangish/yellowish tint but seemed to be slightly fuzzy.  When the formation moved in front of the stars, the stars would obscure slightly but still be visible so that is also why I believe it to be multiple objects.  I have extensive knowledge of aircraft and know when I am looking at a plane, helicopter, meteor, or satellite in orbit.   Looking from my back yard to the south I can observe approaching aircraft from the west into Hobby airport, but this thing came from north to south and I first observed looking due east.   It made me think, “Phoenix Lights” when I thought about it later because of the boomerang/wedge shape and the color and it being right over the forth largest metro area in the country.   I have no doubt other people in the city probably saw this but just wrote it off as something ordinary.  In fact the only reason I am posting this here and on MUFON is so if anyone else in town saw it and is curiously searching and reads this, knows it was something very unusual and was real.

I thought I was calling attention to a shooting star, but it was too close. The object was luminous, a mauve or orange-red color. We each had a different opinion of the exact color. It seemed to be oval, but had 3 lights evenly spaced, like a triange, on the bottom. It made no noise. It flew from north to south as I saw it (I didn't look at it until it disappeared). It followed the main north/south road in town (Broadway). One of my friends said she initially thought it was a something falling from the sky, like a person, but as she looked at it she saw what the rest of us did. She also saw this thing suddenly go east when it hit the horizon (I had looked away by that point). I hate to call this thing a UFO because I still don't know if I believe in that.

I saw these while at a friends bbq and there were about six of us who witnessed it.  We even tried to video tape it but it didn't work out.  It was in the middle of the night I think it was of January of 2004 I was on winter break from college.  It was probably around 8 PM and we saw a flashing red object which was very bright in the sky.  At first we all thought it was a star but it was way to large and close to us to be one.  I thought it was a missle because it appeared to be moving and thought it was coming towards us.  We were all really skeptical until the object started moving in another direction.  People were saying it was an airplane but no airplane moves that quickly and can move in a variety of different directions at that speed.  The object moved up and down and left and right.  An airplane could not do that.  The red object also hovered in the sky for a while then elevated it self higher into the sky.  Definitely not an airplane.  As the object flew higher it came closer to the moon and pretty much covered it in the night sky.  It was at this point that maybe six or more smaller triangular aircrafts flew out of it.  The small aircrafts flew right beneath and scattered all over the sky and it had to be a scatter of 10 miles in diameter.  These small triangle aircrafts also flashed  red lights and flew all over the place way to fast and agile to be an airplane or jet.  After a while we all saw helicopters and we thought they were government helicopters but it seemed very out of place to me.  Helicopters out of no where near Newark, New Jersey, very strange.  The helicopters were black and seemed dark since it was at night.  The strange thing was that the two helicopters look like they were tracking the red flashing objects in the sky but as soon as those helicopters came out chasing them the red flashing objects simply disappeared.  After the red flashing triangle like aircrafts disappeared the black helicopters hung around for a while using spot lights.  They even got close to the house we were in. They had to be only a few miles up in the air.    We all just thought of it as nothing but its really hard not to admit it.  We never talked about it again.  I assume that it was government related and if not that then it was definitely something foreign and not of this world.  I definitely know we weren't all seeing things because we turned on the radio and people in northern NJ area reported the Flashing red lights on 1010 winds i think its called . (The AM radio station channel).  Also down the street was a restaurant filled with people coming out to the parking lot after eating dinner who all witnessed the flying objects as well.

No sound or lights! I was assigned to the local high school, as a Deputy Sheriff, to provide security for the school against student vandalism. While sitting in my patrol car I was using our night-vision monocular, which was issued to me for this assignment, to observe the sky as it was a clear morning. A few minutes later something dark in the sky caught my attention through the lens. This object was not visible to the naked eye, however, the night-vison unit accentuates any available light and this in-turn illuminated the stars brightly. The object was visible to me only because it blocked out the stars in the sky's background thus it was clearly and sharply defined although black in color.  The object was moving from West to East with absolutely no sound. My environment at the school parking lot was totally quiet with only an occasional passing car on Highway 129N which is located approximately 1,000 ft. from my location. The object had no lights and did not illuminate whatsoever.  The object's shape was something akin to a cross with two differences: 1. Picture a cross with the horizontal portion moved forward near the top but not quite. 2. There was another horizontal portion visible towards the rear. That portion was not as wide as the forward horizontal postion. Also, all portions, especially the horizontals, were about 25% broader than what you would expect on a standard (?) cross.  Obviously the size/altitude could not be determined, nor the speed. However, the night-vison I was using does not magnify and I would estimate that the apparent size from my view, if you took a coin in an outstretched hand, appeared about the size of a quarter-dollar.  My viewing time was around a couple of minutes. I lost sight of the object due to the awkward angle of trying to crane my neck from right to left as it moved across the sky. I exited my vehicle to further look for it, however I could not.  As a retired professional pilot of 20 years . . .I have seen many things I could not immediately explain, however, none of them remained a mystery for more than a few minutes.  This object is absolutely un-explainable to me and I have had two years to ponder it.

This was right over the river as we stood by the River Palm hotel, a very public type area. The Lights from the Hotel went straight up into the sky and the object went straight over head. We even thought at first perhaps it had been a flock of geese but could not have been as we heard no noise of any kind. Every time we go back to Laughlin we go the River Palm Hotel same spot and same time Dusk and look up. This has helped as we realized it was much much bigger than anything like geese because it was about the same height in the sky as the helicopters that were flying earlier. Also we noted that each round or balloon shape was nearly the size of one copter or a small VW volkswagon beetle bug or nearly as big. They looked like they were stringed together, I say that because they weren't exact as they were in a V shape and as I said about 8 on each side. It seemed to me that one side seemed to move or some on one side seemed to move. My husband the other witness didn't notice that. As we stared nearly straight up the colors seem to be almost opal or of many reflecting colors as if it were reflecting the colors which would make sense since the lights were so bright from the hotel. We could see it disappear into the clouds, gradually disappearing, also it seem to be going some what slow. Naturally no one else was around towards the other end towards other end of river nearer the Flamingo Hotel there are more people. Naturally at that time I didn't have a cell phone with camera nor a digital camera. It was just to 2 of us. I keep better records but had the info lost in my old email enfo so I am not exact on the month as a matter of fact it was somewhere between  months and 26 months ago. We could ck our records perhaps our credit card to find when we stayed at the River Palm. I have asked and even notified the airport tower of course I waited a year to do so but they said they saw nothing. I can't believe no one else saw this because it was so hudge. To small to be geese, dismissed the idea of weather balloons because of direction and way it move. It was formed line a bomerange of round alluminating light like colors. Not having lights but reflecting light. I would say it was dusk between 6pm and 7:30 pm somewhere between April 2004 and June 2004  or Sept. 2004 and Oct. 2004 ( possibly even 4/2005-6/2005 but I believe it was longer ago than that)WE avoid the place when it gets really hot or really cold.

While sitting in my back yard on a Summer day in 2004 I was looking up in the sky as I often do. The day was partly cloudy with puffy white clouds moving through the area all day. As I was enjoying my time on our yard swing watching the clouds while my then four-year-old Son was playing I seen what I can only describe as a 'Tinkerbelle' object come from out of the clouds toward my yard. I honestly shook my head and blinked my eyes in disbelief! As the object moved closer it seemed to get smaller but remained fuzzy in appearance, almost like a dandelion bloom. Buy get smaller I mean it did not seem to become larger as it came closer. Therefore I can only assume it performed some shrinking act while it moved from the clouds closer to the Earth and our yard. I would also add that it appeared larger in form as it first came out from the cloud cover.  After about a minute of it buzzing around a small area -- much in the fashion of a dragonfly -- it went out over the trees and swamp near our home. I can only guess it to have been about 50 to 100 feet from the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2006-07-16T00:00:00,41.5877,-71.4623

I know what my friends and I saw.   Back in the summer of 2004 I was attending a Wednesday night Church service in the Richpond area of Bowling Green, Kentucky.  The area is located just off the Nashville Road.   My friends and I were outside in the Church parking lot preparing to leave.  We were all just chatting away as friends do after our Church service.   All of a sudden we began to hear a very loud ""roar"" approaching our location from up in the sky-extremely low.  We looked around and could not see any lights or aircraft at all.   The ""roaring"" sound became louder, yet we could still see no object whatsoever.   All of a sudden I looked directly overhead of us and saw a very large black triangular object flying extremely low.  My friends saw the object too.   At first we thought it was probably a B-2 Stealth Bomber, but why would it be flying so low?  The object was flying only around 200 feet above us.  Also, why did the object have no lights flashing as all aircraft normally do-especially flying so low?   We could only see the outline of the triangle, and it was really large.  It was no blimp either.  We all observed the mysterious large object until it just simply disappeared into the night sky.   Looking back, I do not think that this was an aircraft we saw that night.  The whole episode was really strange.  Whatever this thing was defies logical explaination.   Some people might think that we are crazy, but this event really happened.

(no!  this is not a joke) It's been a long time since I saw this craft. It definetely never leaves my mind. I know I'm not crazy nor is my 15 yr old who saw this craft with me. the strange thing is that we were 5 total and only two of us saw it in plain view. hope i can make myself clear, bear with me folks.  it was dark and late, my 4 kids and I walked over to the nieghborhood park . the park is only 2 minutes from my house. when we got to the park, i sat down a moment and happen to look into the sky,  north of us over the 1-10 freeway.  I saw a big bright light. it looked really round.  the light stood there or seemed to be still for about 5 minutes. then i saw it descend as if it were falling. it stopped decending then started coming our way which was south of it's location. my son and i made a fuss over this light and became concerened as it started getting closer to us, we noticed it was right over us in less than 2 minutes.  I cannot explain the length of time that we stared at this scary thing in the sky, time seemed to pass forward and we didnt realize what had happen to us for about 2 1/2  hours. it was after 1:20 am when we cought ourselves screaming and running into the house and the 3 other kids ages vary from 9 to 14 yrs of age did not see a thing nor did they understand why my 15 yr old son and I were running frantically from the park.  only that we were five total and it only attracted 2 of us. please anyone, if this same thing happen to you please let us all know.  This is what my son and I saw that night.  I do hereby swear and promise on the holy bible in the presence of our lord as our whitness that this is the truth and the whole truth as best remembered so help us God.   In the sky above us this night, we saw a huge pitch black triange with dull soft lighting coming from the 2 back corners of the craft as though it were lit up slightly from the inside.and maybe light was visable through a dim window or glass. it had  a red light that glowed from the bottom center but not bright, it was more like a red light like from heat that's generated.. like how hot coals would glow. I could see well because the craft had descended so low that I could hear it and I could see something undernieth the belly. like markings. it was not a stealth bomber nor did it have any other shape other than a perfect triangle. it was very still for the most part. long enough for me to notice the sound that it made.  the height it hovered was no more than the tallest street lights in a city. it seemed to be as wide as maybe a football field. it was very  still and very quiet. my son and I froze with fear and ran away leaving my kids at the park. when i realize what i had done i ran back to the park and it was still there hovering over the park and that's when i noticed the strange lines under the craft. it seem to have markings like a map. they were black or very dark or smokey grey. and barely visable. the craft did make a sound. it was a whispering soft humming unlike anything i heard. my ac makes more noise than the craft did. i would say the sound was similar to that of a brand new computer that hums perfectly with just a slight bit of air flowing through it. the scary thing is that we were so close to it and only 2 of us saw it, what I dont get is we get to the park around 11:05pm no later that for sure. but cannot remeber why it took us almost 3 hours to run home! our home was only 2 houses away, less than 1 minute down the sidewalk. when we ran away we saw it take off slowly to the south west towarsd phx. I watched it for 2 minutes then it simply vanished. most of all we cannot explain the loss of time and why only 2 of us saw this triangle in the sky.

We were returning home from seeing a movie, and we were driving westward on New Scotland Rd, Albany, NY to our home in Slingerlands, NY.  I commented to my wife that ""the plane"" outside the car was flying really low.  This also seemed odd because the object was is not in the normal flight path of planes coming to or leaving from the Albany International Airport.  I slowed down my car, turned off the radio and put the windows down.  It was surprisingly quiet, emitting a sound that was similar to a jet engine from far away, but the object was very close.  It was either moving very slowly or hovering in one location.  My wife commented that we were traveling faster than the object and I would estimate that my speed at the time was around 30 mph.  The object was in the general shape of a plane.  It had 2 ""headlight"" like lights in the front of it, that were emitting beams that could be seen in the overcast skies.  There were several other points of light along what looked like its wing and also several points of light along the fuselage.  The object's ""headlight"" beams were pointing in an eastward direction.  The object was just too bizarre so we had to stop and pull over.  I pulled the car into the lot of a private school, Albany Academy of the Holy Names.  The parking lot curved back towards the east and at that point the object began flying away.  It disappeared from our sight in several seconds, most likely less than 10 seconds.  It appeared to be heading in an eastbound direction.  We waited approximately a minute and we could not see or hear the object.  I turned the car around in the parking lot and headed back towards New Scotland Rd.  Just before we turned right onto the road (heading west towards our home), we saw the object very far away heading in a northbound direction.

What is it? A group of 8 just returned from a fishing trip to a fishing resort near Kenora, Ontario, Canada.  Saturday evening September 2nd I saw what appeared to be a bright twinkling star to the northeast of my location.  As a former BioMedical Photographer I wished I had my camera and telescope to attempt to take some pictures. As I observed it more I thought it to be unusual due to the fact that the star didn't so much twinkle as it blinked in color between white, red and green.  I didn't give it much thought other than wishing I could take some pictures thinking it was Mars being so close to the earth this past August.  Sunday evening the 3rd of September a group of 6 were sitting on the porch at our cabin when a member pointed to the northeast sky and asked ""What in the world is that?""  He was stunned at the appearance of what seemed to be a star blinking between the colors of white, red and green.  I mentioned to him and the rest of the group that I had seen the same thing the night before which was on going until I went to bed around 10 p.m.  The six of us sat that evening for hours debating what it could possibly be.  I am convinced it was just a star or planet but I am not convinced it was Mars.  Should Mars have not been more to the east or east-southeast of where we were?  What strikes me is upon observing it at 20:35 on Sunday evening until we all went to bed at 23:00 the position of the ""star"" had not changed.  The rotation of the earth in a 2.5 hour period should have put the position further west as the evening went on.  I do believe in UFO's due to the fact that me and my best friend saw one up close in the early 1980's.  I am not convinced this was a UFO but I am not convinced it is a star or a planet.  Were all wondering what it is.  This has been an on going topic of conversation within our group to this day.  Were an educated group ranging from agronomists, financial experts, successful business owners and a professional photographer.  Were are very curious and are looking for ! an answe r.

We arrived just as the sun began to sink below the horizon, and decided to sit and watch the stars come out.  I attempted to take some photos with my digital camera of the sun setting; only to find that when the flash would go off we noticed several small particals, for lack of a better term, all around us.  When the flash would go off we could clearly see these particals, they appeared white.  Upon viewing the pictures taken the particals appeared as multi-colored specks of light. We thought nothing more of it dismissing it as some freak occurance.  After the first hour or so it became quite dark and I noticed a bright solid white light moving across the sky, I watched it intently knowing full well it was NOT an airplane (no flashing lights of any kind) and thought it was simply an orbital satalite.  The object flew across the sky in a West to East trajectory and as it crossed over where we sat the light grew in brightness and then quickly vanished. I figured it was just another random sighting, and hadn't had time to ask my boyfriend if he'd seen it as well, so I though nothing more of it.  I'd say about twenty minutes later I noticed another solid light, not as bright moving from the North to the South. It flew over head at a high altitude and as it did so my boyfriend pointed to it and asked if it was in fact moving.  As I was about to reply in the affirmative, the light stopped.  It hovered for several minutes and then moved quite rapidly back from the South to North. This light continued to move from N to S and then back again.  It would stop and hover above us for several minutes and then continue on it's path.  Over the next several hours we counted at least sixteen more lights in the sky.  All moving in random patterns at different altitudes.  The objects would move, stop, hover, zig-zag, and change direction mid-flight.  They would form triangle shapes with stars and then increase and decrease the sizes of these triangles at will.  At 11:00 p.m. there was a bright light that came over the horizon and proceeded to follow in the same manner, the only differences were this one was closer and much brighter, and along with the solid white light there were mulitcolored lights that flashed in random patterns.  We watched this light for quite some time marveled in the way it danced and at it's brightness.  It was then that we noticed two pairs of faint lights moving in perfect unison.  One pair was located to the South and the second was to the NorthEast. They seemed to dance across the night's sky in a most beautiful and random fashion.  None of the lights would stray too far from where they were first seen.  They would move a certain distance and then return to their original location.  We spent a great deal of time trying to determine if it was simply ours eyes that were playing tricks on us, watching stars to see if they moved; and found nothing.  We spotted planes of vairous sizes and knew that this was not the explaination either.  I have over the years seen many strange lights in the night sky, but this was the first time I had ever seen so many lights at the same time in the same area.  This was also the first time I have ever had a witness with me to collaborate my sighting.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,44.6172,-86.182

We got out our video camera and zoomed in on it.  We could not only see one light (flashing), but we saw two separate disc type shapes very close together in the sky.  At first glance it looked like headlights on a car in the sky.  They (the lights) appeared to be spinning.  The two disc shapes had red and green lights which blinked in a radom pattern.  Below the two disc shapes a very small solid color green or blue light would appear and go toward the discs and back. We live within 20 miles of Fort Knox.  We got into our car to drive closer to it.  We drove from Elizabethtown North toward Radcliff.  As we would appear to be getting closer to the objects, they then would move.  We turned and went in West toward Vine Grove.  These objects were moving now rapidly.  By the time we arrived in Vine Grove, keeping the objects in sight the entire time, they just disappeared. In an effort to get closer, no matter how far we would drive it would just stay about the same distance from us.  We drove back to Elizabethtown talking in the car about what we saw.  Too bad we could not get closer to get a better video. As we were one block from home, just over the tops of some one story houses, the object we had been chasing for 2 hours, appeared to our left, VERY CLOSE.  The lights appeared to be less than 100 feet from our vehicle.  My wife grabbed the video camera.  As we prepared to stop, one light disapeared, then the second one disappear in less than a second.   We were on the side of the road looking into a black sky.  There was nothing.  The night was very clear and we had with us three other people who saw the same thing.

When I was walking across the yard I noticed what appeared to be two very bright lights in the sky, one higher than the other. They looked like close stars. I kept walking in the direction of the lights toward the field and stopped at the field to let the dogs do their business while I watched. I had assumed that they were helicopters looking for one of our neighbors who have had a shady past; however, I saw that there were no beams of light coming from the craft as a spotlight would. They were simply bright, a whitish yellow light like that of a typical household bulb.  As I watched the craft appeared to be at about the same altitude, but about .5-1 mile away from each other, making the distant one appear lower in the sky. They were motionless in the air, simply hovering. While watching I noticed that each craft had two strobes that alternated. One red and one white. These lights blinked in unison to each other although on separate craft. The crafts then dimmed simultaneously, although the strobes continued to blink, still in harmony. The craft then traveled off in the same direction parallel to each other, still at the same altitude.  I could not hear any noise, and am very accustomed to seeing and hearing helicopters in the area. Although I cannot judge exactly how far the closest craft was, I would estimate approximately 1/4 mile. The crafts continued in their path until they were out of sight behind a forest that was closer to me and obstructing the view.  Again, I could detect no sound and it was a clear quite night at about 55 degrees F.  This occurred between Lyons Mill Rd and Eldersburg MD just on the SW side of Liberty RD.

I only noticed it out of the driver’s side window because the pulsating glow caught my attention in the dark night sky. At first I though it was a Radio tower light, but it was too long of a streak of orange in the sky and too high for it to be coming from a tower. It kind of looked like the fiery exhaust from a missile. It was in the North East portion of the sky. I could see some stars behind it, but don’t know what constellation was in view at that time of the morning. I estimate the orange streak was about 6” in length (using my thumb and forefinger at arms length) about 55 degrees above the horizon. It was a steady orange glow that kind of pulsated. It kind of looked like it had a head. I pulled over on the side of the highway to observe it twice on my way to New Orleans and tried to video it with a cheap video camea I carry with me. The video did not come out. It was still visible in the pre-dawn sky when I got to Avondale Louisiana and was almost directly over head at that time. I was not able to continue observing it due to heavy traffic a little after 6 AM. It kind of reminded me of a comet with a tail, but I never heard anything in the news about one or anything else.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,29.69969230769231,-91.06912307692308

It is possible (maybe), if deemed necessary on site, to obtain a magnetic flux density measuring device.  This would be valuable if and only if there appears to be residual effects of emr. I will also closely examine the crystalline structure of the salt to see if a possible disturbance caused the crystals to align much the same as metal particles are disturbed by household magnets. A closer examination will be made if the intial determination shows that these are not atv tracks common to our area.

On November 2nd, 2007 at approximately 9:00 pm, my wife and I were driving home from Salt Lake City to our home in Eagle Mountain in Utah.  We have just come from eating dinner in the greater Salt Lake City area, and were nearly home. My grandfather also lives in Eagle Mountain and was driving just a few minutes ahead of us in traffic.  We were driving west on S.R. 73 when my wife pointed out to me what appeared to be a row cars parked on the mountainside, facing us with their lights on. However, this row of lights was perfectly straight.  And within seconds it became clear that the row of lights was not on the ridgeline, but rising above it.  The thin horizontal row of non-colored lights was obviously in flight and heading toward us.  Within moments a massive, black, triangular-shaped craft (with lights everywhere on the front and bottom) was flying over our car.  It was huge.  Amidst all of the regular looking bright lights, there was one red light on the bottom, and one blue light.  (Note:  These were NOT on the edges of the craft, like on the wingtips of a conventional plane, but just slightly offset from the center of the bottom of it.)  I rolled down the window, and could hear no sound as the craft flew directly overhead. (Relative to our direction of travel, it approached from the “1 o’clock” position when it was just a thin line of lights, and after it crossed the highway and flew over us it was going toward the “7 o’clock” position.) It was visible, start to finish for about 60 seconds.  No other cars on the road appeared to slow down, pull over, or otherwise pay much attention to the craft, though, with it lit up as it was someone else had to have seen it.  I would like to note that the craft would not have been noticeable, perhaps at all, if the lights had not been turned on.  It was dark at that time of night, and it would have blended in with the night sky if it simply would have turned its lights off. This was a jet-black colored triangle, with a slightly crescent moon-shaped rear.  My wife noticed what appeared to be a ‘transparent bottom’ of some kind.  We could not see in it, but she at least got the feeling that perhaps it was designed for them to see out.  To get an idea of size, if you had to hold something at arm’s length to cover it up when it was overhead, you would have to hold a large piece of paper, perhaps 24”x 24”- at arm’s length.  That “might” be big enough to block out how big this thing was when it was directly overhead.  Lastly, my grandfather was arriving at the house when we were still on S.R. 73.  As I said before, he was about a 2 minute drive time ahead of us.  He can corroborate exactly the same object.  We live just off S.R. 73, so his vantage point was practically the same. He also reports that the huge craft made no sound as it glided over.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,40.3141,-112.0069

Myself, my brother, and my uncle were on the way home from Philadelphia that night.  We were just going off the exit ramp off of 55. Our exit was 50B.  We were turning off when finally I said something to my uncle about these 2 lights directly next to each other that I saw and had been following us for about 5 minutes. He said he had noticed them too and thought he was crazy.  We kept going towards my house when finally we came close enough to the object to actually see it good.  He pulled over on the side of Canvasback Drive and we got out.  The object was close enough he said to ""shoot it with a paint ball gun"".  We were very excited, myself mostly from doing about a year of UFO research so far.  It was a triangle with 2 lights and very large (about 30-50 feet from point to point).  Also, very thick probably a good 30 feet. My brother contacted a friend who lived close to where we were and he told him to go outside.  The boys first response when my brother told him to go outside was ""Holy Shit"". At this point my brother hung up and took a picture of the object. The picture came out very clear and shows a triangle with 2 lights on the object. The three of us were astonished by the object and it flew over us very slow, we could see it for about 1 minute to a minute and 30 seconds. After it got past us about 300 yards, it sped up pretty fast and just kept flying. I immediately called my friend who lived in the direction the UFO was going and told him to look into the sky. He saw the object and instantly said ""Wow, that thing is hauling ass."" At this point we could start to see little red object all around the sky. They were flickering and we had no idea what they were (I researched this later and found out that a meteor had broke that night and was said to be red). But, that did not see the second triangle object we saw. After the red flickering started my uncle said he was actually getting frightened and we got in the car and went to my house. When we arrived my brother and him went inside to tel! l my par ents the news. I stayed outside and was convinced there were more out here. I know that a lot of the times people see UFOs they see more than 1. About 20 minutes later after my brother had came back out to try to see more with me we saw another triangle come from behind my house. This object was a little higher (probably 2,000-3,000 feet in the air. It was the same shape of the previous object with 2 lights again. The only difference with this one was that when it passed we could see these lights on the back. I noticed right away 5 lights across the whole back. They were as thick as the craft and were very fast. They blinked one after another very fast from left to right. It was amazing to see this and me and my brother were speechless. After this object passed I stayed outside till about 11:00 o clock and saw nothing else except an odd amount of planes. There were so many planes that my mom was checking the news, thinking about calling the police, and even thinking about calling the airport or air force. I know that on clear nights you can see everything but there were over 250 planes that night that I saw and they all came within 2 hours. That is an extraordinary amount. After being a believer I now believe that this is real and is a serious matter even more. If I could send pictures from my phone I would but my phone does not support that. I am trying to take a picture of the picture with a actual camera and send it via e-mail. Thank you for your time.   ((name deleted))",2008-03-04T00:00:00,,

It was quite remote at the time, you had to travel down a five mile dirt road to get to it and it was completely secluded.  The guesthouse in which they resided faced a pasture of approximately 100 yards, which ended at the base of a very high, steap canyon wall.  Behind this wall was a drop off into the canyon with a running creek at the bottom.   My mother, one of my aunts, and myself were staying there for a visit.   On this particular night, they along with my grandmother were inside the house talking and my grandad and I were sitting out in the enclosed porch at the front of the house.  He was just beginning to tell me my nightly bedtime story  when we both noticed a yellow light, gradually growing and raising up from behind the far left side of the canyon wall at the end of the pasture.   He said ""What the hell is that"" and raised from his chair.   I was attracted to the pretty light and went for the door to go toward it.  He yelled at me and grabbed me back inside and at that moment we saw the object itself rise up from the same location.  It was a dark night but we could see that it was disc shaped by the illumination of it's own light; bright, bright yellow came from each of the large square windows, and apparently that created enough light to cast around the object and allow us to see it.   This next part is embarrassing because it sounds so science fiction, but the object made no sound except for the classic rather high pitched ""beep"" with approximately 1 second intervals.  It ""glided"" up slowly; I cannot describe the speed excep t to say that it was like counting ""1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, 3 one thousand, etc.  It was traveling slowly, almost like cruising.  It made no darting or quick moves.   My grandad yelled ""Oh my God, oh my God!  It's a UFO!""  Then he started screaming for my grandmother and my mom and my aunt, screaming their names and jumping up and down.  During all of this I was just staring at the object, loving the color and wanting to go toward it.   By the time he managed to stumble into the house the object had been slowly moving over the canyon wall to the right, and before he could get anyone to come out it had descended down behind the wall at the same speed at which it had appeared.  By the time the others got outside there was no sign of it.   For years afterward, Grandad was laughed at by family members; it didn't help that he was a practical joker.  But one time years later when I was in my early twenties, I was visiting him in his apartment in CA with my mother when someone brought up the UFO subject and I made the casual remark  ""like the one that Gramps and I saw"" and at that instant the 80 year old man jumped up and went nuts yelling ""You remember! YOU REMEMBER!""    After that, nobody laughed at us anymore.   Through the sands of time, the details of the object's description had faded from my conscious memory.   Then about four years ago, I was in the public library in Show Low AZ; I live nearby.  I was waiting for the person that I'd hitched a ride into town with to finish up and I picked up a book on unsolved mysteries, UFO sightings, etc.   As I was flipping through the book, a page turned and THERE IT WAS, MY UFO!  The reason I know it to be the same one is that the instant I saw the picture, all the breath left my body; I gasped and I fell back onto the wooden reference table and onto a man who was sitting there reading.  I've seen lots of UFO pictures before and I've never had that experience.  It was the same one; I'd stake my life on it.  It was a black and white photo, and the caption said it had been taken in New Mexico in 1965.   I was just thinking about my favorite color throughout my childhood, it was the ""lemon yellow"" from the 64 count Crayola box.  I have only recently understood why, it was the same yellow as the lights coming from the craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Neither did we see any windows or other openings. It was simply a solid, highly reflective object, that moved quietly above the tunnel at a very slow but constant speed.

I have heard the story a few times, but I got him to write it all down. This is what happened, in his own words-  Encounter with Flaying Saucers?  	One evening in November 1973, I was sitting in my living room reading when the phone rang. It was the mother of my daughter’s friend that lived about 8 km north of Viking, AB. She said to get my camera and come out fast as there is strange lights moving up and down the coulees - low and slow. The animals were going wild in the area.  	I phoned Don, who worked with me for Nova (pipe-line co) to go with me. On the way out we stopped at another farm. It was all lit up in the barn, the house and the yard. The dog was barking at the bush. We proceeded out to the friends place and they asked us in for a coffee. The TV was on and soon there was a lot of lines and static on the screen. Outside we go, sure enough there were seven orange colored lights in the south sky all in formation, roughly four miles away. I took pictures of this with a 400 mm telephoto lens. We got into the company half ton truck and headed out in the hills. I put the radio on a “no” station with the volume up and sat there waiting. Soon the radio had static. My companion looked out and up. There was a bright light right above us, roughly three or four hundred feet. How come the light appeared all of a sudden? We were looking all around, but didn’t notice it until the radio turned to static. I jumped out for more pictures. Being so close these pictures were all black. Maybe it gave off x-rays. If that’s the case why wouldn’t the whole roll be wiped out? And not just the close up ones? I don’t know.  	This light, to describe it was like looking into a cutting torch for welding, very bright orange and blue. It soon drifted off to the east, behind some hills. There was no sound at all. When I was photographing the formation of the lights, we could see some helicopters from the Wainwright Army base coming to check this. We would see the marker lights on them. These orange lights took off in a flash when they got close.  	Getting back into the truck, which I parked, it barely started, and that’s all. Something was running the battery down, for we could smell rotten eggs. This thing was reversing the polarity and running the battery down. Another few minutes and we would have been walking back.  	We returned to town to a service station where the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) and some people were talking about the sightings. A girl was giving her boyfriend hell for passing gas - but it was their battery. The police officer reported the same drained battery in his cruiser. The RCMP said the army base to the east, had nothing for maneuvers on and this cop had the farmer with him that owned the farm where we were. The cop, wanted to see my pictures first, but nothing turned out except the seven lights in formation at a distance.  	Some farmers later told me their cows and horses they had run through the closed doors of the barn and into the trees. They would not come out as they could sense something out there. There was definitely something strange going on there. This gives a person a real eerie feeling. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in November 1973 is approximate.

I had seen a movie (The Neptune Factor) and was walking back to the barracks.   Passing through a parking lot, I heard a tremendous sound - imagine something the size of a 747 passing 100 feet overhead with its engines shut down.  It was not the wind...  I have spent quite a bit of time outdoors and know it was not something like that.  Being a glider pilot, I know the sound that aircraft make when they fly without power - and it was almost like that, but 100x louder than any sailplane.  When this happened, I stopped and looked up.  Unfortunately, there were bright lights in the parking lot and I could not see if the stars were obscured.  NTC is directly in the flight path of Lindberg Field.  But if this was an airliner gliding to a landing at the airport, it never would've made it.  I thought perhaps I was hearing things, until I looked across the parking lot and saw another sailor, standing still and looking straight up.  I walked over to him, and he asked me, ""What the hell was THAT?""  I asked him what happened, and he described back to me exactly what I experienced. ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the source of this report for his having submitted such a excellent rendition of what he experienced aurally.  We wonder whether he might have been aural witness to the vortices, which are generated in the atmosphere at the wing tips of aircraft.  They descend to the surface, seconds or minutes after an airliner has passed, and they are very audible, as they twist at high speed.  Given that the witness was close to Lindberg Field makesus wonder about this this possibility.  The phenomenon is very common, close to airports where heavy aircraft are landing.

We lived out in the country at the time and as we were driving home, we came up a hill and just as we topped the hill and were going to go down the other side, an object came over our car just above our heads, so low and so fast that we both ducked down thinking something was going to strike us.  It encompassed the whole width of our peripheral vision appeared to be just above treetop level.   I jammed on the brakes and we jumped out and saw nothing behind us.  I then backed up to see if it could have been ground fog.  This time as we came back up the hill there was no evidence of any ground fog and the night was fairly clear as I recall.  We had no idea of what this could have been, but it was huge, shiny and was over and past us so fast that if there were lights visible, we could never have seen them.

It was a chilly night in October, there wasn't a cloud in the sky that night.  Living in the country there were no lights on or around, thee sky was full of stars.  While I was laying on the hill on my front lawn staring up into the sky at the stars a super bright object that first appeared to be a shooting star shot across the night sky.  This object had no tail trailing it and it stopped on a dime.  It was very bright, larger and alot brighter than the north star.  This object stood out among the stars and seemed to pulse a little bit.  Seconds later two more shot across the sky one behind the other and stopped in the same location as the first light, it appeared to be in a triangular pattern.  After a few seconds these super bright star like lights sstarted shooting across the sky as if the were following one another.  The speed was incredible, they would move from the western portion of the sky to the eastern portion in a spilt second and each would stop on a dime.  After a couple of minutes it appeared as if the came closer to the earth because they increased in size and the bright white light became more intence.  After zipping around for a few minutes each object zipped off towards the eastern skyline following one another and vanished in a split second.  I layed there for a couple of minutes to see if they would come back, they did, as fast as they disappeared that had returned.  They were shooting all over the sky as if they were playing some kind of game, after a few more minutes they seemed to shoot off into space because they did not travel across the night sky the way they had been.

There was one big circle and several small circles around the big circle...it was a circle of rotating colorful lights.  There was no sound. We were afraid and hid behind our neighbors camper. The neighbors had a row of bushes and we looked over to the bushes and from behind the bushes..what I would describe as a laser light was coming over the bush and disappearing before it hit the ground. The laser light looked like little red squares. This was way before I knew anything about laser's or anything like that. The craft was so big we could not see the sky...all we saw were rotating lights. We eventually took off and ran home. I remember running home crying and my dad made me draw exactly what I had saw. I know that UFO's exist because I know what I saw when I was a child. I've tried to find out if anyone else has seen the laser beam lights.

We were watching the evening sky grow dark.  The sun set around 9ish.  When I first started viewing the night sky a sliver of a moon and a bright star to the right were visible if you are facing the pacific ocean. As the darkness increased I became aware of two brighter objects appearing between the moon and the bright star.  At first I thought they were stars that were further away and needed more darkness to be seen.  That was until they started to move.  They took off from over the ocean headed southeast at a fairly decent pace.   By this point I have caught my boyfriends attention because I practically had my face planted in the windshield. It was at this point I asked the question to no one in particular and to myself out loud ""What in the hell is that?""  My boyfriend noticed what I was seeing and we both started exiting the car, him to get the camcorder out of the trunk I already had my camera in hand and was ready to take pictures.  I started shooting as soon as I could but didn't think I was getting anything so I kept looking over the camera to make sure I was pointing it in the right direction.  Meanwhile my boyfriend was getting the camcorder trying to capture what we were seeing.  While I was trying to capture the still shots I witnessed a triangular shaped silver object appear 40 to 50 feet above my head going to the right or northwardly up the beach no sound accompanied any of these objects.  When I gave up in my attempts to get pictures and turned back to my boyfriend to see if he was getting it on film I witnessed them disappear into the southeastern sky.  May be a minute later we witnessed two light seemingly further away and dimmer flying a bit further apart flying from the SW to the NE.  We are not sure if they were the same two or two new ones. We watched the sky for about another half an hour and witnessed nothing else at that location.  We finally headed back to our motel room about a quarter mile from the original sigh ting.  We discussed what each had seen my boyfriend confirmed the two bright lights I had seen but he says he saw a third light I didn't see forming a triangle shape with the first two but he reports that he didn't witness the triangular silver object that I seen headed north.   We spent the rest of that evening watching the skies off the oregon coast and an orange glow of what looked to be something burning on the horizon where the sky meets the ocean.  We don't know what we saw that night. We both agree it was like nothing we have ever seen before.  However we did capture video of this event. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??

They were only there for about 15 sec longer then a shooting star would last and also had no tail.  They were heading to the East, if I had to I could shoot an azimuth.

I looked again and saw the object much futher away, yet still very visible. There were no markings whatsoever on it--in fact, it was perfectly smooth with no indentations, bolts, lights, exhaust, or anything of the ilk. It was floating rapidly in a straight line. No accelerations--just a steady fast, straight dash. A moment later, it was completely out of sight. I had a good 25 seconds to inspect this object, and I know very well that I was not hallucinating.

The yacht was moored at the furthest end of the river, I travelled there with two friends of mine; all of us are in our 40’s.  We arrived at the boat ramp just before midnight; it was a very clear night, with no wind.  As Whitianga is in the country, the stars there are very bright and we had often seen shooting stars.  The countryside there is very hilly with a mountain range between us and Auckland on the opposite side of the river.  Auckland, our biggest city is about 100km from Whitianga.  I reversed the car down the boat ramp and proceeded to unload my inflatable and the rest of the gear with Barry.  After about a minute I heard one of my friends, Peter yell out.  He said, ""What is that!""  Barry and I turned around; Peter was looking at the other side of the river.  We replied, ""What?"" Because we couldn’t see anything.  Then, after about 2-3 seconds, a huge bright light, absolutely massive, lit up the entire sky for about 2 seconds then went of again, after 2-3 seconds it came on again.  It did this 5 times, including the time that Peter saw it without us.  The light was so bright, and covered such a vast area that I could only imagine that a nuclear explosion could cause something like that.  After the fifth time, there was a pulsating light that covered a very wide area of the sky above us and was traveling over us, it was not very bright, but we could see it, and it also made a very low kind of growling noise like a dog snarling, but duller, it passed over us and was gone.

It was, and looked liked like, a window or rectangle floating above the north end of Seattle, WA.  I was on the east side of Lake Washington driving west across an over ramp from I-405.  It seemed visible enough that this would have been reported on the news.  I heard nothing about it.  Therefore, I chalked it up as something unusual but since no one else saw it, it would be like talking to a brick wall if I tried to explain to anyone what I saw. However, later I talked to someone that saw the same thing quite a few years prior.  It isn’t really anything fantastic enough to report so we both just left it alone. I lost sight of the one I was looking at because of traffic behind me and no place to pull over for a longer look.  But it was there, just sitting in the sky and not moving. It had definite rectangular shaped perimeter to it and from I saw there was clear sky looking through the inside of the rectangle. Has this type of event ever been reported before?  After reading a sighting by Col. Phillip Corso he mentioned he saw a UFO fly straight up from the ground and through a rectangular opening in the sky and it was gone.  He reported this while on active duty in the army. ((name deleted))",2007-04-27T00:00:00,47.604556307692306,-122.16441774358974

As I am quite familar with aircraft lighting I knew this was not a typical aircraft as no green or white light was visible anytime during my observation.

The sky was still hazy, but I could make out the brighter stars.   I always look up when I go outside, it's the amateur astronomer (for 25 years now) in me.  Turning a street corner, something spectacular caught my eyes just above the stars Dubhe and Merak in the asterism the Big Dipper.  The Big Dipper, standing in the sky with its handle down and dipper pointing up, I couldn't help but notice two bright yellow lights, the one on the right brighter and about one degree higher than the other.   At first, my mind automatically thought ""planetary conjunction.""  I've seen many.  They were both perfectly still.  Then I realized the zodiac goes nowhere near the Dipper, thus no planets could be in that direction.   The bottom planet-like beacon looked like and was about as bright as Saturn is in the sky.  The brighter one was about the brightness of Jupiter, but it was as yellow as the dimmer one.   I immediately turned and started to double-time back to the house for the camera, turning once half way to the house.  When I turned that one time, the brighter one flared up and dimmed.  The other was still there, but dimmed out 20 seconds after the first one did.   I checked the Heavens-Above website, because my first guess was the International Space Station.  It turns out that the ISS was in the area ONE HOUR before my sighting, and this was two UFO's, not one.   Could anyone shed any light on this?  My only guess is that it was something that separated from the ISS or something like that.  No hoax, folks, this was the real deal.  Thanks, Peter.  Regards, MG from Pacheco.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

My husband & I saw a series of 3 flashes high in the sky looking towards the North while sitting on our back deck. I am not sure of the time but it was approx. 8:30 pm. The sky was very clear & the moon had not risen high enough to wash out the stars. There were also several commercial aircraft flying at different altitudes. Some were on approach to Charlotte Douglas & some were much higher. We did not see a craft. We saw the first 2 bright white flashes about 1 second apart. Then after approx. 7-8 seconds, we saw 1 more flash in the same spot. We didn't see anything else. Since we couldn't see any shape of a craft & didn't hear any sound, we are assuming that it was from something high in the sky. It very well may be something quite ""earthly"" & not a ufo. Approximately 5 minutes later we observed a moving craft that had a bright white light on the front and a blinking white light behind that light. It was traveling very fast compared to the commercial aircraft in the sky & was low in the sky, also traveling towards the North.

I recieved a phonecall from my husband on Friday March 10,06 about 8:40pm telling me to run outside and view this big red light object in the sky. I ran out with the cordless phone still in hand.  He was about 2 miles or so from home at his Dad's house off of Meyer and Imperial.  As he had arrived at his dads getting off his car he said he looked up at the moon, (1/4 moon that night), and saw this big glowing red object.  As he watched it for a minute or so, it appeared to be dropping something or shooting something out the bottom.  He said it looked like possible flames, or lights. As I viewed from my front yard, it was stationary.  It sat at about 2 miles or so in the south/east sky, I was looking towards the right and up from my driveway.  It's kind of hard to judge the distance from me. It wasn't real high up either, but it shimmered a vibrant red that you really couldn't get an accurate shape of it. It appeared as being oval.  Now thinking back, I'd say with an arms length measurement, it appeared to be about the size of a hot air balloon, not too high up and not too low. We were experiencing a storm from Alaska at this time, but the skies were pretty clear. There was some clouds around, but not in the area of this object. The sky was really clear in the area it was. As I watched it in awe I began calling alot of family and friends so they could see it.  In years past I have viewed some strange objects, etc, and I wanted everyone I know in this area to see this.  The only ones I got a hold of were my two brothers.  One, who lives in Montebello, and the other who was visiting here from Hesperia.  He had been here earlier in the day and went to do some visiting in Montebello, taking my youngest son with him. It was stationed in this position for about 5 minutes, then slowly started moving towards the north/east, and then became stationary again.  This time I was looking at it directly infront of me.  It sat directly above the house across the street now, and just to the right lower area of the moon. As it sat there for about 7 to 10 minutes it started doing a slow flashing.  It would go off and on with a duration of about 4 seconds in between flashes.  It flashed this way maybe about 5-6 times, then stopped. I live on a busy street, Gunn Ave and Mulberry Dr, and I can't believe that all the cars driving by didn't even notice it.  Nobody was pulling over to look at it!  At about this time, my brother and son arrived. I had called them on the cell phone to tell them about it. They were on their way here to Whittier from Montebello. They weren't even a full mile from here when I called.  They pulled over and saw it from the intersection of Laurel and Lambert, then kept driving here keeping it in view. When they arrived, it was still stationary across the street from my house.  We watched it as it started to flash again with the same amount of duration.  As I watched with them now for another 5 minutes or so, it started to slowly move again, still going in a north/east looking direction. It stopped again.  This time it looked to be in the area of Whittier Blvd and maybe Colima.  It appeared smaller at this distance, but you could still see it.  It became stationary again, and started to again flash a few times.   At one point it went totally dark, like it had disappeared.  It was out for about 10 seconds, then came back on.  It started moving further away, and by this time the clouds in that area of the sky from the storm seemed to swallow it up and we couldn't see it any longer. Upon discussing with my brother from Montebello of his account from that distance away, he was able to run and get his binoculars.  I could have ran in my house to get a camera, but was afraid I would miss something, so I just watched and called everyone. He said through the binoculars, even at a distance of about 8 miles west of my house that the object appeared to be of a triangle shape.  He must of had some good binoculars, because I thought it looked to be oval. Again it was shimmering alot, so I couldn't see the exact outline of it.  At one point he said a different colored light on each end of the triangle came on.  A green one, yellow one, and I think he said a red one.  To me, the whole time it appeared to be a very vibrant ruby red shimmer.  When I saw it flashing on and off, he said that it was flipping.  The kind of flipping you would get from flipping a coin. From his distance, he said at arms length it appeared to be the size of his thumb. I can't explain the differences in our views of the shape, only that he may of had an advantage with using the binoculars. It was just an awesome sight to see!   When discussing its viewing with my husband later in the evening, he said the flight pattern of the airplanes seemed to have changed too, as if being diverted away at a further distance.  My son also commented at the time of the viewing that its strange we weren't seeing any jets being sent out to investigate.  Didn't anybody else see it???  I also remembered a few years back that a very similar object had been spotted in Montebello and Monterey Park Ca too.  It came out in the Montebello Newspaper.  I also found it posted on this site: http://www.100megsfree4.com/farshores/ufo03us6.htm  If anyone else in this area seen the same thing, please post it!

The closest description I can think of is airplane lights, but they did not move and they were in a vertical line. Because I can hear the interstate highway from my home, I couldn't tell if there was a sound coming from the lights, but it seemed that there was the same kind of humming sound I've heard airplanes make at a high altitude. I've never seen a satellite from earth, so it is possible that my sighting was of a satellite. I have attempted to find photographs of satellites on the internet, but have not been able to find anything that looks like what I saw. The lights did not blink or move at all in the time I watched. Although I assume a satellite would be above the clouds, and it was a cloudy night, it may be that there was a break in the cloud cover.

It was impossible to tell if it was a line of stars or lights or a continuous bar of color, but it looked more like 3 stars - blue, red, blue. The night was mostly clear on the 13th, but the lower part of the horizon was slightly overcast. The moon was apparently already down in the west, because my first impression was that it was probably a reflection on the moon. Then I realized that it was definitely not the moon, and the moon wasn't visible. On the 13th (at 1:30 AM), the sky was very overcast with no stars. The moon was visible behind the clouds, and the night was bright in spite of the clouds. The object was very bright and appeared to be among rather than behind the clouds. I watched it for about 10 minutes each time; the first time, I went inside because it didn't seem to be doing anything and I assumed it was simply some brightly colored stars. But on the 13th, I watched until it seemed to be covered by the clouds and disappeared. It did not move at all except for appearing at different places in the sky on the two different nights (or early mornings). It almost looked like airplane lights, but the line of lights was straight up and down and it didn't move closer or further away or change position. In addition, there was a slight sound that seemed to be almost like an airplane engine. However, I can hear the interstate from my house, and I couldn't discern whether or not it was cars on the interstate or if it was coming from the lights. I don't know what it was, but I am absolutely sure it was not a plane, a radio tower, the moon, or any star or planet configuration I've ever seen before. One of the weird things was that I saw it more to the east at 5:30 and more to the west at 1:30. Another strange thing was that it appeared to be closer than some of the clouds, appearing below them, but was covered by lower lying clouds, although it may just be that there was simply a break in the clouds on both nights that permitted viewing.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,39.0715,-81.5704

After a few minutes I noticed something in the sky.  It seemed to be a group of white birds at first glance.  But as I watched I noticed that they were moving in ways that was very ""unbirdlike.""  They stayed in a pretty tight cluster, with none straying away from the group.  After watching for a bit, a worker brought a finished car out and I asked him what he thought it was.  He looked for a bit and said that it was messing with his head and he didn't want to think about it.  He quickly went back to work!  I continued watching and I showed another customer that had come outside.  He quickly dismissed it as a flock of birds.  But he continued watching very intently for several minutes, not very sure of himself.  The group was moving southbound above Sparks.  As they neared, I noticed that it was a group of 20 or so lights....definitely not birds.  It was hard to tell how big they were, but they seemed small.  Some would seem to dim and then get brighter.  It was very peculiar.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone, but the resolution is too poor to really see anything.  After about 10 minutes in total the cluster moved out of view to the Southeast of my location.  I've seen plenty of bird flocks flying south for winter, or just flying around outside.  But birds have wings...and these were lights.  Lights that were dimming, and then coming back.  I was amazed at how hard it was to see them even though it was nice and clear outside.

The sky was partly cloudy and the light streak appeared to get longer, shorter, dimmer and brighter as the clouds passed over.  The lights looked not unlike long green glow sticks in the sky.

The sun was at out backs to the West. I was looking up at the sky and clouds to the South East. Their were high whispy clouds and probably left over vapor trails from passing jets. The object that caught my attention looked odd and not moving in a perceptable way. It was obvious the sun was bouncing off the object and the i would have to estimate the altitude to be between 10- 20 thousand feet but I cannot say for sure. The object seemed to be drifting East to West very slowly over the observation time. In fact the object was at time obscured by the clouds passing by as it was above the clouds. I used a small pair of binoculars to see it better and when I got it focused it took on a spherical shape about the size of a BB at arms length.  After observing the object wit the binoculars for ~ 45 seconds I looked away to address one of the other whitneses and when I looked up to see it again it was gone and no clouds were in the vicinity at that time just blue shy. We theorized that it was a silver mylar balloon but at that altitude we felt it would have been too small to see with the unaided eye. We then agreed that it may have been a weather balloon that had ascended high enough for us to loose site of it or if it was a baloon it may have popped?

They had moved to a triangle formation, but were in about the same location in the sky.  I did not see them move.  They were very tiny, and looked as if they were small stars.  The light from them was bright white.  Then as I was watching them, just sitting still, to my right was one that was traveling towards the others.  It looked exactly like the other three, except that this one was moving and I didn't whiteness the others moving except that I noticed that they had changed formation from the last time I seen them.  This one continued to move until it was close to the others, then stopped.  I tripped my motion halogen light on the side of my house by accident, and it lit up so bright that it was difficult to see, so I walked further out back.  It was also early in the morning, so the sky had lightened some.  I could still see the lights, but they were not as bright.  Then the one that was moving before, began to move again.  There was no sound.  It was as if it were very far above me.  It would move steady, then shoot at a small angle, then slow back down and move steady, then shoot at a small angle as if it were trying to zig zag, but continued to travel in the same direction that it was when it would slow a bit and travel steady.

At that time,my fiancee (who was driving) and I had just passed Madison on our way home to the Twin Cities from Chicago on I-94.  I noticed a bright object moving from north of us to the south, which I initially took to be the ISS (space station).  The first glimpse put this object at the 1100 position (assuming the hood of our car is the 1200 position, and it was to the west of us about 35 degrees off the horizon.  As I am a former member of the military (16 Tango - ADA) I was extensively trained in visual identification of both man made and naturally occuring atmospheric phenomena.  I quickly deduced that this was in fact not the ISS due to its increasingly fast speed.  This object did not have any visible navigational lighting, nor strobes.  I watched the object traverse the entire expanse of sky from the 1100 position to our front, to about the 630 position behind us all in about 10 seconds before it disappeared into nothing. Within a few minutes I contacted the Columbia County Sheriff to describe the incident, and left my name and number.

Just stuffing around making star trails on my tripod as i didnt have an EQ mount at the time (still dont =[.. so im building one tomorrow.. a scotch mount anyway)  The 4 second exposure was taken on the 11/10/2007, south east queensland at 7:28 pm and 03 seconds in GMT+10, the 8 second exposure was taken at 7:28 pm and 15 seconds in GMT+10 and the 15 second exposure was taken at 7:28 pm and 33 seconds. Taken from south east queensland, near brisbane, Australia. It's a UFO, as I cannot identify what it is. I cannot reason whether it was in the atmosphere, or outside the atmosphere but close by and independant of the earth's rotation or a distant object. There are problems with all 3 scenarios. such as if it was close by or inside the atmosphere, it would have to move against the earth's rotation precisely to mimic the star trail found in all 3 exposures, if it was outside, but close by it'd still have to move to match the star trail causes by the rotation of the earth looking at the distant objects.. if it was a distant object, the weird twirly bits shouldnt be there... if it was a stationary object that is... as they also should be trailed out... I was thinking it was camera shake, but wondered why the other stars were not affected by any such camera shake... and considering the fact the lens has its own tripod mount and i used mirror lockup...its confusing. others have suggested bugs/insects in the way, but i pointed out that would be blurred out to invisible as the lens was set to infinite focus (obviously) and its 400mm focal length. others have suggest burning debris... but how could that match the star trails in all 3 photos of different exposure lengths?  and on the smallest possibility that that is the actual shape of the object, it would have to move to match the rotation of the earth no matter how far away it was, which would be a great feat indeed, or a geo-stationary object... which it cannot be either as the shape is different in each long exposure, yet defined. It looked like just a star to my naked eye though, a very bright one, and since the night wasnt perfectly clear or ideal for taking astrophotography, i decided to center around this particular star. I have anonymously hosted the photographs I took on tinypic.com so as to give you an idea of what i am talking about. I really didnt notice anything strange about it with my naked eye, or looking through the lens, only after I had taken long exposures did I see it was weird.  http://i24.tinypic.com/23m9zc.jpg ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the black & white photograph, and I have no idea what the squiggle of light is.

The night was especially clear…you could see thousands of stars and even what I believed were probably galaxies. I did not see the planets I was looking for, but I watched one particularly bright star (I thought) in the western sky.  It appeared far away.  The light continuously kind of jerked a bit (unlike the other stars).  As I watched it, I noticed that it moved down and to the right, then left, and then back into its original position (making a triangle).  It took apx. 5 minutes to complete the path of the triangle.  I watched for about 20 minutes and it continued to repeat the path during the entire time. I then saw a shooting star fairly close to the bright object.  I did not see it burn out but it dropped below the horizon still very bright.  I went inside, found my cell phone to call my sister who lives approx. 20 minutes to the northeast of me to see if she could see the object and then returned outside. Before I called my sister, I looked to the where the bright object had been, but it was now gone.  To the right of where that light had been I noticed 2 blinking red lights (much closer).  One was below and farther to the right of the other.  I assumed they were airplanes … but while watching those, the lower light immediately moved straight up to be on the same level as the other one (still to the right of it), taking only about 1 second.  It remained there for probably 5 seconds and then dropped back immediately into its original place.  This happened probably 4 times in the span of 3-4 minutes.  They both seemed to be moving slightly to the right during this time but not very far.  Then both lights suddenly disappeared. Unfortunately, by the time I got my sister on the phone the red lights had already disappeared so I could not have her confirm it.  She lives in the city and the sky wasn’t nearly as clear where she lives.  We couldn’t find any other unusual occurrences.  I cannot explain what the bright light and blinking red lights were, but their movements were very unusual.

After a short distance, they stopped and the began to form a triangle formation with the lead light staying put and the other two lights moving north and south to form a triangle.

My friend was driving his truck. We where headed towards MEDLOCK BRIDGE RD on STATE BRIDGE RD going down the hill before the   DOUBLEGATE subdivision. This is where they have been doing road work for over 4 years. My friend and I are consumed in a conversation about girlfriends. I first notice something in the distant horizon. I dont know how it got my attention but I guess my eyes were wondering. I noticed a small oval shaped object. I would say it was silver but I have no idea. It also had a shimer of light coming off of it. The light was white/silver but again this could have been a reflection off of the sun/object. I pointed it out to my friend who then stopped talking comletely and we both looked at it in AWE. I quickly said the first thing that popped in my mind. "" Dude do you see what I am seeing?"". He responded with the same amazement. The object appeared to be hovering. I judged this based on the fact you can see a radio cell phone tower in the distance over the horizon as well. After no more than 5 seconds on originally spotting it the object begain to move to the left slowly. It then moved back to the right slowly. Then all of a sudden before I could react, the object then shot across the entire horizon. I very quickly yelled "" oh my god, look at how fast its going. That cannot be an airplane, seriously look at how fast it is going."" Now by the time I had the whole sentance out the object went from one side of the horizon to the other and dissapeared behind some trees. The windows were rolled down and there was no sound other than traffic that I could hear. Although this does not mean there was no sound to the object, I just could not hear anything. My friend and I both talked about it to everyone we knew that night. Nobody would believe us. We have kept this secret until now when I found this website. I wanted to post this only for the fact of documentation and also to do my part at uncovering the truth behind UFOs. I MUST say that this was in NO way an hallucination. WE saw what we saw. I know for a fact this could not be a normal aircraft. I cannot say this was absolutly spacecraft either. What I can say is that the craft was deffinatly unidentifiable. It moved faster than an airplane could. Once it started moving it went from one side of the horizon to the other in less than 10 seconds. the whole sighting lasted maybe 15 seconds. The span of the horizon is about a 7-10 miles in distance. The object was just above the tree lines (which also includes several upscale neighborhoods within those trees.) and couldnt have been more than 100 yards up in the air. Still to this day I can recall the fellings I had when it happend. I became very uncomfortable yet very interested at the same time. I have been affraid of UFO/Aliens for many years until I became interested in the truth. I have only seen one other unidentified object before. Nothing that made me feel the way this did. Please someone confirm they have seem SOMETHING like this before. Please I want to know I am not crazy. Thanks for taking time to listen to my report. I swear on my life this is the truth and nothing has been misconstrued or exaggerated. I now keep a camera on me at all times in hopes I will be able to capture a UFO the next time one is spotted.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,34.082184599589326,-84.26424661190966

I don't remember the exact date as it was well over a year ago but I remember what I saw like it was yesterday.   I was traveling north on Hwy 431 on my way from Dothan, AL to Atlanta to visit a friend before Christmas.  Just outside Headland I saw a very large, very bright white light directly overhead.  For lack of a better description, it was like a strobe light but was not flashing.  It was constant and as I got closer it was so bright that it was painful to look at it (I was trying to see exactly where it was coming from).  It was a clear, cool evening with no cloud cover and there were no street lights, businesses or billboard advertising signs in the immediate area (my first guesses).  I slowed down to about 10 mph and looked for something that would give me some idea of what it was (I was afraid to stop and get out of the car).  I saw what appeared to be the an outline of dark metal (black or dark gray) several yards forward of the light which was still bright and non-flashing.  I opened all of the windows on my SUV and heard no sound other than my vehicle's engine.  The ""object"" appeared to be approximately 100 feet above the highway and must have been huge as I was never able to see anything more than the outline on one side.  My guess is that it was either triangular or chevron in shape and appeared to be moving south very slowly.  There were no other lights besides the white one.  I observed this ""object"" for approximately 15 minutes before I decided to continue heading north and watched it in my rear view mirror, until it was just a faint glow.  I was almost 40 at the time and have never seen anything like this in my life. I like to believe there is a logical explanation for just about everything but have not been able to explain this one.

Spires with lights on them appeared to jut out from it's left side.  It was a clear night -44 Degrees Below Zero.  There was a slight breeze moving from left to right of viewing plane.  I estimate the breeze moving from East to West.  We were looking south from the parking lot.  The object hovered silently and stayed stationary regardless of the breeze.  After about 5-10 minutes the object began to move slightly toward the right of the viewing plane.  The object then stopped again and remained stationary.  While observing it I waited for ((name deleted)) to see it since I did not want to imply what I was seeing.  He then looked up where I was looking and asked, ""What the hell is that?""  Be both observed it for a few more minutes then both decided to go home.  He drove up to murphy Dome Road and said it was no longer in his sight.  The object stayed stationary as we both went home.  The object was in my path as I drove home, moving toward it, so I watched it as I was driving home looking to see if it would get any bigger.  I am still not sure if it did get any bigger.  Later measurements seem to indicate that it did appear larger at my appartment.  At my appartment, I observed the object from my balcony and still was trying to explain it away.  I convinced myself that it was lights from a far away building I never knew existed before, and had a feeling that it would be there in the morning.  However, I convinced myself of this in spite that I knew it was a wrong assumption.  This was because the structure of the placement of the lights were sort of in a random pattern of distribution and that I had seen it moving.  I had a camera with me but assumed that it would be there in the morning.  I went to bed, due to exaustion, after 30 minutes had elapsed from the initial sighting to the balcony sighting even thought the object was still visible.    So my visual sighting took only about 30 minutes.  However, after a conversation with a Physics Personnel at the University of Alaska, Geophysical Institute, we obtained infrasound readings of what may be the object.  The infrasound readings indicate that there might have been an engine signature on Atmospheric Entry and then another signature on Exiting the Earths Atmosphere.  The infrasound readings obtained sounds well below human hearing levels.  Anyhow, two distinct readings do exist that happen to be approximately 45 minutes apart.  I am still in the process of obtaining weather radar data, and any other data possible.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,64.84527636363637,-147.8347387878788

It was dark and the moon was high and to the left as I faced south.   As soon as I stepped out of the house, the first thing I saw was not the moon, but a very bright, fast moving, white light in the sky.  It was as bright as the moon and at first I thought it was the police helicopter with it's searchlight on.   It took only seconds for me to realize that was not what I was seeing.  My niece, whom I do not count as a witness due to her age, could not stop pointing at it.   Once I realized this was no ordinary craft, I yelled in the house for my brother to come out and see it.  In doing so, I alerted the entire house.  In all, 4 adults, an eleven year old, and my 18 month old niece all saw the phenomena.   The light moved across the sky from west to east.  It moved in a fairly quick, yet consistent speed.  It only varied course slightly when it appeared to be manuevering to it's left and right.   In all, the light was visible for about 1 minute.  At it's end, it disolved into the distance.   We then stayed outside for about half an hour to ""star gaze"".  In that half an hour we saw several commercial flights at various elevations, a satellite in orbit, and the police helicopter did fly over (without searchlight)and was obvious to us that if the helicopter did fly over we would have definately heard it.   Ruling those things out, we came to two possibile conclussions; 1 )it was an outer worldly craft, 2) being that we live in Omaha, we are accustomed to seeing craft from the S.A.C. airforce base (B-2 Steaths, fighter jets, etc...).  However, this craft made no banking turn to where the base would be located and seemed to dissapear once it passed the moon.   We are fairly certain that this was no government aircraft and are just curious to see if you have heard of any similar reportings in this area.   This was my second personal encounter, the first took place in 1990 and was no where near as i! mpressive.   Thank you for your time.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,41.254851796008865,-96.06482784922395

I was out walking just a few minutes before midnight, and saw approaching out of the Northeast what looked like an unusually bright and unusually orange satellite. Its motion and appearance were just that, but it was almost midnight, and the light passed nearly overhead and to the southwest until it became invisible behind clouds near the Southwest horizon. Planes nearly always exhibit strobes, are only orange colored when near the horizon, and without exception look a lot different as they change their aspect angle with respect to the observer, and this light didn't.  I checked the time on my cell phone, and it was 23:58 - nearly midnight.  The sun was just about at +7 degrees declination. From that, I calculate that altitude would have to have been about 2500 km to be visible overhead at local midnight from my location (about 39 deg N). A large rocket body in transfer orbit might well be at such an altitude, but I don't think it could be that bright at that slant range (roughly 3700 km or more at first), or that consistently orangish/yellow.  Since it moved from northeast to southwest, if what I saw was a satellite, it would have to be in a retrograde orbit. There have been quite a few of these, but nearly all are low orbiters, well below 1000 km altitude. I tried to find a candidate satellite. It would need an apogee altitude of at least 1000 km (more likely 2000 km), and an inclination greater than 90 degrees. This really cuts the list down to about 20 candidates.  There were several potentially visible birds at about that time, but all would have been in the northwest and would not have passed anywhere near overhead while illuminated by the sun.  I used both commercial and software and web-based tools to confirm this.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,39.03697964869776,-77.02814088431253

The turn may not have been a perfect right angle, but it was close enough.  It maintained a straight line for a few seconds after the change of direction, after which it began to make small jerky motions in more or less the same direction of the town.  It moved from the left to right fairly quickly, but it's pace away from my house didn't seem to pick up.  My mother suggested we go to the other end of the house where we have a deck, and get a better view since it was getting harder to see past the tree's in our front lawn.

I am looking thru the scope and he says, point it at that, I’m like yeah let me just move this thing, refocus into our atmosphere and see...no luck. They were flying E to W. I am going to say about 200 feet off the ground, but they were big. Not like, I can see the pilot in the helicopter big, but I could clearly see the shapes and the light that emitted from the objects. The light that was coming off of them wasn't bright or noticeable. It was a grayish red, very low light. Almost like radiance. There were several craft (6 to 7 maybe) flying in almost a V formation (yes, like birds) Then one moved from one point of the triangle to the other, but the movements were not bird movements. Like jet formations more than birds, but these were NOT jets! The constant movement across the sky was very slow, but their movement when one changed its position in the formation was very fast. No wings, birds or bats, no noise either. The bodies of the crafts almost looked the shape of Sting rays (bodies only). We tried to tell each other that they were birds, but we both knew better. Yeah yeah that's it. Birds. Weird glow...almost too low to notice. We watched them as they appeared over the top of one roof until they past from our line of site over another roof. We see helicopters and planes in that area all of the time and in fact a small plane had just past over that area about 10 minutes prior. Nothing like that either.

It moved slowly clockwise and counterclockwise without sounds like a navigating system to see me standing to look up at flying unknown object in the air about 20 yards away from the ground.  The object was similiar as almost size as ordinary car-suv vehicle . I know no one manufactures a flying strange object but a possible futuristic with advanced technological system?

I was on my way home from my fiance’s house on the night of 09/06/06. As I merged into the southbound lane of Interstate 57 from the Salem, IL. on ramp, I noticed that the traffic flow was unusually heavy. This caused me to note the time, which was 20:04 central time. As I checked my speed to set the cruise control I scanned the traffic in the roadway ahead of me. I noticed that both passenger vehicles and tractor-trailers were all moving at the posted limit or in many cases well below it. This in itself is unusual for this stretch of I-57. My first thought was that a State Trooper must have been laying in wait up ahead but as I maneuvered into the left lane to overtake a line of tractor-trailers, I saw 2 green lights probably a couple of hundred feet above the northbound lane and I guess about one quarter mile away. The lights were very bright, they sat side by side and as I watched I noticed that they appeared to be moving in a southerly direction. As I watched I noted that the lights were indeed moving to the south at a slow speed and I was rapidly gaining on them. My next thought was, that it was a police agency employing an aircraft with speed detection equipment. I could by this time see that the lights were part of the same object with one being on each side. This object appeared to me to be moving too slowly to be regular fixed wing and appeared too large to be an ultralite type aircraft so I assumed it to be a helicopter. At that point I decided that I had better be watching the road or “that chopper” would be life-flighting me to a hospital in St Louis. Just before I came along side the object I got a very intense feeling of dread. It was an almost sick feeling like when you unexpectedly get incredibly terrible news. As I approached, the object was still over the northbound lane, it was slowly moving south, as I could now definitely see it moving past the trees. The traffic in both lanes was still moving but at what appeared to be below the posted limit. I could now see the lig! hts clea rly and they appeared to be running lights on some type of aircraft but I could not determine just what type of aircraft it was.  The sky had been darkening for a while but there was still some natural lighting available as was illumination coming from a rest area that we were approaching. I could make out a dark shape but it was hazy. By this time my view was of course still from behind and the object was at about my 10 o’clock position and I’m guessing about 200 feet above ground. As it came into about my 9 o’clock position, a bright red light appeared to form an equilateral triangle pointing south. At nearly that same instant two other things happened. The sick dreadful feeling in my gut worsened and the aircraft/object stopped in mid air. Immediately the 2 green “running lights” as I call them, both turned bright red and the object rotated one half turn to the left. It spun itself about, completely 180 degrees in place. It reversed its direction of travel and began moving north very slowly. I slowed my vehicle to a near crawl in the passing lane and watched as the red light that formed the lead corner of the triangle turned a brilliant white. A beam of blindingly white light was projected toward the ground and swept about like a searchlight as the triangle moved northward at a crawl. The beam of light swept back and forth behind a thick copse of trees that line the interstate. I could not see the beam sweeping the ground as whatever it was apparently “searching” for was on the opposite side of the tree line.The entire time I watched the object I looked very closely between the lights to determine just what I was looking at. I could see a triangular outline with length, width and height but could not make out any structural details. It appeared as if it was not completely solid. It was a misty blackish, dark color, darker than the night sky. I could not see through it although again I say it did not look entirely solid. I put my driver’s side window down and stuck my head out as I passed the aircraft,! thinkin g maybe the light factory applied tinting on my vehicle’s glass was interfering with my seeing properly. I heard no sound nor could I see any means of propulsion like props or what might be intake or exhaust ports for a jet. When the object was about 100 feet away to my left and about 200 feet above me I quickly held up my hand to gauge size. The distance between the lights along all 3 sides was a little longer than the length of my left hand. I realized that I was still in the passing lane and I was either going to run over someone or get ran over myself. I felt that I should not stop, the thought of stopping made me nauseous so I changed to the right lane and I watched in my mirrors as the object continued northward, shining its spotlight into the woods with cars passing below it like nothing was wrong. I took my eyes off the mirror and glanced at the road ahead and when I looked back the object was gone. I did not see the object change direction left or right; I did not see it go up or down. I just looked back and it was gone. I turned around in my seat and looked rearward but still did not see anything. By the time I reached Dix, IL. my usual exit, I did not feel like driving the country roads home. I continued on to Mt Vernon at exit 95 and went home on more traveled roadways. I did not sleep well that night thinking about seeing whatever this was. I can’t help but wonder who else saw this. Of all the vehicles on the interstate that night surely I am not the only one that was intrigued enough to look.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,38.6368,-88.9198

This encounter has been related to me many times by my mother since it happened in the fall of 1957 or 1958.   For the record, she has never been diagnosed with any sort of mental illness, and is not a drinker.  She is well respected to this day in the community, and has numerous friends who would testify to her honesty and sobriety.   In October of '57 or '58, my older sister, who would have been about 11 or 12 at the time, woke up in the middle of the night sick, and called for mother.  My mother heard her, and when she got up out of bed, she saw from the window a glowing orange disk or saucer shaped object hovering over our yard, very close to the house.   We live in the country, and the night was clear, cool, with a light breeze.  As she approached the window to get a better look, she noticed what she has called indentations on the edge of the object.  To describe what happened next would be the really unusual aspect of this report.  She got the very distinct mental impression that they (her words) meant her no harm, and was told not to fear this event.  After watching the object for an undetermined amount of time, it went straight up at an extremely high rate of speed until it was no longer visible.  There were no sounds heard.  I have often wondered what may have happened to her during the time my sister called from her room, because she has said it took mother forever to come to her.  She actually didn't tell us about this until a few weeks later, but there is no denying the fact she believes what she saw.   Another incident happened in March of 2000 near here, when a ""fireball"" crashed into some woods and fields close to the county line.  Second hand reports indicate a fire so hot it melted paint off the sheriff's vehicle at a distance of over one mile away.  Unmarked vehicles were seen for a few days afterwards, and the local inhabitants were not allowed to see what happened.  After all these years, I believe it's time this report was seen by more than just family members. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was four years old and played in my grand mothers yard, the front by myself, Bored with my trucks and cars I would look around at the sky  to see what I could see.  One day I saw a tiny speck in the distance floating, like the end of a pencil so small, It was above some power lines across the street in the distance. I was curious but well, I was only four. I went inside and came back outside the next day to play. Curious I looked up to find the spot had gotten closer in the same location. no detail  just closer. I got very excited, not sure why. Maybee having something to look at starred at the thing, size of a base ball above the power lines. Next day I was so excited to see the thing , if It was there? And yes getting even  closer. I sat for hours gazing at the object. It got closer to me and I could see some detail. It was round like a little earth. Solid but translucent at the same time. It was constantly moving the outside  layers as  to reach to  change and react to the world. It was communicating but not in words. In a visual mindset. I wish i could explain. I fell in love with the object and could not get enough. It came so close to me that I could almost jump and touch it but would move just out of my reach. The next three days it started moving back further away and finally left. Two questions is how can a four year create  something he has never seen? Why  did  I have such a great connection with this object? I honestly believe that there is something beyond our understanding.",,34.17664012738854,-118.38102866242039

But it was not a plane or small aircraft as we would recognize. My father had just got home from work and several neighborhood kids were playing in my front yard. We all just stood and watched it as it seemed to move ever so slowly from the North-east to the South-west accross the sky just behing my house. It had three main white light, that moved like flashing lights down its side, and a red light underneath it. It moved slowly for about 2 minutes, then litterally shot off into the sky and was gone. There was no noise. We all watched it, and although my father tried to convince us it was a ""special balloon of some kind"", I remember the adults talking about it for weeks it seemed. No one ever reported things like that back then. Until I saw the special on Travel Channel tonight, 05-27-07 about the Florissant, Illionois UFO sighting and the engineers rendition of the witness' sightings, I thought no one would ever believe me about what we saw. It was a perfect likeness to what we had seen. My father admited only 15 years ago to me that it was an UFO as far as he knew. He admitted he did not want us kids upset by what we had seen. Thanks to the TV special this evening, I will never again question myself about what I saw with my Dad and friends on that clear summer day. It is as real to me today as it was 40 years ago.

I was stationed in Meunchweiller Germany from May of 1965 until May of 1968.  At the time I was a cryptographic repairman for NATO’s Central Army Group (Centag).  This was the primary reason I did not report the sighting.  I was afraid that I would lose my clearance and not be able to work in my field. 	I sighted the object when my wife and a married couple stationed in Meunchweiller were on a weekend trip to Frankfurt.  I can’t remember the exact date but it was in the early spring of 1967.  We were on the Autobahn heading north.  I was driving; my wife was in the front passenger seat turned to her left talking to the couple in the back seat.  I looked to my right through the passenger side window and caught a glimpse of an object in the sky.  The terrain on the right side of the auto was a mixture of fields and small patches of evergreen trees.  The view was broken from time to time.  At first I thought it was a plane, possibly military.  Then there was an open field with no trees that gave me about a 5 or 6 second uninterrupted view.  The object was thin and came to a point on both sides.  It was gray semi dull aluminum color.  Along the centerline were several bright spots.  They radiated an orange/green, iridescent color.  It was in a swirling fashion, the colors did not stay in the same spot within the “light”. The other passengers were absorbed in a conversation so I tried to view the object as long as I could.  The tree line came back and obstructed my vision from time to time.  Although at times I could still see it through the trees.  Then a large forest went by and I lost sight of the object completely.  I puzzled over it in my mind while the others were conversing about other things.  I am an aircraft fan of sorts, especially WWII.  It bothered me that I could not see a vertical stabilizer or a wing root from the perspective that I viewed.  At the time I did not consider it to be a possible UFO. Later on I read an article about UFO’s and saw different impressions.  There was one that fit the object I saw exactly.  Only a few weeks had expired but then I realized my occupation in the Army.  I was not willing to take the chance of losing my security clearance because of the apparent mindset of such claims at the time.  Now that the equipment I maintained is totally declassified and you can see them on the internet I wanted to add maybe an insignificant sighting.  Maybe it was seen by someone else at that time and it would help in some way. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",,,

Each of the objects was egg-shaped and emitted a soft neon-like color, almost like pastel.   Each object was of a different color: the 'lead' was blue; the others were red, yellow and white. There were no physical obstructions for those observing the objects, such as trees or buildings.  Most of the observers were senior individuals as they were there in the yard in celebration of a birthday. All saw the objects; some joked about them.

The colors inside reminded of the colorful swirls you see in a soap bubble. I remember thinking to myself if I could touch it my hand would go right through it. It felt like it was watching us too. I stood there holding my mother’s hand, motionless, like everyone for what it seemed like an hour, more likely 15-20minutes.

I was talking to a Vietnam veteran who flew F-4 Phantoms off of a carrier in the Vietnam war.   One evening he was assigned to a carrier defence flight to ensure no enemy aircraft got close to the carrier group.  When flying past the carrier, it was suddenly lit from below the water by a very bright light.   He was commanded to circle and observe the light.  The initial theory was that a Soviet sub was under the carrier and was somehow shining a light up at them; playing games with them.   After about a minute though, the light took off through the water still submerged.   They and another jet followed above for about 20 seconds when suddenly the light left the water (not sure if they saw the shape) and took off straight up into the air and vanished.

I would have been 6 years old or younger.  Sometime very late in the night I was awoken by a sound. It may have been a whistling sound. Before I opened my eyes I wondered if it might be Rudolph the Reindeer. We had watched that show earlier Christmas Eve.  When I opened my eyes I have the distinct memory that I knew that I would not be able to move or to speak and that to try would be useless. How did I have that impression when just waking up? I have always had the impression that something had happened previous to this that I have never remembered and that this is what caused me to just know this.  When I opened my eyes I was amazed to see that our bedroom (me and my two brothers, each 1 and 2 years younger than me) was absolutely filled with hundreds or maybe even thousands of deep red, completely distinct, oval lights. They were each moving rapidly around the room in all directions. As I watched one group of lights I noticed that I could follow them along the floor, up on the wall and then over the ceiling. Whether they were projected from inside the room or projected in from the outside I could not tell.  I looked across the room and my 5 year old brother was looking at me stunned and seeing the same things.  I was very frightened by all of this and tried to move. When I did I was suprised that I could. So I then tried to scream out for my parents and again was suprised that I could make a sound. I immediately then jumped out of bed and ran towards the door screaming for help. Our parents room was across the hallway at that time and they met us in the hallway.  I have also always had the distinct impression that someone, not my parents, told me thta night that I should always remember what had happened because they would return in the future and that it would be important to me and to everyone else.

However, I documented the date to match up with a similar sighting that was entered earlier. The other documented sighting was just too alike not to be related. The Event. Some friends and I were talking in the front of a neighbor’s house when a sphere of light caught my attention on the horizon. I glanced up, seen the object, pointed to it and told my friends, “Look at that.” They in turn looked up and we all watched the object travel the length of the horizon until it went out of sight.  The object entered the horizon from the West and exited to the East. We were starting to discuss what the object was, when an Air Force jet came over the hill exactly where the object came into our view, and proceeded to follow the object across the horizon in a west to east direction. The object and the jet were about a quarter of a mile to half a mile away. The entire event lasted no more than 15 seconds. The Object. What I saw can best be described as a very distinct dull light.

I have no idea how long it was there.  I think only a minute or two, probably.  Anyway, it was there and then it just disappeared in an instant.  Not even a helicopter could have disappeared that fast.  I remember us all wondering what it was and how it could disappear so fast. I asked my older sister about this a couple years ago to see if she remembered that happening.  She told me that she did remember, that it had happened, and that Dad had been pretty freaked out by it.  She told me that he had watched the news for a couple weeks after that wondering what it was.  There must not have been any reports though that she remembers. Anyway, I can only guess the year to be between 1967-1970.  I must have only been 7 or 8 at the time.  I estimate this because my Dad died of Muscular Dystrophy in ’72, and at the time this happened, he was still healthy enough to be walking.  I was hoping to find other reports on your site, but didn’t.  Therefore, the exact year is unknown.  I’d be interested to see if anyone else saw and maybe what year, if they remember.

My dad was a rancher, my mom a housewife, my brother and I students.  Our personal experience with an UFO was in Estes Park, Colorado, somewhere around 1952-1957 (truthfully, I am not sure of the date), but I was around 8-10 years old.  We lived on a small ranch on South St. Verain Rd, about 3 miles out of the town of Estes.  It was in the evening, it was dark outside.  My mom was in bed with the mumps, my brother was laying on his bed reading.  My dad and I were in the kitchen doing dishes from dinner.   My brother’s bed sat along the south wall with the foot of the bed next to a window looking south out to our horse pasture.   All of us a sudden, my brother, approximately age 13-15, started screaming for us to come.  We all ran into his bedroom and saw an extremely bright white light coming through his bedroom window from an aircraft floating above the tall pine trees.  It came from a ship, for want of a better word, that looked like the fuselage of a large airplane but there were no wings.  The aircraft was about the size of a smallish to medium size commercial aircraft.  It looked to be metallic silver and there was absolutely no sound coming to us from the open windows.  The lack of sound is the one thing that has stayed in my mind all these years.   I’m not sure how long we stood there and stared at it--it did not move at all.  Then, suddenly, it moved upward--we could then see a glow kind of like a lit cigar but no flames coming from the back, still no sound.   After it reached a certain altitude, it went toward Twin Sisters Mountain and then continued on through a gap in the mountains in the general direction of Boulder/Denver, Colorado.   I talked with my brother recently to refresh what we remember.  He said that the fire lookout people stationed on top of Twin Sisters also reported it and that the Rocky Mountain Newspaper reported that the nearby Air Force Base sent airplanes up after it was reported in the Boulder/Denver area.  He remembers reading that the planes could not keep up with the UFO and lost sight of the craft.   My mom called the Police Chief in Estes Park, and his only comment was, ""Don’t tell anyone what you saw.""    She did tell our neighbors to the northwest of us.  They seemed to believe us but didn’t say much at all.   About 3 years later, we moved to Longmont, Colorado. One night after we were there a few months, our Estes Park neighbor lady called us and said she had seen the same thing that night.  She had picked up her daughter from a school dance and was driving back out to the country area we lived in when her headlights hit an object crossing the road in front of her.  (This was pretty deserted country at that time).   She said the description we had given her about our UFO fit this one exactly.  She seemed very upset and scared when talking about her experience.  I do not know if she reported it to the police or not.   If you have any information of other sightings, that fits the area of time period or in this area, we would be most interested in hearing about it.

I see a disk shaped object floating over the roof of our neighbors house, it is, I would approximate, 6 feet in diameter and is big enough for 1 occupant, it has a glass dome and is a brushed silver color.  There is a humanoid in the UFO; he appears to be driving it with a “joy stick”. He is a dark greenish gray color and I remember thinking ""was that his skin or a body suit?"", he also has on goggle type glasses very round and thick. I am frozen at the end of our driveway, terrified.  He does not see me at first.  He progresses over the neighbors’ yard and crosses our street.  Suddenly “he” jerks his head around to the left and looks directly at me.  I become paralyzed and fall off the driveway into the little ditch that boarders the road.  I can still see but cannot move.  The next thing I remember is waking back up in my bed.  The little TV in my room is on and has only “snow” on the screen.  I scream “they are in the TV, they are in the TV!” I grab the electric cord to the television and pull it out of the socket and keep pulling until the TV falls off the dresser and breaks, much to my relief.  This wakes my father from his “Sleep” and he comes in and spanks me for breaking the TV. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I've looked long and hard for others that might have noticed the extremely large fireball in the evening sky, it didn't crash, it made no sound, it maintained its elevation just above the treeline and it left no cloud or stream of debris in its trail.

She speaks quite eloquently about her sighting, and she will have the other two living witnesses submit reports, as well.  PD)) The year was 1967. I was 32 years old. I was driving out Montevallo Road, going from the mall to my home. My ten year old son, my nine year old son and my thirteen year old stepson were with me.  I was driving a convertible and the top was down.  It was dusk, I don't know the exact time. All of a sudden we looked up, I do not know why, and saw, hovering above the trees on the right side of the street, a huge craft.  It was oval in shape with a smaller dome on top.  Around this smaller dome was a row of windows and there were lights in the windows.  I heard a soft whirring sound, smooth and barely perceptible.   It stayed there for five minutes or so and then zoomed off to the west with a speed that was incomprehensible.  I pulled off on a side street and pulled over to the curb and parked the car.  The boys and I were all stunned.  I asked them to tell me what they had seen.  We each spoke in turn and we all saw the same thing.  At that time my husband owned a large company in Birmingham and any negative or questionable activity was a threat to his reputation so I told the boys that we would tell their dad when we got home and then we must never talk about it again.  We could not risk losing customers.  The people in Birmingham were peculiar in some ways and it was better to keep quiet.  We did tell my husband when we got home and then we never talked about it again for many years.  A few years ago I began to tell some of my close friends about it.  As you get older you worry less and less about what other people might think and I wanted to share my experience.  My son who was ten at the time has passed away but I asked my son who was nine at the time if he remembered that everning and he said, ""Oh, yes.""  I cautioned them so much he has not talked about it much but he still remembers it exactly the way I do.  My husband died many years ago and I have lost touch with his children but I am sure his son, who was thirteen at the time, still remembers.  You cannot forget because it changes everything you ever thought ab out the world you live in.   I loved the experience and would love to see another one but realize I probably never will.  It was a beautiful ship and so far advanced from anything we have on this planet.  The material it was made of reminded me of one of those globes you see over a hall light, a glass or plastic globe that allows the light to shine through.   The ship had a yellowish, or golden glow, as if it was lit behind the material it was made of.  The lights in the window were brighter than the soft glow of the ship itself.  I don't know how big it was, it seemed quite large though not as large as a football field.  But I am not good at judging distances so I don't know how high it was but it seemed rather close, though not directly  above the trees.  I am 73  now and did want to make some official report before it is too late.  I don't know if this is the right place to do it but I will continue to search websites in regard to this.

After observing this for a few seconds movement coming from behind and between the houses brought my attention to 4 figures walking toward the object, human like in stature but a bit thinner, the distinguishing features that caught my eye were the helmets or head gear worn by the figures along with what looked like black wetsuits. the helmets were similar to our astronauts head gear with a single large tinted visor, only they appeared to be more form fitting closer to the head. the other feature was what appeared to be a breathing apparatus at the front that gave the figures an appearance of having heads shaped like that of a doberman pincher.one of the figures looked up and I quickly retreated back inside the window, I dont recall anything after that other then waking up the next morning and peering out the window the next morning,and of course by that time they had departed.

Suddenly I see 3 lights in a perfect triangle speed across the sky in a North Westerly direction.  My deck faces West with a clear view of West Seattle and the Olympics. I don’t know if it was 3 separate lights (crafts) flying in formation,….or a triangular craft with a light on each tip?  Impossible to tell really, I couldn’t see the actual shape of the craft, just 3 lights moving at a VERY high rate of speed, like 4-5  times faster than a jet.  It faded and disappeared towards the N-West sky. No sound whatsoever.

I did a double take because I could not believe my eyes,  I thought at first a plane or helicopter but it was just a red light, no blinkers or different colors, just a steady glowing, red orb.  A commercial jet actually passed in front of it (from my view) and was banking left to head Westerly, this is when I knew it was NOT a plane or helicopter!  I knocked on the French door for my wife and frantically waved at her to come outside.  She came out and witnessed it for a minute and then went back in,   So, I ran and got my binocs and went to the front yard where I got an unobstructed view. By this time it was higher and I’m going to guess about 3-4 thousand feet?  Maybe less, I see plenty of Cessna’s flying at about the same altitude.  It then stopped and stayed in the relative same place for several minutes, it would sort of pulse I guess I would say or become less intense of a red every couple seconds.  It finally dimmed and then was gone.  I estimate that where it hovered for the longest would’ve been maybe a couple miles or so north of me, putting it directly over the West Seattle Freeway or the Seattle Port maybe?  It was very strange indeed specially due to the fact that I sent in a report last night for a triangle craft or 3 lights in formation that sped across the sky!

The point of the triangle was west-the direction it went. All of the chevrons moved together. It made a very slight VVV sound before it shot off to the west. Only a second or so.

All of the sudden we see an old airplane maneuvering north of us near Yuma,AZ.  It doesn't look military; it just looks like someone is playing around.  All of the sudden I look further behind the airplane and I notice something just sitting there in the sky. It was pretty far away and we could not tell what it was.  The objects were in a disk shape and white metallic color.  The object was pretty bright for a clear sunny day.  We pulled over to see if I can take good pictures of it.  My co-worker mentions of rotation on the object, but I could not see it.  The object stayed in the same spot for quite a long time and barely moved.  It looked like it would grow slightly in size and go back to the original size.  We could even see the object entering Yuma.  That same night there was a high activity of black helicopters near the MX and AZ border.  I do not know if it was the Border Patrols or the black helicopters that I've heard try to chase UFO's.

As we are flying by it I noticed that on the other side there was this metallic object attached to the object.  I looked around the airplane to see if anyone hesitated, but no one seemed to see it except me.  I researched weather balloons and this thing was at least 10x bigger than the weather balloon pictures that I googled.

Then, I suddenly saw what looked like a white/greenish streaking of light that quickly from the sky to the horizon and out of sight. The light moved from the southeast to the southwest. There is an airport near that part of Iowa City, but I have *never* in the past 5 years living in our house witnessed that bright of white/greenish light moving so quickly and then suddenly vanishing at the horizon. Furthermore, I have never seen anything so bright through our dark red curtains.

I was driving on Clairemont dr heading south bound. It was about 9:30pm at night and Clairemont dr was pretty quite. I think I was the only person on the road at the time.  As I came around a bend in the road I saw a gold bright light... I did a double take cause I thought it was the police helicopter that normally is flying around my area. I couldnt make out what the object was. I noticed no other lights and the police helicopter has two lights... red and green and I didnt see those. When I first saw the object I was looking about 200 yards to my right out of my trucks winshield.  as I got closer and realized that the object was not a helicopter I then thought it was an airplane but the sky was over cast and it would have been impossible to be an airplane flying that low.  I started to feel very nervous cause I couldnt make it out. All this happened so fast that I was unable to figure out what to do.  I continued driving and I kept glancing up at the object. It didnt move an inch. When I came right up on it I noticed it was about 3 telephone poles in height in the sky.  It wasnt very big, but it was bright like a like was hanging in the sky. I lost sight of it as a drove by it. I slowed down and was trying to look at it out the back of my truck window but the furniture was in the way. I got a little further down the road and could see the spot where I saw the light over the furniture in the back of my truck and I didnt see it anymore. It was gone.  I decided to go ahead and continue to dump off the furinture and when I came back Clairemont drive I decided to go driving around the back streets where I saw the object and I came to the cayon rim and I noticed something flying around.  I thought for sure this time I was looking at a helicopter flying around La Jolla mountain. I was facing north at a dead end of a back street. I then noticed the supposed helicopter was making very sharp turns and speeding up and slowing down real swiftly.  I knew I wasnt looking at a helipcopter. It was something else.  I lost sight of this object and so I got back on Clairemont dr and continued toward my house heading north. I spotted the object again. I watched move around the sky. It was covering a distance of 2-3miles in seconds as it went around in no given pattern.  It was flying low to the ground beneath the cloud cover. When I got close to home I made a left turn and I lost sight of the object for good. I told my wife when I got home. I went out side and smoked a few times throughout the night but I didnt see the object again.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

There was a sort of dull sheen to it.  It resembled a small airliner, in fact at first I thought that's what it was.  It caught my attention as I drove up a small hill, it was far too low in the sky and travelling very slowly, almost hovering above an urban space.  I feared it would crash.  The craft is a stream-lined oval shape from the side viewed it from. The front was pointed, not a sharp point, but slightly rounded.(I assume it was the front from the direction it was traveling). I don't esactly recall what the back looked like, although I think it was similar to the front - there was no tail.  The wings were not the usual shape of a plane, they were a sort of semi-circular shape, they were short and wide and close to the craft. There was no other colour or letters on the craft, no windows, no lights and no noise.  I tried to keep it in my vision, but couldn't contstantly watch the sky as I was driving, the craft was moving (though very slowly) and my view quickly became obstructed by trees.  I feared when I reached the corner at the top of the hill (about 1/2 a block)it would have crashed, as no plane could fly so low or slowly and stay in the sky.  However when I got to the corner it was gone and there was no crash.  This all happened within seconds and it took a few seconds to realize that this was not a usual aircraft.  I was quite shaken by the experience and kept watching the sky, wanting to see it again - to know what it was.  I called the local air control center and was told there was no aircraft in the area at the time I saw the craft other than a small plane doing flying practice and a helicopter - both were several miles away from the location I saw the craft.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,50.04174457831325,-125.58583012048193

I went out on our back deck facing west.  It was dark outside and I observed a stationary 4 window bright luminous light barely above the tree line over the woods behind our house.  It was fairly close to our house and silent.  I'm not sure how far away it was because I'm not sure how big it was in perspective. I immediately ran up stairs where my wife was to have her see it out of the upstairs window but the lights were gone.  While looking out of our upstairs window, we were shocked at what we were seeing.  We cranked open our casement window and observed 15 or more luminous craft moving in every direction a distance away.  Some even flew high over our house then disappeared.  The sky was very clear out back of our house.  The craft were silent until one would completely stop high in the air and then it would start to glow with what looked like fire and it growed in size and roared like the sound of a very loud jet engine. It would take about 3 seconds for the sound to reach us.  While the craft was stationary and glowing with fire, a luminous ""pod"" dropped off out the left side toward the ground.  We witnessed this exact thing 4 times during the 20 minutes or so that we watched them.  I estimated them to be about 2 miles away.  I called our local police department twice to report this event but I think they thought I was nuts.  I am a business person in our city and afterwards I wished I hadn't called them. They said they would send a cruiser out that way.  To summerize what I said in the beginning of this report is I believe the very loud stationary jet roar above my house was one of those craft that became stationary with stabilizing rocket engines and dropped the luminous 4 window ""pod"" out back of my house that started the whole incident of us witnessing all of this.  After 20 minutes or so, the dark sky became empty of craft and all was quiet.  We are both still nervous over what we saw.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,40.5397,-90.0585

The sky was dark with a slight backlit auburn haze and distant low cloud blanket and even further out clear sky.

The Ligh Formations on the Craft were a yellowish-white color and 8 in numbr. each of the eight light formations were composed of two rectangular segments of equal size forming a 45 degree angle pointing towards apparent front of craft.

I have lived near Air Force Bases and am certain that no aircraft built in U.S. have been made public knowledge, of this nature.I can accept that this craft could be Man-made or of Extraterrestrial nature.

But just haven’t had the guts to put it into writing I guess lol.. But I guess since no one knows who I am.. I will contribute!!  On my birthday, November 14, 2007.. I left work at 5pm. It was a really foggy night. I drove down Hwy 49 towards the beach in Gulfport and about 5 or 6 blocks from the beach, I saw a large green ""fireball"" shoot down from the sky and behind the Hancock Bank building - out of sight.  I know I wasn’t the only one to see this. It took my breath for a second and I looked around after it was out of sight and noticed that all of the cars around me had kind of hit their brakes as I did and slowed down a little.  This only lasted a couple of seconds and like I said, it was pretty foggy, but I could see it clearly. The fog just made the green glow around it brighter.  Tonight,  December 4, 2007, my daughter just tells me that on her way home to Vancleave, she saw the same thing.  She said she and her boyfriend were driving home on O’neal road in Vancleave and they both saw what she described as ""like a shooting star,"" but bright green.. And ""way too big to be a shooting star.""She said it fell straight down and sort of just disappeared.  I don’t know what it was, or have any kind of explanation for it, but it was amazing!  I saw the same thing once before when we lived in Vancleave off of Jim Ramsey Rd. My daughter’s friend and I were so amazed at some lights that we saw in the sky (blinking red, green, yellow.. And moving in ways that normal aircraft don’t move) that we actually, at the risk of looking crazy, got lawn chairs and sat in the front yard and watched for hours. While we were out there, this bright green “fireball” shot down out of the sky and into the empty lot across the street and just seemed to disappear somewhere between ground level and tree level. We both grabbed onto each other and it just took our breath away! We looked at each other in disbelief.. Just like “did you see that too?” Needless to say, we didn’t sit out there very much longer.. We were both scared to death!  There were other things there at that house as well.. A light shining straight down (like a search light from a helicopter is the only way I could describe it) onto the middle of my street. Dogs were barking out of control as well. I saw this outside of my kitchen window. There were street lights there, but they went off when the light shone down on the street (like when your headlights hit the street lights and they go off sometimes). It moved around a little almost like it was looking for something. If it had been a helicopter.. THAT close to the ground.. There WOULD HAVE BEEN NOISE!! I was in shock.. And called to my daughter who was on the phone. She took one look and told her friend on the phone that it was the “creepiest thing she had EVER SEEN” and said she couldn’t look anymore!  And another night, I was sleeping and my daughter and a different friend walked outside and explained seeing something else odd.. My daughter said “have you ever seen a plane with so many lights?” and her friend responded, “have you ever seen a plane with so many lights flying so close to the ground?” and they both kind of got scared and took off for the front door. They said that by the time they reached the front door, the “thing” was directly over the house.. Moving quickly.. And not making a sound!!  I have also read some of the other sightings in the area and can say that for quite some time, I have been seeing these “things” in the sky.. Distant, but not STAR distant. And they always have the same signature “yellow, green and red lights” flashing.      Sometimes they are in the same place, but other nights they have moved to different locations. I can usually see them outside of my house if I go out and look. A few nights ago, I watched one for about 30 minutes and then all of a sudden, it started to move like an airplane would.. Moved across the sky at a pretty fast speed, but no sound. And I can always hear the normal airplanes at even further distances here. And these things DO NOT MOVE LIKE REGULAR AIRCRAFT!!!  Every time I see anything strange, I call whoever I can get to come and look.. I told them I didn’t want them to think I was “crazy” haha  And every time, they see exactly what I see.. My daughter and my son, daughter’s boyfriend, my mother and my sister. Even an ex boyfriend whose dad is a pilot.. And he said he has seen strange things as well.  So.. Whatever they are.. I can just hope that one of these days I will KNOW for SURE!!  And we are the typical family. I am a single mother of 2 teenagers.. I am an administrative assistant  and my kids are good kids who make good grades in school. As a matter of fact, I told them it might be better to keep it in the immediate family so as not to seem “crazy” to people who have never experienced these kinds of things. =P  Hopefully, in my lifetime, this can all be explained to me better than “flares” or “weather balloons” or “satellites”.  ~ Curious in Mississippi",2008-03-04T00:00:00,30.44264888888889,-89.12384592592592

I called to my sister and she came out just as the two balls got just over the tree line and went out. I started explaining what I seen and one light appeared at about the same place as the other two balls had faded out and hovered above the tree line, then another light appeared, and I told my sister to grab my camera or something so we could take pictures. Then within a few seconds apart 5 lights had shown up out of no where and just hovered. Then one at a time they would move like straight up and over, or one would blink out and show up in another spot, and they made out what looked to us like a L, C, and a W. At no time did they appear to be flying or falling they hovered and glided in the sky at speeds an angles I had never seen planes or anything else do. Sometime while we were watching two people that my sister knew pulled in our yard and jumped out of the car saying they had seen it too.

I looked up and observed a low flying craft approx. 1000-2000 feet up.  It was large but I only vaguely remember the outline being circular or oval in shape.  What drew my attention was a circular formation of lights underneath alternating colors.   I do not recall any other lights on the object.  Our house was just 5 miles north of Richards-Gebauer Airbase so seeing aircraft was common all times of day and night. This would have been about the time that the base was slated for closing but the military traffic continued well past from when I moved from the neighborhood several years later.   The object was moving roughly from the northwest to the south east.  I rememebr someone saying ""Looks like the UFOs are landing.""  I totally freaked and went inside the house.   That was the last I saw and I never talked about it over the years.  I had convinced my self that it was something normal, possibly a blimp.

He related that he did remember, he would have been about 12-14 at the time.  He remembered the object as silvery with lights on the bottom but no other lights.   It was low and he and other(s) (Unknown who the other kids were) went in the backyard as it went over the house.

He distinctly remembers thinking that the object definitely was not an aircraft.   pointed out the possibility of a blimp and we both agreed that that we had never seen a blimp in the area before (Especially due to the presence of the airbase) and we were very familiar with the aircraft that frequented the base since we alsways tried to identify the aircraft by the sound they made as they approached for a landing.

I am not sure about the exact date; but in the housing tract known as Old Orchard One, in Valencia, California, I had been waiting up for my Mother to come home from a late night Bible Study Group. I fell asleep on our exceptionally large sofa. I woke up sometime around 10pm; my Mother had covered me with a comfy blanket and was asleep on the other end of the sofa. I got up from the sofa and went down the hall to the bathroom. I then walked to the kitchen getting myself a glass of water from the sink. Instead of going to my room, I went back to the living room, pulled the covers over me, and curled up on the sofa; I glanced out our large dinning room windows, noticed the street light, and turned towards the wall. Eyes wide open; I remembered cleaning leaves from the neighbor’s lawn, and tidying up the garage that summer for spending cash. ""There was no street light there.?!"" I rolled over and saw a large oval shaped, what looked liked a silver metal color, craft. It had head lights, like those on a big rig, I could see detail, and the lights appeared to be spaced, going all the way around the outer rim of the craft. The lights changed colors; blue, red, green, white. It made no sound that I could hear. It sat about three feet above the neighbor’s roof, and covered the entire roof. The neighbor is aprox. one home over and across a street. I thought to myself, “no one is going to believe this.” I even questioned in my mind, would people even believe my Mother. I knew, my Father being of a logical nature, people would be more likely to believe him. My instinct was to wake my Father, but he was in the back bedroom, down the hall. I slowly moved the covers down and slowly sat up, the craft moved up in the air slightly, so I slowly laid back down, the craft coming  down to its original position. I sat there a moment, starring at the craft and wondering, I repeated the same action, again the craft followed by movements moving upward and returning as I laid back down. Okay, I thought, the craft appears to be mimicking my movement; “this thing is watching me.” I kept watching the craft and thinking what to do, I did not want to be the only witness. I slowly sat up a third time and again, simultaneously, the craft moved up higher into the air, so I laid back down, the craft returning to a hovering position over the roof. I decided to wake my Mother gently; I kicked her foot several times with mine, until she stirred. My Mother, now slightly awake, responded. I asked her in a whisper, ""Mom don't move, just listen. Are your awake?"" My Mother replied, ""Yes."" I told my Mother to very slowly roll over and look out the dining room window, but not to make any sudden movements. Well, she rolled over slowly just fine, the scream that followed and the jumping up and running towards the dinning room window wasn't part of the plan. The craft went straight up into the air, dimmed, went bright, then, I know this sounds strange, but the craft made itself look like a star. Dad came running but didn't understand why our knees were shaking looking at a star. We called the Sheriff and tried to explain, but it sounded so strange, we just decided to hang up. We watched what looked like a star move with the rest of the stars until dawn. Several nights thereafter, at around 10pm, in the sky, in the same general area, a light would come in dim at first, go extremely brig! ht, and then appear to be just another star. We decided to keep the curtains closed after that. The morning after the incident, I stood in our yard, and looked at the spot where the craft had been and said out loud, ""tell my baby I Love them.""  I have no explanation why I said that.  Now, I am not a UFO hunter, never will be, don't want people bothering me, but for the record, so others know, our children had “close encounters.” We don’t discuss the matter much, we just know these incidents did happen. We live our life with all the joy God gave us, and realize what can you do? You can’t change it, you can’t really talk about it, and you don’t want anyone to know, so “it” just happened,  and we’re okay, we don’t live in fear and still enjoy looking at a beautiful night sky.

I was approximately 12 years old, it was summer break.  I had been playing a ballgame with Barry F., Scott K., and Denny W.  It was lunch time and those three went to their respective houses to eat lunch.  I usually did not eat lunch so I waited in the open carport of Scott's house.  It was approximately noon, it has been a long time so I am estimating the approximately month, day, and year.  It was near the intersection of Showalter Court and Seabridge Drive in the Laurel Park Subdivision in Orlando, Florida.  Barry's house was on the southeast corner, Denny's house was on the northeast corner, and Scott's house was one house to the east of Barry's house.  I sat in the carport of Scott's house facing north.  I observed a white or silver in color craft which looked like a rocket sideways, a cylinder with a pointed top.  But the rocket looking craft was not flying upwards like a rocket launch, the craft was flying sideways in a counterclockwise motion from north to the west to the south very slowly.  The craft did not have wings.  I lived not too far from what is today the Orlando International Airport, but then it was not an International Airport.  And I had lived near McCoy Airforce Base before that house, so I had seen plenty of airplanes and jets.  When I saw the craft I immediately began yelling for the occupants inside Scott's house to come out.  I was even banging on the door. Finally, Scott's older sisters which were in high school came out.  But the craft had flown to the west out of sight.  I was very nervous trying to explain to them what I saw, but it was not there when they came out.  I then ran home as fast as I could.  I began explaining to my mom and grabbed her by the hand to come outside and look at the strange craft.  But two story apartments were built to the south of our home and the apartments blocked the view of the craft as it flew from the west to the south still in a circular counterclockwise motion.  I had not talked about the incident for almost 23 years when I had a great aunt on my maternal side come visit and have dinner.  During the night she mentioned about actual encounters with alien beings which included time loss, implantation of a device (which she states her doctor removed from her abdomen), and several follow up visits by aliens.  I had not said a thing to her when she confronted me about seeing an unidentified craft.  Her words I cannot recall totally were something to the effect of ""And you know because you have seen one haven't you?""  I could only explain this confrontation as strange.  I never said a word to her about the incident.  I did not know a sight like this existed.  I am currently a field grade military officer in the Army Reserves.  I am also a sworn law enforcement officer working as a detective.  I cannot explain what I saw on that summer day, but it continues to be unexplained and unknown to me what the craft was that I observed.

Virgin Islands),  Shape: Disk Duration:130 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53605.html,"Visible in the mid-day I was 11 years old, living with my mother in an apartment on the North Side of St.Thomas, in estate Rosenthahl. The North side of the island was very undeveloped at the time, so there were few houses nearby, it was mostly jungle or ""bush"" near our house. My mother was out on the balcony watering potted plants when she called me to come look at something. I came out and saw a saucer like aircraft hovering almost at eye-level to us. Our apartment was aproximatley 500 to 700 feet above sea-level on the side of a mountain. Magen's Bay was to the left of our view and we looked out at a small hill just opposite of our building, about 400 feet opposite. On the other side of the small hill is now Mahogany Run gold course which, at the time belonged to St. Thomas Dairy and was a pasture. The Atlantic Ocean is beyond. It was a perfectly clear sunny day and the sun was behind us, we were looking due north. The craft was brilliantly shiny, like highly polished chrome and the sun glinted off of it, the rest of it appeared dark because it was in shadow. I was trying to figure out how far away from us it was; I think it was beyond the hill opposite of us, probably about a half mile away, hovering above the pasture, but visible to us over the top of the small hill. Prior to this experience, I thought a spinning saucer shaped ufo was an absurd concept, but this was not spinning, and there it was before my eyes. It appeared disc shaped because of the way the sun was glinting off of it, but we were seeing its edge, from the side. It was like two thin pie plates one inverted on top of an upright one on the bottom. It was sleek and stealth. The lower portion in shadow was more pie plate shaped, with more vertical sides, the top was flatter. It was not mushroom cap shaped. It was not very large, about 15 to twenty feet in diameter. It made no sound. It was a quiet day and all you could hear were the birds singing. The most remarkable thing about it was how it moved. At first it was absolutely still then it moved from left to right with unwavering precision, and back again and up and down a very little. It moved only about 20 to 40 feet to the sides, as if it were focusing or getting a better angle. It moved up and down only about 10 feet or so. Every movement it made was exact, no wobble, and it went from absolute standstill to movement with no acceleration or deceleration. It moved with phenomenal speed, from zero to super fast to zero again without any lurching. It stopped between left and right movements and stayed unmoving for a couple seconds, and I definitely had the impression it was observing my mother and I as we were watching it. It stayed in the same area of the sky, right in front of us for the majority of the time, and then moved further to the left, as if it was checking out something else and stayed there for only a few seconds more and then it abruptly took off in an ascending arc, going north-west from horizontal to about 45 degrees at a phenomenal rate of speed and disappeared from sight into the dark blue zenith of the sky. The duration that we observed it was hardly more than a minute. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2006-12-07T00:00:00,,

I was about 14 years old at the time and still remember the events quite clearly.  One does not easily forget something like that.   We were out fishing at one of the neighbors ponds and it was getting pretty dark so we decided to head back to my uncle's house.  When we got to the location where the truck was parked, somebody pointed out several small lights that seemed to be traveling in a criss-cross pattern back and forth across the moon.  We started back home - I think we were traveling on Fox Run Road.  My cousins, brother and I were all in the back of the truck and it seemed like the lights were following us.  When we got to the house, we noticed a single bright light moving slowly from left to right just above the horizon and across the road from the house.  It was probably a few miles in the distance.  The light stopped and hovered for less than a minute.  Then it got very bright and in a flash it was gone.  We could not detect any sounds.  If there were any we should have been able to hear them in such a remote and quiet place.  I remember my cousins talking about reported cattle mutilations the next day and how somebody had found branches with flies burned into them.  That's all I can recall clearly.  There may have been some helicopters flying over the area shortly after we saw the lights but that part I'm not 100% sure of.

Anyway, I was a sophomore in high school and I was with my girlfriend and I obviously didn't have a car, and we wanted to make out. We lived within a block of one another and two blocks down the street was a small playground, so we would go down there because there were no lights, so it was extremely dark, except when the moon was out, which it wasn't this night or we wouldn't have went. there was a small merry-go-round I think it's called. and we would sit on it and kiss and stuff. We were going at it when all of a sudden there was all this light coming from above us. It looked like this thing was right above the tree tops (there were alot of trees there), and it was weird, because you could see this thing, it was round and had different colored lights going around on the bottom with one big white round light in the middle, but what was weird about it was it was blowing the treetops apart so it could see us, but it didn't make a sound. You would think the trees would have a rustling sound or something, but there was no noise at all, I'll never forget it. It scared the hell out of us and we ran. There was a small three hole practice golf course across the road where people took golf lessons and perpendiculur to that a small canal that had a small bridge. We ran for our lives because we were so scared and when we ran, this ""thing"" followed us so I told my girlfriend to run towards the bridge and I was going to run across the golf course unless it followed her, then I was going to follow her to. Then when we split up this thing stopped, like it was confused and didn't know which way to go and I was looking over my shoulder and saw this and I stopped and then it just zipped away in the opposite direction like some kind of cartoon or something and I yelled at my girlfriend who was still running and she turned around and stopped and then turned back towards me an! d we reu nited and was walking home not really knowing what to say, but we agreed not to say anything because we figured everyone would think we were nuts, because back then this kind of thing was sort of unheard of, not like today, but most importantly because of what we were doing there, we didn't want to get in trouble. So, that's it. One thing I would like to add. I was watching a show about ufos on tv and I saw this story about these police officers chasing a ufo in I think it was Ohio and they showed and gave a description of the ufo that they saw, and I think that was the one where it was round with multi-colored lights. If I have the right one, I really can't remember (the one on tv), but that is exactly what we saw, exactly. It was eerie watching it, because it happened so long ago it seemed unreal until I saw the ufo special on tv. Anyway, that's my story, and I'd really rather not name names and stuff cause a.) I don't want anyone thinking I'm crazy, I don't really believe in anything, unless there's some kind of proof and even though I know what I saw, I still don't know what to think about it, and b.)my girlfriend back then, it's up to her to tell if she wants, personally I can understand if she doesn't. There's a reason I never told anyone about it and it's because no one would probably believe me.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,,

I looked up and saw a silver metallic disc in the southwest sky of our location. This object was zigzagging at such a fast rate. It was such an abnormal flight pattern. My first thought was that it was possibly a kite. So I looked down to see if anyone had a string below. After not seeing anyone below, I looked up again and continued to see this object zigzag. The best way I can think of describing what I saw is to compare it to someone holding a mirror or metal object, and then reflecting the sun off of it. The event lasted about 45 seconds. The metallic disc then just took off up and out of sight. There were no lights on it; no bulb; no haze; or any other crafts with it.  I went home and expected to see something on the news about it. No such luck. Being that I was a juvenile at the time, I didn't really give it too much thought. I figured there had to be a rational explanation to what we had all seen.

While on Hubbard nearing the mall we saw a saucer shaped craft hovering over a 3 bedroom home.  It was as wide as the house. The house was at least a 1000 sq. foot two story home.  The saucer could be explained as having 3 parts and silver or brushed aluminum in color. The lower base, the center which had circular multi-colored lights that rotated around the ship, and the upper dome. The lower dome had a lens (not sure if it was a light).  After stopping the car in the middle of the street we got out of it yelling. People came outside. Then the craft started to move (with not sound at all) and we followed it down towards Farilane Mall. It then went beyond our view covered by a tree line.  I went home after this event. Later that day my mother and sister came home after going to the same mall and told me what they saw. I mentioned to them I was in my car following it.  This was one of those times you ask yourself why did I not have a camera!

I was walking north on 8th avenue in Manhattan.  It was about 44th st.  I was walking on the west side of the street. I was walking past a Japanese restaurant. I saw two people standing outside, smoking a cigarette (I assume they worked at the restaurant, but didn’t ask), and looking up. What I saw (and this is from memory so it isn’t great) is a dark grey/black ball, about the size of a basketball.  It was hovering over the building across the street.  The building was about 5-6 stories tall, so my guess is that the object was 70-80 feet above the street.  My first thought was that it was a black plastic bag that had been blown up by wind currents up the side of the building.  But I didn’t see any of the loop type handles or an opening. My second thought was that it was a balloon.  I’m still not sure that it wasn’t that, but either a bag or a balloon would normally move in a thrusting jerky type motion, depending on the wind currents.  This didn’t.  At some point after it was hovering, it moved at a slow, but steady pace across/over the street. It took maybe a minute for it to go over say 4-5 lanes of traffic. After that, I lost sight of it as it drifted above the building I was standing in front of. At the time it didn’t seem like a typical UFO because I would think of those as more of a craft. This didn’t seem like a craft at all because of its small size, but its smooth motion didn’t seem like a balloon or bag either. I now carry a small camcorder with me in case I see something again.

Approximately September 2, 2006 I was photographing a beautiful rapidly changing sky.  Two days later I was reviewing my photos on the computer to eliminate the undesirable ones when I noticed some rather interesting forms on the photos.  Honestly, through the view finder on the camera, I never noticed anything as I was focused on the colors. None of the other photos have anything strange on them, eliminating the possibility that something was on the lens. I use a 10.0 excellent digital camera. On one photo there are two distinct images. One looks cylindrical with a bump in the middle. It actually looks like smoke is propelling it. In the same photo, directly to the left is another object, quite a bit smaller, obviously at a further distance. Another photo has a round bright dot which is amongst some dark clouds. To the far right you will see a drain pipe that comes from my building. In the third photo there is an elongated ""something"" that is directly above the house in the photo. Proportionately, it is huge. These were all taken within minutes of each other along with other photos of the area. I will be emailing the photos to you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We see nothing in the three photographs sent to our Center that is suggestive of a genuine UFO.  Two photos are suggestive of birds caught in mid-flight, and under low light conditions.  The third photo suggests part of an overhang on a nearby house, we believe.  PD))",2007-04-27T00:00:00,,

When we filled our catch, we walked out of the woods and set along the road and waited for a ride that had dropped us off earlier. It was now getting close to midnight, when all of a sudden, the wind picked up to about twenty miles an hour or so.  When this happened, we all looked up through the mature hardwood trees.  When all of a sudden, four sets of spot lights came into our field of view. Two side by side, with the other two directly below the others.  They moved very slowly, just barely above the tree tops, maybe a mile or two an hour tops. There was no noise except the wind which put us all on edge, because the chance of it being a helicopter were out, due to the lack of engine or blade noise. Then it got worse, in a triangle formation the size of a 747 airplane, were two huge glowing orange balls trailing behind the spot lights giving the object shape and size. The glowing balls were at least thirty feet across or so. We sat there in a dumfounded stare, until it past out of sight, then the wind calmed down snapping us back to reality to discuss what just happened. A few minutes later are ride came and we all excitedly told him what happened as we made the four mile drive back to town. On the last mile stretch running parallel with us was a helicopter, obvious by the blade sounds, but at first sight sent a chill through us. The helicopter kept pace with us into town and then fizzled off some where. We told a few people about what we saw and of course we got the ""You're Crazy"" look a lot. Then about two weeks later my cousin was sitting on his balcony late at night having a drink, when he saw exactly what we had described, going across the woods line outside of town. We never saw this thing again, but there's lots of swamp land and woods that give good cover. Which leaves only a couple of questions, what the heck was it and why was it in the middle of B.F.E.

The light was stationary for about 20 seconds, almost appearing as part of Cassiopeia.

No alcohol was involved at the birthday party.  So we decided to go way up into the mountain to play because we thought it would be more fun, But boy were we wrong!  First a blinding light flashed down upon us, amost paralyzing us of all movement for a couple of seconds.  Then two figures came out of the blinding light and spoke in an unknown language.  At this time we were about 50 yards away behind a large rock.  They stood and studied the surrounding for a couple of seconds and then proceded to take some samples.  After samples were taken they began to slowly move back toward the origin of the light before disappearing into it.  the aliens were somewhere around 6 1/2 feet tall to 7 feet. They wore no close but their bodies looked to be armoured from head to toe, almost like they were engineered for war.  They were rather skinny, but had extremely large limbs.  They had a small head with the eyes taking up the majority of the face.  the eyes were completely white and it seemed as though the light was shining through them.  They had a very small mouth and did not appear to possess any ears, but looked as though they had small holes in the sides of their heads.  Now for the craft.  It was very hard to get a clear look at the craft because of the light but it appeared to be a small ball shaped pod with no windows.  It did not have any of the typical flashing lights like you would think but it did have a very bright pulsating glow.  The pod moved very quickly and was very agile, almost as if it teleported from place to place.

Still, I appreciate the open and questioning nature of the NUFORC website, and I’d like to respond. First of all, I am well aware of the planes towing the banners.  Usually they are for the ""12 Oaks"" Townhouses.  It couldn’t be more obvious that a small plane is towing a white banner with clearly legible type.  Not by any stretch of the imagination is this remotely a possibility for what I saw.  Neither was it a billboard or a streetlight or a street sign. It was a smoky matte black rectangle, close enough so that I could see it was quite large, in the same way that you can quickly tell if a nearby airplane is a child’s toy, a small plane like the ones that tow the banners, or a large jumbo jet.  This rectangle was clearly a jumbo.  And it was hanging in the air, moving slowly or possibly not at all when I first sighted it.  It was electrifying to see it, and in one second I ruled out all the usual suspects- a sign, a light, and yes, I even briefly considered a banner as a possibility.  But this was obviously an independent floating or flying craft of some kind, with no supporting poles or strings attached. I got a very clear and long look at the rectangle in a large open area, above the horizon, with no obscuring foliage, as I continued down the raised highway.  It was one of those things I’ll remember crystal clearly for the rest of my life.  At this point it was evident that yes, the craft was moving, albeit relatively slowly, much slower than even a small airplane would move.  And the edges were distinct and crisp, although there was an unusual, almost ominous tone to the black color.  It was sort of unearthly, actually, a smoky matte black, as I stated earlier.  I felt that it was metallic.  I believe I was looking at a side panel or back panel or front panel of the craft.  At the time, I thought that the rest of the ship was hidden by perspective, but now I tend to think it was camouflaged with the exception of this one panel, for whatever reason. My great regret is that I didn’t stop the car and flag down other motorists to be witnesses.  I thought of doing it, but it would have been very dangerous in the rush-hour traffic with a narrow shoulder, with me not wanting to take my eyes off this incredible ship in the sky.  I’m glad I was able to keep looking at it, though, because as I was watching it in this wide-open area it just faded away, or ""cloaked out,"" before my eyes, as if it realized it was being watched.  Briefly, I could see a diffuse rectangular shape well camouflaged against the blue sky, sort of like a rectangular panel of water hanging in the air might look like from a distance.  The ship definitely disappeared from ""cloaking,"" as opposed to traveling too quickly to observe.  Absolutely amazing. Since then, I’ve researched these types of sightings quite a bit.  The shape I saw is very much like the shape I’ve seen witnesses draw of the sides of ""black triangles"" or similar craft.  Some people believe these are secret American military craft- perhaps a ""stealth blimp""- but I find that very hard to believe.  Reports of these types of sightings go back over half a century, and have become quite common the last decade or so.  These ships, usually seen in heavily populated areas, are sometimes seen to move at incredible, apparently instantaneous-type speeds.  I saw one fade from view right before my eyes.  If we’ve had these ships for half a century, which in itself is ludicrous, we’d have been using them in battle for quite some time now.  I’ve seen a Stealth Bomber flying up close, and as awesome as the Stealth Bomber was, I have to say that the black ""rectangle"" was a lot more amazing.  An advertising banner?  Absolutely not!",2007-04-27T00:00:00,42.05010904159132,-88.09256772151899

I saw a metallic flash through the tree branches and thought ""there's the plane"".  But then, I saw several other metallic flashes and I stepped out into the open looking up.  There was a configuration of 10-12 metallic-type balls.  At first I thought they were balloons, but that didn't make sense.  Then I thought they must be birds which also made no sense.  The sky was clear blue but was surrounded by heavy clouds to the east over the Santa Cruz mountains.

Suddenly, the left sphere in the lead group instantly ""dipped"" towards the lead sphere and then darted back into its previous location.  I watched them move from northeast to southwest heading towards the Monterey Bay.  I called the newspaper to find out if anyone else had reported seeing spheres in the sky flying in formation. They told me no.  I live approximately four blocks from West Cliff Drive in Santa Cruz City.   The weather had cleared, the sun had been shining for a couple of hours and so I know there had to be lots of people jogging, surfing and walking their dogs.   I can't believe I am the only one who witnessed this phenomena.  I talked to my husband, who has a Ph.d in quantum physics and chemistry.  He suggested balloons..maybe someone let a bunch of balloons go at the same time---but as I told him  ""  Since when do balloons fly in formation?""   I used to work on the original F/A-18 program at Patuxent Naval Air Station.  I know a little something about aircraft.  These were no aircraft and were definitely metal or metallic.  They were so bright with the sun shining on them.   The only other observation I found weird was the silence.

And she got feeling there was something strange about the thing then it glistened and it was shiny. It had a strange pattern of movement. It was a significant size, possibly the size of a roof or even a house.""  The witnesses watched it for a couple of minutes, rotating in the distance and heading towards Wandsworth Town. Then, as soon as it had appeared it vanished.  The witness said if it was a piece of rubbish it would have caused severe damage when it came down, because of its size and density.  A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it had not been notified of any sighting of the pyramid.  ""The MoD does not have any expertise or role in respect of UFO/flying saucer' matters or to the question of the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial lifeforms, about which it remains totally open-minded.""  He said it examined the reports of UFO sightings it received solely to establish whether what was seen might have some defence significance, namely whether there was any evidence the UK's airspace might have been compromised by hostile or unauthorised air activity.  The witnesses said there has been a lot of activity in the skies over Putney recently and they had seen several Chinook helicopters over the past week and believe something must be going on.  A spokesman for the MoD said the helicopters were probably part of general aviation traffic over London and there was no specific activity or event they were involved in.

I must emphasize that these objects could not be seen with the naked eye, and if I did not have my sunglasses on, I would not have even seen the intial object. I searched the sky to make sure I was not in fact seeing stars, but no other objects similar to it could be seen in the crystal blue sky’s background.  After sometime of viewing them, about only fifteen minutes the objects I was observing simply vanished.  I live on the North side of Chicago and see Aircraft on approach to O’Hare international every day, but these objects had to be 50’000 feet or so, and the greenish Diamond object had to be quite large as it appeared to me to be a star. ((FOLLOW-UP FROM SAME WITNESS)) follow up I contacted the flight service station and for my report they told me the following  45 thousand feet winds were at 290@33 53 thousand feet winds were at 300@16   I saw the formation moving from the North to the Southeast.

There were some odd cloud formations that I thought would be cool to post as stock on my Deviant Art account. I got a few pictures of some planes with their vapor trails from the cooling weather and when I looked over into the eastern part of the southern sky, I saw something odd. There was a very bright object in the sky, about the size of a large blimp, moving slowly through the sky. I say it was odd because not only was it so bright compared to the planes I had been photographing, but it also had no vapor trail. None of the other planes were without one. So I took a few pictures of it. I should have clicked my camera, a Nikon Coolpix 4200 to video, but I wasn't sure what I was seeing. I watched it for about 2 minutes, then went inside to tell my wife and mother about it. I was only inside maybe 15-20 seconds. When I stepped back out it had gone. At the original rate it was moving, had it held constant, it shouldn't have gone very far in that time. And if it was a plane, it should still have been in view in the areaI was looking in. But there was nothing. I went back inside and began looking at the pictures. The first one I looked at had everyone blinking in shock. As I zoomed in you could see the object, no vapor trail visible, and you could see from the light reflecting on it that it was ROUND! It looked like a big, silvery inner tube. I checked the other pictures out and all but one was too fuzzy to make out. As I went to crop one of the other pictures so you could get a better view of it, my hand slid wrong and enlarge the picture in a space above the UFO I was trying to crop. And I froze. My heart actually skipped a beat. In the sky above the bright UFO were 3 more dark objects. One was larger than the other and at an angle, with two smaller ones below it. I have cropped these with the bright UFO, and then separately so you can have an understanding of the perspective. The photos were taken in Cadillac, Michigan.

My husband and I were returning to our home in Caliente, NV, from a business trip to Carson City, NV.  We were on Hwy. 375 Westbound approximately 3 miles beyond Nye/Lincoln Co. border, about 20 miles from Rachel.  My husband first spotted the UFO from the driver’s side window and told me to look.  It was glowing orange, resembling the color of rocket flame exhaust or jet engine under thrust propulsion.  It appeared to be cigar shaped, but from our vantage seemed to be a disk shaped object seen from the side.   It initially appeared to be about  ½ mi. away from us and from that distance probably 25 feet thick, (top to bottom) and 250-300 feet in diameter. These are very rough guesses from night time viewing.  It was a clear and bright night, the moon full.  There appeared a series of 6-8 ‘boxes’ on what we believe to be the side of the craft.  The boxes lit up sequentially from right to left, remaining aglow for 10-15 seconds before reversing the process and slowly extinguishing.  It then reappeared some distance to the right (E) and farther away.  At the end of each sequence, only the forward most orange light remained visible.  We maintained visual contact until it crested the range of mountains due NE of Rachel and SW of Caliente.  The next visual contact was at mile marker 73 on US Hwy. 93N, 20 miles outside of Caliente.  We were E bound coming out of an area known as Delamar Flats and entering the local mountain range known as the Caliente Summit (Oak Springs Summit).  We saw one flash appearing much further in the distance, due E of our location and repeated its sequence twice.  At the end of the second sequence the front glowing light remained constant, visible until it became so distant in the horizon it disappeared.   It maintained its single glowing orange light and looked almost like an orange star in the night sky.  The time summary of the entire viewing event from start to finish was about a half hour.  I was unable to photograph object because of my autofocus camera not cooperating.  We do not believe to have had any loss of time or do not suspect abduction.

They were not evenly illuminated, and never changed color, nor did they illuminate anything but themselves.   I watched them the entire time the plane passed over them, and they never left the area.

Since I just recently found information on chemtrails and am still learning about this, I wasn’t sure that it was safe to have my windows open if the “chem-clouds” were still there.  While I was peering out the window into the dark sky, trying to determine whether I could see anything, a very large mass of light passed behind a chem-cloud showing me that, in fact, the chemtrails were still there.  I would call this a “ball” of light, except the mass was diffused behind the chem-cloud so I couldn’t see any precise shape to it.  But my guess was that it was a “ball” of light.  It didn’t make any sound. This wasn’t like anything I have ever seen before.  Stars and planets and planes all have small points of sparkling light that are either stationary or traveling in a mostly straight path.  This light was many times larger, like a huge cotton ball sliding down a winding path in order to stay behind the curved chem-cloud swooping like a giant bird, covering much more distance than a plane.  Its motion appeared almost playful.  It appeared in the east and swooped to the west.  As soon as it was gone, about 5 to 10 seconds later, another one appeared in the east and swooped to the west like it was following the same identical winding path to stay hidden behind the chem-cloud.  When that one was gone, about 5 to 10 seconds later, another appeared.  It finally dawned on me that I should start counting.  So I can’t be positive, but I think that there were approximately 6 in all and identical in size, light, and path--except for the last one.  That one surprised me when it got to the west side, because it turned slightly and came back a short distance before it disappeared.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,44.9822,-92.6995

He took me outside and showed me towards the East and another one on the South East. He said they have been in that same place since he got home and he thought it was and airplane at first because of the blinking lights, but then he noticed that they did not move. My husband has the eyes of an Eagle, so I could not tell w/ the naked eye the different colors, I could see some color change but not real clear. Then when I got the binoculars and I looked at it and I screamed!!. It was definitely changing the 4 colors mentioned above. It was brilliant. He went and got the telescope and it really looked brilliant then. It seemed like the colors was going 'around' the object. One time I saw through the binoculars like a 'light' came out of it, cone shape like= < that pointed towards the other one, that did not last for long. There was a haze around it that throbbed. The one in the South East seemed bigger or closer to us, than the one in the East. They both had the same color blinking around them. We looked at them until 3:00 AM and they were still relatively in the same spots. Both were too far for us to be able to tell what kind of shape they were. But if we had to guess we would say they might have been round, sphere, or saucer shape. We wondered if they might have been satellites. But surely a satellite would have moved w/ the earth's rotation in 3 hours times?!?  Would like to find out if anyone else saw then, and or, if they might have been satellites.

The light was traveling from south to north-northeast changing shapes. Changing shapes like from diamond to oval to circle, at no pattern. At this point, I was transfixed. It took about 45 sec. to respond as I was not sure what I was looking at. Then two other lights, also flashing different colors and shapes, were lined up in the same area as I saw the first.

I will email because it is too long for this box. ((COPIED REPORT)) I began watching a movie on Dish Network and all of a sudden the picture cut-off. An error message was displayed saying my smart card was not allowed to access the channel. This was true for all channels. I am a service tech by trade and did my best to correct the problem with no results. Fustrated, I walked out on the patio to smoke a cigarette. As I sat there, cows began mooing and whaling. I passed this off as a nuisance as well. As I pet the dogs, the female dog stuck her ear up as if to hear something. Using the local colloquialism I said, ""Geeet-em!"" Both dogs ran out in the yard after a grey figure that I saw moving very swiftly, standing upright. As they barked, coyotes began to howl; They were all over the place! There were three different packs from the North, South, and West Directions. The pack from the north was extremely close, and it sounded as if they were in the front yard. I was surprised that I could not see the coyotes but had seen the other figure. The coyotes returned howls back and forth along with all of the sparsely placed neighbors' dogs. The cows began to moo again accompaning all the other sounds of animals. As this was going on I heard a humming sound in the sky start to get louder and louder. This is when I became really nervous, because too many strange things were happening for me to write them off as coincidence. I looked and looked at the sky but could not see a plane or helicopter that was making this noise. The more I looked for something in the sky, the louder the noise became. Finally the noise was so loud that it somehow was making me lethargic and had a sort of hypnotic effect. I almost lost conscienceness, but began to fight the effect it was having on me. Please keep in mind that the coyotes were still yipping and yelping while all this was going on, but the the dogs had retreated to the patio and were just as frightened as I was. Everytime I would glance at the female dog, she would growl under her breath as if she knew that the occurence was threatening in some way. As the noise prolonged, I then noticed what I would describe as a ""light shadow"". It was a oval shape of light in the front yard that appeared on the lawn, but yet there was no ray or beam projecting that light onto the ground. It was light without a source, and it moved in a quirky manner in a circular pattern. I felt an energy trying to communicate with me, but I kept thinking: ""No, No, No, I don't belive it!"" It was almost as if I was trying to deny its existence in order for it to go away. And quicker than a flash everything was gone, the world was still and peaceful, and I was left doubting everything I had seen. Doubting what I saw did not help, however, because nothing could be justified in my mind as to explain, logicallly, what had happened.    I know that every sighting must first be considered as a hoax, however I must iterate that this was the first time I have ever experienced anything so unexplainable. Until now, I did not belive in such things. What I saw, heard, and felt has changed my mind forever on the subject.

I was at work and I stepped out for a cigarette and it was a beautiful blue cloudless sky.  I looked up to the sky and off in the northwest direction I could see a glimmering (looked like a sun reflection, rather than lights) and slow moving object in the sky.  It was very small from the distance away, so this object was very hard for me to determine any shape or relative size.  It moved so slowly and occasionally would ascend and descend rapidly at what seemed a thousand feet or so, but would then fall back into it's snail pace travel across the sky.  Two other guys came out or the building and noticed me looking up, so they inquired what I was looking at and I pointed it out.  One fellow grabbed onto the object immediately, while the other could not seem to fixate on it. Again..It was pretty high up and small.  Anyway...as we were looking up, we saw two orange and black chevron shaped objects fly across the sky into our felid of viewing from the west and turn into an eastern direction at a super rate of speed and a much lower elevation than the other object.  The two objects then made a sharp turn toward the west and did not separate or lose any ground to each other during this maneuver.  It was incredible to watch at the speed they were moving.  Total precision is the best way to describe it. Then they ascended to a little higher altitude and made another minor turn (again, perfect precision) and climbed and headed toward the first object that I originally spotted at the higher altitude.  These two black and orange chevron objects made zero noise that I or the other two could detect and we looked at each other stunned after and the looks on our faces related pretty much the same question...""What Was That""?  All three objects then vanished from our naked eyes, once the chevron objects appeared to re-unite with the first object.

My attention was drawn to the sky along with a few other peoples attention.  Soon after i noticed a light gaining size rapidly and it grew to be the biggest light in the sky atleat 3 times the size of a star and then it was the brightest shinning light in the sky for about 2 whole minutes.  Then short after everyone drew their attention to it.  It caught off as if someone had flipped a light switch and turnned all power off.

As a first note, there was no comsumption of alchohol or any use of drugs. I am a 16 year old male.  I was working in Pinnacles national monument.  One night, my fellow crew mates and I decided to go on a park sponsored star hike. we hiked one mile to an outlook high above the base canyon.  when we got there, we observed stars and various formations.  THe ranger leading the tour had a high powered laser pointer of sorts which was capable of projecting and extremely bright, concetrated beam of light that he used to point out stars.  The presentation passed without incident.  The encounter happened on our hike back down.  A we descended, i was looking at stars when i noticed a strange formation of what looked like 3 sattelites.  However upon further examination, i realized that the lights we set in a perfect triangle formation. The 3 lights that i saw were much too far spaced out to be an airplane.  Further more, the  was no true body connecting the dots.  You could see straight through whatever was connecting the lights.  Finally i said ""Hey, what's that thing?"".  The group looked up.  THe ranger replied, ""i have no idea.  I've never seen anything like that.""  My leader suggested that the ranger use his star pointer to try and signal the object.  The ranger pulled out his pointer and shot three short burst of light at the object.  Upon being signalled, the object banked sharply down and within that second, dissappeared into thin air.  It was the strangest thing i'd ever seen. contact me by email only and i can give you other witnesses to the incident.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,,

In May of 2005 one of my two older sisters had just got her first house and wanted me to move in with her for awhile to help with money and just to keep her company.So i moved out of my parents house and started living with her just right on the other side of town.It is a regular suburban neiborhood with plenty of streetlights, porch lights, and those lights above your garage, just to let you know.  Just east of Plainfield is Indianapolis and just west is plenty of nothing,just a bunch of feilds basically and highway 40.  I have always been interested in ufos and ets since i was probably about 6 years old.Because around the age of 6 me and my family, me,mom,dad,and my two older sisters moved into a really big really old looking house in Russelville the county just west of this.There were these really old and dusty and stinky books on ufos and aliens in the house when we moved in, and that is where my interest in it all began.  But anyway, so i was living with my sister and i liked it, it was fun. I cant remember the exact night it was but it was around the middle of August of 2005, and im pretty sure it was a Friday night.I was doing what i always did there on a Friday night, just staying up late watching tv.One of my favorite movies came on at 2:30 and it was do to go off at 4:10.So i watched the movie all the way through and at the end of the movie during all the credits, i got up and stretched and yawned and all that good stuff,and peaked out my window for no reason really.  The exact second i peaked out the blinds, i could see 3 entities walking across the street under a streetlight staring at me, like they knew i was going to look out the window at that exact second.They did not stop and stare at me, they kept on walking and looked at me while they were walking.There were 2 taller ones and 1 shorter one.They walked very strangly, kinda like zombies, with their backs bent way down low, and their arms just dangeling(long limbs) and their heads were just dangeling aswell but cocked a little to look at me.The heads were slightly larger than human but not much.And they were not walking side by side they were walking back to back with the short one in the middle.  Because of the lighting or whatever i could not tell what color they were, they just looked black even right under the streetlight,and i couldnt see the eyes either, basically i could just see the outline of them, but that i could make out quite clearly. So im up in my room looking at them and they are looking at me and im looking at them and they are lookin at me untill i couldnt see them any more because i lost sight of them behind the houses i guess.So the next thing i did was take my hand off the blinds, take a step back, put my hands on my head and said""what do i do now"", and as soon as i said that i slowly fell to the floor, i could not use my legs at all, and my heart was beating very fast. And while i was on the floor in panic i could smell something that i can only describe as 'insanity' , but not like an odor in the room but rather way up in my nose.  I crawled to my recliner cause i did not have a bed, thats what i slept in every night, and i lied there in panic, still unable to use my legs and my heart racing, i have never had a harder time trying to keep my eyes open, but i was afraid to fall asleep. While im laying there i reached for my cell phone, i thought about calling my other sister who lives in the same neiborhood, i even thought about calling 911 or screaming so my sister in bed could hear me. Fortunatly i was able to maintain my composure and just sit there and suffer through it and wait it out.  Eventually after about 20 minutes my heart slowed back down to normal speed, and i could slowly but surely walk again, and open my freagin eye lids. I was just glad to be OK.  I soon fell asleep. I woke up the next morning fine for the most part. Ive been thinking about that night ever since. The anxiety of the experience is long gone by now, however i still think about it. To be honest i think about it and ""them"" all the time.  I dont know why the hell that happend but it did. Sometimes i think that i was not supposed to see them, but i did, and maybe they demobilized my legs so i could not run outside and and get a closer look or something, i really dont know, all i know is what i saw.  Ive told my experiece to one very well known website, ive never heard back from them, i think they think im jokeing but im not. thank you.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,39.6858,-86.4106

It had its ""headlight"": on like before but this time it was dim like a cars headlight going out.   It hung there for a few moments and when I walked out into the field and put my glasses on to get a better look, its light got bright for a few seconds like it was powering up and then it pivited and took off behind the tall trees like it did before and I couldn't see it anymore.  When it turned it was sort of plane shape and it had a few colored lights on it. It was almost as if it knew that I was there like before and it didn't want me to see too much.

I remember as a kid of about 6 years old; they ran into the house yelling at our parents saying they'd seen this ""colourful object in the sky"" which they called a ""Flying Saucer"",..... In the 60's, anything out of the ordinary in the sky was termed ""Flying Saucer"".. But over the years, after hearing (both)their stories, this thing was anything but a ""Flying Saucer"". Here is what they saw: Both my brothers (about 12 yeays old),were in the street playing with a friend.The elder of my brothers noticed an object in the sky that didn't look like a plane, he pointed it out to my 2nd elder brother and their friend. There was a football match going on in a field about 50m away,and there were actually two police men amongst the spectators.   According to my brothers, this object was rectangular in shape,about 50m square in dimension,at an altitude of about 300m (only an estimation), the object had port-holes and was silent. But as a kid, what struck me most was the fact that my brothers said the object constantly changed colours ""throughout the spectrum"". Recently, I quizzed both my brothers on the incident, this gave new elements to their story; apparently, the craft was not perfectly rectangular, but the bottom of the craft resembled the hull of a ship... Also, after about 1min in a stationary position, the craft fell, in the words of my brother ""as if you let a feather drop from your hand"", the curb/or trajectory then sent it east in the direction of Wales in the UK.

July, San Juan, Puerto Rico (mid-afternoon): 1969:  Dark Gray Ovals   I was 14 years old then, arriving on the island of Puerto Rico from Connecticut with my parents; we had a house in San Juan which we rented, and needed yearly maintenance.  I heard a lot of talk on the radio, and through local word of mouth about unusual sightings in the skies all over the island.  I often climbed roofs where on two clear nights I saw several fuzzy circles flying over the city near the airports (there are two airports in the city, one a military, the other a civilian international airport).  These objects were flying very slowly, and seemed to reflect the city lights (having no lights of their own). On another day, in our backyard,  I saw two dark gray oval objects in the distance on the flight path of our commercial airliners (our house is directly on that path).  However, these objects were slightly oval, dark gray, and made no sound.  Being aware that these might be UFO’s I made a point to observe them carefully as they flew almost directly overhead (see diagram).  They flew slightly askew from each other, as in formation, keeping a perfectly straight course northward (towards the Atlantic).  Because I was in the yard, the house overhang soon blocked my view of them, but I climbed to the roof on a tall iron gate: I was up in less than 30 seconds, but to my bewilderment they were gone!  Thinking they had gone inside low clouds, I waited for them to reappear on the other side, but after waiting several minutes, they were gone. For years I wondered about these events, and only now I am reporting them officially. They could not have been balloons because they did not wobble, or altered their distance from each other, and, most importantly, they did not move with the prevailing wind (since they appeared to go diagonally into moving clouds).  I am a serious person (I work in human services in my city); I would not deceive anyone by telling this story, and now, after many years have come to believe that the objects I saw may be extraterrestrial.  If so, we are living in a very special historical period.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,,

What is was is still difficult to say.  The only way I can describe it was like a glowing light, a light that started small and slowly grew large enough to fill the sky.  I don't know how long it lasted but at the time, to me it seemed to have lasted an hour. I remember everyone trying to decide what it was.. or more accurately what it was not. First thoughts were that it was from the air base but that didn't make sense.  There was nothing large enough there to cover the entire sky. I remember asking lots of questions about what it was but no one had any answers. There were at least 20 families on our street watching the sky.  I remember being scared to death and going inside my house with some of the neighbors.  When it was gone there were lots of phone calls and lots of discussions.

I have told very few people of this incident for obvious reasons, most insist you are exaggerating or just not remembering the events accurately.

I am now 56.  It was a warm summer night up near Wichita Falls, Texas. This town is located in North central Texas, not very far from the Oklahoma border where the Red River separates the two states.  My two friends and I decided to take our 22 caliber rifles and see if we could possibly find some rabbits to shoot at.  I know it sounds cruel, but boys will be boys and I haven’t killed any game in years and have no intention to do so.  We all learn from our mistakes. We got in one of my friend’s car, a Mustang, and drove West past a town called Iowa Park, my hometown.  We continued driving West until we turned onto a Farm to Market road that led to a town called Holliday, Texas.  We again turned West and went down a dirt road that led to a ranch.  The name was posted on a sign there, but it’s been too many years to recall the name of the ranch.  We didn’t find any rabbits, which we thought was odd, but after shooting our three 22 rifles empty into a ravine we decided it was time to go. It was about 12:30 or 1 a.m. at this time.  After traveling back down the dirt road we rounded a hill, and I saw something behind me.  I turned around and there was a bright orange glowing saucer shaped object about telephone pole high over the road directly behind us.  I yelled at my two friends in the front of the car and they looked around and saw it too.  My friend that was driving punched the gas and we were literally floating on the rocks of the dirt road trying to get away as we were all so scared.  I told him to slow down as he was going to wreck us,  and he did,  and I asked him to shut off the lights of the car.  He was able to do this as there was enough light from the moon to see by.  The orange glowing object was still following us.  I asked him to just shut off the car and see what happened.  We coasted to a stop with the lights off and as soon as we stopped completely, it disappeared.  We looked around and it was now over a barbed-wire fence over some property next to us.  It had moved so fast from behind us, it appeared to have just vanished.  We couldn’t understand how it had moved so fast we didn’t see it do so.  I asked my friend to start the car and see if we could slowly move away without it following us, but it continued to move the exact speed that we were traveling as though it was somehow able to match our speed exactly.  Almost as though it was somehow locked onto us somehow.   We again turned off the car.  We talked about getting out and even joked about reloading our rifles  and shooting at it, but no one in that car was about to get out and shoot at it.  We were too scared to even get out of the car.  We got very quite and stopped talking as the realization of what was happening finally sunk in.  We don’t know what really happened past this point.  The next thing we know we felt like we had all been sort of frozen, looking at it for a long time, and the first thing we remember is we all saw it streak away until it was just a speck and then it was gone. We started the car and drove back into Wichita Falls where we all stayed that night.  I remember that it strange that we didn’t remember talking about it on the way back to town.  We told a few people about seeing it, but of ‘course they all had something to comment on, like what had we been smoking? That night we were cold sober and hadn’t had anything to drink as we never went shooting firearms if we’d had anything to drink. A couple of days later our local TV station had an interview with an older couple that lived in my hometown.  They told of an incident where the wife had seen an orange glowing flying saucer shaped object over her back yard while she had gotten up to get some water.  Her husband stated he’d had a hard time getting up at his wife’s urgent calls, but he had indeed seen something glowing orange that had streaked off into the distance after he had seen it. I looked over at my step-dad, and he was looking at me and starting to understand the story I had told him a couple of days earlier might have been true. The one thing we never could understand was it seemed like we were out there a lot longer than we thought we were as it was very early in the morning when we finally made it back to Wichita Falls.  The object never made any noise.  That was one thing that scared us the most.  That, and the size of it.  It was the width of the two lane road including the ditches.  From barb wire fence to barb wire fence.  We figured the orange glow came from it heating up in the earth’s atmosphere.  Traveling so fast through the air.  It looked like two perfectly round plates put together with no sharp angles.  It was round on the edges with no windows or other lights visible.

Bear in mind that the weapons panel was ""selectively"" knocked out only after the pilot acquired a solid lock on the target.

John F. Kennedy [CV-67] during the late spring, early summer of '77 while on the flight deck checking on our aircraft I saw what I initially thought was a meteor coming down at approximately a 45 degree angle.  The sky was clear with no moon and no clouds, there was no glow from the coastline of Florida and the ship was operating with red lights only above deck.  I called my crew away from the aircraft to look at this thing, which continued down on it's initial trajectory off of our starboard quarter.  The object was very high, about the size of a cigarette ember held at arm's length. As it got lower, we could plainly see that the front was white, the middle orange, and the tail a flickering red.  Then a contrail became visible, which we took to indicate it was in the atmosphere. After 5 or so minutes a fog bank formed in that part of the sky with this object behind it, resembling a streetlight as seen through a heavy fog.   At this point, a laser-thin beam of light blue suddenly appeared, aiming back up the way this object came from. After 2 more minutes, everything started fading away, the glow diminished, the beam of light faded and the fog dissipated to where stars could be seen again in that portion of the sky.  Then, at an angle approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, a dull silver colored object about 3 times the size of the largest star dropped down out of the bottom of the fog bank, shot forward paralleling our course on the starboard side of the ship then angled back upwards and was gone in literally the blink of an eye.  Looking about the deck, I noticed between 50-75 personnel standing and watching this display.  Years later I encountered one of my former crewmembers who was there that night and who asked me to please tell his wife that we saw what we saw because she thought he was nuts.

It was pretty cold that night and the air was clear.  As we were driving west on Rte. 101 I noticed a large object in the sky moving slowly from north to south.  I pointed it out to my companions and we pulled over and got out of the car to get a better look. When we stopped the object stopped moving. It appeared to be at least a mile or two away and was very large, about the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length. It was at about 10 o'clock from the horizon. It was an elongated oval shape and perpendicular to the ground. I seemed to have a bump on one side. The object was glowing purple and the raised area was glowing red. There were two rows of orange or yellow lights on the oval part that were flashing in opposite directions around the oval. The overall shape reminded me of one of those children's tops with the lever that you push up and down to make it spin except slightly flatter and on its side. We watched the object for about 10-15 minutes as it hung there in the sky.  While we were stopped, someone in a pickup truck stopped and asked if we needed help.  We explained what we were doing. He had a CB radio in his truck and I could hear other people on the CB chattering about the object.  He looked with us for a minute or two and left.  We finally decided to go ourselves as the object was just hanging there.  When we started moving the object continued moving slowly south and eventually passed from view.  It moved a little slower than an airplane and seemed to move at a steady speed. When we got back to Nashua my band mate's girlfriend was waiting up for us.  She was nearly hysterical.  She had been out at a dance class and on her way home had apparently encountered the same object except that it was directly overhead and low to the ground.  She said that it covered the whole sky. Surprisingly or perhaps not, there was nothing about this in any of the local papers even though there were many, perhaps hundreds of witnesses.

I was in the passenger seat.  My husband suddenly hit the brakes and exclaimed ""What the hell is that?"".  He had stopped where a large elm tree blocked my view and he moved forward.  When he did I looked to my left and saw about 100 feet above the houses, a large triangular craft.  it was moving in parallel to us but in the opposite direction.  While I kept the craft in view my husband went the short distance to the end of the block and turned the corner to follow it.  I do not recall any lights, the craft was a medium gray and from what I could perceive the only way we were able to see it at all was that it was so close to the ground the street lights were illumination the bottom.  I looked specifically for any openings for landing gear etc but the bottom was smooth.  It was winter so the windows were rolled up and the heater was on so I dont know that it made any sound.  As we followed it down the block it appeared to be moving at no more than 10 miles and hour.  I looked to see if lights were going on and if people were coming out of their homes but did not see any unusual activity.  We did turn another corner to keep it in sight and that is when I saw what I call an army jeep with a young blond bespectacled male soldier standing outside the jeep with one hand on the steering wheel, the other on the door and one foot just on the inside of the car.  He was also staring at the craft. As we passed him I looked at his face but he did not seem to notice us.  I observed that the craft was accelerating and told my husband to drive faster. With a sudden burst of speed the craft was gone.  I dont know if it moved away from any light source and so became impossible to see but it did seem to me that it simply vanished.  We tried to continue in the direction in which the craft was headed and came to a point where we could see a bridge crossing the Mississippi.  I felt that if any! one on t he bridge was seeing it that traffic would come to a halt but this did not happen.  He is now my ex-husband and about 25 years after this happened I asked him if he remembered what we saw.  He remembers that the craft had lights and that there was more than one military vehicle at the scene.  I know that people use football fields as a measure but I am not familiar with the size of football fields so I can only tell you that it measured the length of three small single family homes driveways included.  I did not report it to the police as my then husband feared ridicule but I have always been curious as to whether others saw the same thing that night.  I have run into many people who did not strike me as mentally stable who are involved in such organizations as MUFON and so when I say you on a news program I thought perhaps you were the person to report this too.

It was a very dark night, few clouds in the sky.  He saw the lights first and so saw them a bit before pointing them out to me.  I recall the lights being higher up than a jet would fly but moving very quickly across the sky.  I remember thinking that there was no way that an object that high up could be moving that fast - at least a man made object.  The lights were perhaps as bright as one of the planets (Mars or Jupitor). I recall - all these years later the three objects (lights) moving as a triad together across the heavens.  After a few minutes (maybe three) they stopped at the zenith of the sky and stayed there just a moment.  Then one zoomed off at a very high rate of speed (no way it could have been a man made craft)in one direction; seconds later a second one went off in a different direction; and then seconds later the third went off in another direction.  I remember looking us looking at each other and saying - did we really just see that?  Since then, I've been an avowed UFO believer.  We had not been drinking or using drugs.  The following is what my friend remembers - it is not prompted except to ask him what he recalled.  The best I can remember, I think it was during the summer of 1976.  I have pictures of you visiting in my photo album, in storage, of that trip.   I could dig them out and see at least what month and year it may have taken place.  I believe that was the summer my grandparents were adding on the new kitchen to the old green house. We were riding bikes up and down Ranch Road 1120 between Leakey and Rio Frio.   It was about 9:30 at night.  We had stopped briefly to rest. We both looked up at the stars.  A few minutes later, I saw a bright light come from the west, another from the east and another from the north.  They were probably (wild ass guess) 15,000 miles up. What caught my attention was that they were coming at a high rate of speed from the three directions. They all came to a point and then came to a complete stop together (from our perspective).  After about 60 seconds, they suddenly shot off into different directions at a high rate of speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was 15 years old walking with my oldest sister on 9th street towards downtown Los Angeles, CA. Heading for the Greyhound depot.  It was dark and quiet.  All I had in mind was the approaching boycotted Moscow Olympic games. A small spheric light appeared traveling horizontally in a straight line, and paralleling 9th street (West to East).  At a height of, I would say, half the height of the terrorized 9/11 tween towers of New York. No sound at all. It left no trail behind (as an asteroid would).  It did not appear to be descending or decelerating.  A very stable and fast speed. It disappeared in the skyline of downtown Los Angeles. Feeling disturbed, I turned around and asked my sister,""did you see that?"". ""Ahu..yes"", she responded.  We both kept walking disturbed and quiet since it was too early in the morning and we were still sleepy. A few minutes later, I still asked,""did you really see it?  It was a light bulb, or something like that..right?"" She responded, ""yes"". What ??  A LIGHT BULB ? ?  IT WENT INTO ONE OF THE BUILDINGS, OR IN BETWEEN THEM, OR SOMETHING !"", I said again. My sister was, I believe 18 years old, and I'm sure her mind was into guys most of the time. The spheric light we saw seemed as big as tower window.  I can compare it so because there were many buildings around where we last saw it. That left me a question mark for ever.  I know I will never see that again.

While attending this show on the first day, I heard someone say they saw a UFO, I looked but didn't see anything at that time...I believe that it was about 2 or 3 PM but it was 25 years ago now and the exact times are a guess at this point. I watched several bands and then it began getting dark. I believe that the Australian band Men At Work were playing when I noticed a Dark metallic disk shaped object hovering about 25 yards from me just below the low cloud cover we had that evening. It just floated there silently for approximately 10 minutes. Many people attending saw this object (one girl even began screaming) and even the singer for the band made some comment about the object between songs. Then the disk silently began to rise at a very slow speed and disappeared into the low cloud cover. I wouldn't even report it except that there is photographic evidence taken by a photographer from the concert and it is on a website that commemorates the 3 day show.

Because I've worked for some law enforcement support companies, I've always hesitated to do anything that could have been a “problem” at work. This happened in the week around Easter, 1986 in Los Angeles. I was working for a special effects company that mainly worked doing laser EFX for rock tours, motion pictures. Our shop was in W. LA, and I had a job installing a laser system at the Spruce Goose theater in Long Beach, CA. I had been working there every day including the holiday to get the show ready for the grand opening, and with the bad LA traffic at that time, I had to leave the shop very early to make it to Long Beach in time to get in at least 8 hours. 	On this morning, it would have been about 7-8 a.m. Traffic on the 405 going south was very, very slow, and with lots of stops and starts. I had just passed LAX airport on my right, and was in the area where there were lots of defense contractors such as the huge TRW and Hughes plants. I was in a second from the outside right lane of traffic, and all the cars had come to a stop. I was just glancing around, waiting to get moving again when I happened to look up. I did this a lot in that area as there were many large commercial jets in the area landing at LAX and it was something to do while stalled in traffic. I had heard a plane nearby, and as I looked up, I could see a fairly large, and completely stationary black triangle hovering possibly as much as 500ft over the buildings off to my right. It just hung in the air, as if frozen. There were no lights, noise of any engine, and it was a dark flat black in color. I thought that it was very, very odd, but considering the area that I was in, I considered that it may have been some exotic antenna that was being tested at Hughes, etc. Then it crossed my mind that it would have been very hazardous to have something like that so close to commercial aircraft in flight. 	I watched this triangle for maybe 2 minutes, and at one point, the driver in the car next to me was looking at me staring up through my windshield. I looked at him, and motioned with my finger to look up, which he did. He looked directly at this same object for about 30 seconds, then looked back at me and shrugged as if to say, “I don't know what it is either.”. At this point, traffic started to move again, and I tried to watch for as long as possible at this object, but I quickly had to put my attention to driving again and once I could not see it from my front windshield, I lost view of it. On the trip home that evening, I made a point of slowing down at the same location to take a look, and there was nothing that I could see, however it was dark out by then. Just lots of normal aircraft lights at that time. For the next 4-5 days as I continued on that project, I made a point of looking every time I was in that area, but never have seen the object since. 	The size to me may have been about 50 feet wide, with almost a perfect triangle shape. The thickness was hard to judge, but I would say maybe 5 feet. I looked very closely to see if there was a tether as there were lots of advertising balloons in the area along the 405, but there were none that I could see, however the object's lack of movement made it appear as if it was tethered. It is windy in that area from the air coming in from the nearby Pacific Ocean. The “point” or nose of this shape would have been pointing NE, about 2 miles south of LAX on the west side of the highway above industrial buildings. I believe there was a wide bend or curve at the point of the highway. I have not seen any object like that before or since that day. It does remind me of the appearance of the stealth aircraft that many of these companies in that area most likely worked on, and I have always had a thought that what I saw that day may have had something to with that, however at that time, those programs were all still very secret I believe. Oh, the sky was clear and blue, and with the morning sun coming up, and not much pollution yet from traffic. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

In a short matter of 5 seconds the green streak started as a single orb-like light source, and then changed to three green orb-like lights stacked in a vertical line before it disappeared.  There was no sound other than the road noise from the moving police car and no smoke trail one would expect from fireworks.

It was in the formation of a triangle, moving very slowly across the night sky, too slow to be a jet, and it appeared to be soaring at roughly 1000 feet above the ground.  The formation consisted of three straight faintly illuminated lines, almost appearing like straight fluorescent shop bulbs.  I attempted to rationalize the sight into some sort of concrete explanation before it disappeared as slowly traveled too far to be seen (the lights appeared to be about half as bright as the stars seen around it, but it was quite obvious that it was close to the ground).  I first thought it may be three geese gliding in formation, with nearby light reflecting off of their bellies, but this was quickly disproved, as the lights were perfectly straight and geometrically in tact as it appeared to turn slightly before leaving our vision.  My next thought was a stealth aircraft (as there are military bases within distance on either side of us), but after viewing pictures of said aircraft, the straight lines of light prevent this from being the case.  It should be noted that my wife was actually afraid of pointing it out to me, as I am notoriously skeptical...

I and my family was witness to the major sighting on 26th April and took it upon myself to visit and interview all the others following response to a newspaper report of my own sighting. I have absolutely no reason to doubt these people's veracity or integrity and, similarly, no doubt that there was something unusual going on in the area over this weekend, backed up by similar sightings, at simil times, in England and, indeed, all over the world.  I set ot the sightings in what appears to have been time sequence:  26th April 2008 5.30am  The first came from an amateur photographer with some knowledge. He is closely involved with a local community issue of some sensitivity and consequently has been unwilling to publicly release his name, although I have met and spoken with him and have no reason to doubt his veracity.  He lives just outside Torquay, a coastal town in the south west of England. On the morning of 26th April, he was going fishing on a friend’s boat from Brixham just up the coast from Torquay and was travelling on the ring road en-route when he stopped to take a photograph of the sunrise at a popular beauty spot with extensive views of Tor Bay. This was at 5.30am and was taken in the direction of Torquay. Having taken the photograph, followed by another about a minute later on a different exposure, he continued on his way and went on his fishing trip, taking other photographs throughout the day. One of those photographs was of terns perched on the rail of the boat, an unusual shot, of which his friend wanted a copy.  So, on his return, he downloaded the photographs onto the computer and was surprised to see, on the first sunrise shot, a bright speck of light above the tree line. The conditions – apart from the sunlight on the horizon – were heavily overcast with low cloud, a situation which had prompted him to take the striking photograph in the first place. This bright light could not therefore have been mistaken for Venus (which was not visible at that time anyway) or anything other than something below the cloud line.  Enlarged, the object appeared to have a discernible shape, almost like a squashed bell or squashed, truncated triangle, with what appeared to be a dark cross-shaped object at the leading edge. There also appeared to be a cone-shaped ‘tail’ as though the camera had captured it in flight. The second sunrise photograph taken moments afterwards and at a different exposure shows no sign of the object.  As an experienced photographer he discounts any sort of lens flare and the secretary of the Cornwall UFO organisation whom the newspaper consulted describes the photograph as apparently showing something of interest. Visiting the site later I was able to extrapolate from the image and the tree line that the approximate direction of the object seen would be in the St Marychurch area, where – coincidentally or not -  the major sightings took place later that day.  It would have been quite high in the sky to have been seen above the tree line and quite probably inland to have revealed the detail that the later enlargement showed.  There is anecdotal evidence, from a conversation he had with a friend some days later, that later that day a bright object was seen in the sky in broad daylight en route to Newton Abbot(some seven miles distan from Torquay and inland) which then ‘disappeared’.  THE MAJOR SIGHTINGS 26th April 2008 9.20am – 9.30pm  My own sighting, which drew all the other reported incidents, took place in the evening of 26th April. No specific time was recorded when the sighting started but, extrapolating back from the second incident when we were back in the lounge at 9.30pm after the UFO had passed I estimate the first incident to have been at, or around, 9.20am.  Our lounge window overlooks the approximate direction of the flight paths to Exeter Airport some 22 miles away. Consequently we are well used to seeing aeroplanes, at varying heights, throughout the day. Light aircraft following those routes are extremely rare and are always at a height where their engine noise can be clearly heard. Even high flying jet engines can be heard when outside. The police and coastguard helicopters frequently overfly and, again, we are well used to seeing these, sometimes with spotlights operational and always with engine noise apparent except when seen from a fair distance away when the spotlight, though bright, appears minuscule.  The weather was clear and dusk was rapidly turning into full dark.  My wife saw a  bright light approaching from the Paignton/Brixham direction over the roofs of houses intervening. It appeared as though it was a landing light of an aircraft, flying low, although aircraft showing landing lights this far out from the airport (22 miles away) are very rare.  It approached at a steady pace, at about the speed and height of a fairly low flying light aeroplane. Extrapolations later carried out of the estimated flightpath showed it to be almost precisely on a South to North alignment. Perceived size was probably that of a ten pence piece held at arms length.  The colour of the light was exactly as one might perceive an aeroplane’s landing light, i.e. whitish  (although I did perceive scintillations of red as it passed). The light was diffuse, with no immediately discernible outline, although I would describe it as elliptical in footprint. Whether it was refraction through my spectacles I don’t know, but I believed I could discern north/south/east/west spikes of light within the overall light in the manner of an illustrative representation of a star pattern. This lent it an almost diamond-shaped perception – although I do put this down to refraction and optical illusion.  There was absolutely no engine noise and no navigation lights apparent. The object passed silently over the house, where we were observing it from the front door, and we followed it again from the rear of the house where it continued silently on its way, at its former speed, beyond a belt of trees at the top of the garden. The apparent trajectory over the trees and the angle at which it appeared to travel towards the horizon again suggested to me that it was a fairly low flying object. Anything higher flying would have remained in vision longer over the top of the trees which are set well above the tiered garden at the back of the house.  This sighting, in the latter stages, was also observed by my son.  Having been mystified by this sighting we returned back to the lounge, my son to his room. Some moments later my wife announced another, similar, light approaching. It was much the same colour as the other light, although I did perceive it as redder in hue. It took almost the same path (although later observed to be slightly to the west), and appeared to be travelling at the same height and speed. Again this disappeared behind the belt of trees at much the same angle of descent, although slightly to the west of the path that the first object had taken. Again there was no engine noise and no navigation lights apparent. This time the sighting was also observed almost throughout by my son and his girlfriend.  We have no explanation for these sightings and later enquiry of Exeter Airport revealed that there were no landings scheduled for that time of night on that date.  We were so taken with observing the objects that we totally overlooked the possibility of taking photographs.  As a corollary, some half-an-hour later a light aircraft did fly by, very low, with engine noise, navigation lights and even the fuselage visible in the reflected glow from the cockpit lights, making the comparison with the unexplained sightings that much more striking.   26th April 2008 9.30 – 9.40pm  The second family who saw something almost identical to my own sighting live, live in Thurlow Road in Torquay, which is just about three streets removed from my own house and  perhaps some quarter of a mile away, just over the brow of a hill on the opposite side of the valley which is Chatto Road. Their experiences appear to corroborate my own, although the timing is slightly different. The rear of their house faces the front of mine, were they within sight of each other.  Mr. Webley was on the patio at the rear of his home burning some rubbish at around  9.30pm when he perceived a bright light approaching from what was later estimated to be the north. It approached his property at a steady pace and appeared to be at what the family agreed was about 500-600 feet. They describe it as orange to red in appearance and about the size of the head of a yale key held at arm’s distance at its closest approach (it appeared to shrink in size as it receded). It appeared to stop and hover at a point estimated to be about 220 yards away judging from the recognised configuration of the roof line in this built-up area, then moved slightly to the east and moved back towards the north, finally disappearing in the distance.  This was witnessed in the latter stages by the whole family. Some estimated three minutes later a second – and brighter – object appeared from the north again, paused in the same spot and then gradually dimmed and faded away without moving off. On this occasion one of the witnesses managed to capture a video on her mobile phone. She says that, at its closest approach, she could discern green and pink colouration within the overall brightness and later study of an enlarged download on the computer clearly shows a green ring in the centre of the object. At its brightest the children describe it as though something was on fire in the sky. Friends of the family were later known to have witnessed this phenomonen.  From the time recording on the phone video the family was able to precisely extrapolate the sequence of events. The video ended at 9.40pm; the second sighting lasted approximately 3 minutes (only part of which was recorded) (i.e 9.37pm); there was an interval of three minutes between the first and second sighing (i.e. 9.34pm); the first sighting was estimated to have been about three minutes (9.31pm).  Interestingly these phenomena occurred immediately following the phenomena I and my family had experienced (I noted the time my second sighting finished as 9.30pm). Interesting also is the fact that the sightings these second witnesses experienced were moving in a north to south direction whilst mine were in a south to north direction (and almost exactly on the same line when plotted on a map and then compared – plotting is relatively easy to calculate since the tree line over which my sightings disappeared is clearly visible from the second family's property).  What is intriguing is that they should have been able to see the earlier phenomenon that I had witnessed, since the rear of their house faces in precisely the direction where it would have been visible, but they did not. I also should have been able to witness their phenomenon (at least partially) since the suspected line of flight would have been slightly to the east of what I had witnessed, which would have brought at least part of the trajectory into view from my lounge window. Similarly I did not witness their sightings, nor did my wife who habitually sits nearer to the window than I do, nor did my son and his girl friend who had taken off  by car in pursuit of the second object that we had sighted, travelling in the direction from which the second family observed their sightings to have approached.  We have all spoken of two objects: however, the possibility arises that they could be the same object seen at different time intervals and possibly engaged in a ‘quartering’ activity.    26th April 2008 (approx 9pm and 10pm) 28th April 2008 (3.50am)  This third set of witnesses report different activities. Their reported sighting took place at 3.50am on the morning of Monday 28th April. They live in Great Headland Road in Preston, immediately overlooking Tor Bay, with Brixham to their right (west) and Torquay/Exeter to their left (east). Their lounge and bedroom windows look over the bay. The witnes could not sleep that night and got up. As she often does, she looked out of the bedroom window at the night sky and she saw a white object describing wide circles at a high speed, fairly high in the sky above the flat (only half the trajectory was visible from her position. She called her husband and by the time he saw it, the whole of the trajectory was visible, this time over the sea, suggesting that it was spiralling outwards from the position when first noticed.  It was a clear night but with high cloud cover.  The witneeses desribe the object as white with an apparent cone shaped tail as it traversed the sky on its trajectory. As they watched it ‘shot off’ – in their words – in the direction of Dartmouth (ie overland between Paignton and Brixham). At this point the witness's husband describes the object as appearing like a truncated triangle and used the palm of his hand and fingers to illustrate the point. They are unable to estimate a height for the object but, from descriptions given to me on site, it appears that it was possibly flying at the extreme height of a light aeroplane. They are adamant that it was not an aeroplane (no navigation lights and no engine noise) and was moving much too fast for any object they have seen from their extensive panoramic windows overlooking the bay. He describes the path that the object circumscribed as being ‘like you might imagine a football stadium would look when viewed from a height.’  My interest, and my own experiences, elicited reference to further sightings that they had been reticent to report to the newspaper when they reported their sighting of the Monday morning.  These took place on 26th April, bracketing my own and the second family's sightings, when at approximately 9pm one of witnesses perceived a diffuse red object appear in the sky over the sea and ‘shoot off’ again in the direction of Dartmouth. More interestingly, at around 10pm her husband reports seeing a red light hovering over the sea at height (in much the same direction as his wife's sighting that evenng and referenced by a church tower), and shining a spotlight onto the water. At the time he put it down to either a police helicopter or coastguard helicopter (although no engine noise was apparent, and they would normally hear that even through the double glazing). The light then extinguished and the object flew off ‘towards the east’. he is used to observing – he keeps a telescope in his lounge and his son runs a boat so he will have  some knowledge of navigation and bearings.  Later enquires of both the police and the coastguard reveal that there were no operational helicopter flights at that time and on that date and additionally the coastguard elicited the view that no helicopter would use a searchlight at the height described, since it would diffuse the usable light too much.  Timeline of events  Saturday 26th April 5.30am	Unknown object photographed in the direction of Torquay, and more particularly the St Marychurch area where the major sightings took place that evening. There is anecdotal evidence of a similar bright object being seen in broad daylight towards Newton Abbot; 9.00pm 	 (approximate time) Diffuse red light observed over the sea at Preston ‘shooting off’ to the west; 9.20pm	Bright, reddish light observed travelling a south to north flight path over Dower Road, Torquay; 9.25pm   Similar object observed following an almost identical path over Dower Road, Torquay; 9.30pm   Time noted for the end of the second sighting; 9.31pm	Bright red light observed by the second family following a north to south flightpath towards Thurlow Road, Torquay, hovering moving slightly away to the east and moving away, growing smaller; 9.37pm   Second, brighter, red light observed by the second family following the same approach, again hovering and then extinguishing (this time recorded on mobile phone); 9.40pm	Time recorded on mobile phone as when the second sighting ended; 10am	(approximate time) Bright red light observed hovering at height over the sea at Preston and shining a spotlight on the sea which was then extinguished before the object moved off to the east;  Monday 28th April 3.40am   White, truncated triangle-shaped object observed at some height describing spiralling circles above the witness's property and then out to sea before shooting off toward the west.    Checks carried out Exeter airport confirm that there were no landings of aircraft scheduled at or around 9.30pm on 26th April; Devon and Cornwall Constabulary confirm that there were no police helicopters operational over Preston/Paignton during the evening of 26th April; Maritime Coastguard Agency similar confirm that there were no coastguard helicopters operational over Preston/Paignton during the evening of 26th April.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,,

The single light was soon joined by 4 or five more “stars” to create a Flying V formation.  The Flying V moved slowly to the Northeast, I believe, until it was out of sight.  The most peculiar thing the lights did were, as they were flying away, the lights at the back of the formation quickly switched places and moved about at impossibly fast speeds.  It was almost like watching giant fireflies move around in outer space.  I say ""giant"" because they seemed to be among the stars, so I guess they were at least above our atmosphere.

The lights flew in a 'question mark' formation according to some callers. Another caller described a 'backwards letter C.' From my perspective, these lights were spaced further apart. They slowly floated upward. A couple callers said they saw them float up toward space, but I stopped watching in order to announce this event quickly to the public.  They were very bright, and callers closer to the area described them as being consolidated...that is, multiple lights made up each distinct object. I would say I was about 4 miles from the area the lights were flying over.

I started to get freaked out after about 15 minutes and went the window.  I saw an aircraft of some kind flying VERY low--in contrast to commercial jets in the sky, which from a ground view have tiny blinking lights, the proximity to this aircraft was such that the lights appeared to be the size of grapefruits.   I couldn't see the exact shape, only that three lights (white-red-white) were kind of lined up in a straight line, and they cast a glow on a kind of underbelly shape I could only glimpse.  My thought was that the shape of the thing was almost rectangular, or a straight line, with a very slightly convex underside. The lights were strong enough that I thought, 'they can see me!' through my window, though who knows, and I went away from the window and the aircraft nosies lasted about another half hour.  It sounded to me like there were more than one thing zooming around and around.  I don't have a whole lot of experience with stuff like this, and there is probably another kind of explanation; I'm only reporting it because I found it very mysterious and thought it might make sense to someone else.

The weatherman said the Geminid meteor shower was occuring that night, recommending the best time to view the event was before midnight.  I went outside and looked up towards the E/SE sky.  It was a clear, crisp night, allowing the constellation Orion to easily catch my eye off to the right of my peripheral vision.  After only a few moments of star gazing in that same direction, 5-6 reddish-orange/burnt orange lights appeared out of nowhere just above the few tall pine trees that border that side of the property.  These lights shined as if they were large, bright stars, and appeared in a straight line with equal distances between each (""• • • • •"").  I believe these lights to have been the tail side of the object, possibly part of a propulsion system. It sat in a completely still hover for only a couple of seconds and then quickly accelerated without a sound toward the E/SE, tilting as it appeared to turn slightly more south and gain in altitude till out of sight.  It was quite an experience and I began questioning whether or not I had just seen what I thought I'd seen.  In the next ten minutes or so, I also got to enjoy more than a dozen meteors as well.

In the sky, perhaps at a 45 degree angle or so from me and apparently at least 1000 feet up or so, I noticed an object.  I would estimate it's location as being directly above the area of 54th Street and Oak Park Avenue, possibly somewhat farther east-southeast.  I noted that it was black and round, not much larger than a BB at arm’s length.  My first thought was that I was looking at a bird or an airplane end-on, but it quickly became obvious that it was neither.  There was a solid gray cloud cover, the shape of the object was starkly visible, and wings if they existed would be clearly seen.  No plane would be ascending towards or descending away from nearby Midway Airport (about two miles east-southesast of there)so steeply at that altitude. By now I had viewed the object hovering in the sky for about five seconds.  Suddenly it bolted, at a bit of an angle right-to-left, headed roughly eastbound and upward, toward the clouds.  The black circle rapidly shrank into a pinpoint dot and disappeared into the clouds, clearly moving upward and away very fast.  It took less than two seconds for it to accelerate out of sight.  I did not see a hole in the clouds where it entered the solid cloud ceiling.  My impression was that it was disc-shaped because of the flat appearance of the black (no shading at the edges like you'd see with a sphere). The only reason I saw this object is that I had a shocking daylight sighting of a large craft back on November 9, and since then I’ve been scanning the skies every chance I get, hoping to see another UFO, which amazingly enough I did.  These two sightings were very different, however. Truthfully, I’ve been reluctant to post this sighting, as I’ve been discouraged since my previous experience.  Since I was alone at the time, and I'm not a pilot or a police officer, it seems that I might not be qualified enough to report that a gigantic, very clearly defined black rectangle which I observed at length, slowly flying in high-visibility conditions before it camouflaged itself, is not a “weather phenomenon” or some other nonsense like that.  Even though I’m in my 40s, a stable family man with a science degree, that’s lived in the Chicago area with it's teeming air traffic basically my whole life, to boot.  Worse still, you feel you can’t discuss it with anybody, because even your closest friends or family members will think you’re a nut case or want to come up with some ridiculous debunking.  If I had gotten photographs, those either wouldn’t have been good enough, or they would have been too good, i.e. fake.  So the whole process of seeing and reporting a sighting is really very frustrating, even though I’m joined by tens of thousands of other witnesses.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,41.7834,-87.8238

I probably have the strangest story to tell. I know that more and more people are going to think that my whole family has lost their mind. Since November, 2007 I have become obsessed with what is happening in our tiny town. I am not sure where to go with it. We have lost a lot of sleep since November of 2007.  On November... I believe 29th of 2007,  I was driving home from town. The hwy. we travel is very long and dark, with little or no traffic and no street lamps.  I had my daughter and her boyfriend with me. It was a perfectly clear night between 6:30 pm and 7pm. Suddenly there was a fog that came up around us in which we all started talking about because it was so odd. Then, a very bright bluish light lit up around us which really startled us. At that very moment a bright white light shot from the sky at low altitude and could have hit the ground in front of us, but not so that we could see. We were very startled, and nervously chatted along the drive. We drove aways and there were very bright, what appeared to be red and orange lights in front of us.  They probably could have more than stretched from one side of the highway to the other.  It looked as though I might run right into them and I began to come to a stop. As I got closer it appeared as though they zipped sideways and disappeared. When I thought I had passed the spot where this occurred I wanted to turn around and look for the lights but my passengers were too frightened so we continued home. Since this occurred, the whole month of December has been somewhat like a nightmare that won't end. I have made a journal of what has happened and continues to happen. My story is probably too much to believe even for your sight. I have video tape and photographs unlike anything I have seen on the internet. I have seen more things going on around our two closed down mines than anyone can believe. I have made many comments on Youtube about what has been happening simply because of some of the idiotic comments people have made about what people are reporting they have seen, and it makes me angry that people don't believe them. I also reported the first part of my journal to Brian Vike from hbcc, who was supposed to come out and watch these things with me, but turned out ill. He hasn't contacted me since and I suggest we don't just let this go. So, I wonder if someone hasn't picked up on this and is either checking out what is going on here, or are they actually ufo's mistaken for aircraft, or has our military been sent to this area to make people believe that is what I have been seeing because suddenly, just as of this week, we have possibly been having fighter jet type planes in our area. Now I cannot confirm this but I have been told they are being seen, which is totally unheard of in this area. I know the difference and I know what I have seen here almost nightly since November 29th. This includes a craft the size of a football field and much more. I know you are going to find what I have to tell you very crazy, but I swear on my life and on my family it is all true. I definately don't trust this in the hands of police, (even though two of them witnessed one above our mine a few years ago). Neither do I trust the military or any government official to look into this. In fact I believe they already know. I have not shown my photos or video to anyone and will not send them out over the net. Among others we have excellent clear footage of a saucer carrying below it what looks like a pod type thing or capsule. The capsule has flames. We have had orbs everywhere. I am not going to go on about everything but just when I thought they may have left us, I saw another the night before last hovering over the mine again like a strobe light of red and white. Believe it or not we have major ufo’s or George Bush is flying around in his ""Black Craft"" stealing our resources, looking like Mr. Burns of the Simpsons counting his money. Please let me know if you would like a much clearer description such as the journal I have been keeping.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,,

My first impression was that it was a landing light on a commercial aircraft on approach to Stockton Airport, some 30 miles to the west.  As we continued east on Hwy 4 the light remained stationary.  Eventually we lost sight of it either due to its departure, or it may have become obscured by the foothills that we were not traversing.

Wife's account- When I first saw these ""twinkling stars"" they appeared to be at about an 80 degree angle from the street on which I was driving.  I watched them for about 2 minutes.  They did not change their course.  It looked to me like the Little Dipper blinking in the sky.  By the time I got my husband outside to see what we were seeing, the ""Little Dipper"" had quit blinking, but there were still blinking lights in the not-so-far distance.  My first thought was that these were the lights of an airport tower - a signal warning airplanes about aerial lines or an upcoming runway.  But I then realized that in the more than five years that I've lived at this house, I have never seen towers.  Another thought was that it was several airplanes in the sky.  The lights were too many and too close to be airplane lights.

The other night, I was driving home in the farm lands. I was taking a shortcut home. As I was driving, I believe I saw something. This something was hovering, about 20-30 feet above ground. It was just off the road maybe only 50 ft or so. I didn’t know what it was, due to the fact, I have never seen anything like this in my life. I didn’t know what to do, whether I should stop what I was doing and try to get a better look at this object, or if I should’ve fled away being afraid of what could possibly happen. I was somewhat scared, because it was abnormal and it was so close to me. This object was so close to me, that I could have thrown a rock at it and I would’ve definitely hit it. Being so afraid and uncertain of what I was seeing, I just kept driving, but only faster. I didn’t tell anybody because I didn’t want people to think I was hallucinating or something. Now to describe this object. I saw a cluster of lights. The lights were not in a row or any formation. They were not in a sequence or in any pattern to form a shape of the object. They were spread out. They changed color. All of the lights changed color at the same time. At first the lights were a whitish color. Then they changed to a blue-grean or teal color. Next they appeared in a reddish or red-orange color. They flashed or should I say switched position. One light would go out and another one would light up. They switched from light to light extremely fast and again, not in any pattern or sequence. This flashing of lights made it hard to identify its shape. I could not make out the body of the object because of the scrambling lights. When the lights changed from light to light, it was like there was a streak of light following behind it,  kind of like a tracer. This object didn’t appear to be on the ground, but very close to it. And it wasn’t moving, and if it was it was cruising very slowly. After seeing this, I was not sure of what to do. I was so astonished, I couldn’t believe what I had just seen. I thought there was some kind of mistake or I was just seeing things. I never really put too much thought into this sighting. I never really believed in these sightings that others reported. I was just online at MSN.COM and I saw an article about a recent sighting in Texas. There was a video of the witness talking to the news crew. He was describing what he had seen. The way he described the object was a very accurate description of what I saw. I should have made this report a lot sooner. But me seeing this video of the witness and him describing the sighting, pushed me to make a report. Maybe my info could help you all out in some way.

The lights appeared to be seven or eight feet off the ground, extremely bright, and coming from a stand of trees about a quarter of a mile from the house.  Thinking someone was either poaching deer or stealing cattle, he hobbled into the house (broken leg) got his shotgun and drove his truck through the rain soaked grass toward the gate at the rear of the east pasture and the lights.  As he neared the gate and the lights everything went black.  When he came to he was dizzy.  His truck would not start.  He was so disoriented he couldn’t figure out where he was. He called for help on the CB, ""I don’t know where I am.""  His wife responded on the CB that he was out at the back gate in the east pasture.  Again he said he didn’t know where he was. Others heard him on the CB and told him to turn on his lights. He did, only now he was in the west pasture a half mile from the gate and where he had seen the lights. How did you get there his wife asked? I dont know, he replied.  The two pastures, one east and one west, are separated by a deep tree filled hollow running north to south almost the entire length of the property. According to the witness’ wife, he could not get from one side of the property to the other without passing the house or going through the hollow. If he had passed the house she would have would have seen and heard him, which she hadn’t. And going through the thick tree filled hollow in a truck would be impossible.  The CBers who had been hearing this recounted that they had heard him say that the truck was spinning and there was a great deal of intererence on the radio. Concerned, they went to the house to see if they could help. When they arrived the witness had managed to drive back to the house and seemed less disoriented. The CBers drove out to the pasture and found only one set of truck tracks. They then walked the field to see if they could see any broken trees in the hollow which they didn’t.  They also examined the witness for head trauma which he did not have. The sheriff was called and a report filed.  After the incident the witness reported that his alternator and voltage regulator had stopped working. He also stated that his watch had lost 12 minutes of time.

I was laying on the couch, and out our front window I saw something through the curtain sheers. I went to the window and observed a giant fireball roughly 50 feet in diameter moving very slowly in a horizontal direction. It was roughly 50 feet in my estimation  by comparing it to the 70 foot trailer across the road that it was nearly flying over.I could see all the flames. It was moving at my best guess about 5 mph. It didn't leave a fire trail, but the flames were vertical, and I could see it was sphere shaped. It moved about 10 feet over the tops of the trees and illuminated the tree tops as it went. I figured that if it had traveled in that same plane without raising or lowering, that it would have been a couple feet at most over our property in the back. We had a hill behind us that lowered to a creek bed in front of our house, that began another slight grade and then the tree line across the road. When I caught site of it, it was just passing over the hill in the front of our house, where it then moved over the trees across the road. I was 20 at the time, and was home alone. I got so scared that I ran upstairs and shut off all the lights. I didn't know what that thing was. I never even told my dad about it until about ten years later.

We had to be there no later than christmas day, and I had turned of all utilities, given notice at our apt. and off we went.  Feeling tired my wife and I pulled along a dirt road into the woods in toccoa to catch a power nap.  As we settled back in our seats looking south at the beauty of the stars...I saw 3 lights in the form of a triangle, just kind of sitting in the sky at a great distance.  Then I thought I saw them move about 3 inches as viewed in a linear measurement from my view...then after about 30 seconds the lights did not slowly, but at a great rate of speed moved from one side of my windshields view completely to the other side of the windshield in about 2 seconds.  I sat amazed and didn't say anything, trying to rationalize what I had just seen.   My wife also without my knowing had seen the same thing, after a few seconds she replied somewhat amazed and unsure, "" Did you see that?!""  I replied, ""What?"" to check if she meant the same thing as what I had seen.  She said: ""Those three lights !""  I knew she had seen it then, to confirm I knew what she meant I said, ""..in the shape of a triangle?""  She was just as amazed as I was and just said ""yeah"".

At first, I thought it was Haley's comet which was due later that year, but quickly realized it was not.  We pulled over to the side of the road which is something I would never do because of safety, but this situation was overwhelming.  (No other cars were on this road). This ""light"" then came directly beside us moving about 5 miles per hour.  It was cigar shaped (looked like an airplane with no wings), as long as a football field, made no sound, had a large light near the front and smaller ones down the side (which is why it looked like a comet with a tail - from a distance.   It was just above the treetops just to our right (It was so close we could have thrown a stone at it).   My son got out of the car and walked down the sidewalk beside it as it slowing traveled by. (I kid him now, that his photo is probably hanging on some martians wall!)  We were sooo amazed.   I kept assuring the children that this had to be some special project the government was working on and that I'm sure others had to have seen it and we would watch the 11:00pm news to hear what it was.   We were not afraid (I didn't believe in UFO's at that time).  We were just amazed.   Anyway, we tried to follow it by going around the block and heading in the direction it was going.  We went to the next street over and pulled over hoping it would fly over us, but it never did.  So, we went home and watched the news.   The news man said they had recieved numerous calls of a UFO, but ""all I can say is what they tell me to say - it was falling space junk.  It was spotted entering the atmosphere as a fire ball"" (about 10 minutes before we spotted it). ""It was sighted from Tampa to Georgia.""  --- What we saw was definitly not falling!!  A nd at that moment my eyes swelled with tears, because I realized that what we had seen was so rare that very few people would ever get to experience something like this in their lives. In the newspaper the following few days, people that had spotted it came forward describing what we had witnessed, but no one had come as close as we had.  I did not tell anyone except close family members, because my husband was in law enforcement and I didn't want people to think his family was looney. (Of course, some of my relatives didn't believe it either, and I don't blame them - I probably wouldn't have believed it either.)  Needless to say I and my children (who are now grown) definitely believe in UFOs and really feel blessed to have experienced this.

I was trying to sleep and my cousin was laying with his head out the tent door and kept talking about a moving white light.  Thinking it was just a satellite, I did not look until told me it was changing directions instantly at high speed. When I looked, at first I could see nothing...but he told me to watch in this one area for a moment. What appeared to be a big, bright star took off instantly and shot across the sky at an unbelievable rate. It then stopped just as suddenly, making it hard to find, as it just blended in with the stars when not moving. Every once in a while, it would move slowly, maybe making small little circles before shooting back across the sky. Sometimes it would zig zag erratically across the sky, even changing directions 180 degrees without slowing down. The object seemed to travel back and forth generally in a line SE to NW. I watched it for about an hour, and finally got tired and went to sleep. My cousin watched for some time after that, and I think it was still visible when he went to sleep as well. When telling my Dad about it, he said that my uncle had seen similar lights, but in greater numbers. He lived about 10 miles away at Iron Mountain,MO and on many summer nights sat on his front porch watching them. One night one of them fell from the sky out of sight behind the treeline, and immediatly all of the other lights converged on that area and hovered for a few minutes before dispersing again. My uncle was not the type to make up stories about UFO's, and as a matter of fact I don't think he talked about it much for fear of people thinking he was crazy.  I read just a year or two ago about a professer doing research around Van Buren MO on UFO's in the 70's (I think). The visual desciption and movement of what he studied sounds as though it was the exact same thing my uncle, cousin,and myself saw.

I looked toward the south/southeast over crouch mesa and observed 6 lights that appeared to be hovering a few hundred feet above the mesa approximately 2 to 3 miles away.  The lights were yellow/orange, identical in color to sodium vapor street lights.  They were in a straight line, at the same altitude, and fairly evenly spaced.  The light on the left most side was much larger and brighter than the other 5, which were of the same brightness.  At first I thought that they could have been street lights, but I could clearly see the mesa top and the lights were much too high to be street lights.  I also thought that they could be helicopters, but there were no helicopter sounds.

Honestly, I'm not really sure of the time of year, but it seems like it was winter, no cloud cover, clear night sky.  I was coming home from work as a bartender..no, I had not been drinking. I'm guessing at the time, somewhere between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. as the bar closed at one, and I was usually out of the building by 1:30-1:45 headed south towards Elk River, which was where I was living at the time. There is a large gravel pit that I passed by each night on my way home, and this night, as I approached I saw, briefly, what looked like along the ridge at the top of the pit, was a line of red lights.  My first thought was that it was a line of semi trucks parked along the ridge. But what I saw was at least the entire length of the ridge of the pit, and I can't say now if it was one long light, or many lights, but whatever it was was just above the ridge, directly above treeline.  Then, it was gone, the row of lights just went down, below the ridge..at least that's how it seemed. No one end moved faster than the other, there was no angles..it just droped below the horizon of the ridge and was gone. I drove by a few days later, daylight hours, to get an idea of what the ridge looked like during the day, if there was a road along the ridge, what, exactly was there. There was no road along the ridge where the lights were.  There was a road that led to an area near the ridge, but nothing at the ridge.  To be fair, it was even difficult at the time to estimate the size, or length of what I saw that night, but going back to look at it in the daylight I'd have to say bigger than a football field in length, much bigger.  I didn't see anything besides the lights..no shadows of any kind, nothing to indicate that there was anything but lights, although I know that's not likely.  Looking at the 'Characteristics of The object"" section in this web form, I will select 'There were lights in the object' only because that's all I saw..I didn't actually see an object..just lights.

We had traveled from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to visit a work of art in progress (Bishop's Castle, a very cool hand-made structure all readers must visit someday....) on a beautiful Saturday, April 17, 1993.  We drove a Jeef Cherokee to the castle, which is just west of Rye, Colorado, off I-25, south of Pueblo, taking CO-165 West.   We left the castle to find a 4-wheel drive trail to explore west of there.  We stopped at a large rock formation near a trail, when ""D"" yelled at the three of us to look at a strange light in the sky.  We were looking to the east/southeast at around 110 degrees or so. The sun was behind the mountains to our west and light was fading quickly.  The three of us looked at this 'star' and didn't see anything, at first.  We actually told ""D"" he was hallucinating....this got him a bit mad at us.  We were going back to gathering wood for a fire, as it was getting chilly as the sun set.  After about 10 minutes, ""D"" again yelled at us to check out the light, which we all did.  And sure enough, we ALL saw this very bright, rapidly 'twinkling' white light move incredibly fast to a secondary position in the sky....and then back to the original position, all within the blink of an eye!!  This was incredible....we all were quite amazed and spellbound.  The light continued to do these rapid linear displacements (equivalent distance of 2-3 times my thumb length while my arm is held out, base of thumb near the light....).  I estimate the light to have been 10-15 miles away, but it was hard to tell as we had no minimal reference points.  There was a ridge in front of us to the east with plenty of pine trees, and the light was well past that.  It was at an angle of about 35 degrees from the horizontal plane from our position, again looking towards the easterly direction.  What was also pronounced was the rapid pulsing of the light! , which was the brightest object in the sky (stars were just beginning to appear as the sun set....around 1800 (MST) or so).  It seemed to have bursts of red and blue, but it just (at first) seemed like a bright, twinkling star. That is, until it shot off in different directions so fast, and then back to the same spot again1! It did this several times....we all saw it.  I finally recalled I had a camera with me, and as a plus I had brought a tripod!  So, I raced to the Jeep and got my camera setup with the longest lense setup I had available (2x teleconverter with a 80-200 zoom lense).  My only film (1 last roll....I'd shot 4 or 5 of the castle!) was a 100asa 24 exposure roll of Kodak.  I loaded it and grabbed the tripod and headed up the hill!  My three friends stayed with the campfire below, continuing to observe the light as it bobbed and moved to various positions, but staying within the general area of just east of our position.  I got my camera setup, despite the steep angle on the hillside and had a pretty clear view of the light (from the campfire, it had been dipping below the treetops in front of us).  I used a cable to activate the shutter, as I did several long exposure shots. I decided on this strategy to capture a picture since the film speed was too slow for such low light exposure.  I had a couple of problems with the cable release, as 2 times it got stuck and allowed a regular high speed 1/1000 exposure.....wasted film, I figured.)  After several hours of trying to get pictures, the light disappeared behind clouds that came up from the west.  It was then we left the area, just around 2330 or so.  The next day, I took to the film I'd shot to the 1 hour photo shop at the mall.  What I got  back was really not much, at first.  Just a bright dot and lines.  But, 2 pictures were unusual.  1 looked like a 'tadpole' with a bright head and a tail???  The other...well, I guess some would call it a '1 in a million' shot, and it is.  It clearly shows 3 separate and distinct lights, all at low level intensity.  Connecting the lights are straight lines...it is definitely a triangular shaped craft!!  Now, what I must make clear....none of us (the four witnesses) ever saw a distinct shape, except for a round, bright light.  This was quite profound to me, as this told me a LOT.  Whoever controlled this craft was intelligent....and using a camouflage method that sure seemed to work well. Secondly, the other timed exposure pictures revealed another fact:   Whoever controlled the craft also was smart enough to use the stars as cover, moving the craft in perfect sidereal time!!  It was emulating a star!!  (the lengths of the lines created by the star movement = time.  The bright light as well as observable background stars in the picture all have parallel light trails of equal lenght!).  This, to me, is a vital clue.  This was a very clever and effective cover....it sure worked on us!  But, the camera does not lie....I have the picture (and negative...no digital pix here!).  I had it blown up, and this is an amazing picture.)  In any case, we all agreed we had seen the same thing....but, the pictures told a very important story--that there was an intelligence operating whatever type of craft it was....not something I'd ever seen before!  And it made no noise whatsoever.  This is my true story; I was reluctant in the past to tell anyone but close friends, but the picture still amazes those who see it.....maybe these facts will help other researchers.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,37.9032,-104.8858

Wednesday, June 20th 2007 was no different from any other evening in Hendersonville, NC up until around 10:45pm.  The moon was a little under a half moon and barely any clouds in the sky that evening. The moon was bright enough to cast a baby blue hue across the sky, lighting it up as if it we moments before daybreak. Theres a star that usually accompanies the moon in the warm season, its Venus or Saturn or some huge star that is always close to the moon normally.  For some reason, I looked up to see these two hanging in the light blue night…only to find that the star that usually is there by the moon..is now moving at a slow but constant pace. Then looking below it…is another star…a little to the left and below it in the sky moving at the same speed. These weren’t planes or anything man made. It gave me the initial feeling that I was moving and they were not. So I used another star near by as a point of reference, and thought, “Surely those stars won’t pass one another!!!” But yet they did.  The sky was lit to the point where I could plainly see air planes, commercial jet traffic easily and ID them without a doubt. These two moving objects didn’t not have any “outer” structure….and appeared to be so high up…that they weren’t even in our atmosphere. Slowly they made their way up to the top of the sky…then the lead object began climbing. The light emitted from these two were the same if you were looking at the North Star, or a planet in the sky…bright white, but the size of a star. No flashing…no changing color…no erratic movement.  As they climbed, I could tell that they were leaving or going higher because their light began to dim.  Within about 20 seconds of this climb, they both disappeared into the sky.  I’m really hoping that someone else saw this. I’m not a huge believer in this kind of stuff, but this was really something amazing.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,35.352264285714284,-82.43025357142858

One object leading, one following, on what looked to be the same course. The second object was not close to the first. Objects were very high in the sky. Objects came from the northwest traveling south east. Objects were observed for approx 1-2 minutes as they crossed the sky. About 3/4 of the way across the sky, the first objects bright white light began to dim to a faint pinkish/redish hue, then to nothing, no lights at all. Hard to tell exactly, but it did look like that when the second object got to the same place in the sky where the first object had started to dim, the second objects bright white light started to dim also, going to a faint pinkish/redish hue, then to no lights at all. The area of the sky where the lights blinked off was constantly observed for approx 10-15 minutes after the lights went off, and no lights/activity was noticed. Not being an expert, but knowing what the commercial jets look like at night that fly in this area, all have some form of blinking traffic lights. I cannot see these as being commercial planes. Probably military???, but why would they turn off their lights completely?  I just thought this abnormal behavior for 2 airplanes flying together at night, and may be this might be of interest.

It was a lovely evening, clear skies in all directions.   He faced East, I turned to look at the moon hanging in the western sky. I immediately noticed a very very bright object moving out of the west, moving very fast.   I began to ask my husband if it was probably a satellite, because I could not see any type of blinking as with most airplanes. We squinted, trying to decipher if there was blinking or not,  but he saw no blinking either. Right then we both noticed a second very bright object following at the exact same speed, in the exact same direction as the first.  From the ground, the bright objects would have appeared about 8-10 inches apart, so I don’t know what the actual distance would calculate to be,   but they were in unison , appearing as if the second object were being towed along.  We deliberated for a minute or two, concluding, that for satellites,  they were flying at a really low elevation ,  looking like they were inside our atmosphere,  not orbiting outside of it;   And they were so bright,  as compared to most satellites which are usually only as bright as the stars & moving across the sky at a slow but steady rate.  My husband and I are very reasonable, logical people.   It was our instinct to dismiss the objects as some logical device which was operating normally in the sky. However,  standing there….. suggesting, squinting, contemplating the possibilities of what they were,  we suddenly saw the first object fade quickly and disappear completely. We were both astounded at this point.     Questioning why and where it could have gone,   watching the second object follow the same path,  & at the exact same place in the sky,……it too faded very quickly and disappeared completely. By now we were absolutely confused at what in the world we could be seeing.              The sky was completely clear &  the objects were gone, just like that.  They traveled out of the western sky in unison, and disappeared into the Southwestern sky at the same place in the sky. We talked excitedly and returned inside after a few moments.   My husband headed to bed.   I sat down to watch some Tv. At about 1am,  I was too curious to sleep without knowing, so I called Rickenbacher Airport, and was transferred to airport operations. I explained to the man on the phone, and he confirmed that he also saw the objects in the sky at that time.   He remembered seeing them because he too noticed how fast they were traveling. He had no actual confirmation,   but assumed the first object we saw was the international space station,  because it ‘probably’ has its solar panels out right now.  I said okay,   and mentioned again that they seemed so close,   too close to be floating outside of the earth. I asked him what was trailing it so far behind the object at the same speed, and he said he did not know what that could have been.     He told me they appeared to disappear  because at a certain point on the horizon, the sunlight does not reach the object anymore and it appears to disappear.     I accepted this. My husband brought up the point that the objects were no where near the horizon,   they were way up in the sky, almost overhead.    Im sure it is possible though.  My father keeps  suggesting it was the Space station and that the object behind it was probably the space shuttle which would be docked on it or very close.  However,   the distance even from our view was already too far for the objects to be docked together,  let alone what the actual distance would be up there. He also supported the disappearing horizon theory.  When I thought about it later  I realized Rickenbacher is a military installation.   I had called them thinking they would be a better authority than Port Columbus,    but now I realize, if there were anything unidentified up there,    a military installation would be the last to confirm it.  And so we left it at that.        No answers for the boatload of questions in our minds.  I have seen now that a Pilot flying over the English Channel last week, along with his passengers, all witnessed a very large Unidentified craft outside of their windows.      After it moved out of site,  the pilot stated that a second object appeared 5 minutes later.  I do not know whether the two sightings are related but I see an amazing coincidence between the timing and actual objects seen. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS?

I quickly realized they werent when these two round shapes started to move southwest at a slow speed. After about seven minutes of floating in that direction, we noticed a flicker of reflection,1 as if it rolled from the top end of a cigar shaped craft at one end( round white shape), and made its way round and round until it dicsipated at the other end(round white shape). After it hit the other end, there was what seemed like a long bent foil piece falling down as the two white shapes continued to move southwest still equidistant at the same speed. I observed the falling object and compare it to bent foil. It almost as if someone had bent a piece of rectangular foil several times in equal sections, then slightly unbent it. This is the most accurate description  I can give if someone trys to imagine a falling slightly unbent piece of foil and the reflctions from the sun it gives off as it falls end over end. The object stopped halfway down from the other craft? and what I thought were the suns reflections turned to a slow pulsing glow. About one every 2-3 seconds.It is at this time that the object starte to move horizontally but slighty up and down as it proceeded to move out of view behind some building towards the Northeast end of the city. I got the chills when this happened yesterday. I also called the local news station, but they transferred me to someones voicemail. I couldnt focus my cellphone camera far enough to capture it. I had no camcorder or other camera with me. I also checked to see if it might had been the shuttle detaching from the ISS, but nope that was delayed.

It sounded like they had come from the direction of Jackson, MI (northwest of my location) and flew onward, in the direction of Brooklyn, to the southeast.   I didn't actually see them, only heard, what seemed to be, several loud, powerful helicopter engines (the whoop-whoop sound was easily noticibale)  At 8:00 EST I heard more heliocpters behind my home and they seemed to sit over the swamp behind my home.   There are several horse pastures surrounding this swamp and this realization made me concerned that there was possible animal mutilations occurring in my neighborhood.   I felt this because while hearing the helicopters come and go, I began to feel like I was being watched.  I've had that same feeling while in the presence of the UFO phenomenon.  The helicopters left after a few minutes but I don't recall in which direction. Around 8:05 I hear them again. This time I ran for the camera as I wanted to get a photo or two.   I know that I may have to jump in my car to get a good look at them as there are many trees in my yard and neighborhood.   They departed before I could get my Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 out and 2x telephoto lens attached. I was a bit unnerved by the helicopters and began to feel the overpowering need to take photographs outdoors.   Around 8:30 I went outdoors with camera and tripod in hand.   I set up to shoot some stills of the moon and try out the manual settings on this digital SLR.   I snapped a few images of the moon while having problems with the tripod.   I detached the camera body from the tripod and began snapping off dozens of photos into the air,just above the tree line to the NE.   I can't explain why...I just began to shoot images. The two images attached, ""disc"" and ""cigar-close"", were shot around 8:30pm on 21 June 2007.   I saw a small, black disc flying erratically in the sky, like a balloon in turbulant wind...but under much more control.    It was flying from west to the east. The photo with the cigar shaped image was one of many images taken during a 'manual burst' of dozens of images.   The image preceding the one with the cigar and the one after contain no objects in the sky but were taken within an extremely short time (1 to 5 seconds between images. It should be noted that both images employed 8x zoom (the camera has a 12x internal zoom) and a 2x telephoto lens.

The craft was shaped like a football that was somewhat flattened with it's points cut off and black as the ace of spades.  You could even say it was capsule like shaped.  The crafts was approximately 3 to 3.5 miles to the north and about 1200 - 1500 ft in the sky.  The reason I know the distance is because it was fling directly over an area I bicycle frequently.  The point at which I sighted the craft was the enterance of our condominiums.  The reason I can approximate the height of the craft was because it approached a 'low' white puffy cloud (east of the cloud) and banked around the puffy clound going from a southern direction (at me) to a west direction.  This cloud was only one of two clouds in the sky.  My back was to the south the craft was almost dead north to my vantage point which means the sun was hitting this craft  directly head on from my vantage point.  Their was a passanger jet aircraft further to the northwest of this craft. It was flying west.  I can even approximate it's distance because I know this area very well in miles.  The black oval / disk craft was traveling at a speed relevant to that of a piper cub would travel in the sky.  Now, I was in a car with my fiancée and she likes to (shall I say) talk it up, when I saw this craft in motion.  We were heading south out of the complex she had to slow down for the speed bumps as you exit and wait for traffic at the street.  It gave me enough time to observe the craft before we truned and drove east, the craft already banked around the cloud at that time and was heading west.  I dare not interrupt my fiancée while she was talking besides she had to watch the road.  Having a lifetime experience of observing aircraft at the same height and distance in the sky, as this was, I can say with certainty this craft was at the same length as a commercial / passanger jet.  Also, and this is very important, I saw this very same exact craft in a archived UFO photo with a Vietnam era fighter aircraft with it in the sky. Lastly, this is not my first sighting.

This was on Christmas Eve. We were traveling by car through a rural area - we were surrounded by fields with no streetlights. We were just approaching a hill when a car came down the hill, facing us. As they came down the hill, that car braked and its taillights illuminated the hill behind them in a reddish glow.  In that glow both my father and I saw a craft gliding across the top of the hill from one cornfield into another. It was dark gray with no lights and massive - it took up the entire road, we could not see the beginning or end of it. It moved more smoothly than anything I have ever seen; cars, planes and ships can move smoothly but this glided almost as if automated. It was like it was on a conveyor belt. Then the car approaching us stopped braking and its taillights went off and the hill fell into darkness again.  Both my father and I were shocked. We are from that area and are well acquainted with tractors, cars, trucks and anything other vehicle in local use and we could not think of anything it could be. It was just too huge. Furthermore there were cornfields on each side of that hill - there was no reason for any kind of craft to pass at that location. As we drove up and over the hill, I looked into the fields but could see nothing... everything was pitch black.  This probably isn't related but something odd happened the following morning on Christmas. My parents' house is very remote and too set back from the road for anyone to approach on foot. Yet we discovered HUGE footprints leading from the driveway through the snow around the house... and they just stopped in the middle of the yard. They didn't turn around and they didn't go anywhere else. The tracks just ended as if whoever made them vanished.  It was Christmas and we were obviously busy with other things, but the sight of that craft gliding from one field into another has haunted me ever since. I know it's not a ""flying"" object as it was on the ground but it was not of this world either. I'm sure of it.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,,

What I saw was the most profound experience of my life – it happened over the duration of my stay – I arrived on the 26th of December and every night from the 28th-29th I was visited by something in my room.  I had someone staying with me and he saw it as well.  The first night I was sleeping and was woken by a kind of grinding noise, like a car revving – I was laying on my right side of my body facing the wall which had curtains across it – when I woke I didn’t immediately open my eyes, but I listened I thought it was something outside my window of my room – later I learned the curtains only covered a small window but they spanned the whole wall of my room.  I listened and when the sound got louder I opened my eyes.  Directly in front of my face, in my room, there was a ball of light – about the size of a basketball – it began to move way from me as soon as I opened my eyes.  It moved in and thru the curtains while moving away from me, but still in my room.  It got to the end of my bed – sound of the revving still present – then floated out my balcony window.  I stared at the wall directly in front of my face, and I could see the light thru it as it backed thru the forest – I could see the shadow of the plants and trees blowing the wind on the wall of the interior of my room.  Then slowly the light faded away and the wall became solid.  As I lay there I thought of every possible explanation: someone shining a flashlight in my room, I was dreaming – but I wasn’t and they weren’t – it happened. The second night I went to bed with the anticipation that something might happen again.  I had told my friend who was staying with me what had happened the previous night and he didn’t believe, he thought I was dreaming.  We went in to our beds and turned out the lights, and I lay there for a bout 2 mins with nothing happening.  Then from the corner of the room – the opposite side from the window – I saw a light.  A small round light formed in the corner of the room, and it began to float over to me and floated across the room and over the foot of the bed until it was directly over my body.  The ball of light was slightly different from the other – it was bluish in color and had tentacle like streams of light coming from it.  If I had to draw a parallel to something – I would say a jellyfish, but it wasn’t a jellyfish.  I woke my friend up by calling his name – I didn’t turn on the light and I told him to look and tell me what he saw and he said he saw it and he described it as I saw it there floating in my room.  We were both quite shaken over it and turned on the light - after several minutes of talking about it, rationalizing it we turned the light out – and we could see it floating there still.  I asked him to turn the light on again and when he did – the light wouldn’t come on immediately – instead it flickered, like an old movie reel – we could still see it – the flickering of the light allowed us to see it still as if the light was on – the light flickered for what seemed like forever, but was only a couple of seconds.  When the light came on – I have to admit I was terrified.  Then I heard a sound – like a plane coming from a distance, but the sound became louder and louder – then I realized it was the same sound from the night before – like an engine revving, but clearer, more defined and definitely louder.  My friend said it was it was in the room – I know it was there and it was loud and frightening, there was no light show or anything – the room was lit and I couldn’t see anything, but the so! und was there and then all of a sudden it wasn’t.  We slept with the lights on that night.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,,

After turning 2 curves in the road I looked back over my shoulder and through my mirrors but could no longer see the light, it could have just been out of my line of sight. I have tried to dismiss it as an airplane but there were no other flashing lights nor can I think of an airplane with a light that would pulse in such a fashion.

It was about 2:00am.  I was several miles south of Belle Glade approaching its small suburb of South Harbor.  It was a clear dark night and the stars were out. Lake Okeechobee was on my left to the east just beyond a retaining dam or dyke and a swamp was just to the east of me on me on my right.  There was what I think was a sugar cane processing plant aglow in a cluster of lights on a hammock about a mile away in the marsh.  Suddenly a bright green object traversed my windshield from right to left on a downward path at a slight angle.  It was a glowing iridescent green triangle open in the middle with a smaller triangular cutout.  It looked like one of those fancy new odd shaped Frisbees that kids toss around in the back yard.  Its relative size on the windshield was each leg of the triangle was four or five inches in length.   The object began to fall in a graceful falling leaf fashion, flipping and flopping in several different directions as it descended. Then it faded away and disappeared from view.  My girlfriend was looking out the side window of my truck, the window being open, and saw what appeared to be the same object doing the same maneuver.  I was apparently seeing the reflection of the object on the interior of my windshield while she was actually viewing it. What was astonishing is the reflection itself was very vivid like an image on a liquid crystal T.V. set.  The color, the shape, and the movement of this object sets it apart from anything I have ever seen before.  So far media or law enforcement sources have not corroborated this sighting. This was the third UFO I have seen in my lifetime (I am 65) but the first one I have ever reported.  I have decided to include the details of the other sightings although I cannot remember the exact dates of these sightings.  Varadero Beach, Cuba, winter of 1954  I was just thirteen years old and had just jumped off the bus with my Cuban friend, nicknamed Pupi.  It was midnight and we were returning from the movies.  It was a clear cloudless night and the stars were out and shining bright in the night sky.  We were walking along a road that paralleled the beach.  Suddenly in an instant it became as bright as day and I could see a woods a half a mile away.  Trees, houses and every visible object stood out in stark relief as if they were caught like a snapshot by the flash of a giant camera.  Then an object appeared going in the opposite direction of our travel.  It was a round luminous white disk.  It could have been a saucer shaped disk flying on its edge or I could have been viewing a round object.  Other than the flames there appeared to be no other details such as structures or lights. From the trailing edge or rear of the disc sprouted a dozen or so blue flamelets like the flames on a gas stove turned down to a low setting.  I estimated the object to be about fifteen hundred to two thousand feet in altitude and about a half mile away.  Its relative size at that distance was about the size of a melon.  I have often wondered how an object responsible for producing so much light could be easily viewed, not appearing as an intense overwhelming blinding light with no discernable shape because of the glare. What was amazing was that this object appeared in a night sky with a starry background while the whole landscape was bathed in light.  Apparently this same object was seen over and over again and reported to the media. It was once described as a glowing disc that cart wheeled through the air.  This disk did not appear to spin or cartwheel but appeared to be flying in a steady fashion with a leading edge and a trailing edge that spouted flames.  Rockford, Illinois, early Nineties  I was just about to enter a bicycle shop on the south side of Rockford.  It was midday with a clear blue sky and a few clouds.  Before I got to the door of the shop I stretched and as I did this I looked up and saw something I couldn’t identify. It appeared to be a light silver oval or disc shaped object.  I was seeing it not from the side but possibly balancing on edge like an egg carefully placed upon its end in some kind of magicians trick.  It hung motionless several hundred above me at about an eighty degree angle from where it was soaring above some telephone wires. It was actually hard to determine its altitude and size.  Its relative size from my vantage point was that it was the size of a (egg shaped) manhole cover.  I thought it might be a balloon but balloons tend to rise and to my recollection high altitude weather balloons are sent aloft under inflated to compensate for the reduced pressure of the atmosphere there. This thing was fully “puffed up” so to speak and it was not moving at all and not rising. I decided to go into the bike shop and get some witnesses to help me possibly identify or verify what I had seen or verify that I had seen it at all.  But just as I entered the shop I became embarrassed, feeling like some kind of irrational lunatic. So I quickly went outside to see if it was still there.  It was gone.  It was not some distant dot high in the sky or any where on the horizon of my view.  It had totally vanished.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,26.6547,-80.728

I walked out on to our porch (which is on the second story of the house) and I looked acrossed the street (which is on a right angle from our house)when I realized the sound was coming from that direction to see if the coyotees were that way. Out of the corner of my left eye I caught something in the sky that looked bright. It was ""falling"" in a straight line from left to right yet at a downward angle, it appeared to be in the sky over the Beaverton or Hillsboro Area. It was just above the line of a tree in our yard, and over the lights of the town. My first reaction was that it looked like a HUGE shooting star but then my brain connected that it was not white but a very bright Aqua (blue green) color.. not a regular blue.... and it was pretty big.... much larger than any falling star I've ever seen. Sort of a firey looking bright aqua colored light. I yelled for my family because the door was still open and I really didn't know what I was seeing. It lasted long enough for me to think they would actually be able to get to where I was at and see it, but at the last moments ...as it seemed to get to it lowest point it suddenly swooped back up in a circle (rounding over itself and coming back around), then in a kind of figure eight and then basically made a bunch of very eratic moves...in a really much faster and crazier pattern. honestly the closest description I can give is that it looked like a ballon losing its air... a kind of crazy dance right at the end... and then it just disappeared. Before it did the circles though it was going very straight and fast at an angle towards the ground. It was very clear .... no clouds skewing my view..... and I saw it distinctly. I don't know what it was, so I won't even speculate, but I can say I For SURE saw what I saw and know it wasn't any kind of plane or ballon or regular aircraft I've ever witnessed before.

As I was setting up my tripod in my solarium which faces southeast over Lake Ontario in Etobicoke, I looked up at the moon which was very “yellow” and noticed something “black” on the face of the moon. I asked my husband if he could see it from the livingroom where he was sitting and he said yes he could. I reached for his camera which was closest to me and had a 100-400mm lens on it to get a good look. I was amazed at what I saw! At the top of the moon but closer to the right side rather than the middle, there appeared to be a black pitchfork shaped object shooting downward toward the bottom of the moon leaving two stream vapour barrier in its trail. I was able to get about 5 shots in before the object reached the bottom of the moon and once leaving the light background of the moon it appears to be nothing more than a puff of black smoke. Upon reviewing the images I shot I realized that in one of the early shots I took of the moon the “pitchfork shape” was at the very edge of the moon prior to me being aware that it was there.

It seemed to loop around quickly to change directions, then accelerated at a sharp angle as if trying to land quickly.  It disappeared.  The area in which it seemed to go down was too far from Fort Campbell to be near that airfield.  It had a V shape of bright white lights that seemed to be in a straight line sometimes depending on the angle.  At first I could only see the three lights at the outside angles forming a triangle.  I only saw white lights, no color.  The lights were equally spaced apart at least 6 or 7 in number.  I did not hear any sound of a helicopter or plane.  I’m guessing the distance to be less than a football field away from my car.  There were plenty of vehicles on the interstate including truck drivers.  No one even slowed down.

It went away for 15 minutes and then returned again for maybe 5 minutes to the same place, this time higher up in the sky as it swooshed down out of sight again. It would hover in one space and then travel laterally, as the angle changed quite frequently. No doubt in my mind, this was a UFO.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,33.5717,-117.7289

Late night of 27-28 August 2007 off Interstate 10 heading from Phoenix to Tucson Arizona, near Arizona City, I spotted two lights off to the right side of the road. One was white, the other blueish. At first I thought it was just an airplane and then the white light seemed to shine a spotlight up into the sky (at the moon). It was during a lunar eclipse. I pulled over to the side of the road and proceeded to watch it for a while. The aircraft appeared triangular, but I am basing this on the positioning of the lights. The aircraft would continue to do the same pattern over and over. It is somewhat hard to explain, but the two lights would seem to disappear and three lights (much like headlights of a car) would come on. The aircraft would come towards the edge of the freeway, and spotlight the moon, flip over upside down, and then turn away. It would then turn around, turn on the three bright lights as it came back towards the freeway. It would again spotlight the moon, flip upside down ( which would now be right side up) again and head away. It made very little noise but I could faintly hear it. It was in the vicinity of a small airport and may have just been a small airplane, but I have never seen an airplane stay upside down for as long as this one was. I also haven't seen an airplane with lights such as this, which gave it a triangular appearance. If anyone knows what this was please let me know.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

Weather conditions were sunny and warm, approximately 75 degrees Fahrenheit, relatively cloudless. I was driving and my wife sat in the front passenger seat. As we passed through the area where I-5 intersects Highway 134, we both observed a very large elongated object hovering just east of that intersection, which from our vantage point would be to our left. It seemed to be no more than ½ mile from us and no more than 2 thousand feet in altitude (my estimate). The object was dull, dark grey in color, no windows. Our initial thought was that we were looking at a blimp, except for the fact that it was 2 to 3 times the length of some of the commercial blimps we normally see. The object was closer in size to WWII-era zeppelins The object we saw had no markings, no tail fins, and no underbelly cab. My driving speed at the time went with the flow of traffic, which I estimate to have been approximately 65-70 mph. Traffic was brisk, yet there were plenty of vehicles on the road. We both observed the object for maybe 8-10 seconds before a line of roadside trees momentarily blocked our view of the object. Our view of the object was obstructed at the most for 3 seconds before we passed the trees.

I first thought they were balloons tied together, but a commericial aircraft (DC9 I think) actually flew between the ground and the objects at about 6:40 P.M. This gave a great visual reference to the actual size and altitude of the objects in question. As the aircraft had passed the objects actually changed from a vertical position to a horizontal position and stayed approximately the same distance away from each other. I actually stopped one family coming out of the restaurant to show them but they were not interested at all and looked at me like I was crazy. Two younger men in there early 20's were going in and I stopped them to ask if they also could see the objects and they trying to figure it out also. After about 2 to 3 minutes the object ascended in altitude and then you could no longer make them out do to darkness and altitude of the objects.

Usually I go outside to do this to save water in this arid area.  I had gone outside, looked toward the San Pedro Mountains and saw a small moving light.  I observed it very carefully and listened to see if it was some sort of aircraft.  It was moving much too slowly to be an aircraft, no noise, and there were no blinking lights. So I surmised that it was a genuine UFO...my first one!  I also supposed because of its position that it was about 3 miles away when it disappeared from view behind South Mountain. I had not really had given much credability to UFOs until I met with a man that is a neighbor, and prominate in the UFO community, 2 years before my sighting.

We were outside smoking cigarettes. I had a 3 month old in my house and my cousin's 2 week old baby was inside as well so now you can see why we were sitting outside on a cool fall, almost winter evening. It was almost dusk and about 5 miles away we could see something flying and it had a bright light so we figured police copters looking for drugs. It was very low to the ground. It is normal to see cops looking for pot fields around here and if they think they have a moving meth lab the copter is out too. So we were watching cuz this is a small town. We all know each other if we aren't already related to them or married into the family. And it happened to be over top where a lot of my friends and family lived so I was really curious.So here we are cracking jokes about which friend/family member it could be and It darted sideways up! Totally from the left side at the bottom of the sky to the far right and high. After we were through freaking out at how it did that, then it dawned on us what happened and we started saying ufo! And we came in and got everyone in my house to go outside and look. (of course we told them we thought it was cops and how it darted there in the sky.) This thing hovered. It didn't move. I tried to take pictures of it but I have a pretty crappy cam when it comes to taking pictures of the sky. Even when we have a huge full moon that is bright I can't even get a dot on my cam. But I tried anyway. It wasn't like the thing was going anywhere. I got a blurry spot in the blackness of the sky with these pics BTW. We had been watching it for about 20 minutes when a passenger plane started it's nightly route to where ever. We watched this plane go straight towards it and we were like, ""It's going to move"" and it didn't. The plane kinda moved around it. It was like maybe 30 minutes after that we had military aircraft flying towards it. The funny thing was we were like ""should we call the air force? call the police? call someone?"" and we pretty basically agreed no that if the military was involved they would say it was one of theirs they were testing or a weather ballon or something like that. What could local police do? And we thought if we called the local tv station they would laugh at us. So we just sat there talking and watching. Well here comes the military and we were like ""YEAH! Now it is going to get interesting."" And we watched 4 air craft fly up towards it and go completely around it like they were circling this object of prey. It was as if there was an invisible barrier stopping air craft from getting close because we used the trees as guides and we could tell before they got to a certain tree they would go around. We watched the military planes for a long time play cat and mouse and finally the object moved a tiny bit. And then it disappeared. Now what I really found odd was the planes still could not go into the area of the sky that the object occupied. After the military left we came in and warmed up and that is when my mom told me she had seen the same object before from her bedroom window one night and she watched it for hours because it scared her. She saw it in summer on the other side of town in a completely different year. Well when we went out (we walk people to the door if not their car still here in the south) it was back, in the same place. My cousin says, ""They cloaked!"" He was convinced they cloaked themselves and hid. And we watched it for a minute or two but it was too cold to stay out there. So every little bit I would walk out my back door and look at it and it would still be there. I went to sleep at 12 that night and when I went to bed it was still there. A few weeks later, my cousin and his wife who were here that night and living in the same house my mom lived in when she saw the object that summer night, called me at like 6 am telling me they had been watching it stince about 2 am when they went out to smoke. And they reported they saw it two or three more times after that too. Plus as of 6-21-2006 they are still reporting seeing this object at my aunt's house. I will go in to my paint shop pro and try to make a pic of what it looked like-well the lights on it. I can't draw the ship.

When I looked closely at the rotating dome I saw strange runes or glyphs encircling the top dome emitting a blue glow that out lined these odd symbols. It went the same for the smaller rotating domes underneath, yet they were colored separately purple, red, green, and yellow. It circled around my house practically brushing the tree tops. After about 15 minutes of circling it hovered directly over the house. Intrigued, I went outside to get a better view of it. The glyphs on the small domes then became brighter and the domes began to spin faster and faster. Then all of the sudden a dazzling blast of light focused on me. I was so scared I couldn't move.

It was deafening and incredibly painful and forced me to the ground clutching my throbbing head as though I was to die from it. Then there was a brilliant blaze of light and the shrieking stopped.

(13 Photos available) I was driving my semi north on I-135 from Wichita heading for McPherson, Kansas.  I am quite familiar with this highway as I live in Hutchinson, not far away.  At approximately 18:20 I saw three very bright amber lights in the sky to my right and ahead of me.  At first I figured them to be on an airplane approaching for landing in Wichita, but then realised that these lights were not on the normal landing path, and also over several seconds and then minutes, did not move.  The lights were evenly spaced with the one on the left being a bit lower. The highway slants to the left (north-west) at the place of this sighting (near Moundridge), so I figured them to be somewhere west of McPherson at the time. They were lite up when I first saw them so I do not know their total duration, but after about 20 minutes I watched as the one in the center went out, then the one on the right, and a couple of seconds later the last (lower) one went out.  During this event I phoned a couple of knowledgable friends asking about the colors of flares, and this orange/amber colr was not a typical flare color.  I then proceeded north and a few minutes later, four more lights appeared, spaced evenly as before with one slightly lower than the other three.  These may have been there for some time before I saw them.  This time the highway was going straight north so I could see that these lights were over the city of McPherson.  I then rolled down my driver's side window and reached for my digital camera and began pointing and shooting in the direction of these lights.  During the photos, I saw something dark brush me directly in front of me.  As I approached the Highway 56 exit, the lights began to disappear in the same fashion as the earlier ones that I saw.  While sitting at the dock in McPherson getting loaded, I downloaded the photos into my laptop. Most of the photos are jiggly but some of them captured the lights.  In closer examination, I noticed that I must have captured the (object??) that brushed me.  This object shows lights that do not belong to anything in the area, and I can not identify the object, only to see a vague outline of something...like a craft of some sort, containing white, amber and green lights in square an ""I"" shapes.

This particular object was due east from my location, at about 25 degrees elevation, just to the left of Mt. Hamilton, a prominent landmark. It shape was a cyllinder with rounded ends, long axis parallel to the horizon--and fixed in the sky during the 5 minutes I watched. The object subtended approx. 1.5 degrees, and in the evening light shone in the same colors seen in nearby stratocumulus; I judged it to have a reflective surface. The atmospheric effects on the object gave the appearance of considerable distance, perhaps even as far distant as the Mt. Hamilton range. While unproven, I had the impression of considerable size.  Naturally, when I observe something puzzling, I try to eliminate any conventional possibilities. The only prosaic explanation was a blimp or approaching aircraft, but as there were no visible protuberances, such wings, fuselage, or stabilizers, I'm not satisfied with that explanation. Have observed many blimps before, this distinctly cyllindrical object was quite different from a blimps familiar ellipsoid shape.  When traffic cleared, I watched this object until it was lost behind the local skyline of rooftops and trees. Since I was near home, I quickly dropped by and grabbed my binoculars for a closer view, then drove to my previous viewing point. The object could not be seen, and upon driving towards Mt. Hamilton and away from ground obstructions, I could not find this object anywhere in the sky. Since only 5 minutes from my last sighting had elapsed, I do not believe a blimp could have left local airspace during that brief time. Local wind conditions were calm. With those details, and a bit of skepticism I submit this report. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) The report below was incorrectly entered as ""Cupertino, CO"".

It was like a ship on fire, burning light of white and a little yellow in a kind of corona around a central mass that was traveling at tremendous speed and then it exploded in the air in a conical fashion. About the time the debris cone got to three times the diameter of the original object the 'fire' went out and nothing of it was visible in the dark. I can estimate the speed at around 3600 mph because for the second (if that) that I saw the object it traveled the length of a hill/mountain top that is somewhat like a mesa in shape and is a mile in length. However, the object appeared to be about 5 miles beyond the 'mesa' and from my perspective about 5 degrees above the mesa and in slight declination... for reference my distance from the mesa was about a mile. The freeway is pretty much going south-east where I was at, so I guess the object was traveling south, but I can't be sure becuase the 15 fwy changes direction alot. I'm sure the media would have already have the story out if the shuttle exploded, so it wasn't that. Other possibilities would include a meteor, but I would guess that a meteor that big would cause some major damage, and not be at such a slight declination at such a low altitude.

It was nearing dusk on the beginning Friday evening of the Memorial Day holiday week-end, in approximately 1982.  I do not recall the exact date, and it could even have been 1983?  Myself, my wife and three children were camped at Stewart State Park on Lost Creek Lake in Jackson County, Oregon, with another family, a co-worker, his wife and their four children. We had had a very full day and were all just sitting around chatting after eating dinner. I remember being very tired at the the time and feeling myself in an odd state of lethergy, when I noticed a roughly pyramidal-shaped formation of three glowing objects silently moving down the highway bordering the edge of the campground, moving over the edge of the campground itself, and moving roughly parallel to the highway. From where we were camped I could see pretty much the entire expanse of the campground area and quite a bit of the lake beyond, at its edge, and a portion of the highway and the bridge across the lake, at its far edge. At that time you could see this, but now the view has has changed considerably due to the growth of the trees that have been planted around the park, that were then basically just seedlings. Now, you cannot see across the campground very easily and depending on where you are camped, you cannot even see the lake, itself. But at that time I could see the other campsites across the park, I could see the smoke from their campfires, see people and I could even hear their voices. I could not hear exact words, but I could hear laughter and voices. I remember feeling amazed that what I could clearly see had not caused the slightest spark of interest from any of the other campsites. And, I can recall being amazed at my own strange lack of excitement. I just sat there in somewhat of a ""funk"" and calmly said: ""Gosh, look at that.""  My youngest son, who was approx. 12 at the time, was sitting next to me, and he said to me: ""Yeah, gee....that's funny."" Also, in a very calm voice, and showing no hint of excitement, either. A third person, the wife of my co-worker friend that we were camped with, who was sitting directly across the picnic table from myself and my, also acknowledged that she had seen it, too. But also in the same sort of matter-of-fact manner saying: ""oh yeah,"" very off-handedly, then she laughed continued chatting with the others in the party, who had seen nothing at all. After many years, I discussed with my son what I had seen and asked him what he had seen. His recollections are far less vivid than my own. He cannot recall EXACTLY what it was that he saw, only that it certainly was something out of the ordinary. He too, remarked how he felt the same, in an odd sort of lethergy and the odd feeling of calm with a complete lack of excitement. I also discussed the sighting very briefly with my friends wife, again many years after the incident. Her response was that she definitely saw something but couldn't begin to explain what it was, then laughed it off and she changed the subject, like she didn't care to discuss it. It was almost as though we were all drugged or had been zapped by something (though nothing of the sort had actually happened!). My exact recollections of the sighting are this: The three balls of light were perfectly round and had to be at least as large as an automobile in size, judging from how far off they were from our campsite. One was red, one was green, and one was white. I remember at the time saying to myself that they looked like Christmas Tree ornaments, they had that same sort of glowing quality about them. They were solid objects and you could not see through them, and they were each surrounded by a sort of a whitish colored halo....you could see through the halo itself, in a sort of out of focus fashion. The halo was surrounding each of the objects seperately, but not collectively around the formation itself. The objects couldn't have been more than say 30 or 40 feet, at the most, from each other. The were no windows or appendages on them of any kind....no markings at all, and they moved in complete silence, emitting no trail behind them. I watched them veer slightly from the highway edge of the campground and glide directly over the campground itself, and then out over the lake....going quite a distance over the lake before, in what felt like just seconds (or less), the three balls of light merged together, changed color to a very bright white, and then shot straight up into the sky, going extremely fast, and totally disappearing from sight. Again, not making the slightest sound, but leaving a very discernable white streak behind them, which just as quickly as it had formed, faded and then disappeared. Oddly, I put the entire incident out of my mind, and did not even mention it to anyone in the group for the rest of that week-end, nor did my son or my friends wife mention it at all. I did not report what I had saw to anyone and it actually took me quite some time to later come to the conclusion that what I had seen was very possibly a UFO. Whatever it was, it was not imagined. It definitely was like nothing I had ever seen before in my life (I was approx. 42 or 43 at that time). Does this sound at all like something that someone else has reported?  Now, many years later, when I tell this to others (friends and family), they all think I'm pulling their leg about it, or they jokingly accuse me of being a ""bit swacked"" at that time.  It is not a joke....I did see SOMETHING, and I was not drinking at the time, either.  There was not a single drop of alcohol in either of our campsites, as my friend and co-worker was a recovery alcoholic and was, at that time, very early into his now 25+ year association with A.A., and I did not want to make him feel uncomfortable that week-end by drinking in front of him.

The thing just sort rose up from behind the trees or maybe off the horizon but it seemed close (approx 100 meters).  It was silent and kind of danced around in a slight ‘zig zag’ pattern bobbing up and down to the right before changing direction left, then leveling to a straight line and blinking out.  It was at what seemed about tree top level in altitude but it was really hard to determine.  It was strange looking at it.  Judging the true distance and altitude was kind of tough because it looked unreal, literally, like ionized gas, or a hologram.   I don’t suppose this is relevant but we were all engaged in very a heated debate discussing the possibility of intelligent life originating elsewhere and the chances of its traveling here, two on one side, one taking a more neutral stance and one the opposite, shouting religious and scientific contentions to support one or rebut the other.  At least one other witness can corroborate and the other two probably would if they could be located; although one was stating disbelief in the whole UFO phenomenon at the time of the encounter.

I lived and worked on Andros for 13 months as a crew member on several different torpedo retrieval boats and also on AUTEC vessels that deployed sensitive sonar testing equipment in the Tongue of the Ocean -- affectionately rendered as the acronym TOTO. During one voyage on an AUTEC vessel in the summer of 1985, we were underway in the channel between the north end of Andros and New Providence islands, bound for a port in West Palm Beach, Florida. During the midnight to four o'clock a.m. watch, my watch partner and I sighted what I would describe as two ""ghost rockets"" that flew side by side over our ship on a west to east trajectory.  These ""rockets"" were highly unusual as neither made any sound, were traveling at an oddly slow rate of speed and were visible to us for about 15 seconds.  However, the rockets left behind contrails that glowed brightly and which were ""multi-colored,"" in that the contrail smoke changed from white to green to blue to pink and then disappeared completely after about ten minutes.  (I estimate that they passed over us at an altitude of about 500 to 1000 feet; both rockets were white-colored and perhaps 25 to 40 feet in length). I never have been able to determine to a 100% certainty whether or not those ""rockets"" were a part of some sort of secret Navy submarine or destroyer test being conducted in the area; I have always assumed that they were not and for good reason: As an AUTEC vessel, we would definitely have been informed that such a test was being undertaken and subsequently, warned to stay out of the area.  This had always been the Navy's practice during similar rocket firing tests that I witnessed while working at sea in the same area. After returning from the voyage, I asked a friend at the AUTEC base who worked as a sort of ""air and ocean traffic controller"" about the incident.  He told me that he had no knowledge of any sort of test-firing of rockets on that night and due to the sensitive nature of his job, he certainly would have been in a position to know.  (And as a very close friend of mine, he would have told me even if it was supposed to be ""top secret"").  Again, I have never heard any satisfactory explanation as to exactly what it was we saw that night.  I have also never heard of rockets that travel in such close proximity to each other, i.e., the ""side by side"" flight that we witnessed, or at such an unusually slow speed.  Since that incident occurred, I have learned that there is a known history of so-called ghost rocket sightings in other parts of the world, particularly in Sweden.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,,

I realize that this was 22 years ago, but it deserves telling and some attention. My two brothers and I were on a fishing trip in a place called Bear Cave Road which is located behind  Indian Bay, Newfoundland, Canada. We camped on the edge of a lake called Alley’s Pond and just after dawn on the following morning,  I got up and went outside to try my luck with some early morning fishing.  It was a clear morning with not a cloud in sight and as I looked toward the opposite side of the lake in  the eastern sky, I saw a large object hovering above the tree line about a kilometer away. The object appeared to be about a hundred meters or more across. It was saucer shaped and had a string of orange lights on the outside edge of the object which seemed to be moving around the outside circumference on the edge of the object. Although it reflected some sunlight, it appeared to be of a dull coloration. It remained motionless in the sky and I went to alert my brother who was up and about. We both stared at it for a minute or so when I suggested that we go over and have a closer look. We both got in a boat which we had and started up the outboard motor. All this time it still remained motionless about a hundred feet or so above the trees. We only moved about a hundred feet when the lights turned a blue color and the object moved at very high velocity at a forty five degree angle away form us. It did not make a sound and in an instant it was gone. To this day, I cannot get this experience out of my mind. My brother and I both saw exactly the same thing and we will occasionally bring up the subject, but otherwise it is all but forgotten.

At about 10 miles from home - looking to the east I saw what looked like a small skinny cloud (cigar shaped) in the orange yellow sunrise.  There were 3 or 4 small clouds.   A few minutes later as I got closer to home, what I thought was a cloud grew in size and was moving east to west back to east. Upon arriving home the object was still moving east to west and back east.  I immediately woke up my parents who were still sleeping in.  I called them out to the front porch of the home we were living.   As my parents were trying to figure out what I was talking about, the object continued to move east to west back to east.  The object seemed to concentrate its path over a small minimum security work release correctional facility that is 1/2 mile directly east of our house.  Our house is on a small hill west of the correctional facility, so we had an unobstructed view.  The prison does farming and some small level cattle work (1985).  The prison has open fields on the east and west side of the property.  Almost at the moment my parents realized this was no joke and started observing this strange event themselves the object came nearly over the house and slowly rolled its belly side for us to see.  Basically went from horizontal movement to a banking position.  I was so shocked I could hardly move or say anything.  To describe the object as unbelievable is an understatement.  First of all it was immense in size.  I would estimate the size somewhere between 1000 and 2000 ft in diameter.  Grey in color.  It had detail and ridges on the underside and it looked like it was intelligently built.  It was dead silent, no lights and at about 1000 ft in altitude.   The remarkable thing I did noticed from the belly view was it was trailing sparse clouds off the edges of its disk shape.  It looked much like the arms of clouds in a hurricane seen from space.

I was on a kibbutz in Israel called kibbutz Einat, about an hour from Tel Aviv.  It was evening around 9pm, and I was walking by myself. I saw a flying object moving slowly above me.  It was a triangular craft with a triangle of pulsating red lights in the center of the bottom.  I don't recall if there were any other lights on it. The triangle of red lights was at an opposite angle/position to that of the craft.  I don't recall any sound either, I believe it was fairly silent. A moment after I walked into view of the craft it stopped moving and hovered above me. I couldn't tell how far away it was at that time. I stood and looked at it for a couple minutes or so; I waved at it; it hovered for a bit and then suddenly darted in the opposite direction from me, made a sharp left and went behind a tree. It was at that point that I realized that it was smaller and closer than I first thought - about 10-20 feet across. I stood and waited for a couple more minutes, not sure if it was still behind the tree (about 100 feet from me) or if it had continued on behind it.  Eventually it came back out, stopped above me for another moment, and then very quickly zoomed out to my right towards a sunflower field.  I watched as it went, and about 2-300 feet away from me, it suddenly plunked straight down into the sunflower field. The height of the sunflowers (about 6 feet) was higher than the craft. I ran to tell other people about it, but they all thought I was making it up.  The most amazing thing about it was the way it moved - quickly jolting from one spot to another in the sky, and hovering in one spot. The other very memorable thing was the pulsating red lights.  They pulsated as though a wave was going across them from one side to the other. There was an army base near the kibbutz, and I wondered if it was actually some sort of creation by the Israeli army. In the last year or so I saw a TV show that described similar types of crafts seen by others. Just wanted to share the story with anyone who's interested. Thanks!",2007-06-12T00:00:00,,

They were luminous, but not hugely bright.  They appeared to be transparent or had a certain hard-to-describe transparent quality about them.

The objects made no noise that we were able to detect.   My friend and I went back to the house where we were staying and took out pencils and paper.

A ""family member"" and myself were waiting at a traffic light on Franklin Blvd. in a small burb between the cities of Eugene and Springfield.  We just picked up a pizza to take home on one of these foggy evenings at this time of year.  The fog was just starting to condense and lower towards the ground as it was visible by the city lights. It was already dark and you could see the moon rising to our left. I was a passenger in the car and noted to my co-occupant that the moon was rising. And then I saw another more bright, round sphere-shaped object coming from the left side of the vehicle. It appeared at first to be the same size as the moon. But it moved steadily and became brighter as it crossed our plane of view from left to right,(East to West). The object was a bright white lighted sphere, a completely round ball. It's size seemed to be approx. 15-20 feet in diameter. As it moved I got the attention of the person with me and alerted him to it. That is when I noticed that he was in a state of mild shock, for he would never believe in anything like UFO's, ghosts or any thing out of the ordinary. I quickly focused my eyes on this thing in disbelief myself. It floated slowly in front of us about roughly 1000 ft. away and about 150 feet off the ground. It appeared to be manuevering around trees and it would rise up into the lowering fog layer creating a glow in the fog. It would then drop back down towards the ground. At one point it came close in and I could clearly see that it was a three dimensional object for it had a shadow feature on the bottom and was more bright in the middle and less towards the edges. I got really excited and told my ""family member"" that we should follow it because it moved slow enough to be pursued. It eventually disappeared behind a hill and then my fellow occupant suddenly grabed me by the neck and very forcefully said in no uncertain terms,""Don't tell anyone we saw this thing!"" And then he just non-chalantly turned the car out onto the main road and drove off a! s if not hing ever happened. I was shocked by his reaction to witnessing this together. For I thought; aha...now lets hear him deny that there are things in this universe that cannot be explained! To this day he claims to have no recollection that we ever saw this thing together. He is either under some kind of spell or in deep denial. It was several months later that my memory of this experience hit me like a sledge hammer and It took me a while to realize It was not some kind of strange day dream. Part of my curiosity about him having such an agressive reaction to something from out of this world is that he is a very close personal friend to an influential congressman and a prominent businessman in the community. His fear would be based on their reputations in the community. So, I remained silent for many years. One strange thing did happen one evening over a card game with some friends and we got on the subject of UFO's and the like and I told my friends about this experience and Brian suddenly had this wierd look and he recollected a story from a close friend back in Indiana when he was in high school. His friend told him about seeing this exact same thing from a car parked on the side of a country road and it had landed in a recently mowed hay field. They apparently had a good look at it and were able to size it up based on these rolled up balls(bales) of hay. It was three times the size of one of the hay bales, and Brian's friends brother got out of the car and walked up to it and actually touched it! Later they found themselved in the car together and it was near morning. They claimed to have lost some time. When Brian's friend came to, his brother grabbed him by the neck and said those exact same words that my ""family member"" said to me in 1998! ""Don't tell anyone we saw this thing!"" Now this really blew me out of the water, because I had always wondered if I was simply loosing touch with reality over this experience. My friend Brian is a musician and business man as well and I have never heard him talk o! r discus s anything outside of this realm of existence. Strange, what is this thing? A probe?

I've always been scared to, but now I'm ready to learn more about it because I've lately been experiencing abnormal things in my adult life and want to explore further. I just don't know where to start and something tells me to start here. When I was about 11 or 12 I woke up from a deep sleep to go to the bathroom. My bedroom was in the front of the house with a big window facing the front yard. We lived outside of town in a housing development so it was pretty secluded but we had neighbors. As I was coming out of the bathroom across the hall, I could see a VERY bright light shining through my window and through my room out into the hallway. I remember walking very slowly, robotically, towards my room. I thought maybe there was a car in the driveway with their brights on and thats when I remember looking at the clock. It was 3:30 am. I neared the window and thats when I remember this heavy feeling come over me. I was totally frozen where I stood. This giant object was hovering over our front yard. We had a couple trees in the yard but it was somehow clearing them but the object was also kind of transparent. I could see the house across the street through the object. I remember it was triangular with curved corners, not pointy. Underneath, in each ""corner"", was one large light and in between each big light were straight lines of smaller lights. There was a small circle of lights in the very middle too on the bottom. I could also tell from my angle that the top of it was slightly elevated. Not a lot, just a little curve at the top. Like a VERY short pyramid but again, not pointed at the top but curved. I don't remember any colors or colored lights. No sound either. I remember thinking that was odd that this wasn't waking anyone else up and thats when I looked at the clock again and it was 3:30. I had been standing there for a half hour just staring at this thing. I don't remember it feeling ! like a h alf hour though. I snapped out of my trance and bolted for my parents room. My mom would not get up but I forced my dad out of bed to come look out my window. By the time we got to my window, it was gone. Since then, I have seen pictures in books of the EXACT thing I saw. I also have read where there were similar sightings around the same time in the midwest too. That made me feel not so crazy and I've just kind of let it go. I have never seen anything like this since nor have I told anyone outside my family. Who of course don't believe me. They only make fun of me.  I am almost 30 now and have recently been feeling strange ""vibes"" as I call them. Ever since I was little I sometimes knew when things would happen or could guess things about people. I always have chalked it up to just being lucky. My sister and her husband recently told us they were pregnant and I knew it was a boy almost as soon as they told us. I told my other sister that I know its a boy. She asked me how I knew. If our other sister had told me first and I said no, just that I knew. I don't know how I knew, I just did. Yesterday, she called me and said our other sister had told her about my ""vibe"" and asked how I knew that. I again explained that sometimes I just know things like that. I realize its a 50 50 chance, but I can't remember a time I've ever been wrong. What are the odds of that? Anyways, she did confirm that it is in fact a boy. This same sister has, in her childhood, had odd experiences too. She had a dream about a Christmas present that she hadn't received yet. The next day she got that exact same doll. Same name and clothing and everything. She also has an uncanny memory. She is the only other person in my family with unusual abilities that I know of. Its not like I'm psychic or anything. I don't see dead people or things like that. I can't explain it. I just know certain things. I have certain dreams of things that haven't happened yet. I just don't know what that means and want help figuring it out. I can't help but won! der if m y childhood ""sighting"" might have something to do with all of this. Its always been something I've wondered about. Anything you could do to help would be appreciated. Thanks for reading my story and hopefully believing it.

Those ""lights"" were far from us, above a dark hill next to my neighborhood not that high in the sky, exactly aligned to the front of my eyesight. I was puzzled and I asked my BF who was facing me to take a look and I asked him what it was. He took a quick look and told me those were helicopters. I quickly answered back: ""unless there are two helicopters next to each other just standing there...."" and then I noticed it couldn't be because there were 3 lights forming an obtuse triangle and helicopters just don't stop in the sky NEXT TO EACH OTHER. I wanted to believe my BF, so I said goodbye, came inside the house, closed all the windows (that my parents would always keep open) and went to bed shaking. I calmed myself down and fell asleep.  Next morning I called my best friend as I usually would do every morning and the first thing she says is: ""do you remember last night when you dropped me home and we saw the guy's cars outside but the guys were not there?"" Since my best friend was a quiet, smart girl the way she was trying to tell me something was wrong made me feel as scared as the night before. I asked her what happened. She said that when she went inside her house the guys (her brother and his friends) were inside, scared, and told her that minutes before they were out in the street as usual when they saw a round light standing there in the sky and then they saw smaller lights coming into the bigger light and then separating away. They went up to the roof of the house saw the lights for a couple of minutes and then the lights flew away. Then I believed what I saw was a UFO but I tried to supress the memory of it until now. FYI, I lived in the rural part of town, SouthWest of ""downtown"" Cabo Rojo and my friend lived East of the center of downtown Cabo Rojo, which is a 5 minute drive away.

I awoke in the middle of the night to the sounds of what sounded like fast whispering, my eyes were closed so I assumed I was swimming out of a dream and hearing dream stuff, so I opened my eyes.  I heard the whispering with my eyes open.  At this time I knew the thing was happening again. It is strange and hard to describe, but I will try. I have this overwhelming feeling of guilt or saddness, or some sort of PHYSICAL-emotion that is either overwhelming or bad.  Gravity feels stronger or muddy-like, and every thing I stare at grows, or my eyes had telescopic vision.  All I wanted was for this to go away as soon as possible.  I would therefore go to my mom's bed and lay with her, staring at everything growing with this terrible feeling inside and outside of me.  Words and crying didn't seem possible at these times, so the other witness, my mother, was unaware.  I think I  cried when I was younger. All these events I thought were personal until one night a caller on Coast to Coast named Brian described almost the exact same events happening to him when he was younger.  I almost cried.  I say telescopic vision, he said things grew when he stared at them (he specified his mom growing, so he was probably feeling the same thing too and went to her).  He also said he saw those two white theater face masks, you know, I think the one is laughing and one was crying, up in the corner kinda just there, and I freaked out because I had one of those in my house, or so I thought. I swear I have a memory of having them but thinking on it for four years now, I am positive we have never owned that. That is weird. I swear everything I wrote is the absolute TRUTH.  I even left out my speculations so you will not dismiss this odd one.  BTW, is there a name for this phenomena, I would Love to find out or talk to someone with similar things.

These lights were in the form of a giant flying wing. It appeared solid. I was driving north and increased my speed to intercept the appearant UFO. My speed reached 90 MPH to put the target on the collision course for me to pass under the appearent UFO to achieve a CPA ( Closest Point Of Approach). I ran out of road and was forced to pull over to the right of the road prior to CPA. After pulling over possibly a minute or so passed and I witnessed the following. The White Lights broke apart and formed a single trane of small aircraft which follwed one another in exact spacing and altitude so exact to land at Falcon Field in Mesa Arizona that I belive they were not under manual control but automated control. This airfield is close to Hughs Helicopter that makes the Apache Helicopter. Also Called McDonald Douglas. It is my personal belief from what I witnessed there has existed for some time an AutoPilot that can control the actions of a group of small aircraft and that is what many people are reporting as giant flying UFOs that look like a series of lights and give the impression of being a solid thing. The precision and accuracy of flying that I witnessed would seem almost impossible for individually piloted group of planes. Although I was able to Identify this Appearant UFO I think I would not have been able to if I had not actually witnessed the landing at Falcon Field In Mesa Arizona in the Early 1990s. I genuinely think they were under GROUP Automated Control and not Individual pilots. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I didn’t realize there was such a place to report my experience, so I am writing this now after sixteen years.  I have forgotten the exact date and time but will never forget the other details – the image and brilliance of this strange ball of light and the feeling that it was certainly not normal.  I was sitting on a couch chatting with my visiting father.  At the time I was 32 years old and my retired Naval officer father (I mention that because my father is not prone to frivolity) was about 54.  We have a 200 acre farm in rural West Virginia – very secluded and private.  The couch faced a wall of floor to ceiling windows overlooking a small mountain ridge and a pond.  All of a sudden an enormous ball of light appeared – there was no beam – the light was consistent for the entire size of the “ball.”  It looked like the sun but obviously a bit too close!  It was clearly moving but at a very slow and controlled speed.  It was not falling.  ” My father and I have related the experience to people every now and again and frequently people will ask it might have been a meteor.  We don’t think it was because of its slow controlled speed.  It passed out of sight after about 15 seconds.   I called the police – but felt they wouldn’t take us seriously.  I told the person who answered that I just felt like I should report it (I didn’t call it a UFO) in case they got other calls attesting to the same sighting.  Nothing ever came of it.

I am a 31 year old (male) from Tel-Aviv, Israel. I am reporting here about a story that I was a witness to. I have no intention to submit a hoax or a prank and I am willing to testify under a polygraph test these events I am going to describe really happened. I have not reported this story in my country because it was so public and obvious I felt there is no need for another testimonial. I hope this story will meet a more serious approach on this website. p/s one of my duties during my 3 year service in the Israeli army was in the  intelligence core and my job was to detect and recognize enemy planes.  I knew dozens of aircraft models by heart. Sighting`s description:  On summer 1996 (I think it was  august 5th but I might be wrong) half past midnight,  I was heading home from a friend’s house in my car, driving northwards on one of Tel Aviv’s main exists . As I was nearing a large main 4 lane intersection I noticed something funny ‘ there were about 50 cars facing my direction and some were scattered all over the junction on the opposite to traffic direction.  As I got near I saw a lot of people that just stopped their cars and got out, all of them, looking at the sky. I stopped the car with the engine on and did the same . What I saw (with dozens of spectators around me) can be described as a very bright ""sphere."" It was about the size of a big van, hovering in front of a medium sized apartment building (about 17 stories high). The object changed colors in an enormous speed, from blue to red from dark purple to Even what seemed like platinum and then back to the color of gold. It looked like it changed hundreds of colors at once. The object was totally silent, it was very close to the building yet it didn’t project or glow on it. The object was near the dark windows of the building yet it did not shine through them into the rooms. We stood there ""paralyzed"" about two minutes  and no one said a thing . Suddenly the object flew upwards in a direct angle towards the sky flying high above the building in less than a seconded (about 100 meter high) . Then the object turned brighter and flew east and disappeared beyond the buildings. At this point a few of the people shouted in fright and the others said loudly, ""Let`s chase it !"" Everybody got to their cars and started following the object. I rushed into my car and drove very fast to my friends house which was about 7 kilometers far from where I was. I got to my friends house and told both of them to please come with me to see something amazing. We rushed back to the junction , but it was quite empty already , we encountered A few people that stood there and they said, ""You are looking for the ufo?  It went south east."" We drove south east about 3 kilometers, and got to a bridge the is over looking Tel-Aviv `s main highway.  When we got to the bridge we noticed tons of people and TV cameras plus a few border control army jeeps with fire arms ready . North to the bridge, ""hanging"" about 50 meters above the highway`s traffic  , there was the object shining bright like a small sun (it didn’t change colors ) . I remember clearly standing near the army jeep with my friends and some soldiers were pointing their weapons towards the object and then a shout heard from the CO, ""Do not load, Do not shoot,"" and he remarked, ""What do want to start a war of the world right here?""  Then the object flew east in a blink of an eye. I have never seen anything move so fast. The object then made an impossible angle and flew upwards in a straight line until he was Looking like a very distant and small star. Then he just stood there not moving at all. We all kept looking at this ""star,"" something like 2 hours more trying not to lose sight.   After two hours or so.  This ""star"" became a red dot moved again in a straight line across the sky   And vanished. The next day there were only relatively small and brief headlines, and the army issued a statement saying this object was nothing but a kite that some kids attached a stick-light to.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,,

"Triangle UFO above Corning, NY.",Corning,NY,1994-07-23T01:00:00,triangle,0:05,"Occurred : 7/23/1994 01:00  (Entered as : 23/07/94 01:00) Reported: 6/23/2008 4:30:37 PM 16:30 Posted: 7/5/2008 Location: Corning, NY Shape: Triangle Duration:0:05",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64088.html,"Triangle UFO above Corning, NY. My friend and I were driving around late at night. We stopped for a moment on Spencer Hill Road to drink some soda, eat some snacks, and listen to music on his car stereo. He had a Honda Civic with a sunroof and I took a minute to look up at the sky which was clear with only a few clouds. I noticed a set of 3 lights in a triangle pattern hovering about a half mile or so above his car. The lights were plain white lights which did not blink. The object emitted no sound at all. I guessed its size to be no larger than 200 feet but admittedly it is hard to gauge size at night with no reference.  I told my friend to look up and he saw the lights too. We thought it was maybe an airplane but it was not moving and was too quiet. It also was too big to be a helicopter and we would have heard it if it was. We even turned the car off and turned the music off to confirm it made no noise. We got creeped out by the situation and decided to drive down the road. As we started driving the object began to follow the direction of the car. I could now clearly see that it was an opaque equilateral triangular object and the stars within the triangle were obscured. We drove faster and faster and the object continued to follow in the direction of the car. We finally got to the outskirts of the city of Corning and the late night fog began to obscure the sky.  When we were fully into the city we drove to my apartment. My friend was spooked out as well so he drove home. I was so terrified that I could not sleep and I kept looking up at the sky. Later that night there was a loud thunderstorm. We were scared by the encounter and we told a few friends who believed us. We spent the next week or so driving around late at night seeing if it would come back but it never did.  Weeks later my girlfriend at the time(who I am now married to) says that there were military helicopters flying low over the city as if they were looking for something. I never told her about the UFO sighting until after she told me about the helicopters.  ----------------- Please do not include this final part of my message if you put this report on your website: I have grown up around aircraft and helicopters since I was young. I am now an Aviation Structural Mechanic for the U.S. Navy. I have seen literally thousands of foreign and domestic military and civilian aircraft at day and during night. I have seen military aircraft at night with just formation lights on. I have seen confidential and secret aircraft operating at night as well. I have also worked at several military installations in the desert. I can say that the object which my friend and I saw late that night was no military or civilian aircraft. I wrote down my experience a long time ago but never reported it until this day. This message I am writing now is basically a transcription of what I wrote a long time ago.  After I told a friend about this sighting he said that there were triangle UFOs seen in Belgium. I looked up a photo of one of these UFOs and the one we saw is similar. The only difference is that the UFO we saw did not have a triangle in the middle. It only had triangle lights near the points.  I am reporting this UFO sighting for historical purposes. I hold a security clearance with the military and I do not want to have my name connected to anything which could hurt my clearance. I believe in UFOs and I believe that the job you are doing is worthy of merit. I do not have any other UFO sightings to report except this one. I am sorry it is not sensational, but I assure you it is truthful. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Three minutes from my house, above the Fish creek river, I noticed fuzzy white balls of light whirring around in a circle. Although they did not make a sound. Because of some low lying clouds the balls of light would illuminate the clouds as they passed through them. There location was up off my left shoulder. After five or so minutes I decide to drive on Route 32.  As I drove they moved along with me always above to my left and a little bit in front of me. The road was a winding road. All the while the lights stayed with me, moving with me and at the same time - they continued to circle in a clockwise direction. It became a kind of game as I wanted to see how fast they could go. I drove as fast as I could on this winding road; the fastest being around 78 miles per hour. They stayed right with the car. After eight or so minutes of driving I decided to stop again, The lights also stopped, continuing to circle. Five minutes later I proceeded down the road until I saw a person getting out of his car in his driveway. I pulled in and asked the man if he could see the lights.  He brushed me off and said there are sometimes airplane lights in the sky, but he did not see what I was seeing. He was irritated that I was intruding upon his space, and so I left, turning back in the direction I had come from. The lights hovered this time in above a large corn field. I stopped again to simply observe. I decided to wait and see what would happen. All of a sudden, three of the seven lights vanished.  I did not notice them leave. Then something very interesting happened.  The remaining four lights went into formation. Four lights circling into the center. The shape was that of a four leaf clover or mandalla. They circled in unison so that at the same time they were all at the most outer edge of their circle and then they all circled back into the middle. this went on for 4 or 5 minutes. They then went into a third formation. Each light moved to form a perfect diamond. The lights did not move. For a minute they remained this way and then all lights moved to the center of the diamond - creating one glowing ball of light. And then, as though someone would turn off a light switch, they vanished. I drove home to tell my partner. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Was about 7:30 pm and my brother and i were going into the local woods behind our apartment for whatever reason i dont remember. We played hide and seek in the early dark and such, but i vividly remember that night there being a dark colored helicopter in the field we usually play paintball. There was also two more things stuck partially in ground. Planes do not just get ""stuck"" in the ground. (i knew this because my father was a b-52 tail gunner and we spent a lot of time around planes and military bases)  We were just kids so we wanted a closer look at everything. We both told each other that we could never tell dad about this. We walked very slowly and sometimes crawled in the dark field and got about 20 meters from the helicopter which i now recognize as a russian hind. Very dark almost leather appearance to it. only one marking on the body read S^6 ( the chevron was the otherway around but in the same position, kind of like the military uses for friendly identification) There were about 8 men on the scene and it was weird because even though the helicopter was still ""idling"" we could hear them talk about logistics of getting ""them"" back to base. We almost ran away after a few minutes because we were afraid we would not be able to come up with an excuse for being out late, but then something strange happened. A glowing wand or something was used by one of the men to ignite or charge a small box type thing on the outside of the craft. It was then apparent they were connected and not just three diffent things. It began to rumble the ground like a deep bass sine wave would from a subwoofer or earthquake. It then became translucent and lost physical shape but the dirt still defined its outline somewhat. It was to the best of my childhood knowledge, the size of three small busses like the special kids rode to school in. Very angular and connected by bars of the same material as the craft in a diamond shape. It had a grayish appearance like an old winnebago, but then again it was dark so i d! ont know for sure. I remember crying with my brother because were more scared that we would be found as people walked away from the craft and toward the chopper. About three or four minutes had passed and we were locked onto each other while they people from the helicopter tried to raise the craft from the earth and get it airborne.(i assume) the rest is kind of hazy, but i do remember talking to some one after the craft had been hoisted or lifted off the ground. Some one said that nothing is more important than not tellng anyone ever-or something i don't really know. I don't remember ever going home or ever seeing my brother after that. of course i know where he is now but we don't talk. I'm not sure what the hell happened but i have a very good memory last i checked and whatever happened to us just isn't there. I did write everything down the next day in school and i hid it behind a piece of broken drywall in the basement of a library i used to go to.Ever sinnce then i cant remember ever going back there again. 12 years have gone by and for some strange reason i decided to visit the library and get a book for my studies opposed to getting the info from the web and it hit me. I had never returned to the basement. I did find the same piece of broken drywall however i did not find the paper i left as a kid. Someone knows and so it is not secret anymore. I wish to disclose what i know in hopes someone remembers seeing something in the field behind franklin knoll apartments in pottstown/stowe area. I have visited my neighbors and some remember just the rumble of ""cars"" or heavy machinery at about 8 o clock. I know what i saw and it wasn't normal. I can't believe that no one else saw anything as there were at least 20 apartments facing that field, and still are. I went to the field last week for shits and giggles but a grim reality set in as i approached the ""site"". there were electrical hazard signs for a local power tranformer all over the place. There is now a large grounding field for a power substation where it! all hap pened. But heres the catch. Theres no power. I am an aspiring electrical engineer. I saw no means of power transmission to this ""field"". It is just there. If it weren't for the damned barbed wire i would go further in and investigate but the fence is pretty seriously guarded by barbs and triple lock out devices common to the electrical trade. i have searched construction maps and electrical manuals far and wide but nothing was ""built"" in that area according to record. Then why is it there? I believe something weird happened not just in my memory. Go and look for yourself. Touch the fences and listen to the false hertzian waves generated by a loudspeaker within the electrical device inside the electrical looking breaker boxes and switching devices. It is all bullshit. The field had been plowed over and construction of the grounding field was made to cover up evidence im sure. feel free to breach the fence i assure you it is not charged like the signs say it is. I also assure you that all those boxes and wires have never had so much as a single volt passed through them, it's all fake. There is a nuclear power plant visible from limerick pa from the very spot. That power unbeknownst to locals is being sent to an electrical power grid for texas. Not to stowe. It is a half ass job if you ask me of covering my memory but i still remember it happening. Somebody is gonna fry when ""they"" read this.

Straight ahead of me- due east, were two bright red-orange lights just hanging suspended in the sky above and in front of me.  I thought they might be a reflection on my eyeglasses, so I removed them.  I was totally shocked and surprised by what I was seeing.  I put my glasses back on - the lights remained the same.  I could not make out a distinct shape because it was dark and the light was so bright.  They started to move very slowly and silently toward the southwest.  Two more sets of lights, identical in every way, joined the first set.  They took a position directly under the first set of lights.  Then a third set of lights did the exact same thing.  There were six sets of identical lights arranged in pairs- each under the other.  They all moved slowly and silently - there was no noise whatsoever - toward the southeast.  I went in the house to get a family member to see what I was seeing - we were both mesmerized by the lights and their intensity and their slow, silent movement through the sky.  I looked over to the North and saw one more light (I was up on a hill) which I thought, at first, was just something that was being launched, like a flare.  It was a single light that moved (glided) very quickly right next to the last set of lights. I kept trying to identify by some logic what the lights might be: hot air balloons, flares, etc, but nothing fit what I was seeing.  The lights continued to glide away toward the southeast and just immediately disappeared - they did not fade away - they just disappeared as if their lights went out.

I went outside to investigate. I noticed ten glowing lights resembling dim fireballs in the sky in an octagon formation with two or three in the middle of the octagon. I went inside to get my phone camera and when I got back out to the road to film, the glowing lights left their octagon formation and began to ascend in single-file into outer space.  I watched as all ten (could be more) faded away at what seemed to be very fast altitudes. It wasn't over just yet.  Suddenly there were 8 to ten more where the first ten had been in octagon formation. They moved into single-file and ascended into space as well.  There were many people on the highway stopping their vehicles to this spectacle. I could hear cars stopping and people talking about what they were experiencing. I heard one person say that they saw a glowing blue/green inside the orange/yellow fire of each light.  This sighting took place on Sunday, April 27 2008 at between 8:30 and 10 pm. There was a report of a man down at Keei beach (4 miles away) who saw the lights in an upside down question mark formation at sundown towards the mountains. That was sundown! that means the lights were in the sky for quite some time (half hour+). When I noticed the lights, they were towards the ocean, meaning the lights were between the main Mamalahoa hwy in Honaunau and the ocean- a 4-5 mile area.  There were two phases of lights. The first held formation, then ascended at approx 9:00, then 5 minutes later as second series of lights (from the horizon) ascended into  in the same place. I was pondering the altitude of the lights before they disappeared and 20,000 plus feet came to mind.  There were dozens of whitenesses. There will probably be more reports of this same sighting. I filmed for five minutes. The movie took does not do the sighting any justice because of extremely low resolution.

Peculiar ""flare"" of white light in the nighttime sky; not caused by an Iridium satellite. Two adult males were standing and admiring the clear night sky, identifying the constellations in the northern and western sky.  As one was looking at the Big Dipper, he suddenly noticed a very bright light, the approximate apparent size of a bright star, suddenly flare up at approximately zero degrees (true) azimuth, and at approximately 85 degrees angle of elevation above the horizontal plane.  The object was almost directly overhead of the observers' location.  The first observer quickly called the object to the attention of the other witness, who apparently already had observed it.  The first observer checked the time of the event with his cell telephone, and the time of the event was measured at 22:11 hrs. (Pacific Daylight Time).  He then stated to the second observer that the event probably had been caused by the reflection of sunlight from an Iridium satellite.  However, the first observer, who has witnessed dozens of Iridium ""flares,"" was surprised by the fact that the light appeared to be moving surprisingly slowly.  During the duration of the event (3-5 seconds), the object did not move more than from one quarter to one half degree of arc (estimated), much less than the typical angular velocity of a satellite in low Earth orbit.  When the first observer returned home, he checked the website, <www.heavens-above.com>, and was surprised by the fact that no ""flare"" from an Iridium was visible at 22:11 hrs. (local) on April 27.

The craft originated from the south west travelling north east. When it was due south of the circle, it vectored to its right, now heading south east. It travelled in this direction until obscured from sight by buildings and other ground clutter. During its turn to the south east, the craft appeared to bank much the way a conventional aircraft would.  Initially, I saw the craft from almost head on. It appeared to be a large aircraft with several landing lihghts (very bright, white lights, facing forward). During its turn and bank, I could see its underside. The ventral surface seemed to have a large white light at its tip, and two more aft of the nose. The second two were very far apart laterally, and appeared to be at the tail end of the craft, implying a delta or flying-wing shape. In the middle was another white light. There also appeared to be standard aviation anti-collision (strobe) lights about half way between the nose and tail, but no position (colored) lights, nor a red beacon.  I was standing outside, and the craft did not make any noise that I could hear over the sound of traffic.

It stopped in the sky in the clouds n got bright as the sun.  it was still dark out so it lit up the sky.  this was very frightening.  it looked like a black canopy with a hole cut in it with light on the other side.

I called my exgirlfriend who lives in philadelphia, n she said there were a bout 8 fighter jets in the sky up there, this was around 9a.m.  My dad called back and said there had been a newsflash of the reports.  The media said that the government shot off two missles off of an island off of virginia.  They made no mention of why, and made no other mention of it.  They blamed the smoke trail on the weather.

We were all aware that they would have the video game system we all wanted for xmas so we had to be in line before the store opened or we would not get it.  I showed up at 2:00 am and others arrived after that.   At 6:30 I happened to be looking south toward the city of Guelph.  I saw what I thought at first was someone setting off a firework or flare.  A reddish orange ball shot up from the ground leaving a smoke trail underneath it.  When it reached it's apex in the air, it moved slowly east and then west and back to the east in a circle.  There was also a smoke trail of a circle where this manoever had occured.  Then the object just blinked out and dissapeared.   I asked if anyone else in line had seen this and they all said yes.  There was many comments on how it was really weird.  There was no clouds in the sky that it could have gone behind or anything and like I said it did not shoot off in any direction it just dissapeared.   Someone mentioned that they wondered if it was some sort of a plane that was having a problem.  Someone else mentioned that they had heard there was solar flares occuring that day.   As all this commotion was going on the object suddenly appeared again exactly at the point where it had dissapeared.  This time though it was no longer red and orange it was a silvery colour.   The object had 2 red lights and a white light visible on it. Then a bright white light shot out of it.  Not towards the ground but out horizontally.   The light was brighter than any lights I have ever seen it was like a huge floodlight of some sort.  The light shone out from a single point but created a wide triangular like arc in the sky.   I then realised that I had my cellphone on me and I could take a picture of this object.  I fumbled getting out my cellphone to take a picture.  The object had now been visible this second time for approximately 30 seconds.  I snapped a picture of it and as soon as I snapped the picture about 1 second later it dissapeared again.  It did not shoot off real fast or anything, again it just dissapeared.  It left no smoke trail or anything showing which direction it went.  But the original smoke trail it left when it raised from the ground originally stayed visible for approximately 10 minutes.   None of us had ever seen anything like this before and none of us could explain away what it really was.  I do know one other person in line personally but I do not know who the other people are.   However when the store opened and we got our video game systems we all had to leave our name and phone number so Zellers does have a record of everyone who saw this event if you would like to research this further.

They were much closer to it than we were, in fact they were transferring golf clubs into another car in a parking lot when they saw what they described as a small round object launch extremely fast , as a rocket would launch, vertically.It than seemed to drop back towards them at which time it again rose very rapidly and than turned on a dime toward the west and quickly disappeared to the west.

I am currently engaged in a remarkable UFO experience. I live near the Kaneohe Marine Corps base located in Kaneohe, Hawaii, and I have been photographing UFO’s in the skies on a nearly daily basis since Dec 1, 2007. Today is Dec 22, and I have dozens of pictures of different shaped objects. Some are perfectly round, some are cylindrical, some are disk like, and one close up disk even appears to have antenna sticking out the top and bottom.  On occasion two objects appear in the sky at once, and the higher object is usually cylindrical.  In one image there are two white spheres an done black sphere. 	What is remarkable is that there are no visible objects to my naked eye. They only appear when I download my pictures. I have excellent vision and have been extremely careful to watch the skies as I am taking the pictures to insure that they are not bugs or birds or other visible flying objects. It is so intriguing that they resemble other people pictures I have seen on the subject. 	I began this project out of inquisitive fun. A friend and I went to an October 22 2007  Blue Angels show on base and he, being very well read about UFO’s, said we might get a picture of one if we took pictures of the skies around the show. I didn’t expect anything but a fun diversion, until one of his downloaded images contained a far off cylindrical object that I have since become very familiar with. 	I decided to make a project out of seeing if I could get similar results, and have been quite shocked with the experience. Having shot pictures of the skies all around, I am only getting these objects in a very specific area, but at different altitudes.  They are essentially hovering above what is known as Kalaheo hillside, to the west of some pretty complex towers that I have been told are military radar equipment. Maybe these objects are military in nature, but even this is profound. From the H3 Kaneohe look out they are most often directly above, and from my house in Kailua, they are above the ridge. Based on their relativity to the common cumulus clouds, I would say they most often sit right below them, roughly 2000 feet up. 	I am currently trying to convince others to join me in this project but have yet to have anyone join me in taking pictures or video. I think it’s remarkable that I can accurately predict capturing UFO’s on film. I would encourage anyone reading this to take pictures of this area and see what they get. 	I would like to add that early on in this project I had a very visceral dream that was very out the ordinary. I don’t know if its connected, but the entire dream was look down from very high in the sky at two air force planes refueling mid air. The whole dream was just my thoughts trying to orient the view, trying to figure out what I was looking at. Its very strange because I really have no interest in military things, and I was able to confirm the way the planes were aligned with a little research afterwards. .  Interestingly, there were no views looking down on the operation, like I was seeing, available. I had no references to how I was seeing this, no ship I was on, just a view. I don't know why or how I ""knew"" they were air force either. And in thinking about it, it really was a perfect way to “show me” something that I could understand, but not really create.

I estimate the object to have been at least ¼ of a mile away and about less than 1000 feet in the air. There is a Freeway located below in the path the object was moving. My guess is that this object was probably moving at about the same speed as the cars below which is 65 miles per hour. We looked at the object to where it looked like a small dot in the distance. The object then suddenly veered upwards and then we could no longer see it in the distance.  The color of the object looked like some type of burned chrome or dull alloy. It resembled a US Stealth Bomber, but without the wings(side view) and the color. In the background, we saw a large airplane heading to Los Angeles International Airport. The airplane was heading east to west and the object north to south. It crossed directly in the planes path, except it was about a few hundred feet lower.

I am now 24, and I have always had this hazy memory of seeing some strange goings on in the fields at the end of my street (Tanglewood Grove, on the Northway estate) when I was a kid during the early or mid 1990s.  I'm really not sure of the exact date, but I just found another report on this site dated as 1995 from the same town, and its not a big town, so I think it might well be related.  Basically I didnt see a UFO, but one night me and my slightly older sister were upstairs when we heard a noise from the fields at the end of our street.  We went into my parents' bedroom which afforded a view over the fields and we saw a helicopter landing.  Now, one of my passions has always been aviation, and even as a kid I could identify most aircraft.  For some reason I distinctly remember being convinced that it was a Mi-8 or Mi-17 transport helicopter of Russian manufacture.  I know that the helicopter was not camoflouged, and I think it was white and blue.   It landed in the field directly at the end of the street.  People definately got out of it, and there was some comotion.   After perhaps 10 minutes the helicopter left. There were no sirens or police cars around and the local police helicopter was very familiar to me, as was the local air ambulance, as they were based just a few miles away at what is now Wolverhamption Business Airport, and I saw them frequently, and it was not either of them.  The only other helicopter I saw regularly around there was a bright orange Bell 206 that was something to do with the National Grid.  Anyway, the point is that this helicopter that landed in the field that night was certainly not familiar to me, and was definitely not an Army Lynx or Gazelle, and definately not an RAF Puma, Chinook, or Wessex.  Despite not talking of the helicopter in the field for years, recently it cropped up in conversation and my sister (who still lives in the area) confirmed that she clearly remembered that night's goings on.  The next day there were several large crop circles in the field that the helicopter had landed in.  The crop circles were clearly visible from my house, and I remember that me and my friends did our best to investigate the surrounding woods that bordered the fields, but we were too scared to venture into the field.   We found nothing out of the ordinary.  From Sedgley Hall Park (which is on the hill going up to the town of Sedgley)  the circles were clearly visible.  It is interesting to note that the fields where the crop circles appeared that night, and where the helicopter landed and the men were seen is near to a reservoir (towards Penn, Wolverhampton); could it be the same reservoir mentioned in the other Sedgley sighting?  There are a couple of reservoirs in the Sedgley area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  Witness does not indicate what the time of the sighting was.

I noticed intense but unusual ground effects lighting all around us before I noticed what was causing it.  There were no clouds, it was a bright, sunny, blue sky, October afternoon with the sun shining to our right, casting long shadows in the sand. I had sat down on a swing for about 5 minutes, watching my son playing in the sand to my left, when all of a sudden I physically felt an extremely intense, powerful double shock wave that initially seemed strong enough to stop my heart momentarily from beating. When I looked around me, everything was lit up brilliantly in a strange light grey light, and then looked over at my son 7 feet away from me, I could clearly and obviously see that we were being intensely illuminated from directly above. When I looked over at my son, his own shadow below his body was razor sharp around him on the sand, but when I looked straight up in the sky, the two round objects were actually about 3-4 miles over to our right instead, which was confusing because the light they were emitting made it seem as if they were only 100 feet straight above us.  His bright red jacket appeared only grey, there was no color vision at the time of the sighting.  The light seemed brilliant grey, and actually eradicated all of the shadows eminating from the bright sunlight.  They were heading south to north, same speed, same line of movement, second one behind the first one about a mile or two behind, and were the same size each, circular in shape with about 7 concentric non-contacting rows of brilliant but separate and staggered, huge, stationary sparks underneath them, but coming out of the underside of the objects. The sparks were static and appeared photographic due to total non-movement, but with random, smaller bright shards of blue and red in each of the white and also each of the yellow sparks. The first, outer, ring of sparks was white, the second two smaller inner, concentric rings were yellowish in color, the next smaller ring was white and the next two were yellowish ag! ain in c olor, with the final, smallest ring being white sparks. But in the exact center of each object was a huge black circular discharge of downward facing uneven energy, like an enormous jet black spark, as was all of the other sparks, each facing downwards as well.  I could tell the black energy was larger because it was blocking out the few rows of sparks that were behind it.  The second, trailing object then zoomed quite rapidly up to the first one, as they each continued northbound, and then immediately bounced off of without ever hitting it in two or three tiny little loops to the right of it, then instantly approached it again, and once more seemed to be deflected somehow by the first one in 4-5 little swirling looping motions on the left side of the first object.   The first object remained perfectly stationary at both times.  Then the second object went all the way back to its original distance and position and once again approached the first object again, same speed, but this time, apparently making a smoother approach, because it went slowly under the first one, because the first one started disappearing as in a crescent shape above it, and then the top one dissappeared completely, apparently as it overlapped the second one now below it.  Due to their similar size, they now appeared as one object.  Then, after traveling another few miles towards the north, above to my left, they rapidly and suddenly flung apart from each other, the top one seemed to deflect to the right where I could still see the rings of sparks on the bottom of it and then the second one deflected to the left of it flipping almost on its side at an angle towards my direction because I could see the top of it, that it was covered in a greyish brownish material, soft looking, and it had no windows or doors and had a smooth dome shape directly in the middle of its center. When they both instantly flung apart from each other, they also instantly and abruptly stopped at the same exact time completely in mid-air.  At that instant, that ! they bot h stopped in mid-air for perhaps two seconds that I could tell, then they both, at the same precise instant, disappeared from view completely without any indication of speed, flight trails or even any apparent flight direction whatsoever.   I used to work in the financial accounting field, so paying attention to details was very important.  I also did not feel threatened or afraid at any time of the sightings even because of the strange light because they made no movements towards us, they simply seemed to be maneuvering in the sky, and the way they moved so effortlessly, made it seem to me as if they were floating on top of a solid surface, even though they were so high up in the sky.

I was looking from 49°57’44.42”N / 8°14’06.45”E from a 6-storey building into the skies from E towards W / WNW / NW between approx. 10:45 pm and 11:30 pm CEST; no clouds in my field of vision as indicated. I could see the (increasing) moon (W), the biggest and brightest of Leo (NNW), Saturn and Venus (NW) almost like on a 17-min directional line when considering the moon as clockface reference with regard to my point of observation (facing W).  On 06-20-07 I had missed seeing the Shuttle/ISS, yet solely because of the clouds that night. Today (06-21-07), for locating purposes, I used references: One being NASA TV with the live recording of the actual shuttle orbital position, the other (which for good reasons should have been at my geographical location instead, but no more available at ESA) as given by esa.heavens-above.com/esa/iss_step2.asp?lat= … Marseille&tz=CET because I found Marseille to be a place from where the Shuttle could still be seen around 11:09/11:10 pm CEST that night according to ESA. Given the good visibility of the moon and the other planets/stars indicated as well as their seemingly reasonable height over the horizon, I just hoped I could eventually tonight see the Shuttle/ISS just over the horizon, since I could reasonably figure out its course as shown on the “sky map” from ESA (for Marseille) being a course between the two ‘lines’ Moon-Leo-Saturn-Venus and the horizon when seen from my place of observation. In the end, I was wrong due to lack of experience, ESA was right (it was in the shadow and/or too far down under my horizon), and so I didn’t see what I had hoped for.  Instead, at approx.11:10 pm (+/- 3 minutes) CEST I saw all of a sudden a steady bright light close to the right side of the moon, as big as and a little brighter than Venus at that moment, moving to the right faster than a commercial airplane (for which I took it at first; too big, too bright, seemingly too far away, no blinking lights!) for close to 4 seconds until it suddenly disappeared (shadow?) and never turned up again. I had the impression it was going down in a slight right turn towards the earth (shadow?). Its direction in more detail was when seen from my position: From close to the right moon surface towards the right (first horizontally) in a slightly changing direction (downward curvature) from like on a 16-min to an 18-min course (with moon as clockface), in the end with a slight even more downward (20-min) course when it disappeared as if switched off. Its roughly general direction was like opposed, i.e. facing the flight direction (under an estimated 12 degree angle) of the Shuttle/ISS as expected by me from the ESA “star map” (which at exactly the same time must have been in that area (approx. over Malaga, Spain), yet lower than my horizon (I assume that’s why I didn’t see it). The so far unidentified object had the almost exact appearance of Venus by size and colour and was somewhat brighter than Venus was at that moment, it seemed to be ‘much closer’ in distance; no blinking lights, no re-appearance. The duration of its appearance was close to 4 seconds. In terms of ‘length’ of its course visible to me: It appeared out of the dark at little distance right of the moon’s right curvature (where I was staring at) to continue as a bright light for a distance that I would describe as being half of the distance I could recognize between Saturn and Venus from my position at that moment, with approx. 80% of its initial length in a 17-min directional mode, the rest directed more downward.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,,

At 12:45 we hadn’t heard the boom so we went into the restaurant and turned on CNN.  The shuttle had yet to land so we went back outside.  When we looked to the north we saw what appeared to be 3 very bright lights following a dark object.  We assumed that we were looking at escort planes following the shuttle.  For about 2 minutes the lights followed the dark object in a triangle formation.  Suddenly 3 more lights appeared.  Several seconds later 3 more lights appeared and so on.  At one point there were about 15 very bright lights in the sky.  Two other people walked over and watched in amazement as these lights moved.  Most of them were moving from north to south but some appeared to alter their course, moving east and west.  After several minutes all but 3 lights disappeared, as did the dark object.  One light stayed fixed in the same position while two others passed overhead (at what appeared to be a very high altitude).  We thought that maybe something terrible had happened to the shuttle and we were looking at pieces of debris. We rushed back inside to see that the shuttle had safely landed.  When we went back outside the lights were gone.  Possible Explanations:  1) The lights could have been shiny balloons.  However:  -Some of the lights changed direction moving west and east.  Most were moving southeast.  -It was a sunny day and these objects were very bright in the sky.  The two that passed overhead were still bright as they passed near the sun.  -Some appeared to be moving in a triangle formation.  They split apart then came back together.  -They did not appear to be rising nor losing their intensity over time.  -The lights did not flicker like balloons would as they rotate in the sky.  2) The lights could have been airplanes. However:  -They were all the same size the whole time we observed them.  Even the lights that went overhead appeared to be the same size as the ones further away.  -They did not move like airplanes.  One stayed completely stationary throughout the 10-15 minutes we watched them.  Some moved quickly, others slowly.  -Two groups of 3 appeared and disappeared in unison.  -They were not reflective like airplanes.  Other planes going to and from LAX flew by and would only reflect light for several seconds at a time.  The two strange lights that passed between us and the sun stayed illuminated the whole time.  All of them were much brighter than you would expect from normal airplane reflections.  3) It could have been debris/fuel/waste from the shuttle.  However:  -The lights did not fade over time like you would expect to see from debris burning up.  -They did not leave a trail.  -Some lights were moving quickly while the single one remained stationary.  Some also appeared to fly in formation.  There were four of us that witnessed the event.  The only rational explanation we could come up with is that they were shiny, helium filled balloons.  I’ve seen balloons in the sky before and, because of the reasons I outlined earlier, I truly don’t believe in this hypothesis.  It is also a very strange coincidence that this would have happened at the same time and place the shuttle would have been reentering the atmosphere.  Did anyone else see anything like this?",2007-08-07T00:00:00,33.83267537437604,-118.33263344425957

There was no wind and visibility was extreme clear. There were stars out in the background nothing in the sky that would obscure visibility. There were also a few dissapating Con Trails at higher altitudes. The best description I can offer is that it looked very much like the image I found depicted on the top of this page.  It was a ""V"" shaped set of low intensity lights with 1 at the point, and 4 or 5 on each leg of a symmetrical shaped ""V"". It disapeared after about 4 seconds which was not obscured by any ground objects or the horizon.  What confused me is that there was no sound, and that there was plenty of background light which would provide a view of the vehicle the lights were a part of, and there was nothing. It was simply a formation of low intensity lights, shaped in an angle that no aircraft (commercial or military) I know of.  For the record... I'm not a believer in extra terrestial life or aliens from another planet. I've also seen plenty of waterfowl formations at night and can assure you that idea has no merit in my opinion.

January 2007, Fayetteville NC  It was around 7:00pm. I was heading west to my parents house on Cliffdale Rd. I saw these two bright lights coming out of the clouds (storm clouds just hit the area.(no rain tho) The clouds were mid altitude to low, running fast west. Now at first I thought they were helicopters, because my parents live right next to Fort Bragg. And it’s totally normal to see them in the area. Now what caught my attention was the light as they came out of the clouds (it was kinda dark all around), I thought dam that’s cool to be flying and doing that(coming out of a storm like that). I saw them and lost them as I drove. They came out of the clouds and started to head down. Now when I turned into my parents housing area, as I was going down the road and I saw the lights again behind the houses (not right behind the houses) but I could see where they were still moving west and heading down. I pulled into my parents house and ran to the back yard. The lights were bright, very bright. Both the lights seem to be independent from each other but kept a tight formation. One light was a head of the other. As I watch them, they swooped down and started hugging the tree line real close, I mean right down in the tree line. I could see the lights thru the trees, its January and the trees had relatively no leaves on them. They where constantly changing altitude, up, up, up, down, up, down up..etc... Very quick tho. I had a clear line of sight on them, before hugging the tree line. The description of the light was as follow: bright white (dead center) to white/yellowish around its edges. The light was not glowing perfectly around the object but had spikes of lights around it but north, east and west the spikes of light where at there greatest, with a long tail down (kind of like in Christmas cards, how they draw the star of Bethlehem) The tail down was really weird, it sparkled half way down the tail, slightly wavy and sparkling. As I sat there watching them, I really could not focus on them because it was all light. But I did squint m! y eyes a nd I saw a hint of blue and yellow blinking light (only one time) coming from dead center of the object. They got closer and closer down into the tree line and keep moving west right into Fort Bragg. Now I thought of every thing that it could have been. I am a military brat, seen all types of aircraft daytime and nighttime. No way was it a helicopter. If it was they are very irresponsible for flying that low in that kind of weather. Also it moved up and down so fast and tight when hugging the tree line. The other thing that I thought it could be is a flare canister with a parachute that larger military aircraft release. But the wind was strong and they would of flow apart unless they were tied together, if so I didn’t see the chute, which I think I should have been seen easily with that large of a light source. And the light was so large that I think that the chute would have caught on fire. Also when they came out of the sky the were coming down at a constant rate and smoothly straighten out before hugging the tree line. The wind was to my back going west but I tried to see if I heard anything but the wind on my ears made that impossible. The light source is what made me think. If it was any type of aircraft the light source completely envelop the whole aircraft. Never seen anything like that. I looked all over the internet and read this whole website trying to validate what I saw. The only thing that I keep reading is that people see a star like object, but I wish people be a bit more detail....thus me writing a lot...PS When I say they flew into Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg is a big base, I don’t mean the main base were the housing area is and the PX/BX, mini mall is at. But there is a large area west of bragg that’s all impact area and they have drop zones there, field exercise area, etc., also I will be sending you a map as soon as i can get it done.

TOM SHEETS, FOR SHARING THIS CASE WITH NUFORC.   MUFONGA Investigation-Glowing Orb Flies Low Pass Over School Bus The following described event and investigation resulted from a Georgia citizen's report filed via MUFON's CMS.  On 05Feb07, MUFONGA received the CMS report from MUFON Hqs. and launched an inquiry.  The event occurred on 25Jan07 at about 6:45AM, and involved a witness living in Forsyth County Georgia (about 40 miles NNE of Atlanta).  This writer contacted the witness and found her to be a 45YOA mother and homemaker who wished for her identity to remain confidential for the time being.  For the purpose of this report, she will be referred to only as ""Monserrat"", as is her preference in this matter.  Witness was found to be well educated, articulate, seemed forthright, and had traveled and lived internationally during earlier periods in her life.  The witness' neighborhood is upscale suburban, the area also containing small pastures, horses, a few cattle, and MANY children.  She has resided therein for about 3+ years.  After the initial conversation with Monserrat, this writer assigned Jim Clifford, a HIGHLY experienced MUFONGA investigator, to visit the event site and conduct a ""sit-down"" with the witness. Jim interviewed the witness at her home on 9Feb07.  Event---- On 25Jan07, Monserrat was going about her early morning routine, getting her children ready for school and so forth.  At about 6:45AM, she walked them out to the bus stop which is only about 20 feet from her driveway.  Some other parents had driven to the bus stop and were sitting in their vehicles up and down the block.   She put her children safely aboard and turned to go back to the house.  At this time, the witness noticed what she initially THOUGHT was a ""tossed"" ball fly over the bus.  She reacted as most people do when something is tossed, a quick awareness and focus on what has been tossed.  She observed a SOFTBALL SIZED ORB, GLOWING MUCH LIKE AN EMBER FROM A FIRE, SILENTLY FLY OVER THE BUS ABOUT 10 FEET ABOVE THE VEHICLE'S ROOF. She stated that this ORB was gliding along at about 3/4's LESS VELOCITY than a regular tossed ball. It continued on toward a neighbor's home across the street, flew OVER the roof and on toward a wooded treeline behind.  During the progress of this slow flight, the ORB grew smaller and smaller, from SOFTBALL SIZE, to about TENNIS BALL SIZE until it VANISHED.  The witness was very surprised, and unfortunately, the other parents did not make the same observation due to sitting in their vehicles.  After returning to the house, the witness tried to go on with her normal morning chores, but found herself uncharacteristically fatigued.  She fell into bed and slept soundly for about 4  hours (this extended morning nap being TOTALLY out of character).  She was awakened by the sound of LOW FLYING HELICOPTERS, so low that she indicated the window panes were rattling.  Adding that this had NEVER happened before during their years in the neighborhood, saying there were no military or similar aviation facilities nearby.  Later that evening, at about 8:00PM, she was preparing for her children's next school day and happened to see a strange light outside and heard what sounded like a tractor in the rear......where no light and no tractor should be.  During this period she heard distant helicopter sounds, and then the low, window rattling fly-over again.  After contemplating all that had occurred, she felt that what she had observed was a living, organic, intelligent entity of some sort, and perhaps the government had also picked up on it.  During his visit to the scene, FI Clifford routinely checked the area and orb's flight path with an EM Field Tester and compass......no unusual readings were noted.   He found nothing else that could be related to the event.  Jim is a retired 20+ years veteran of the U.S. Navy and a communications specialist.  He later checked the various military authorities that might dispatch helo flights into the Forsyth area......no source for the helos was found.  The witness recounted her original statement at least three times during this investigation, once to this writer, once to Jim Clifford, and once to the MUFONGA metro staff at a meeting.......consistent throughout, credibility throughout.  Jim Clifford classified this event  as an ""Unknown"" in MUFON's CMS.

My wife and I were driving south on I-17, about 6 miles north of AZ Loop 101.  I noticed a formation of 4 or 5 bright lights in the sky to the south-west.  The lights were in what I would describe as a random pattern.  We decided to take an exit off the interstate so we could get a better look.  I ended up on a service road heading north.  As I looked for a place to turn around I looked in my outside review mirror and noticed that suddenly all of the lights were in a perfect line!  We went about a mile down the service road, turned around and pulled over to the side and watched for a while.  One thing that we noticed when the lights were in a random group as well as when they were in a straight line, is that one or two would fade out, then slowly ""fade"" back into view.  It was a clear night (CAVU).  After about 10-15 minutes, they all ""went out"" in no particular order.  Later, on the evening news, they were reported as flares, as high as 10,000 ft.  Which raises some questions: Why would they be dropping flares that high (flares are used to light the ground.  At 10,000 ft. they wouldn't do any good) and if they were dropped from a plane, how did they manage to drop the first group of flares in such a random manner?

It was about 15 degrees up in the sky, and it was brighter than any lights coming from the aircraft flying below it and infront of it.  It moved very slowely in the north direction at a very slow pace.  It moved about 10 to 15 degrees in 30 min moving north. Now as it was moving north it was what seem to be changing alttitudes.  It was Very bright, again much brighter than the large craft coming from the airport not far from where it was seen.  It had no flashing lights.  I have lived next to airports for most of my life, not including when I was a young child lived next to Miramar naval station in San-Diego CA for quite some time, and this thing I saw in my oppinion was not moving or acting like a normal aircraft.  I got a 10 to 15 min video of this light.  When the camera focused in on the light, it was flat on top and bottom, Rounded on both sides, and had a very perticular pattern to it. A pattern I cant even describe.  The two people that where there with me were flabergasted as well was I.

This is the second time it's happened to a friend of mine, his story:   He said he was walking home from the store during the Monday night snowstorm and as he approached his building, he noticed three women in high-school cheerleader mini-skirts walking silently behind him (he mentioned that they were silent because he said that he only heard his own footfall as it crunched into the snow). When he turned back around he noticed what he first thought to be alot of police cars. Then he said because of the size of it, maybe a large construction crew working on Lyndale Ave N.  As he climbed the steps of his building, he noticed that the women had lined up side-by-side, standing at the foot of the steps but were facing and staring at the ""construction sight"".   Everything was silent and this is when he said he got the sudden urge to run into the building.  He said he went straight to the Recreation Room because the window there gives you a direct sight to the street where the ""construction sight"" and the women were.   This is when he got a clear view of what he said was this huge object hovering over the street about tree level.  It was silent, black, or either a very dark color, and had a row of flashing, dancing, lights running along the bottom perimeter of it.  He said what was also astonding is that the object was about as large as a football field.  ' He also noticed that the street--which is usually busy--did not have ANY traffic at all.  (I was born and raised there too so I know this particular street and it is ALWAYS busy--just like a freeway.)  He said he then started running around inside the building to all his neighbor's, knocking on their doors trying to get someone to come and see the object--finally finding someone after approximately 15 minutes.  He said he told this person, ""Man, come and see this shit!""  But when they got to the window, the craft was gone.  He said the guy then asked him, ""What shit?"", and my friend said he told him, ""Man...NEVER MIND""  He saw this very same object back in 1979 while with a group of friends. That sighting lasted for about 10 minutes as a triangular-shaped object moved slowly in their field of vision from right to left.  I must say that these encounters are similar in that there is an eerie calm and that sometimes no-one seems to be around or is arousable when these experiences happen--obviously ""they"" set it up this way.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,44.98078334423014,-93.29330787839163

I left the research complex a bit early today and began walking to my car.  When I reached my car, I opened the door to get in, and I momentarily turned back toward the research buildings.  I saw a large object in the sky, and a quick comparison allowed me to estimate its altitude to be three times as high as the research building.  This was, of course, without knowing the ultimate size of the object, or the distance at which it appeared, so altitude was merely estimated.  My first thought was a helicopter, being on the campus of a university hospital, but there was no sound - absolutely no sound.  This caused me to look closer.  The object appeared to be quite large, larger than a helicopter, and spherical in shape.  Metallic silver best describes the color, with flashes of reddish-silver as the object caught the bright sunlight.  The object appeared to be hovering, slightly bobbing back, forth, up and down, as if it was a gigantic weightless balloon, tethered to the ground, accosted by the wind.  But the movements seemed different – as if they were defying gravity.  Up, then sideways, then quickly backward.  I’ve never seen any aircraft move that way.  Then, suddenly, the object shot upward and was nearly out of view within a few seconds.  I could still see the shining sunlight reflecting off of the object at its new altitude.  Suddenly, I was able to see a smaller, white object orbiting the object, which eventually shot off into the distance.  The object then ascended to an even higher altitude.  I sat down in my car, and rapidly opened my window.  The object was still visible.  I pulled out my phone and called my mother.  As she answered, I told her that I was seeing my first U.F.O. – and being a scientist, I wanted to rule out natural phenomena.  I mentioned the helicopter idea, but we both shot that down.  I mentioned an airplane – not likely.  A balloon?  It rose too quickly.  We couldn’t figure it out.  Then, as if on cue, a helicopter appeared from behind the hospital.  It passed through the general area where I had originally seen the unidentified object.  This was clearly a helicopter, it was smaller than the object, I could see the red and white paint, and I could make out the unmistakable sounds of the rotors.  It was a perfect controlled comparison.  Next, I was able to see a passenger airplane pass in the distance.  The shape, size, and sound were unmistakable.  Another perfect controlled comparison.  The object was still visible, a mere pinprick of bright light, moving slowly back and forth in the high atmosphere, reflecting sunlight every few seconds.  Suddenly, the object faded from view.  A few seconds later, I viewed a jet approaching the area where the object had been.  I could easily see the wings and shape of the aircraft, although I couldn’t make out the exact type.  The jet proceeded on its course then it disappeared on the horizon.  I waited a few more minutes, and the object appeared again.  Only for a few seconds, it quickly enlarged in size and then shrank off into the distance and disappeared for good.  It was 16:22 when I last saw the object.  I have no explanation for the events of this afternoon, although I can definitely say that the object was not a conventional aircraft.

We were well into the flight (2-4 hours) when I happened to look out of my window, even though I knew there was nothing to look at except clouds and the ocean.  It was broad daylight and we were flying above the clouds.  The jet I was on also had a large video display which showed our location on a map, and it showed nothing but water all around us (no land appearing on the display).  But what I saw when I looked out of the window took me by surprise.  There was something hovering at a medium distance away (not far, but near enough to get a decent look at), and at just a slightly lower altitude than the plane I was sitting on.  I could see it when I looked straight out of my window and down slightly.  What I saw looked like jet-black smoke, except that the smoke was in the shape of a ""V"" with curved sides and a rounded point... like a 2-D parabolic curve.  And the orientation of it was that the vertex of the parabola was pointing in the same direction as my jet was travelling (parallel with the jet), but it was also pointing slightly towards the jet.  Also, the dimensional plane containing this 2-D parabolic curve of smoke was parallel with the surface of the earth.  I am not sure how large the object actually was, but I can say from my reference point that it was roughly 2 inches long at arm's length.  The oddest thing about what I saw was that the black smoke looked to be flowing within this parabolic curve shape, but the smoke never left this shape!  And the motion of the hovering was the same approximate motion and speed of the wobble of a toy top when it just starts losing stabilty (as it slows down), except that the wobble motion and speed of what I was looking at stayed constant.  The parabolic curve shape itself wasn't spinning (it kept pointing in the same direction as described above), it just had a slow and steady wobbling motion to it.  I stared at it as long as I could, trying to figure out what it was.  How could smoke hold a constant shape and wobble like it was a solid object???  I did look around briefly to see if any other passengers near me were also looking at it, but I only saw people reading, watching TV on the small displays on the backs of the seats in front of them, or sleeping.  I was travelling alone and didn't know anybody to talk to about it anyways.  I also wanted to get up to access my stowed bag where I had a disposable camera, but I knew that by the time I got the camera and returned to my seat that the object would be either out of view or too small to take a good picture.  So I quickly looked back out the window to watch it and study it as much as I could.  As we travelled, it slowly drifted towards the rear of my jet and became smaller as we moved away from it, until I couldn't see it anymore from my window.  Looking back at this experience, it was most unfortunate that I didn't think to take note of our position -- the jet airliner also showed (along with the map) the latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, etc. of where we currently were.  Is there a way to find out who the pilots of this flight were, and contact them to ask them if they also saw it?  And can the same be done with the passengers of this flight???  I am 35 years old and I have a 4 year Bachelor's of Science degree in Electrical Engineering.  But I can't think of anything that I know of which could describe what I saw.  All that I know for sure is that I saw a black, smokey, parabola shape wobbling as a solid object, but I couldn't see anything else -- no vehicle!  Yet I was near enough to see the flowingness of the smoke.  And even though I was looking at it mostly from the side and slightly from above, watching it wobble gave me a good feel of its overall shape.  The only explanation that seems to make sense about what I saw is to imagine some kind of invisible triangular craft hovering there, with the black smoke eminating from the outer edge of the bottom of the craft as a result of its hovering mechanism.  Also, maybe the black smoke completely dissipates shortly after being produced.  This could explain why the smoke seemed to conform to a certain shape -- the shape of the craft producing it -- and why the entire parabola of smoke looked to move together as a single entity while the craft was wobbling...",2006-07-16T00:00:00,,

Moving point of light in vicinity of Wheaton/Glenmont Metro,Wheaton,MD,2007-10-16T06:55:00,light,<1minute,"Occurred : 10/16/2007 06:55  (Entered as : 10/16/07 06:55) Reported: 10/17/2007 9:11:11 AM 09:11 Posted: 11/28/2007 Location: Wheaton, MD Shape: Light Duration:<1minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59296.html,"Moving point of light in vicinity of Wheaton/Glenmont Metro I live near Cloverly, MD.   On 10/15 at around 6:47 A.M. I left the house to drive my husband to the Wheaton/Glenmont Metro Station.  I was traveling south on Layhill Road, and approaching Middlevale Lane, a side street on the left, when I noticed a bright point of light above the trees on my right side.  It was about the same size and magnitude as Venus, except it was in the southwest sky.  I saw that it was moving and wondered if it was a satellite, because it was a steady brightness and there were none of the navigation lights or beacons normally associated with an airliner. However, it didn’t behave like I would expect a satellite to.  The point of light moved slowly from left to right above the horizon, stopped, resumed moving and then stopped again.  Though I was very interested in watching it some more and looked as long as I dared, Layhill Road descends sharply into a basin at this point and I lost sight of it behind the trees.  I went on and left my husband at the Metro station, drove back, turned around at Bel Pre Road and retraced the route again, just for curiosity’s sake.  This time the light was gone, and the clock in the car now read 7:05. I hesitated to report this as a UFO, even though it struck me as really odd.  I know that out of the thousands of man-made objects orbiting Earth, occasionally one catches the light.  A little research turned up an Iridium flare in my area (Iridium 45), which would have been visible from that position at 6:43 AM at an azimuth of 165° (SSE), and an altitude of 40° from the horizon.  I have to consider that as a possible explanation, however, if I left home at 6:47, then I passed by later than the time of the flare, which only is visible for a few moments.  I have not found any other satellite passes that coincide with that date, time and location.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,,

Then I noticed two more identical flashing lights behind and off to the sides in a triangular shape. Now the first light was visible out the windshield of the vehicle.  I said something to my friend (the driver), and he craned his neck to look at the light.  As he noticed the strange light, it banked left across our path heading West.  He mentioned at this time that he saw four blinking lights in a huge trapezoid formation.  After a few seconds I also noticed the forth set of lights.  The objects (or object) was directly in front of us around a mile away and approximately 15,000 to 20,000 vertical feet.  As the lights moved to the West it stayed in perfect formation and appeared to be one huge object.  But I could not confirm this.  If this were one object, the shear size of it is mindblowing.  The lights slowly disappeared to our West obscured by Mt. McGee and the Eastern Sierra's.  The whole incident lasted around a minute and a half.

On the 31/03/2006 I was visiting Jumbles lakes Bolton with a friend, this was mainly to have a country walk and to do some birdwatching.  I have a very good pair of Carzeiss Jena 8x30 binoculars we had a good day seeing many birds.  At about 1-00pm I noticed initially two objects/lights very high in the sky and flying together  I looked at the two lights wondering what they could be. I did not see solid objects as such I can only say they were lights I can=t say what distance or how high up they were. They appeared to be very high in the sky. The first two lights did appear to be linked initially. One white to clear the other a pale aqua blue. The aqua blue light went brighter for a few second, then back to a pale light. I only recall that happening once. They were similar to stars.  As I looked I noticed more and more lights, I lost track of the first two.  I thought there was about twelve lights. I can=t be precise of the number. My friend and I jointly concluded there were about twelve. There could have been more, it was very cloudy. I could not determine if they were solid objects or not. We were looking at the lights for five minutes. The visibility was good and the weather conditions were reasonable to good. There were white bright clouds and a blue sky and a average wind.  The lights were moving in a North- east direction from South-west. The wind seemed to be in the same direction, they appeared to be travelling slow but not slowly, I couldn=t determine the speed. The lights were various pale colours clear, yellow, pink, silver and aqua blue, they were of similar size. They were definitely flying together but did not appear to be flying in any kind of  a formation, As I was looking for more after about five minutes there were four lights flying in a line but this was not a straight line.  All the lights were flying in the same direction but not linked. When my friend and I discussed this he said he thought Athey were connected@.  I did not get that impression. We discussed during the sighting the possibility of them being weather balloons. I don=t know what weather balloons look like so I can=t say that they were or were not. Jumbles lakes is close to Manchester Airport. Planes were circling to land all the time we were in the area. These lights appeared to be higher up than the planes but I don=t definitely know that.  I chose to look through binoculars for most of the five minutes although the lights could be seen without binoculars. I couldn=t scan the area very well due to all the clouds. Finally they disappeared behind clouds and we lost sight. During the sighting I could not identify any specific detail with the binoculars neither did I hear any noise they were too far away.  My friend and I discussed the sighting. He could not think what the lights could have been. I am at a loss for an explanation. They were not children=s balloons. Weather balloons ?

The pilot reported the ""meteor"" was at his elevation , in a level trajectory and very slow. Subsequently, several calls to the FAA  control center at Tri Cities  inquired about a burning aircraft. Minutes later, a witness (who knew nothing about the aircraft report) reported having observed a large dark cigar shaped object hovering  low over downtown Johnson City. She described the object as looking like a ""Vietnam helicopter""( we assume a Chinook) with no props. The object was observed for several minutes as the witness drove.  The object it's self was described as long, blunt , silent and having a white light on top and bottom with a larger light on the end which was hanging some 45 degrees lower toward the ground on this end.  The witness reported that the object ascended and moved off quickly to the southeast. Yet another  report came in from Carter County from a person listening to a scanner and heard a discussion regarding a "" unidentified flying object"", laughter and a request to discuss the subject by cell phone instead of radio. A request to the county 911 office for futher information could find no records regarding this ""ufo."" All of these events took place within a 20-30 minute  time frame which lead us to believe thay are possibly related.

It was hovering over the house on the next rural block. Silent! It was a clear wonderfull morning. The background was the mountains so it shown very clear. This area is well known for activity. It is not the first time I have witnessed activity, but, the most disturbing. This sounds strange, but it noticed me. I noticed it. I felt a bit of mental presure. Sounds crazy I know. I was not scared, just concerned. The object was there for at least 5 min. I had time to call my partner and tell him. At one point it looked as if it was heading my way. This is when I felt the mental presure. My partner yelled at me to get the camera. My dogs had been unusually quiet untill now. All 10 started to howl (I have an informal dog rescue and no we are not trashy people). This is the point it started to head west into the mountains slowly. I went to get the camera and by the time I got it running, the object was gone.  This is stranger. I started to get confused soon after this. I had to stop and center myself. I felt strange. I am a person who is never a victim of life, but I started to get confused and a bit forgetfull, like I wanted to, a bit of mental time slipage? I called my best friend. We talked. I felt fine. I then laid down for a nap with my dogs. I am o.k. I did not lose any time, but I did feel affected. I refuse to let them take me from the light.  In retrospect. I think it was doing something over there. Something happened or an exchange took place, something not very nice. My gut is never wrong. I went over to talk to the neighbors. They refused to talk to me. This is rural desert, so that behavior is not unexpected. This is an area next to Goat Mountain and Giant Rock. The Integratron is not far away and 29 Palms Base is right to the east. The unusual weather, paranormal, and sightings are not uncommon during the year I have been here. I have personally talked to people who have been ""abducted"" in this area. We also see a lot of orbs as of late. I have been told we will have a quake soon by oldtimers. But, that is an other story.  While I have the stage. I believe something big is going on. That is for sure. To all my friends out there. Hold yourself in the light (I am a Quaker). Center your self. I know people who have been very affected by events such as this and worse. This is our life, our world. Some call it prayer. Whatever, just empower your self. Do not be scared. Bad things are happening, also good too. You are not crazy. Do not be a victim. Best of luck.  Please forgive any grammer and spelling mistakes.  Thank you, DM",2006-10-30T00:00:00,34.3003,-116.45515

I was on my way home from work driving south on Somonauk Rd. just a mile south of Hinckley, IL.  An object in the sky just above my truck caught my eye. It was moving across the road from the west side of the road to the east and was almost directly above me. I slowed the truck down and rolled down the window to get a better look at it since I was passing directly below it. It was not very high in the sky, maybe 10 feet higher than the telephone poles and was a triangular shape.  It was moving relatively slow maybe 20 mph. At first glance it looked kind of like the top of a cell phone tower.  It had a very simple structural look to it.  It kind of looked like a silver and bronze metal “I” beam structure in the shape of a triangle.  There was a lot of structural frame work holding the center which was more solid and circular shaped. Each corner of the triangle had a smaller metal looking beam that came down a few feet but angled in towards the center of the object. I didn't notice any sounds or lights or smoke or anything.  It just was floating across the sky heading east above the corn fields.  I have no idea what it was; I have never seen anything like it.  I stayed and watched it move further away from me until I couldn't see it anymore.  As I started to drive on down the road I was kind of freaked out and I had this strange feeling that is hard to describe.  I guess I would describe it as a depression or a sadness that only lasted a few minutes.  It was very strange.  I have gone home from work  the same way the last few days and I have made a point at looking to see if I was just seeing some kind of optical allusion or something, but I can't find anything in that area that resembles what I saw that afternoon.

While driving through this rural countryside, Her husband (W2), saw something unusual off to the NE.  He pointed it out to W1 and they both began to observe more closely.   Observed was a strange object floating just above the pine trees on the right side of the road, barely moving.  W1 driving, slowed down to a crawl to time the object's road crossover to be just above them.  The object then came to a complete stop and hovered.  Due to curvy road conditions and driver safety, W1 moved slightly down to a dirt road.  W1 then turned the vehicle around and proceeded back.  As they now viewed the object on the left side, it began to reverse it's course (BACK-UP), returning in the same direction as it's initial approach.  W1 got to a nearby area to pull off and they watched as it slowly flew back to the NE, without turning around as any normal craft would have done (BACKING-UP). Witnesses watched until the object began to vanish in the distance, then took a route on some country roads where the terrain would allow an unobstructed view and make following the object easier.  The object had by this time vanished completely.  Further searching proved futile. W1 described the object as being DISC-LIKE, but having similar profile and a large mass sort of like a military Chinook helicopter (but larger) which is what they first considered upon seeing it.  However upon close scrutiny, there were no rotors, no sound, no wings, no windscreen, no landing gear, and no markings.  The fuselage appeared like DULL or tarnished steel, with a YELLOW-GREEN tint. Local authorities in the area have no information regarding similar events and likewise the regional airport. This writer, and John Bodin, ASD for south Georgia, and MUFON researcher Joye Pugh, will continue probing this matter.  Currently, local information was found that an UNIDENTIFIED resident of the OCILLA Georgia area may have recently encountered a HUGE unknown object that he thought was going to land on his home.  Efforts to locate this witness are underway, but have thus far been unsuccessful.  This may be an important witness since OCILLA is only about 20 miles to the WNW of Douglas i.e. the scene of the above described event.

It made no sound whatsoever.  I couldn't exactly makeout the shape of the craft at first, because it appeared that the entire sky was moving.  After watching in awe for a moment, i noticed that some of the ""stars"" were flashing like a dim strobelight.  A line of these lights extended down the center of the craft, and the outer edges appeared to have similar luminations but more widely spaced.

The situation was that it was getting fairly story outside, i was drifting off to sleep, and then all of a sudden there was a lightning flash, and the light from the lightning filled the room.  I could actually see with my eyes shut.  The more i tried to shut my eyes the more i could see.  What i saw was a type of staircase to heaven, seriously, up to a throne.  That lasted for about, well, i could have been meditating on it for minutes, i don't know, but it had a profund effect on me.  I never SAID at the time it was a UFO until the next morning when the prime TV network carried a story about UFO sightings in the area that night, and my sister confirming that she saw something in the sky that night. In the years since I have been ""contacted"" via specific dream events it seems, well, i have been tuned into something, something to do with flying crafts not of terrestrial origin, it seems. As a result, through the years, I have developed a theory of space-time (attached here as evidence of my initial exposure to something), derived from my awareness, and more to that, my sincere interest in a higher intelligence.

I glanced at it, thinking nothing abnormal...because it was next to the airport.  At first glance the shape seemed odd, but I wasn't really looking at it with my full attention. I was driving and it was off at an awkward angle. What I did notice, was it was going unusually slow and looked like a egg with about the same color and luster as a old pearl. It really caught my eye when it went from a sluggish pace to a very quick pace without any transition time. I would have stopped and looked, but I really was so surprised by it that I didn't even think to until I was out of the area.  Date and time are both guesses.

I was driving north on hart st. heading towards a park which is approximately a mile south of the intersection of hart st. and U.S. 30.  As I was approaching the park, the road does a very slight left turn and has a slight decline which allows you to see the tree line, I saw a black object which looked triangle shaped at first but as I got closer I could see that it was more diamond shaped.  IT was a very sunny day out and I was wearing my prescription sunglasses and I was driving a work car back to the office.  I saw this object litterally staring at me or so it seemed.  It was looking right at me and I just stared at it the entire time.  I think it noticed that I was able to see it and it started to slowly drift towards its left (my right).  It was hovering above the tree line and just turned into the trees where I lost sight of it because i was then underneath it and lost sight because of the roof of the vehicle.  The very split second I lost sight of that, something told me to make a quick scan at the park to see if anyone saw this.  Not a single person saw this object, they were all playing soccer and tennis.  I was just in total shock when I saw this.  I should have stopped and got out of the car but you never know how one would react in a certain situation.  I saw this object very close and upfront.  It was a solid black metallic object.  Whatever this thing was, it simply defied any law of gravity.  It hovered about the tree line and didnt rustle a single leaf.  It made no noise whatsoever.  There was no exhaust coming out of it like you see with any vehicle and was apparently invisible to everyone except me. After this happened, I was in total shock.  I didnt even tell anyone until the next day and of course nobody believed me.  I tried to examine and research for any possible explanation and came up with nothing.  I was scared to death to really even talk about this to anyone aside from my closest friends and then once i told them, I never mentioned it again until many years later.  I KNOW WHAT I SAW IS REAL.  I came up with only one logical solution and its far fetched at that.  The only reason i saw this object on that sunny day in june is because I wear prescription sunglasses and I believe that these sunglasses were able to bend the rays of light and allow me to see this object.  I know this is far fetched but my sunglasses have this reddish tint in them that makes certain colors look different.

One evening, we decided to go down to a pier near the water which seemed to be a popular destination.  When we arrived, there were many other people around the aream probably 100 other people or so.  We walked down the pier to the water and, as we neared the end, we suddenly saw a VERY large object (much larger than a football field  it seemed to cover the sky) moving very slowly at a low altitude.  In fact, it was so low and so large, I can remember flinching and ducking because I was afraid that it was going to strike the large suspension bridge to our left.  The object was completely silent - almost like a vaccum of no noise - and I did not see any type of trail or emission coming from it.  We both quickly looked around wondering if anyone else was witnessing what we saw, but no one else seemed to see it.  Every other person present was carrying on as if nothing were happening.  I can distinctly remember being extremely confused and somewhat frustrated that no one else was seeing what we saw.  That is where my memory ends.  The situation is the same for my friend.  This event transpired some eight years ago, and she and I have conversed about it several times since.  We cannot remember what happened to the object, where it went, how we got back to our car, or even how we got back to our hotel.  We woke up in our hotel the next morning and continued our trip Washington D.C..  We were both very confused and somewhat scared of the incident.  We laughed about it to a degree, as young people will do, but we have recently spoken of our concealed fear and confusion about the sudden loss of memory.  Neither my friend nor I had been drinking or taking illegal drugs on this trip or in any period of time immediately prior to or subsequent of it.  We are both college-educated, working professionals with families.  Both of our memories of the actual event are exactly alike.  We both saw an extremely large, black object with many small lights (or what appeared to be lights).  The object was so large that it covered most of the sky and it was flying at less than 300 feet (my best estimate).  It is difficult for me to state the exact shape of the object because it was so large.  However, it was rounded on the front end (the end that was moving toward the bridge), so I assumed it was either circular or oval in shape.  I was fearful of it for the brief period of time I saw it, but now, looking back, I’m very curious to know what it was and what happened to us after we witnessed it.

Having finished work at 16:30pm.  I walked to the Bus Stop at Woodside, Eastfield Industrial Estate.  It was a cold November night, very dark, but; the sky was clear. I sat down in the bus shelter, facing east.  I observed two glowing, white/spherical objects hovering a mile or so away.  They were at the same altitude, and then began to move toward one another; and appeared to intersect one another; before drifting apart and hovering a smaller distance apart.  There was no sound.  I departed on the bus moments later, so don't know what became of them. I thought they were perhaps Helicopters, but; I concluded it was too dangerous for them to move toward one another the way they did, perhaps they circled one another.

This first craft was in the shape of a v, it made absolutely no noise, which is what made me look twice. Usually you hear a loud noise with a plane. I watched it fly out of site; it was about the same speed as a plane I would guess. I stayed outside a while longer looking at the sky and about 1 min later I saw another one. This one was much different from the first. As with the first, it made absolutely no noise. This one was long and was thin compared to its length. It was huge. I stared at it as it crossed the sky and when it went over my head, I could see two very bright lights on the bottom, which almost seemed like they were pointing directly at me. This one went about the same speed as the first. One really odd thing about this second craft is that it almost seemed to move, kind of like a snake. I have no photos and so cannot prove this but I thought I would let you know. I will carry my camera with me always from now on!

At first I figured the object was just some type of plane going to land at a major airport about 30 miles away. The problem was that the object didn’t seem to heading in the direction of the airport. As the object passed, it didn’t strike me as any type of aircraft I had ever seen before. I couldn’t see the actual structure too clearly but the outline was noticeable. About 10 or so lights as bright as stars lined the craft to form the triangular shape. The strange thing was that there was absolutely no sound coming from the object. I am very familiar with human aircraft and there is no such craft of that shape that can fly so low and not make a sound. After watching the object for a few seconds, I looked down at my dog and when I looked back up, the object was completely gone. I waited outside another five minutes to kind of gather up what I had seen and to wait for any delayed sound, however a sound never came. I could also see and HEAR a commercial plane in the distance (about 5 miles away) after about five minutes after I had seen the UFO. The commercial plane was moving much slower than the UFO.

They had to be over Camelback Mountain (8 miles away), or maybe further west towards Glendale, it all depended on their altitude. They were in an area of the night sky that was void of stars, probably due to pollution. This is why I knew they did not belong there.  Upon further visual exploration of the scene, I noticed a third twinkling light at a lower altitude. The three would get brighter and move around a bit, but they would stay in the same general area. Sometimes they would dim to the point that they were impossible to see, only to brighten and twinkle once more. They did not move for nearly an hour, after which time tiredness dectated that I go to sleep.  Forty five minutes into watching these lights, or around 12:45, there was what I deemed to be an aircraft with a bright red flashing light, maybe a helicopter, that flew past all three of these objects. It should also be noted that these objects were present before I noticed them, and they probably lasted after I went to bed.

This is something I do quite often since I moved to Lake Tahoe.  As I was standing there on the beach I noticed a small very spherical object moving awkwardly around the clouds.  It looked metallic which is why I believe it was so shinny because the sunset was reflecting off the metallic surface.  Initially the brightness of the object caught my attention but then I realized that this object was moving much faster than a plane and in any direction without losing speed.  I watched this object for about a minute while I was trying to zoom my camera in close enough to get a good photo of it.  I managed to get one clear picture of the object.  I didn't see it leave the area.  I looked up from the LCD screen of my digital camera after I tried to take a picture of it and it was just gone.,2008-06-12T00:00:00,38.87074821428571,-120.00599821428571

The large round lighted mist is gone and now, A starburst! My friend and I had split up and were settling in for the moring deer hunt. He was probably a half mile from me and saw the entire happenings. As I had walked to my position where I was going to sit and wait for Whitetail deer (about 50 yards from a large wood line in a picked soybean field) I looked over at a beautiful red horizon where the sun was going to be rising soon, As I looked I saw what appeared to be jet contrails coming from almost directly from where the sun was about to rise. For a split second I didn't think a thing about it but just as quick I thought it was strangely low in the horizon to be contrails. Now the contrail seems to moving very fast and right at my frined and myself. Suddeny the contrails stopped and now I could see one very bright light. This light, now no longer producing contrails seemed to be at a very high rate of speed and was still heading right at us. the next thing that happend really shocked me. I continued to watch and suddenly the light stops. Not right over top of me but still out in front  of me and was now lower than at any other point. My guess would be 500 to 700 feet. Just as it stopped the single light seemed to begin growing. The light grew and it wasn't just light but a mist or fog seemd to growing within this ever expanding light. It still was not moving. In much less than 1 second, the misty light or large circle of light disappeared and once again it was just this single light hovering. Then in another split second the single light turned into a larger starburst light! Now the object is moving slowly to my left (North) But it may not have been moving directly left as it didn't get smaller in size or seem farther away as you would expect an oject to do as it moved along to my left. I thought it may have actually been moving to my left and slightly forward. I conituned to watch it and just then my phone, which is set on vibrate, begins to do so. I answered it and it was my buddy asking me if I was watching this too. I said of course. As we were talking about the events we just saw the light seemed to be fading away. But not really fading as if it was moving away and becoming faint. This was not the case at all. It was simply disappearing. It looked as if was slipping behind a curtain. It started to disappera on the Sunburst right side and continue to move towards that side until the whole thing was gone. Someone may think it was cloud it slipped behing. Nope....There wasn't a cloud in the sky on this beautiful Saturday morning. It was crystal clear with thousands of stars out. This thing just slipped away into thin air! My friend and I contued to discuss this for quite sometime before we started to think about actually hunting. I have always loved airplanes. I model them and go to airshows all over a three state area around Ohio. I am somewhat fimiliar with any aircraft, it's lighting and and it movement. This couldn't have been the movement of any aircraft I have ever seen. I think We certainly would've heard some prop or jet sounds. Not close of course, as even airliners that are very high in the sky can be heard at 7:00 am in the middle of a large area where there is nothing but crops and woods.

It was still mainly dark but dawn was just beginning and you could still see the stars and moon. The sky was almost completely clear with only the odd low wispy cloud. After maybe 30-45 seconds the object caught my attention as I was looking in an E.S.E. direction. It appeared to be quite large although it's hard to say how high and how far away it was- I will guesstimate it at 4 to 10 miles away and at an altitude from 6 to 12 thousand feet. The object was a general triangle shape however the ""front"" seemed to stick out slightly in a semi-circle protuberance. The closest thing I can compare it to is a badminton birdie that has been flattened and then had its back flared end cut straight across to form 3 straight sides but with the rounded rubber end sticking out at the front somewhat. The object was travelling downward at about a 55 degree angle very smoothly at a fairly slow speed- it almost seemed to float or slide through the sky. The object made no noise and seemed to be made of white light or was luminescent. It's colour was very close to the bright moon's although it seemed to be less substantial- as if there was no actual physical{steel,aluminum...} structure to it. - The light reflects off of the moon so you can see it but this thing seemed to consist of light itself. It retained its clear shape for about seven seconds with no contrail and then over about the last 3 seconds it sort of slowly, uniformly shimmered and faded out of the absolutely clear sky- it just disapearred out of thin air and I was left there literally with my jaw hanging open. I was in awe of it and was excited,stunned,bewildered,delighted and in disbelief all at the same time. After about 30 seconds had gone by and I was pretty sure it wasn't going to reappear I ran inside to check the exact time and try to process what I had just witnessed.

My friends and I we're standing outside our high school waiting for a school bus. I saw a white smokey trail come out of the southern horizon quite a distance away from us. I would have to guess on the order of several miles or more. At first I thought it was some type of rocket lifting off, the zig zagging of the trail indicated that. The trail abruptly cut off after a few minutes of rising. Then a minute or so later a second trail appeared going up in the same way about a thumb width away from the first trail. The second one rose much higher. I measured it with my hand on its side, it went up a little more than the width of my hand then vanished. A few seconds passed, and another trail appeared above the trail that had just cut off. I assumed it was the same object, but I could see a glowing bright light at the tip unlike in the previous trails. The sun was up above the horizon and to my left. The bright light flew to the west for a few seconds and then stopped and stood still. A large haze started to come from the object, spreading out to make a sphere of haze that was by my guess a mile wide. This haze stood in the air for at least five minutes after the light had vanished. The trails had not dispersed when I had gotten on the bus and stopped looking. I looked at a clock, it had been twenty minutes.  There were about six of us there who all saw it. Two adults and four teenagers including myself. Later when we got to a speech tournament, my coach had talked to a coach from Akron (a full 30 miles away from Canton) whose students had also described to her an identical event.

The color of the light was about that of a blue LED light that people use to decorate the hoods of their cars with.  It was deep, bright....almost neon.  It truely looked almost exactly like a LED light.  It could tell it was very far in the distance and high in the sky based on it's position relative to the horizon.  This thing was booking it.

However, I did see something in the sky this afternoon, which was unlike anything I've ever seen before.  I was putting Christmas lights up on my house today at around 2pm. I was on my ladder facing east when I noticed four silver dots in the sky. Initially I believed they were birds, as they were flying in an arrow type shape headed in a southerly direction. After about 20 seconds they doubled back and began to weave in different directions. They went up, down, sideways, made circles. This went on for about 1 minute, then they began to head south again, still weaving and bobbing. I have an American flag flying on a pole in front of my house, as the objects began to fly south again the flag obstructed my view. I jumped off my ladder and went around to get a better view, however they began to fly toward the sunlight and I lost them in the glare.  The strangdst part about this is that they stayed completely in synch with each other the entire time. When the first dot would bob and weave the others followed the EXACT path. They were all the same size, shape, and color. It reminded me of a ribbon on a stick. When you shake the stick and move the ribbon in the air, it follows the same path, it was very strange how these did the same thing. It was one of the strangest moments of my life.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,35.957344,-94.962552

On the westbound side of the highway there are two steel frame towers (communication towers I assume),right up near the road,that each have a light at the top that slowly flash like the lights on radio towers.I've seen these towers many times while driving through the area. So when we got another half mile or so down the road,I was surprised to see what at first looked like a third tower.Actually I assumed it was another tower because of the strobe/beacon that I saw flashing. As we got closer I noticed that the light was flashing much more quickly than the lights on the towers.(and,by the way,flashing about twice the speed of a normal aircraft strobe that can be seen in the sky on any given night.) I said to my wife,""What the hell is that?"" She only glanced at the light.(We were returning from the Erie,PA veterens hospital because her dad was there recovering from a collapsed lung...so she was thinking about her dad and not a light flashing along the expressway) As we got closer,still...almost beneath this thing,the strobe was obscured by the 'body' of the object.It was a very dark night with no moon.Whatever this thing was,it was as black as the sky.I couldnt really tell how big it was as it was invisible against the dark sky.No outline was visible at all. Now here is the thing that tells me this was not a stationary helicopter or something...and also the part that scared me. As we passed the object I kept looking up at it through my drivers side window. I saw a rectangular opening on the bottom of the object. The opening was about the size of a small car. I could see a grate or screen up inside there through which was visible a pulsing,glowing orange/red light which sort of looked like the pulsing glow of the hot coals at the base of a campfire. I've seen lots of helicopters and they all have lights and numbers on the bottom or say police or sheriff and have visible landing wheels or skids on them.I've never seen a helicopter a with pulsing,glowing rectangular opening on the bottom. By the way,the object was close up to the road...just over the tree line.The opening was about as high as the top of a 4 or 5 story building.We heard no sound as it was January and we had the car windows rolled up tight...and we were driving around 60 miles an hour. I have to admit that I began to panic a bit on the inside! My heart began to race as I realised I was looking at something very different than anything I had ever seen before in the sky! For some reason I had the feeling that whatever it was,it 'knew' I was looking at it...as if all the other cars that were going by didnt notice anything strange...as if I was the only one who noticed that this was NOT another communications tower! For a moment I feared this thing would come after us!My panic began to subside as we left the object further and further behind. I watched it in my side mirror and glanced over my shoulder at it as we continued down the road. It may have been an illusion,but I thought it looked like it moved back away from the road about 30 feet in an instant! ...like it moved in a wink! ...but it could have been an illusion because all I could see over my shoulder was the strobe blinking in the dark sky...and we were driving. As we rounded a bend and passed under a bridge I was not able to see the object any longer. My wife said it seemed weird but like I said she was preoccupied with thoughts of her elderly father we had just left back at the VA hospital. This whole thing happened in less than one minute as we drove along the highway.Just for the record,there were plenty of other cars driving in both directions...I'd say light to moderate traffic for the area...so others must have seen it.If anyone else thought it was strange I do not know.

I was the only person in the vicinity at the time. What follows is my best remembrance of the event. I saw a vertical disc shaped object (symmetrically rounded on both sides). It was smooth and dark colored and had dim lights on the rim. It seemed to be moving by rotating slowly like an upright wheel. It was almost totally silent although there seemed to be a very slight humming noise. It was very low in the air, seemingly only a few hundred yards above my head, and so I could see it's outline quite clearly although the object itself was very dark and only dimly lit. It appeared quite large to me although I had nothing to judge it's size against and I could not tell for certain how far above me it was. It came from the direction of the town of Clarion and and it eventually passed out of sight as it continued ENE over the woods (state game lands 74).

Dear Bud   I am a marine field service eng.  In the spring of 2001 I was driving to a service call from St. Catharines were I live on the St. Lawrence Seaway {Welland Canal} to Goderich on the shores of Lake Huron.  While traveling I received a phone call that the ship a salt carrier would be delayed so I decided to cut a cross county as it was a beautiful early morning, slight to moderate mist, sun breaking through and the leaves just starting to break out on the trees.  I was well below London Ontario traveling along a gravel road. On my right was a hedgerow, with a plowed field after and on my left broken woods. As I looked through the hedgerow into the plowed field I saw what seemed to be a flattened white egg about the size of my Aireostar van about ten feet off the ground.It was pacing me in an undulating motion and slowly traveling as well as forward laterally across the field toward me. As I looked at it I thought I saw Identifying marks as a small number near the rear but as it got closer I realized what I took for a number was actually black dirt mixed with water that had followed the contour of egg with the 40 mile an hour breeze as that was my speed. As it came closer it rose above the hedgerow and was on my blind corner at the right rear but I could see it if I bent my head low and looked out my side window. There was no noise only that of my van and what seemed to be rushing air.  The next thing I remember is still traveling down this mud gravel road but whatever this was had passed me and was rising over the hedgerow at the end of the field still a good quarter mile away. How did it get ahead of me without me remembering it pass me.I continued to my service call and repaired the ships radar returning home late that night.  I don't know what I saw but I can still see it in my minds eye. It was heading in the direction of London airport. This was what consoled me somewhat. I really have had no other problems but cant account how this got so far ahead of me as what I took to be so suddenly. I have only told my wife and my Dad now 84. I cant explain what I saw but felt I had to tell someone.  Everyone in the Canadian Great Lakes Shipping industry knows me as I have been installing and servicing marine navigation electronics and steering systems for 35 years, I didn't want to tarnish my image by mentioning this. Now I am retired I don't care..  What I saw did not fit my understanding of air dynamics,. no propeller, no wings. no identifying markings and no noise.

When we were driving back, and neared our home, at McGuire Air Force Base, we saw three, black, triangular shaped ufo's. Now, remember, all air traffic was shut down at that time.  So, we were confused to see aircraft flying so low and close to the road.  They were about 100 yards from the road, or less.  There were three aircraft, just above the tree line.  All three ufo's had round, very bright lights at all three points.  They were moving very slowly, and rotated circularly at the same time.  There was no noise being generated, it was completely quiet.  I pulled the car over, got out, walked around the car and into the field.  It was awesome, I was so happy to see them.  I wanted to run out into the field to get a better look, but my wife started panicing, telling me to get back in the car or she was going to leave without me, now I wish I would have.   A few days later we found out that the flight line at McGuire AFB was shut down at the same time we saw the ufo's, and F-16 fighters were sent out to investigate, freaky!  Talk about an awesome experience, great!  My wife and I both think it is obvious that they were observing what was going on, with the events of 911, and our sudden stop of daily routines.

The attached photos were taken from my 3rd floor balcony on 200 asa film with a 35mm reflex camera with a 28/70mm zoom on a tripod facing West with a shutter time of about 3-5 secs and the crane in the image is about 100-120 metres distant. The images come off a CD which was made with the development. The photos were taken between 11.20pm and midnight so when there is no lightning the sky is black black black, so I did not see anything when I took the photos. I have only removed some noise and the jpeg motif from these images in the way of retouching. (the set of retouched photos from that storm can be seen here  http://www.flickr.com/photos/9400459@N03/sets/72157600519687915   When looking for the points of interest look at the photos at 200% In 07 the point of interest is on the right hand side of the photo to the left of the balcony on the edge of the image. In 13 look to the right and above the crane weight. In 24 it's halfway between the crane tip and the top of the photo. In 32 look directly above the crane stand two thirds the distance from the crane to the top of the image. I think 07, 34 and 32 are clearest but they are small in all photos. I've ruled out a speck on the lens or mirror as a cause, because a roll of 36 exposure film was used in about 30-40 mins, the camera moved only once and one or two adjustments to the zoom and the specks appear in different places but not on every photo. If it were an emulsion spot it would appear as a splodge not a pixellated dot with the same pixel intensity as the rest of the photo. What do you think?

I had just ended the conversation and was getting ready to go inside when I looked up into the East/Southeast sky and noticed two stars.  In between the stars was what I thought was another brilliant star.  It was extremely bright, that is what caught my eye. I watched it for less than a minute and was getting ready to look down and come inside when ""it"" moved.  It was not a satellite, we see satellites out here all the time and this object was much larger and not has high as a satellite.  The bright object began moving a little north so I thought it was a jetliner coming in to land with its landing lights on.  (we are live along a jet highway in the sky and see many airplanes on a daily basis).  But then I realized if it was a jet it was too high to be coming in and the lights were nothing like I had very seen. The object then slowly started moving to the east/southeast.  I became very curious because I knew jetliners did not have ""landing lights"" on the back on the planes.  There were no flashing strobes to correctly identify it has an airplane either.  I also know airplanes don’t fly backwards.  I heard no rumble of engines as we normally do when an airplane is passing by.  Even when the plane is at it’s altitude of 30,000 to 40,000 feet we still here it fly over. I opened my back door and yelled for my husband to come look and tell me what it might be.  He was perplexed as I was.  He knows a lot about airplanes, civilian and military.  My two boys saw it as well.  We watched for about 30 seconds as the bright orb moved away from us and then all of a sudden it picked up speed and within a matter of five seconds or so it was out of our site.

The sun had already went down and it had just gotten completely dark.  I estimate it was around 7:00 to 8:00 PM.  I see a bright light through the trees tops across the street.  My husband is sitting across the room with his back to the wall.  He has no view of the window.  He sees that I see something and ask what it is.  I said I see a bright light and it must be a helicopter searching for something.  My house faces east and the light was comeing from the east going west.  I go outside to get a better look and a few seconds later I am followed by my husband.  I told my husband that it is not a helicopter cause there is no noise.  Soon we could see the lights where the wings are suppose to be.  There was one on each side.  One was blue and the other is red.  I don't remeber which side one or the other was on.  The white light, which was in the middle and out front, outshone them by about 5X.  I assumed the white light was landing lights.  We started to hear a low roar from the engine.  It passed right over the top of our heads and just a little to the north.  I should of been able to see the landing gear and the noise from the engine should of deafen us.  This was not the case.  It was too quite and I couldn't see the plane.  I couldn't even make out the outline.  My husband made the comment that this is strange.  Viewing it from the rear the two lights on the side changed to one white and the other red.  I ran into the house to get the binoculars and out the back door, but it had already cleared the trees in the back.  My husband and myself are both ex military.  We know what planes and helicopters sound like.  We can tell the difference in the helicopters by their sound.  We don't have to see them.  I am also retired from the FAA.  We live east of an Airforce base.  There is a flight path behind our house going south to north.  This is the training path of the Airforce.  There is also a National Guard helicopter base to the south of us.  Their path is east to west south of our house.  The also sometimes go west to east on their return trip, but not all the time.  I looked on the internet for information on the stealth plane.  Even though there is quite a bit of information about them it doesn't say that they are quite.

I was a ((deleted--electronics)), and rode Trident class submarines, as well as teaching ((deleted--electronic)) operation and maintenance, and training instructor candidates to be instructors.  I have had a year in college of: engineering physics, calculus, and English, almost a year of biology, nearly two years of chemistry.  I have no college degree.  After ((deleted--near 20)) years in the Navy, I worked designing, writing, and delivering custom training, as well as did presentation coaching, in Atlanta, GA, for 4 years before the economy went south, and I was laid off.   I now work for PNM, Albuquerque’s power and gas company, as an accounting technician.  My brother teaches at a Christian elementary school in Albuquerque, has taught there for 10 years.  He put 4 years in the USN, as a Boiler Technician, in the surface fleet.  We are both Christians.  I am open to there being life on other planets, and I believe UFO sightings are real, especially now!  He is much more closed to both UFOs and alien life, believing there is probably a ""logical"" explanation in most cases of sightings.  I go out back every night at my brother’s house where I live, here in Albuquerque, NM, and have a cigar before retiring for the evening.  I did so on February 10, 2007, at about 8:45 p.m.  As I am smoking, I look up at the constellation Orion and at other stars and constellations.  On this evening, I was looking south and slightly west at Orion in the dark, clear, cloudless night sky, when I saw movement to my left out of the corner of my eye.  I turned my eyes to the southeast, and saw what looked like a ""vee"" formation coming from the southeast, on a northwest heading.  The vee consisted of 7 objects, each roughly the shape of a B-1 bomber, only, by my estimation, a little longer from nose to ""tail.""  They were all the same color, sort of a pale yellow/tannish/gold color, and glowing softly, (it crossed my mind) almost as if lit by lights from the city, but way too bright for that (even if we had enough ""city lights"" in our residential area to provide that kind of illumination) on a dark night.  Each object appeared to have a distinct thin black outline around the glowing colored area.  I say each object, because I distinctly saw dark sky between each of them.  In the approximate minute to minute and a half that I viewed them moving toward me and then close to directly overhead, the vee shifted twice to sort of a ""lambda"" shape (Greek letter).  (Take one leg of the vee, and move the head of it down to the mid point of the other leg.)  The leg of the vee that moved was the leg nearest me, on the west side of the formation.  I yelled for my brother several times, finally got his attention by sticking my head in the door for a second and yelling, then moved back to watch the formation again, as he came rushing out.  He could just make out the formation by that time, fading into the northwest night sky, which was lighter, looking in that direction.  By this time, the glowing color of the objects contrasted against the lighter blue sky was darker, sort of an orange/yellow.  No movement or change in shape was made by each individual object (i.e. no wings flapping)--objects simply shifted in formation, and moved in one direction, and, they were completely silent.  I really cannot gauge the altitude at which they were, but, looking back, had I held up my pinky finger, at arms length, the nail would have, I am pretty certain, completely covered one of the objects.  Related information:  my mother told me the next evening, that she had heard that day, a short blurb on local news regarding sightings of what I had seen the previous night.  The official story, apparently, was that there had been an Air Force exercise of some sort, planes supposedly from Kirtland Air Force Base, which is here in Albuquerque.  (We have either B-1 or B-2 bombers, here, not sure which.)  If this was an actual exercise:  1)	Why/how were our Air Force’s planes/jets GLOWING??  (What possible purpose could the capability to glow serve for a war plane, one that is bent on avoiding detection to begin with?) 2)	The direction from which they came is not the direction they would have come from, if they had originated from Kirtland AFB, which is southwest from my sighting position, unless they had taken off, made a wide circle, and then come from over or around the Sandia Mountains, which are to the east.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

From my window seat at the right side of the plane, I observed an object to the north, not much lower than my airplane. Object was within 1,000 feet or maybe less by my estimate, & was large enough to be seen clearly. It had a metallic orange color, and was a rounded, triangular shaped solid object.  Its appearance reminded me of a kite or a top, although thicker in proportion than a kite & similar to the helium balloons at the supermarket. Although it was observed in a very bright sky, there was not a shiny metallic reflection, and no visible seams, markings, windows, edges or lights. It was positioned vertically, as if it was standing on end, and did not have a horizontal (flat) flight appearance.  Speed and direction could not be estimated visually with any certainty or accuracy, given the effect of the airliner’s flight speed on perception of movement outside the plane. However, I had the sense that it was flying east, which was opposite the direction of my flight.  At that relatively close distance it was only visible for perhaps 2 or 3 seconds, before the wing obscured further viewing of the object.  My first reaction was that I thought I was seeing a near miss. Not dangerously so, but too close to be within normal tolerances. It definitely was not any kind of airplane, and if that was a weather balloon, it sure seemed like it was too close to our plane for safety!  I wonder if the cockpit radar registered this object?   As far as my background, I am a 46 year old male self employed in real estate consulting. I was not drinking or hallucinating, and have no history of delusional perceptions or behavior. While I can't verify the object was extra-terrestrial, my observations were clearly identifed to the best of my ability, & it is fairly classified as an unidentified flying object.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,,

It was still early since I figured it would maybe happen, a sighting I mean, at about 3 am the witching hour.  Well to my surprise I was laying there playing guitar for about an hour straight, all alone laying on my back looking up at the almost full moon.  Well the moon was sort of in the west at this point but I sat up and put my guitar down and I saw three oval shaped craft with no light's flying in formation from south to north towards the old downtown airport. The ships looked maybe brown but really stood out, against the clear night sky about 300 or so feet above me.  They flew in such a way that it looked like one craft, and there was a jitter effect on one of the oval shaped craft like tracer but they were not moving that fast maybe 100 to 200 miles an hour.   The sighting lasted about 10 to 15 seconds enough time for me to blink a couple of times. I found it strange because to start the night of I looked at the sky and said in my head LIVE  TO LOVE AND LOVE TO LIVE LIFE which is my sort of meditation words, and as soon as I was done playing guitar they flow over, it scared the shit out of me I called my dad and he instructed me to get off the roof so I did but remained at my roof hatch for the rest of the night with camera in hand but I was to late.  I am going to make it a point to be up there every night till I get footage.

Thank you for doing this the world needs to wake up and see what has been hidden, I was thinking about my statistic's class in collage which I went to but It was art collage, any way the chances of me catching eye of a UFO on my first night and the fact that they flow over me very low to the ground lower then a normal helicopter even it seemed, are almost impossible.

While standing in formation (I) we observed a dish shaped object approaching from the west, white in color,( that could have been due to the altitude and the reflection of the rising sun giving it that color) and you could tell it was spinning because what appeared to be flames were coming off of it. The object stopped very suddenly and began to hover.  You could tell that the object was spinning and leaving what you could say was a vapor trail.  The object moved at great speed and would stop abruptly and change direction. The entire platoon witnessed this object for about 10 minutes.

We had heard on the news several reports of strange  objects being seen in other areas of the Texas panhandle around the same period of time.

A sudden high wind outside attracted my attention. Thinking it was a storm that had blown in I looked outside as tornados were known to strike the Ohio valley. The time was twilight and early fall in the year 1958. The leaves were still on the trees. I looked out the back window which afforded a view from 90 degrees up to 30 degrees to the next hill which was 600 feet away. The trees were being blown downward. Our house was located just over a hill on Ray street in Ashland, Kentucky. A sustained downdraft was something that I had never seen. Prior to this event the air had been still. It wasn't cold enough for a fire. Looking up I saw the leading edge of a near object. By near I mean that there was no way to determine just how high except that it was close to the ground. As a minimum it had to be higher than the average terrain. Three hundred feet might be a good estimate. The direction of motion was north to south. The leading edge was a wide curve, the left edge did not block the horizon. It was only lit from above since it was twilight so the details on the underside could not be seen. Being a child at the time I yelled for my mother. She saw the receding edge of the object. It simply passed over at a constant speed. The axis of motion was east by at least 500 feet. The trailing edge going out of sight It had a thickness but that was seen only for an instant as the viewing angle decreased. Wind was not blowing in my face as I did not have to squint nor was wind blowing into the window. So how could you have a noise of wind without me being in the blast? On the passage of the object all wind effects ceased. Here is what was missing, no turbine whine, no motor noise, no fuel smell, no nothing. Silent and dark except for the trees being lashed downward. However the force downward was not sufficient to break off the limbs which sets the maximum force to less than that necessary to break off mature poplar tree limbs. That was about the weakest trees there other than apple perhaps. So from ! the heig ht and transit information and a good guess that it was 300 yards across you should be able to decide on a weight of the object since it was balanced by a constant downward force. I didn't notice any change in the downward force from edge to edge. Normal force from propulsion is concentrated at the center falling off to the edges. Or it is high at the edge and still in the center riding on a bubble o higher air pressure.I feel like someone who has seen something but can only say canoe in the sky. Not enough information. An object like that was part of the air force experiments at that time and Wright Patterson AFB is nearby. However circular aircraft were not that big. It is not possible to move that much air and not have some kind of audible infrasound. That was fifty years ago. My mothers story changed with time. My brother and his friends said they saw three moving back and forth over the Ohio river moving east. I really didn't believe him at the time. He didn't mention his experience until we told the beginning of ours. My memory is accurate from that time. What has faded a little are the visual memories. Conclusions? You can't say what it was. Only that it was. You can't extrapolate the origin. Consider a bright flash in the sky that rivals the sun. What could it be? An exploding meteor, a collapsing magnetic star, an unknown massive high energy particle, a tiny black hole, something we might not understand for hundreds of years, a blood vessel pressing on nerves in the eye. It is not always an explanation that fits our experience. What did we see in 1958? An object that changed position with time. An object that was opaque and had mass. An object that balanced its mass with a uniform downward force. The downward force ended rapidly with the passage of the object and that the ending of the downward force was not abrupt. The object was close enough that the entire object was never seen in its entirity. The front edge had passed from view before the back passed from view. I wish there was more. It is only by comparison with future discoveries that might give meaning to the event. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was some time in 1959.  I can't verify the date.  I was 5 and hadn't started school yet.  My family lived in Miami (our address was considered to be Opa Locka) but I would attend school the next year in Carol City.  We lived a short distance from the Opa Locka airport (then, a military airport).  Our home was not near anything but rock pits and cow pastures.  We lived on 1/2 acre lot.  Some time, in the middle of the night, I woke up.  I saw the cat was inside and followed her through the house.  She wanted to go outside, so I opened the door and I followed her outside.  I walked into our backyard and saw at the back corner of our yard a large dark sphere.  Curious, I went closer to see what it was.  The object sitting in our yard was about 40' in diameter and faceted - like a disco ball.  The facets were small and bevelled, but clear - like glass.  There was a lot of moonlight, so I could see the color of the glass appeared to be bronze.  There was no light emanating from it, but it looked like whatever was in it could have seen out the glass.  I became afraid thinking that a door might open (and maybe it did - because I have a vague memory of seeing a black ramp extend from the lower fourth of it) and ran back inside the house and locked the door.  (Back then we NEVER locked a door.)  The next morning, my mother asked me what I was doing up.  (I think my return to the house and slamming the door woke her up.)  I told her I was letting the cat out of the house.  She thought I was sleepwalking, she said the cat wasn't left in the prior night.  I can't remember if I told her what I saw in the back yard.  If I did, that too was probably written off as ""sleepwalking.""  I may talk in my sleep, but I have not had any other experience with sleepwalking.  After this incident, I began having a recurring nightmare about being abducted by people who looked like my parents, but weren't.  I would be in the back seat of the car riding along with my parents, when I would realize they were different, not my parents.  I would jump out of the moving car and run back to my grandparents' home.  When I would get there, my parents would be there.  But, I could tell they weren't my parents either.  This recurring nightmare went on for about two years before subsiding.  I am 53, female, have a slightly above-average IQ, and that's it.  I have often wondered if there's a relationship between the nightmare and the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

She lived with her mom and sister in northeast Portland. My cousin's sister suddenly called out to us that she saw a flying saucer across the street, hovering over the park.  We, of course, didn't believe her - it was just too coincidental that we were watching Science Fiction Theatre at the same time!  Then, her mom, my aunt, said it was true, come and see it!  We flew up the stairs and went out the front door of the house.  By the time we got up stairs, the object seemed to be hovering over the ""Hollywood"" district in east Portland, about a mile south of where we were.  As it hovered, we could see a bank of greenish lights, followed by a bank of whiteish lights (about the same color as regular light bulbs).  From the rotation of the lights, we could see that the object was hovering, while turning clockwise.  After about 10 minutes, it moved to the east and then to the north, where we guessed it was near the Portland Airport.  We called the airport to find out if anyone in the tower could see it on their radar.  The answer we received was that it was a ""plane, flying a banner behind it"".  This obviously did not make sense, since it was 11:00 pm.  In addition my cousin's sister called her mother-in-law to be when she guessed it was over her mother-in-law's house and the report was that the object was ""as big as a house"", round, and didn't make any noise whatsoever.  The only sound was a ""whoosh"" as it sped by.  This has always stuck in my mind, since our technology did not extend, specifically, to soundless, round objects that could hover.

It appeared to have no wings and was cigar shaped, silvery white in color, and moved slowly across the sky.  This was not a narrow cigar shape, but more like a blimp. We watched it for several minutes as it moved on a westward heading (towards Spokane Washington).  It traveled at a speed close to that of a small single engine airplane, maybe a bit slower.  I cannot be certain that it had no wings, but that is how it appeared to both my wife and I.  It definitely made no sound, and that’s why I am reporting it.   I’m skeptical of alien spaceships, but I cannot explain this craft’s silence.  Visibility was perfect, as the sun was high and the air clear, and we were hiking in the hills above the valley.  If it had an engine, we should have heard it clearly.  There was no con-trail or visible markings or lights of any sort.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,47.20100000000001,-116.55209999999998

The plan was to take a couple of pictures every 15 minutes or so.  I went to my backyard prior to the start of the eclipse to take the first pictures.  A beautiful full moon on a clear night.  After the first shot I noticed a blue spehere directly below the moon in the camera screen.  (Looking at a clock, it would have been at the six).  Thinking that is was from the camera, I changed the setting and took another picture.  It seemed ok.  Last night I developed the pictures. The first picture had the sphere at six, to the left of the  moon (at the 9 postion) is what appears to be a chain of gold/metallic spheres linked together and curved.  There are what appear to be additional gold/metallic spheres on the roof the house behind mine.  To the right at roof line is a very large bright light in what appears to be a street light. In the second picture the blue sphere is at the 5 position.  The chain of spheres is below and behind the blue sphere, again at the 5 position.  It now looks straight.  The spheres on  the roof have moved to the right.  The street light has moved from the right of a tree or roof  toward the left so that it is now in the middle of that.  It looks more like street light in this second picture. After I took the second picture I went into the house and fell asleep. I have seen some strange things in the past in the sky in Petaluma and San Rafael, but this is first time I have photos.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,38.22604202898551,-122.65297500000001

From our location in Toms River, NJ, the objects passed just to our West while traveling from the Southwest towards the Northeast. There were four peach/orange colored object and two smaller white objects. They held a general formation but the distance between the objects varied as they moved along.  There was no sound coming from the objects at all. We live under a busy airspace serving the New York metropolitan airports as well as the McGuire Air Force Base and can always hear the sound of a passing aircraft.  Altitude was hard to verify since the size of the objects was unknown. If they were the size of a small aircraft like the Cessna 175 (Which I flown in many times) then I would estimate their altitude at 5,000 feet and their ground speed to be 200 MPH. Altitude and speed remained constant while I observed them.  Both of us agreed that their shape was circular. My wife commented later was that she thought of jellyfish as she watched them. They looked to me as thought they were self illuminated globes.  I have never seen or reported anything like this before and have no opinion as to what they were. More than anything, I wanted to know if anyone else saw the same thing.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,39.98447272727273,-74.19884456762749
