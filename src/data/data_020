I then noticed a very small, dim yellow light which seemed to be following the 757 about one and a half plane lengths behind. As the jet got closer (to me) the light began a slow arc to the northwest, executing a turn of roughly 90 degrees.

I said well they shimmer due to the atmosphere is that what you mean? She said no I'm seeing one oh no there are two no wait there are three lights moving with us as we are driving.  I couldn't see anything as I was paying attention to the road.  At one point during this period I openly called to the craft and ((deleted)) screamed ""Oh my god!"" when I asked her what happened she said that as I was talking to the craft what she at first thought was a very bright light in the fields next to the highway flew almost instantly toward the car and was next to the passenger side window for about 5 seconds as we were going 65 mph..

Saturday morning approximately 4 a.m. on 12-23-00, I was outside on a clear and cold night watching for shooting stars and anything else that might cross the sky. As I said, the sky was clear and the moon was in or very near its new moon phase. So it was an absolutely perfect observational setting- though it was just below freezing, but I like it cold. The area is rural.  My family's home sits with neighbors to the left and right or east and west.  In front and across the road of their home (South) is a pasture. Behind (North) it there is woods.  The pasture across the street was logged about two years ago, so there is a stretch of land that is relatively clear of obsticles. Where the property line ends at the pasture, roughly southwest, the tree line picks back up and covers a large portion of the skyline from Southwest all the way back North- there is a small opening westward where the road goes.  Much of the woods behind the house were recently logged as well, but the larger pine trees nearest our property line still stand and take up much of the immediate Northern skyline. Now to the good part.  I had been outside about half an hour and was looking westward after just having seen a dim shooting star in that direction.  I then saw this solid red oval shaped craft, flying very low, come out of, well actually over, the trees to the North. It seemed to be moving from north to south. I studied it intensely to see if there were any flashing lights- there were none.  The object seemed very low, and very close.  I began walking toward it- west along the street. It was moving very slow and made absolutely no sound.  As I walked toward it, its speed noticably increased and very quickly. There were no human defying zig-zags, but it went from a rather large clear red oval shaped craft in front of me to being a rather small vaguely red oval shaped craft much faster than I would have liked or expected.  It seemed to fly directly away from me, and grew perceptively smaller as it went. Also, as I studied it, I think I saw at least two, possibly three different angles of the craft, and it was solid red all around.  Nothing but red light. Well, as I realized that it was moving away from me I ran about 80 yards trying to keep it in sight, but lost it to the treeline as it appeared to be moving first due west away from me, then more of a south westernly direction. I could be off a little or alot on Its last direction due to the treeline, but it was without doubt somewhere between due south and west, but closer to south. After I lost it to the trees (it was also very vague in the distance by this point)  I reluctantly walked back to my parents house and silently mused to myself about the fact that I had just seen a UFO. I do not know of any known man-made objects that move with the its velocity, have no blinking lights at all, and is one solid defining color. Speaking personally for a moment, I must say that the adrenaline rush was amazing. As I ran toward the object, as it made its escape, I was silently calling to it, ""come back, please, come back.""  Mercy, I like the awe inspiring feeling of seeing something that perhaps, just perhaps was created on some other planet in some other galaxy far far away- deep within our vast and complex universe.  I find that the nightlife in this small rural town isn't quite as dull as most here like to believe. :) I don't know if this goes here, but I have video footage of something that flew through the background of a newscast report.  I was working at a local t.v. station in Meridian, MS at the time.  I was the only one to notice it because it was very light in color and the sky was in that overcast, really hazy and bright way. However, as the report was shown on air, I happened to be watching a small black and white monitor, which effectively took away the excess hazy light, and I could see the object clearly. This thing ""did"" do human defying manuevers as it zig zagged up through then out of the frame.  I've sent a copy of it to Peter Gersten, and I'd be happy to send a copy to the NURC if you want one.  Its brief and not particularly spectacular, but it is definately ""something"" and its movements defy everything that we're supposed to be able to do.",2001-01-03T00:00:00,32.413,-88.5196

Hi, this evening I saw a strange thing in the sky.  It was a beautiful, silent summer evenening, without any wind.  The sky (and clouds) had some red and orange colors of the sun.  I was in the living room when my father & mother called me to come and take a look at the sky.  There was something 'rare' they said.  My father had his pocket-telescope and we looked at it.  Actually it was my mother who noticed it first.  She must have got goooood eyes because the object was very small (because it was far away).  By the time i was watching, a friend of mine came in the kitchen too (we were all watching through the window in the kitchen) and he saw it too, even without glasses.  I took the telescope and looked at the thing.  It was a glittering thing that didn't move.  I could see that it didn't move because it was placed between two electrical wires (it was much much further than the wires of course, but it was a reference).   I continued to stare at the glittering thing, and saw that it took different colors.  I don't know if they came from the sun or what, but the colors slightly differed (which my friend confirms).  The thing was hanging there for 3 or 4 minutes (that we know) and i (we) didn't stop staring.  Suddenly it started moving up at a constant speed.  It wasn't sensational fast, but if you consider the distance it must have been away from us,it can't have moved very slow neither.  So the thing rose and then there was a real FAT cloud after the thing.  First we (me, my parents and my friend ) really thought it was an aircraft that was crashing! It seemed to be falling. It's a kind of cloud you see after a BOEING aircraft but at least 10 times broader.  The cloud had an orange color (was it a reflection from the sun? it did have approximately the same color) and was moving fast (not from our point of view, but again considered the distance...).  After 1 minute or something the cloud was suddenly vanished.  We looked around and some little further there was again this little tiny glittering object that ! we saw b efore the clouds were there.  Then me & my friend saw the different colors again. After 1 minute it restarted moving.  It was moving further away from us.  Again, when it started moving, these clouds appeared.  When the clouds were there, you couldn't see the object.  Okay, it was real far away from us now, so me and my friend jumped in the car and drove into the direction where it was located.  I had the pocket-telescope with me, i could still see the thing from inside the car.  It was really un-necessary for us to move, because it went MUCH faster than we did, so we drove back home.  The last thing i saw (at home again) was the cloud (but very far away), i stared at it, but at once it was gone. i never saw it back. In my opinion, it was no balloon, that's too slow An aircraft... i don't know, i've never seen such big clouds after a plane.  Besides, what aircraft can hang still in the air? I have absolutely no idea what this was, but it was a strange phenomena. I'm not making this up, i'm too tired for jokes... Maybe someone else has seen something like this too, or maybe it can be explained... I hope to find an answer or hear about it. Bye...",2001-08-12T00:00:00,,

Both lights where equal distance apart,(about one and a half fingers apart at arms length) red in color and about the size of a star. The lights also had a strange pulsation to them. The lights would fade in and out, but would not fade compleatly. I asked for my wife an my sister to hurry and come out and see this. We stood out on the driveway watching the lights for about a minute and a half untill we could not see them anymore. After we lost sight of them, we went back in the house. I then started to write down the time and any relevant information. I asked my wife and sister what they saw to verify my notes.

Satellites do not course from east to west, except in very rare occasions.  Also, given that the object was moving from left to right, as seen by the witnesses, had it been an aircraft, the two female witnesses, who presumably have normal color perception, would have seen a green light, not a red light.  Standard lighting conventions on aircraft and vessels require a red marker light on the port (left) side of the craft, and a green light on the right (starboard) side.

For 15-30 seconds or so, it sped across the clear sky in a straight line, leaving a substantial tail which dissipated fairly quickly as it crossed.  At first I thought it was a Navy type flare that some yahoo had set off for a lark.  It was the same size as such a flare and had the same velocity as those I have seen set off around here on New Year's Eve.  However, the light was a very bright white, not orange or purple.  After its rapid, soundless progress almost directly overhead, it disappeared from my view plane behind trees and a bright streetlight, having maintained its constant speed, trajectory, and brightness throughout.  I have no idea what it could have been, though I suspect that it was a large meteor or a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere.  It was probably nothing out of the ordinary, but it would be reassuring to have it identified. Please let me know if you have heard anything about it.

While observing the meteor shower from my NNW facing window, I noticed a creamy yellow light appear out of nowhere high in the sky, a few degrees WNW from the second brightest star I can see from my vantage point (possibly in the constellation Casseopia, the thing that looks like a big ""W"" in the sky, which is almost directly overhead and to the NNW from my view at this time of day). The light was tiny and it looked & moved like a satellite in polar orbit, but the time of sighting would seem to preclude that possibility, as the sun has been down for some six hours. It ""came on"" slowly while moving directly south, increased in brilliance over about 1 second, stayed lit at around magnitude -2 to -3 for about another second, then dimmed & vanished over the next second, never to reappear.  I tracked its projected course until my view was obstructed by the exterior wall of my own building, and did not see it light up again.  The color did not change, and no trails or tails were left behind. Once it dimmed out, it could no longer be followed. The apparent size was smaller than the head of a common pin held at arm's length. The two meteors I observed earlier this morning before sighting this object both travelled very quickly (est. many tens of thousands of MPH), on a generally southeast-to-northwest track, and were colored white and blue-white respectively. One left a blue luminescent trail for a brief time.  This object was nothing like them.  The speed was all wrong, the direction of travel was wrong, and the color of the light wasn't a typical ""meteor"" color compared to any meteor I've ever seen. Any ideas?

No strobe nor colored flashing lights. I was on my way to work at 3:46am, when I stopped at a stop sign in new housing development area in Sherwood on the outskirts of Portland. When I looked out my windshield I noticed a low flying formation of big bright white lights moving together as one low slow moving object. There were 5 lights shaped in a V. One on the tip of the object and two on either side of the craft and two more on the end of the V shaped craft. All were evenly spaced.  At first sight...I thought oh my! That's one low flying craft...but why aren't there any colored or blinking strobe lights flashing? 2 years ago before moving to Oregon, I lived for 6 years behind an Airport in Juneau Alaska...the runway was behind a stand of trees behind my home. So I have seen and heard many types of aircraft including the largest military cargo plane made (it flew in and stopped at the Army Air National Guard Station next to the Heliport and Airport. It's wing structure wouldn't allow for a V configuration of lights like I saw, and neither would anything but a triangular shaped craft or a chevron shape).  And, I also saw a Harrier Jet rising up from the runway, flying stationary and then zooming up and away during a ""Snowbird"" airshow directly behind my home (watched it through my livingroom bay windows). It was soooooo LOUD!!! And all the planes I have ever seen have some sort of colored flashing beacon lights of some sort. So, what struck me as verrrrrry unusual was the absence of these kinds of lights, and I couldn't hear any sound. I then thought that what ever this is it has to be very high up to be so quite and moving slowly and if so...then this thing is SOOOO HUGE, and the 5 white lights very big and bright to shine so much. Or it's a low flying craft which is very strange....that it's so quiet. Very quiet. (no engine sounds) But what ever it was...it was still a large flying object. I watched it for a few minutes as it slowly passed almost over head and then I made my right hand turn and pulled over to the right hand side of ther road and turned my head around and looked at it through the drivers side window when I noticed it start to bank left (the V formation of 5 lights turned into 3, because it was turning) and fly off towards a more unpopulated area. I then took off because I didn't want to be late for work. I thought it might be a stealth wing, but when I saw the photos of the lights on them, I saw that they had a red light under the belly of the plane and small green lights (landing gear lights?) and more white lights than what I saw and the pattern of white lights were not evenly spaced along the V shape on the Stealth craft. Now I'm even more puzzled because what I saw didn't have a red light underneath nor could I see an afterburner in the back like the stealth aircraft. Unless it's the space shuttle? But I don't think so...even that has an afterburner! UFO...that's all I know as of right now.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,45.3552,-122.8615

We were southbound on US-395.  It was approximately 9 PM and it was pitch black outside.  There are no lights at all in this area.  This area (Owens Valley) is a long N/S valley that is bordered on the E/W by mountain ranges in excess of 14,000 Ft.  As we were driving south of Lone Pine, my brother told me to look at a light that was to the left of the vehicle.  I looked and I saw a green light.  It was off to the east of the roadway by approximately 3 to 4 miles.  It was only about 400 to 500 feet off the ground.  It was moving at approximately 150 to 200 MPH.  It had apparently come from behind us, out of our view, and we noticed it as it passed us to the left.  We watched it as it continued south.  Since it was doing approximately 150 MPH faster than us, it gradually got further away until we couldn't see it anymore.  We expected to see it get higher as at the end of the valley, there was a ridge of foothills that it would have to climb over, but we never saw it again.  This light very well could have been an airplane as all airplanes have a green navigational light on the right wingtip.  But, there were no other lights other than the green one.  No flashing strobe lights or other lights indicative of an airplane.  Also, the green light was more like a luminescent ""glowing"" color, very different from the green color that is typically used on an aircraft.  Unless this was a military aircraft with night vision capabilities, there would have been no way for a pilot to see the terrain.  If you look on an aeronautical map, the section where we saw this ""light"" has mountains as high as 14,000 feet and it is pitch black out there with no ground lights to use for visual reference or dead reckoning.  Although we didn't stop the vehicle to listen for aircraft noise, we never did hear any noise.  If it was a military jet, even at 3 to 4 miles distant, we should have heard some jet noise.  The area in question is very near the China Lake! Naval W eapons Station.  During the daytime, I have seen plenty of fighter jets maneuvering in that area, however it was always during daylight hours and they were always up above 25,000 ft.",2000-12-09T00:00:00,36.5647,-118.1873

PD)) I was leaving work about 12:30AM when I noticed in the sky an oval shapped lighted object in the sky. At first I thought it was a search light looking for planes. Then as I was driving around the horse shoe shapped road in the industrial park, I noticed that it was only about 100 feet in the sky and there are no airports or small planes that fly in the Central Islip area of long Island. As I started to get closer to the lighted object I noticed that it was moving lower to the street	and started following my car. I knew this was not a search light looking for planes now. Now I'm driving as fast as I can, all the while this object is following me. When I got to the end of the street, the traffic light was Red, I stopped and waited for it to turn Green, as I looked up to my left was this oval shapped object now hovering to my left only about 100 feet in the sky, it was as if it was waiting for me at the intersection. All of a sudden this oval shapped lighted object splits up into 4 smaller oval shapped lighted objects, and they start rotating around each other, all the time staying the same distance apart from one another. Now the traffic light turns green and I take off driving as fast as I can. I'm heading North on Carlton Ave. to get to the LIE. I look over to my left and the 4 lighted objects are following me on the left side of the road, only about 100 feet in the sky. Then I saw head lights in my rear view mirror, I tried to get the attention of the car behind me, the driver just passed me up, I looked over and noticed the 4 lighted objects were gone now. I keept driving North on Carlton Ave. and now I was the only car on the road again, I look over to my left and once again I see the 4 oval shapped lighted objects on the left side of the road, about 100 feet in the sky and moving alone with my car. Now I'm really getting scarred, I don't know what the hell this thing is. Then once again another car approaches from behind me, I look over to my left and the 4 lighted objects are gone again. I'm st! ill driv ing North on Carlton Ave. and I don't see the objects anymore, since the second car passed by me. Then instead of going straight home I decide to turn down one of the residential streets in Central Islip. As I was slowly driving down this dark narrow street something strange came over me, and I asked myself why did I turn down this residential street instead of going straight home? I then decided to get back onto Carlton Ave. and go home. But instead of just turning the car around, I decided to continue down this street and make a right and then another right to get back to Carlton Ave. I finally get to the end of the residential street and I see a lighted object in the sky, directly in front of me, this time only about 50 feet in the sky, I froze for a minute as I watched this object hovering in the sky. Then all of a sudden the 1 object splits off into 4 objects, just like it did earlier. Now there were 4 smaller oval shapped lighted objects hovering in the sky, and rotating around each other right in front of me. I step on the gas pedal and make the right turn, I'm driving as fast as I can, I get to the next corner and make another right turn to get back to Carlton Ave. I'm driving as fast as I  can and looking back every other second, the objects were still following me. I finally get to the end of the street, I make a left onto Carlton Ave. I'm heading north and driving as fast as I can, I don't see the lighted objects anymore. I finally get to the LIE and all the way home I don't see the lighted objects.

What caught my attention was that neither the jet trails nor the small objects in front(presumably an aircraft of some type) were moving.  They appeared to be absolutely stationary!!  It would be hard to estimate the altitude but I would guess 5-10 miles.  The craft/jet trails were positioned where it appeared that had the craft been moving, it would be travelling from north to south. As stated above the jet trails were white in color but were unusually short, much shorter than what is commonly seen.  From my perspective, they were both an inch to an inch an half in length. Additionally, they did not appear to disperse from the effects of the wind, as would normally be expected. The jet trails were not close together, separated by about 15-20 degrees horizontally. Since I was driving a vehicle, I had to divert my view briefly in order to drive safely.  At one point, I looked up and the plane/jet trail to my right completely disappeared!  I scanned the sky in the vicinity of where I had seen it and it was totally absent.   I had just seen it a few seconds previously. The object to my left was still visible.

Actually the back of my lot borders Grayslake since the lots fronting Route 45 have been ""taken"" by Grayslake recently. That evening looking out the kitchen door window, checking as a security measure before retiring I looked up and over towards Grayslake and just above the power lines I notice two rather large glowing objects in a stationary position.  I looked at my watch for a moment, unbelieving what I saw, it was about 2 minutes before midnight.  I quickly looked again and they were still there in the exact position in which I first spotted them.  I was awestruck and was waiting for movement, but it never occurred for about 5 minutes.  Then suddenly, the one on my left, and a little lower then the other one suddenly started moving away towards the West until I lost sight of it.  It moved out very fast but was not instantaneous and I was watching it as it departed. The other object stayed, and I wanted to get my binoculars which were in the dinning room just off the kitchen, but I hesitated figuring I would miss something.  But after a couple more minutes, without movement, I took a chance and dashed into the dining room, found the binoculars and took them out of the case and got back to the window.  This movement on my part took no more than 1-2  minutes.  As I returned the object was still there, and as I raised the binoculars up it started moving westward, just as the other one had done earlier.  Unfortunately by the time I got the binoculars focused, it was completely gone. The objects were observed as rather large lights, but they had a oblong symmetrical shape and while watching, I had the sensation that something zoomed past my window just above the roof of my house.  It happened so fast, I'm still not sure it happened, since I was mainly focusing on the two lights off to the distance.  I heard no noise, nor did I even think to go outside and try and get a better view. I have mentioned my sighting to some of my associates at work, and some of my family members, but I really can't confirm what they were, the only thing I know is that they were there, were stationary for several minutes and were not airplanes of which I have seen many times before.

Friday night at about 11:00 pm I saw the strangest thing while looking at the night sky. Looking straight up I saw a line of light in the sky that my first reaction was that Oh its a shooting star. But the light didn't fade out like a shooting star would and the light didn't move in a downward motion but in a horizontal movement across the sky. Then I realized I'm looking at lit up side or a reflecting side or edge of an object. My next reaction was that I must be seeing an owl gliding across the night sky trying to rationalize this when I immediately realized this is no owl. I could make out the sides of a 3 sided object dark as the night sky itself but the sides were just barely visible. I felt that rather then looking at just a dark object, not lit up that I felt it was camouflaged to the night sky. I don't know how to explain that but that's a feeling that went through me. My reaction in a split second was ""how sneaky this thing is"". I want to say it was not lit, it seemed as black and void as the night sky, but I was able to make out the 3 sides. I'm not sure if it was reflections or actual lights very dim that shown its form, but I could make out its shape. No doubt though at what I was seeing even as quick as it was I was able to get a clear view and take it all in. 3 sided, like a guitar pick shape.When it passed in front of the stars the shape was also that much more easier to decern. Heading west to east. When it was out of sight I even thought to hold my hand out in the sky to try to judge the size it took up in the sky. When I held my hand out I would say that it was the size of half of my hand size. It was not a far off object I was looking at. Marine helicopters fly through this corridor daily heading for The Miramar Base, this object seemed to be moving at about that or  just above that height that the helicopters fly at. What that elevation is I dont know but that is the best way for me to judge what height in the sky the object seemed to be. Not a sound, and because there was no sound ! and it m oved at a tremendous speed my mind was searching for a different word then flying. It was one of those things where if you weren't looking in just the right spot at the right time you would never have seen it, it was so stealthy. I saw it from directly over my head and disappear past the mountains in the east 10 miles away in 5 seconds. Once it was out of sight I stood staring at the sky for another 15 minutes trying to understand what the heck could it have been and thinking perhaps I might see it again. The frustration of not being able to understand what could be that shape, that quiet, that dark and move at that rate of speed, made me not even want to think about it at all until I spoke to my wife about it the next day. I couldn't fit it into a box in my mind or relate it to anything Ive ever seen, and that can be frustrating. Do we have something that can move at night like this ? If we dont then someone does, there is NO doubt about that in my mind now. I'm sending a little drawing of how it looked to me as I looked up at what I would guess was its underside. Side A is the edge I first noticed glimmering that I thought was a line of light in the sky that was a shooting star. Side B would be the side closest to me looking up and the front was the portion of the object that was at the head of it moving towards the east.

PD)) For the past 3 days now I've seen some objects hovering over Popocatepetl Volcano for upwards of 15 minutes, on the Cenapred live cam. For the past 3 days now I've seen some objects hovering over Popocatepetl Volcano for long periods of time, on the live cam, and have been capturing series of still pictures. The first day the object actually came straight down from above the volcano and looked somewhat like a huge silverish colored cylinder. It took at least 15 minutes to make the descent and when it impacted Popo, whoever was manning the live cam actually zoomed in on the explosion. The next day I saw the same type of thing, only this time there was no explosion, though it looked like it would have impacted the top of the volcano. Then this morning I checked the live cam for any increased volcanic activity and couldn't believe it when I saw a disk shaped silvery colored object, at least the size of a huge jet or football field, approach from the left side of the screen. It hovered over the volcano at about a 45 degree angle for at least fifteen minutes, and once again, I captured the still pictures. The object today actually hovered up there in the steam and smoke directly above the crater for a long time, so I captured a total of 50 pictures of the thing. Each picture is about 25K so would have to be emailed separately, but I would send them to you if you're interested. This is from the Cenapred live cam and each captured picture has the date and time on it by Cenapred so you can see how long it stayed over the volcano, before it simply vanished. Please email me if you'd like any of the pics. I have series from 3 days in a row now. If not, you might want to watch the Popocatepetl live cam for yourself. I am concerned, because if this is some kind of attempt to control the volcano, it could have repercussions in other areas, affecting earthquakes, or at least the movement of magma below ground. Could they be experimenting? And what kind of craft could hover up there right over the volcano in those extreme temperatures and air currents for long periods of time without being destroyed???",2001-02-18T00:00:00,,

Immediately following this, the light began to wane and flicker slightly and move up (which is the only way we can describe it) in a seemly westward direction, but definitely up.  It was also moving side to side in quick movements as it went away from us.  The light got smaller and smaller until it disappeared into the clear night sky.  As we saw it, it seemed to go out of the atmosphere as opposed to any direction imparticular.  We watched for several minutes afterward, but nothing returned.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,40.5788,-124.15

I had gone to the phone @ a convienence store and while on the phone to a friend, I was looking to the N.W. when I noticed four red light's in the sky, they were pulsing and moving toward's me and stopped above Nellis Air Stip, then the one on the right left the staggered line formation and dipped down below the others,( the centers were white but the pulses were red flashes ), and strobed brighter than the other's as it manuvered around below the others from right to left, then it hovered for a few second's flashing brighter in intensity then proceded on its course to my left and circled around back up to the others and they all proceded to move away to the N.W.N then northerly and out of sight. These red lights were not like a planes red light because they were at least 10 times brighter and the one that was manuvering around was at least 20 times brighter because I could compare them to planes in the sky above L.V., and I didn't notice any sound coming from the direction of the objects, then all of a sudden Nellis A.F.B. came alive with sound, jet engines roar filled the air and it was constant, then planes started taking off one after the other, I counted between 10 and 12 in the first wave and they climbed upward fast to about 12,000 to 15,000 feet and leveled off and they proceded toward the direction the UFO's had gone. The first wave made a scurmish line roughly five miles long from left to right above the mountain range of the Nellis test site range and they seemed to me to be hearding or escorting the objects out of the area and it seemed also that they were looking for them and blocking them from the test site area. While the first wave was busy several more waves of planes took off in groupes of 4 and 6 and this lasted for a good 10 minutes and I stsrted to loose count but I estimated between 30 and 40 planes had taken off in that time and the last wave of planes to take off were the big airliner size and I counted 5 of th! em and a t this time I noticed another large plane coming in to nellis from the east at about 15,000 feet and it eventually headed off to the N.W. also but was just above the flight path of the fighters that were taking off. I continued to watch the planes that were still flying around above the test range to the north of me and all of a sudden out of thin air amist planes there appeared a white orange light object and the planes in the immediate area changed there courses toward the object and then it flashed a bright orange and winked out and re-appeared in a new place in the sky in the same area and all the planes changed there courses again and the object winked out again and re-appeared in another spot like it was playing its version of cat and mouse and it did this atleast four times that I saw 'cause I grabbed my binocularsto see if I could Identify these Objects for myself then it winked out brightly one last time and was gone and the planes cicled around for a few more seconds and then headed north. This second sighting occured @ about 8:45pm p.s.t. I watched for another 15 minutes then went to the phone to report the sighting I had just witnessedfirst hand. After talking to Mr. Davenport I was a little taken aback by his disbelief as to the number of planes I witnessed taking off from N.A.F.B., it was as though he thought the number of planes was excessive, but he wasn't here and I was, so after I hung up with Mr. Davenport I went staight home,for I was about 45 seconds from home and started to write down what I saw as per Mr. davenport's instruction's and then I heard the plkanes coming back in to land, so I stopped writing and went outside and started counting the number of planes that were coming into land and I counted ""38"" fighter's and ""6"" big airliner size type military planes and with my binoculars I was able to distinguish ""9"" different types of planes of the fighter's and big planes and they kept coming in until 10:35pm (pst) and the big planes landed last and one was a propeller type and they! finishe d landing by 11pm and I finished this report at 11:42pm (pst). ((NUFORC Note:  Source of this report is anonymous, but apparently is the same person who telephoned our hotline about this alleged event.  We have no other reports of ""30-40"" planes taking off from Nellis.  Upon reflection, we suspect that few military air bases have 30-40 military aircraft, and the necessary crew members and necessary ground personnel, to get that many aircraft in the air on short notice, and in a very short period of time.  Moreover, the air traffic control problem, it seems to us, would be significant.  If anyone can provide more information about this alleged incident, we would be grateful for additional reports.

A friend and I were on our way back o Las Cruces, NM.  I noticed a red glow out of my passenger window.  We were a little bit out of Cloudcroft, NM and it was about 11:00 pm.  There was a red glow that appeared to coming from behind a mountain and covered a good portion of the sky.  I kind of looked like there was a big forest fire.  We pulled over once then drove a little more to get a better view and pulled over again.  The red was more intense in one area and seemed to lighten out, the further it went out to the edges.  There were also white beams of light the shot very high into the sky, almost to the point where they were over my head.  They beams were not extremely bright but stretched a ways into the sky.  There was also a time where there was 3 or 4 beams and then to the right of these, a could more appeared.  They just started appearing in succession from left to right. Every once in a while they would fade away they in a while they would come back again.  They never moved across the sky though, they would appear in different places but they were always stationary.  Another weird thing was that when their were about 4 or so in a row, they were all space the same distane apart.  Then after a little while, the red was gone but the beams of light were still there.  There were two other cars pulled over at the same spot that we were but I didn't talk to them so I don't know if they were looking at the light or not.  But we couldn't have been the only ones to see this, it was hard to miss if you just looked in that direction at the sky.  There are nothing but a few very small towns in that area, and I have never seen any type of spot light that can make a beam of light like the ones that we saw  It is the wierdest thing that I have ever seen.  I regret that we had no video camera or anything with us.  Well, I guess that is it, it happened about 4 hours ago, and I had to document it somewhere.

First I saw what I thought was a falling star, a bright stream of light in the Eastern night sky falling in a slight curve for what, in my visual field, was approximately 4 inches, but was located a great distance away, so of course would have been far greater in length.  A minute or so later I saw a bit farther south but still in the Eastern sky a fast moving light that was first bright white, then red, alternating.  This object was moving very fast and again a great distance away.  The object, continuing to change from bright white to red, to bright white, etc,  then began to move in an erratic fashion, jumping forward quickly, then up and down in a zig-zag fashion--not straight up and down but more in a pointed sine wave pattern.  At this point, I said something to my husband, and he pulled the car off the freeway.  After he started watching the object, we saw it move backward, in addition to up and down.  We continued to observe this odd motion for as long as we could.  The lights from oncoming vehicles on the freeway made it impossible to continue observing the object.  I observed two objects (the ""falling star"" and the red and white lighted object) and my husband saw only the red and white lighted object).  I didn't think about it at the time, but on telling my sister about it today, she pointed out that the direction we were looking was toward Mr. Rainier, where there have been repeated sightings over the years.

While working Sunday evening online with my compter upstairs in my kitchen, I had an unobstructed view to the S.W. through two large windows which had the blinds pulled 3/4 of the way up... when I happened to notice an UNUSUAL CONTRAIL ARCING TOWARD THE NORTH FROM the direction of Waco, Texas. I am situated approximately 48 miles S.S.W. of Fort Worth and 45 miles North of Waco, Texas. As a former commercial pilot, with instrument and multi-engine ratings, I noticed that this particular contrail had a base which appeared over the apparent S.W. horizon and the angle was so steep (probable 60 degrees) that it immediately caught my attention- I went to the window for further investigation (thinking, perhaps this is an airliner in distress) - runaway elevator or loss of control, etc.--when much to my amazement, this object did a abrupt verticle ascent from a fixed point- that's right- no pull up with a normal curve at contrail bottom- I'm talking about a change of direction, speed and ascent almost instantaneosly to the verticle- 90 degrees ascent and it accellerated as it went forward. Since the sun was setting in the Western sky and we had a clear sky this contrail and object was clearly visible, especially since it was reflecting in varying intensities as it passed throgh our upper atmosphere. I caught a very good reflection of the object with binoclars I keep in the kitchen- it HAD NO WINGS- EGG SHAPED, (not tublar like a missle) METALLIC SILVER WITH REFLECTIVITY OF BRIGHTLY POLISHED CHROME-- my estimate of altitude would be in the 25-30 thousand feet range when I first saw it... as it accellerated upward, the contrail was not continious, but rather sparoidic as if it were passing through different temps... I watched it till it disappeared from the sky..still in a verticle ascent- Good God, I thought this might have been a missle launch the way this craft behaved. The only major military based south of me is Fort Hood (approx. 100 miles as the crow flies) however, President Bush's Texas compound is prob! able 60 miles S.S.W- I called my parents, who live next door out to witness the event, but by the time they made it outside all that was left was the tale-tale sign of the lower contrail, except that the portion of the contrail that went verticle was still evident and they were also amazed as to the phemonenia. Hope this wasn't Saddam's avowed 1st attempt at retribtion. If it was however, our missle defense worked, because I'm still here to report this sighting. There was no sound involved in this incident. From now on, I will replace the binnoclars with a video camera. Keep up the good work. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found him to be credible.  We addressed the possibility that he might have been observing an airliner reflecting sunlight, but he thought that was not the explanation.  PD))",2001-03-06T00:00:00,32.1706,-97.2947

"Very slow-moving, silent, triangular formation of lights; some RF interference",Irwin,PA,2001-02-19T18:48:00,light,4 minutes (?),"Occurred : 2/19/2001 18:48  (Entered as : 02/19/01 18:48) Reported: 2/19/2001 19:14 Posted: 2/24/2001 Location: Irwin, PA Shape: Light Duration:4 minutes (?)",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16553.html,"Very slow-moving, silent, triangular formation of lights; some RF interference I was driving US Route 30 East from Forest Hills (just outside Pittsburgh) to Irwin.  This is the usual route I take home from work.  My wife was in the car but was dozing and laying down.  As I came over the hill near Norwin High School I saw a light in the eastern sky - nothing unusual at first.  As I approached the intersection of 10th Street (Irwin) and Rt. 30, I noted that it was getting very much brighter (white) and was slowly ""pulsing"" in brightness - about one second from bright to dim and one second back again.  When I got closer, perhaps 1/2 mile from directly underneath it, I could see that it had two close-set front lights like headlights, both white, which no longer appeared to be pulsing.  It also had a red light on its port ""wingtip"" (relative position of the lights implied ""wingtip"", but I could see no silhouette, only the lights), so I concluded it was a plane. It was moving to the west very slowly, though.  When I got closer still I could see the starboard ""wingtip"" light which was also red.  This struck me as a bit odd.  It was passing nearly directly overhead at this point.  My car's digital clock read 6:48 PM.  I was listening to a Pittsburgh  station (1410 KQV-AM) which breaks up and fades back in a lot in Irwin, but the static is typically just white-noise.  As the object passed overhead, the signal was lost in a wave of loud ""angry"" buzzing, which caused me to shut the radio off.  The car was not otherwise affected. The object was moving west very slowly indeed at this point.  Since neither size nor distance were known I'll put this in terms of objects at arm's length.  Its length was about 1/2 the width of a normal music CD at arm's length, and it was moving (when directly overhead) about 1 CD-diameter in about 7 seconds. Since it was moving in the opposite direction to me, I thought this was unusually slow for a non-hovering aircraft, so I rolled down the window to see if I could hear it (thinking perhaps it was a helicopter and the ""wingtip"" effect of the red lights was an illusion).  I could hear absolutely nothing but the other cars - no ""airliner roar"", no chopper blades, nothing. I should note that I work near several hospitals in Pittsburgh.  If a helicopter is sufficiently low to appear that large (and they often are), I can easily hear it going overhead, even over the roar of a busy Pittsburgh street and my car's engine with the windows rolled up. So between the red (not green) starboard lights, the radio interference (which was gone after I passed about 1/2 mile ""behind"" the object), the slow motion, and the silence, I'm very confused.  Again, all I could see was two white ""headlights"", closely set, with two red lights at ""wingtip"" positions.  I guess you could call it a ""triangle"", but again I emphasise I saw no silhouette, only the lights themselves. It may have been a perfectly conventional craft, but it was nothing I'm familiar with.",2001-02-24T00:00:00,40.3178,-79.7177

It was fairly high in the sky, but looked big. At times it seemed as if a halo was around it. I continued home and when I got there the ""star""was over my right shoulder. (I'm not sure whether it moved or not while I was driving. It seemed to, but who can be sure when they are moving themselves?)I got out of my car and watched it for a while. It stayed in the exact same spot. I had my neighbors outside light (1/8 mi. down the road if that) and trees as a reference point. I finally went in and ate. I went back out to check on the star. It was still there in the same spot. I hadn't called anyone nearby, I was afraid I'd look stupid. There was a whole lot of activity in the air, which is unusual where I live. I'm way out in the country. None of the aircraft approached the object that I could tell. I went back in and picked up my camera, not really thinking I could get a decent picture but I might be able to get a better look at it through my 300mm lens. It was gone. But there were other strange things happening. Across the road, I could see lights moving through the trees. The lights were fairly big so I could not justify what I was seeing with my own eyes. they were kind off light pinkish orange. This is the best I can describe them. This continued for another 1/2 hour or so at random. When the big ""star"" had left, the air traffic had also calmed down. This star was big and I don't understand my hesitation in calling for a witness. I didn't call anybody until it was all over. Ther's one thing I left out and it might seem crazy, but I got really sleepy at one point and went in to lay down. I fell asleep, but it wasn't long. the dog was barking like crazy and my cell phone was ringing,so I woke up. That's when I grabbed my camera ! and went outside. Like I said it was gone. I looked all around the sky to see if had moved with the rest of the stars. It simply was not there. That's why I am convinced I saw something unusual. I called my local airport, they were of no help. I also called the county communications department, they didn't know anything. I called several other places to no avail. I called the Richmond Air port this morning and they referred me to your number. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the wintess, and she seemed serious and credible to us.

This object was not a plane, it was not clouds(the sky was clear at that time), it was not the smoke from my neighbors chimney or a falling star(meteor)and it was not a flock of birds flying in formation(although the latter did crosss my mind at first because of the formation it was in but it was traveling much too fast). What I saw was something shaped roughly like a boomarang, it made no sound, left no trail in the sky and the only thing that defined it's shape was what seemed to be dots of white light, several rows of them. It wasn't light like starlight or streetlight or any light I have ever seen, it was just white dots of light, glowing white dots. It seemed to be traveling northwest to southeast at the time I saw it and I watched it till the tree branches obscured it and it disappeared over the housetops. It's shape never fluctuated from this boomarang formation. I stood there saying to myself, ""what the @#&* was that?"", and would have probably just left it at that but as I was standing there contemplating what it was I just saw I noticed this same shaped object with the white light further down the horizan. It was further south closer to the downtown area of the city(Buffalo) and now seemed to be traveling east to west till it disappeared.  This thing was so strange I probably would have talked myself out of believing I had seen what I had just seen if I had not seen it twice. After I saw this object the second time further down the horizan I stayed out for probably another 10 minutes or more searching the sky for this thing till my toes were getting numb before going in. I don't know what it was that I saw that night but I do know what it wasn't and I'm wondering if there were any other reports in the Buffalo, Western NY area regarding this strang object close to the time I saw it??

I put my reverse gear in, and backed out of the dark, cold desereted parking lot.  I turned left on Fir Ave.  Then, I turned another left onto Peach, where there's a Honda North dealership at the corner.  On Peach, I made a right turn to E Herndon then made a left turn on Willow.

I normally look at the sky and watch planes in route to Parks air field and Lambert International Airport (These are usually much higher altitude).  While looking to the north I followed some lights I thought were a plane. Will I watched I noticed there was no beacon (I was able to see beacons on other planes flying in the sky).  The crafts lights were also much bigger than any I had ever seen on a plane, and in an unusual delta ( compared to the other high flying jets that night).  My distance from the craft was hard to judge, but I would say about 3/4 to 1 mile and about 500 to 750 in altitude. The craft appeared to be banking to the north toward downtown St. Louis on it's slow journey (the slowness also set this craft apart). It seemed to be as slow as a blimp but much more stable in its route (I had seen many blimps use Parks Airfield on other occassions).  I finished my cigarette and went back inside.  I did not mention this to anyone inside because I thought they would think I was crazy.  I went home about 15 minutes later to meet another friend and told him the story.

I saw a perfect rainbow in the sky and was so impressed with its clarity (a perfect arc with all colors visible from end to end) that I decided to pull over at the next rest stop and take a few pictures.  Stopped at a picnic area and waved hello to a hispanic family sitting at a picnic table before snapping a few shots.  Had just turned my camera from auto to off when i noticed a line of what i thought had to have been geese or a larger sort of bird because they were flying in a v-formation and alternating black and white, which i thought meant that their wings were black on one side and white on the other.  the longer i looked i realized that they were flying too high to be geese and too low to be an airplane.  As they got closer I began to notice that they were breaking off in to separate groups and then coming back together in a perfect line or v-shape, then they would do it again.  By the time they were directly overhead I was so overwhelmed that i didn't notice that my camera was turned off and wasn't clicking.  the hispanic family and i were all shouting back and forth and pointing up at the sky but we couldn't understand each other because of the language barrier.  By this time it was unquestionable that what was passing over us was a group of between 7 and 9 objects that were moving silently and independently as they flashed brightly in a pulsating way, chaning from black to bright white.  i finally figured out that my camera was turnede off and got a shot of them as they moved off towards the southwest.  the photo that i got back shows these lights grouped together in a weird pattern but it's really small.

I had just stepped out on the porch and was admiring the clear night sky when an object traveling very, very fast crossed from the south to the north.  It caught my eye because I thought it was a shooting star, but then I realized that it was flying within earth's atmosphere. Moreover, it had least 3 distinguishable bright orange lights in an oblong formation.  It was too dark for me to make out the outline of the vessel itself. It flew at about the height on the horizon as a plane would, but was totally silent and at about 10 times faster -- it took about 10 seconds for it to cross the sky.  To reconfirm my thought that it could not possibly be a plane that had just passed, moments later one in fact did fly by (presumably coming from SeaTac airport as they often do), and I could make out its shape, hear it clearly, and it was much slower than what I had just seen. I took out my journal and wrote: ""3/13/01: It's dark and I can't see to write well.  I just saw something cruise through the night sky.

But after the vivid clarity of this one last night, I felt almost driven to find out what's going on here...This dream was in very specific detail and extremely clear and in color. Last nights, had a combination of disc shaped aircraft and what looked like shining mercury-like material craft...they were zipping across the sky in the Seattle sky leaving a golden haze colored trail behind them. Several large ships with cylindrical engines on the sides and a round disc in the center of the engines (like the Star Trek ship only with the disk in the middle of the engines and other complex connective elements between the engines and disc (which was a dark green color) I noticed a small US Flag decal on the bottom of the craft and some other symbols. I also saw what looked like several aircraft but they were unusual, they seemed to be escorting the other craft. The aircraft looked like overblown A10 warthog jets...except the engines were huge and they were very smooth on the surface...with some non reflective material that was dark green almost black in color. When I was about 14 years old (I'm 42 now) I had a dream like this about similar ships landing at Moon Island near Hoquiam, Washington (in the 1970s) in that dream I called a good friend (who can witness this) ((name deleted)), and told him to look up in the sky...and he set the phone down (this is all in the dream) and went out to look into the sky...when I went back out to look up at the crafts all I saw left was what appeared to be one large star that broke into three pieces one fell over towards Moon Island (I was in Aberdeen) the other started desending toward me and I saw one headed towards ((name deleted)) direction several blocks North... A cylindrical object that looked very much like the old Apollo command module softly landed in my front yard and I called ((name deleted)) back and told him and he said something that looked like the LEM landed in his. Now here's the freaky part... the next day (this is NOT a dream) I was telling him my dream and he literally turned white because he had the SAME dream from HIS perspective...and remembers my phone call. Since then I've had many, many of the ship dreams and they are in incredibly detailed, color...I can see every detail of the ships...and I always wake up excited and hopeful like we're getting closer to something. I hope I haven't wasted your time...maybe this can help in some way, maybe it's nothing...but I just felt led to share this with you and if you have any suggestions or can offer any help about others that have had this dream or know what's goin gon I'd appreciate it. I hope I haven't wasted your time, but since I don't know if these are physical, psychic, spiritual or interdimensional issues, a dream constitutes on level of contact or reality to me and should be noted incase something else ties into it and can help you with your research… ((NUFORC Note:  We traditionally do not post reported dream sequences, since they are impossible to document.

On December, 9th, 2000, about 9PM, while driving north, on Dutch Ridge Road, in Brighton Township, PA. alone, after having attending a funeral gathering, I noticed two bright, non-blinking lights of equal size, moving in unison, side by side (horizontally) in the northwest sky, behind some trees. The left light was a yellow-white color which, equalled the brilliance of an approaching aircraft headlight but, slightly larger and less ""amber"" in color. The light just to its right was of equal size but very red. It resembled a red traffic light more than, an aircraft's smaller red running lights. These lights were moving slowly and in an area where I don't usually see planes flying that low. After catching glimpses of them, behind trees, I drove onto Maplewood Drive and stopped my car, for a better look. The craft was, now, almost overhead and it seemed, unusually large (about two or three fingers wide, at arms length). It's altitude seemed low, too and, if it were flying at an airliner's altitude than, it would have been huge. Except for the five lights, on its underside the craft was very dark and, barely moving. On its underside were three dim, non-blinking, rounded, yellow-white lights, one at each corner. At the center of its underside were two smaller, alternately pulsing lights, one red with a smaller, white light, beside it. These alternately, pulsing lights, created a confusing mix of red, pink and white flashing light with a very faint, pinkish haze flickering beneath it. But none of these lights were as large nor as bright, as, those seen during the craft's approach and departure. While overhead, the object seemed to be barely moving, yet, rotating slightly, to its right (about 20 degrees in 5 seconds). After this turn, it then, began to move, noticeably, forward and gradually, it picking up speed. Only then, did I notice that this triangle was flying backwards, with two corners towards its front and one towards its rear. As it flew towards the southern horizon or towards Vanport, I saw three large, bright, non-blinking, hazy, yellow-white lights, evenly spaced (horizontally) in a row, across its rear side. This craft seemed to be flying into a hazy, gray luminous fog as it departed. This haze might have been only the effects from lights from town but, then, I've never noticed large, bright, hazy, yellow-white lights, like these, on any aircraft, at night. I didn't notice any sound. My car's engine might have masked them, though. This sighting's duration was about 60 to 90 seconds. I've now, had three triangular sightings, all within a mile of each other. The first was during the summer of 1999 and the seconds was in February of 2000. Both flew with one or more immensely smaller companion crafts. All three occurred around 9PM.",2000-12-20T00:00:00,40.6974,-80.3735

I would like to start-out by saying that I am an expert on aircraft and flying, and can honestly saw that this object was not an aircraft, helicopter, or meteor, or any other man-made object.  The night went as follows:  My 2 friends and I were driving NNW on Highway 161 near Puyallup, WA when we saw an bronze-colored object fly overhead at an elevation of approx. 5500' above sea level. The object was traveling at a very high rate of speed, around 700-750 mph, but showed no signs of it's propulsion system(i.e. afterburner flames,exhaust,etc.)  I could detect no noise being emitted from the object either.(Aircraft that fly that fast are most often VERY loud at low elevations.)  We followed it until it disappeared from sight approx.60-70 miles away.  It followed a straight path and did not change altitude or speed.  The object ""blinked-out"" at about 70 miles away.  One interesting piece of information is that it flew directly through the upwind leg of the landing pattern of Seatac Airport at a very dangerous altitude, violating FAA regulations.  Also, judging by its flight path, it most likely violated the airspace of McChord AFB also.  The AM radio in my car had slightly more static during the time when the object was overhead. I am more than willing to talk about it further.  Please call with any other questions.  Thank you for your services.",2001-03-06T00:00:00,47.14574063670412,-122.2924202247191

Searching the sky I could see the tiny, sporadic contrails which are often emitted during these daily flights.  Then I noticed a white light in a stationary position in the Northeast.  It was in the general area of where the jet had been training but it did not move for several minutes.  I had to take my eyes away for a few moments to attend to something.  When I searched the sky again, I saw that the object was now perched much nearer and appeared to have some solidity to it, though it mostly appeared as a reflective type of light.  It did look bigger and was in a more overhead location.  I positioned myself just under some telephone wires so I could better gauge any movement of the light.  It either remained very stationary, or would drift in irregular movements from time to time.  I watched it come into what appeared to be a nearer location- more overhead.  Its appearance of some kind of hard object grew more apparent.  I could almost determine the object to have a slight cylindrical, or oblong shape.  The jets that had been present earlier faded with their sound into the distance.  Just as the object was nearing a directly overhead position, I went to see if I could find my friend M who was outside somewhere nearby.  I did find him and we proceeded to both observe the object hold still, then drift, now apparently away from us.  Soon, I left M to watch and I went to find a pair of binoculars.  My son helped me look but we were unsuccessful.  Then my son and I joined M in observing the object for several more minutes as it alternated between moments of stillness and movement.  As it continued in a southerly direction, it appeared to either glow brighter with its own light or reflect more off of the sun.  This continued until it faded in the southern distance.  This daytime sighting comes after 2 nightime sightings of similar events at night 3 and 2 nights before- which were not reported here.

Black diamond-shaped object w/three bright white lights crossed I-84 and headed west paralleling highway towards Hudson River.,Fishkill,NY,2001-02-21T20:15:00,diamond,10 Minutes,"Occurred : 2/21/2001 20:15  (Entered as : 022101 20:15) Reported: 2/22/2001 09:13 Posted: 2/24/2001 Location: Fishkill, NY Shape: Diamond Duration:10 Minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16592.html,"Black diamond-shaped object w/three bright white lights crossed I-84 and headed west paralleling highway towards Hudson River. Heading west on I-84, approaching exit 13 (Fishkill, NY), as the highway crests a ridge and drops into a valley there is a panoramic view of the sky.  As usual, I scanned the sky for lights, and saw the usual assortment of recognizable aircraft lights.  However, at my 1:00 position (approx. NW), I saw a group of three very white bright lights in a straight line, close enough to each other that my initial reaction was that they couldn't be separate aircraft.  They were also much lower than aircraft in the area typically fly.  As I continued west, I tried to gauge the object's motion relative to mine.  While I initially thought the object was travelling east, opposite me, it began a banking manouver which carried it perpendicularly across the highway directly in front of me, approximately 1/4 mile away, and only a couple of hundred feet up at most.  Though it was night, there was more than enough ambient lighting from the surrounding area, so as the object crossed my path while banked to it's right side I could see it's bottom, which was a black diamond shape, with three bright white lights across it.  There were no discernable wings - it was as though I was looking at a large, black kite.  Two of the lights were at opposite points of the diamond, with the third in the middle.  Since the object was banked over, the three lights were in a vertical line.  The object continued it's turn, then levelled out at treetop height and continued westbound towards the Hudson River, paralleling the highway but on the other side from me.  My exit came up and I pulled off, then watched until the object left my field of view. When I first observed the craft, I called my girlfriend at home (appox. 2 miles from my position) intending to ask her to go outside and look for the object.  When she answered I didn't have a chance to ask, as right away she started telling me that she was watching an object from the house.  We agreed that it was the same craft, and she was able to view it for a minute or two after it left my view.  She had initially noticed it through the living room window, due to it's bright, unusually configured lights and low altitude. Though I've always believed that our planet is (and has been throughout history) visited by extraterrestrials, I've never witnessed anything like this myself.  This area of the Hudson Valley is known for many sightings, particularly during the early 1980's.  Having spent five years in the Air Force with a keen interest and familiarity with most types of aircraft, I know that what I saw was not a conventional aircraft.  This was not an instance of ambigous/anomalous lights in the sky.  I saw a distinct shape to the object.  Furthermore, it's flight characteristics were unusual.  Not in the sense of speed or extreme manouverability, but more regarding it's flight path.  Even if, for arguements sake, it was a military aircraft of unconventional design (Stewart AFB is nearby), I can't understand why it would fly so low as it crossed over a heavily travelled interstate highway, then descend to treetop level and parallel the road... As soon as I got home I continued to search the sky for another glimpse, and turned on the scanners, all in vain.  The morning paper didn't carry any stories about it, but hopefully others saw it and will report their sighting(s).  Tonight I plan to call the tower at Stewart and ask if they received any reports or tracked anything themselves.",2001-02-24T00:00:00,41.5277,-73.9072

TIME: 5:19 pm, U.S. east coast time, still daylight out, sun was above the treetops. LOCATION: Charlotte County (northern southwest Florida, on the Gulf of Mexico). EVENT: I was outside my home, returning from my mailbox and spotted a contrail in progress above my location. There were other contrails in the sky nearer the horizon, some criss-crossing. With the unaided eye, the size of the contrail was about half the width of a pencil at arm's length, with an elongated object about half the size of a pencil tip traveling in front of it. What was unusual was that the object was displaying a single reddish-orange glow or light along its length. I rushed and got a pair of binoculars and observed that the object appeared to be a conventional looking passenger or cargo jet, except for one big difference: its fuselage, at least the underside portion observable to me on the ground, was glowing or radiating a uniform bright reddish-orange color (not a point of light, but the entire length of the fuselage). The wings were normal in appearance, not glowing or lighted, and appeared, from the great distance, to be white, tan, or gray. Two contrails were forming a short distance behind the aircraft, which then combined into a single contrail (a normal occurrence). The aircraft was traveling southward along the Gulf Coast of Florida, yet slightly inland. The nearest international airport it could have flown out of is in Sarasota, and then north of that, in Tampa, where there is also a major headquarters-status  U.S. Air Force base (the Gulf War was managed from there). Since the sun was still above the treetops and there was no evidence of any sunset activity in the sky (even if there was, the aircraft would have needed a mirrored  fuselage to reflect the level of light seen), I lowered my binoculars and rushed inside the open side door to my garage to get a video camera I keep on a shelf and back outside. I timed it after the event and my eyes were off the aircraft only 8 seconds. When I looked back up in the sky, all I saw was the contrail cut off in its tracks where I had seen it last and no aircraft. I searched with my binoculars and couldn't locate any evidence of it, which should have still been visible. I wish now I had kept observing the jet with the binoculars for those 8 seconds. Was what I saw an exotic new U.S. stealth aircraft fitted with a skin of light panels that could allow it to blend into the sky upon activation, or is there a conventional explanation? I don't know.  All I can do is report what I observed. I've witnessed one other definitely exotic stealth aircraft earlier in my life, totally different than this incident, but some things need and deserve continued secrecy.",2001-02-24T00:00:00,,

There is a bypass just before Ballater which lets you miss going all the way through the village. At about 7.15pm, 400 yards or so from the bypass turn off, both Peter and I looked up to our left and saw an object in the sky. It was triangular, looked to be grey in colour and its predominant feature was that it had 3 large blue lights at each point (but not on the very tips). These lights were not flickering or flashing and did not appear to emit any beams as such. It also looked as if there were white/grey laser beams coming out from the opposite side of the object (to the blue lights) however, it may have been the 'top' of the object lit up by more lights. The object looked to be about the size of a house. I have been calling it an object but it definately was some kind of aircraft as it was hovering maybe 200 yards above the trees to the side of the road. I could hear what seemed to be a helicopter, however, if the helicopter had been overhead, it would have been much noisier and what I heard was a muted rotor sound. There was no sign of any other aircraft such as a helicopter nearby. When I heard this noise I assumed that it must be a helicopter because of the relative proximity that this craft would have been to Balmoral Castle (7 miles approx). I believe that the airspace around the castle is restricted and that it is monitored so if there are any unauthorised aircraft in or nearby this area, the airforce scramble jets etc to investigate. There were no jets which I found strange but perhaps it was outside the restriction zone.

I only watched it for maybe two minutes, and it ""Blinked out"" as it had never been there. There were no clouds around it.It also seemed to have a haze around it, that would come and go, depending on how bright it would get. Then tonight, I was letting my cat outside, as it is nice out tonight, at about 5:50, and there it was again!(A very bright light in the sky.)

This occured at 5:58 pm, this Sunday.  I didn't drive, so I was passing the time looking at landmarks, lights, and stars in the sky.  As we were passing Benicia on hwy 680, I noticed, at my 1 o'clock, what at first appeared to be a low-level aircraft passing to our right.  What caught my eye is that it didn't have standard lighting: I saw no red/green indicator lights, tail lights, forward lights.  My attention was drawn to a light or lights on what appeared to be the leading edge of the object, gold in color, and blinking in a random fashion.  I would almost describe this point-source as ""sparkling"".  Within a few seconds of my initial sighting, this point-source grew in size.  At that point, the light would ""blink"" randomly, and as it did so, it would grow into a triangle whose longest sides pointed down.  The triangular light'(s)  downward-facing vertex was approx. 4 times as tall as the shortest side.  All edges of the light were of the same sharpness and intensity.  As the light grew, it appeared to be composed on many smaller lights, and it continued to blink in an irregular fashion. Naturally, this caught my attention, since it didn't exhibit conventional aircraft lighting or other recognizable features.  I continued to watch as it appeared to angle away from the bearing of the highway.  It appeared to grow distant, and the shape of leading-edge light returned to a point source, which appeared to sparkle.  As I continued to watch, there was one point where this object was briefly illuminated, perhaps by city lights (it appeared to be reflected light)  It was at this point I could see a lighter outline in the night sky.  My first impression was the shape was similar to a blimp, except it was more elongated, and the ""ends"" of the shape weren't at all like a blimp (no stabilizers or canopies were visible).  The shape ended in squared-off points, and the edges leading to the more curved shape in the middle appeared jagged. Otherwise, the shape was roughly elliptical, with the long axis approx. 3 times longer than the short axis. The point-source was clearly on the front ""point"", and the light appeared to change shape randomly.  I saw this object for about 30 seconds, from 30 to 15 degrees from the horizon (its apparent position lowered over time), and when the illuminated shape subtended about the width of a nickel at arm's length.",2000-12-09T00:00:00,38.11290000000001,-122.1331

Sometime before 0402 hours today, have the feeling I was visited.  For the past five years (since 1995) while sleeping have dreamed that my house, a two story is tilting to the west and crashing into the street.  This morning, I awoke for some reason.  I lay awake and suddenly hear a low frequency buz or vibration and then hear noise, not sure what it was but almost at the same time sense I and my entire house tilting again to the west as one.  I said ... gee, my house is going to colapse on top of me.  I braced or tried to brace myself for this (thinking maybe an earthquake as the noise preceeding this reminded me of an earthquake when I lived in Japan) and expecting to hear furniture hitting each other as well as the west wall.  I mean the angle was about 45 degrees now.  However, I neither heard furniture slamming into anything and to my amazement, my ceiling fan was turning as normal and not at an angle.  That clued me into something weird.  All this time while I was trying to brace myself, but then I realized I was fully imobilized, could not move any limb or my head.  The only thing that would move were my eyes and they were open.  At this time, I forgot about the tilting effect when I looked to my right toward my skylight and see a beam of blue light that I sensed was searching and it found me.  To my left (west side) I also saw light coming from the window.  I realized somethign was not right, yet could not move let alone get up.  I now felt as if made semi unconcious yet fully awake and being examined in bed.  I looked around and could only make out a small dark figure to my left, above my head and to my right.  To my astonishment, directly in front and a little to the right of me about 10 ft away I saw what appeared to be a holograhic figure or what tried to be one, or perhaps that was the beam of light that found me.   I asked these thing what they wanted, but got no response and sensed they were intent on examining me.  I definately experienced fear! , yet no thing I could do.  Then suddenly it stopped, and they left at least it felt that way, and I look quickly at the clock and it was 0402 hours.

Actually, I found this site while searching the internet for photos to try to identify what I have seen. And to be honest, it's the first time that I've actually come to ""grips"" with what I've seen and decided to try to get to the bottom of it. My sightings have been numerous the past six years but this is the first time I have seen them early enough in the evening to get my husband and my son to look also. You may think I'm nuts (I know I did until I had witnesses to it) and I hope that you don't have a text limit to this report because I have quite a lot to tell. Although I'm reporting a sighting of four craft tonight, January 1, 2001, I'd like to begin by telling you about the first time I saw this craft and the events thereafter. It was about 6 years ago and I woke at about 3:15 AM. From where I was sleeping, I could see out the window that faces to the east. I saw what first appeared to be a twinkling star in the distance over the treetops but I noticed that it had colored lights and it was moving incredibly fast. So I closed my eyes and opened them again and tried to focus on it, thinking I was seeing things. It went zipping around the sky, up and down, left and right, like nothing I'd ever seen. So I got out of bed and went to the window and watched it. I kept blinking my eyes, thinking I can't be really seeing this...but I was. And then it zipped off out of sight. A few months later, I was cleaning out a mobile home on our property that had belonged to the original owners (an elderly couple) of our house and they used it for a summer home for years while they lived in California. I found a box of photos and in it was a VERY CLEAR picture from 1967 of a ""flying saucer"" over the same treetops that I had seen this flying object, only it was taken in broad daylight. I showed it to my husband and said it sure looked like a UFO and that I had seen one in the night some months ago. Anyways, I mailed that packet of photos to the owners in California and they have since passed away. I am going to contac! t her so n to see if I can retrieve that one photo. Since that time, I have seen these same lights in the sky on many occasions and always in the same place. I live in Maine and about 30 miles from Brunswick NAS so I've always kind of hoped what I'm seeing is just some kind of military secret and not something extra-terrestrial. Here's the real kicker though. This past summer, I was sitting at the picnic table in the backyard talking with my husband. The day was overcast with cumulus type clouds...not really low in the sky but not terribly high either. I remember they were gray looking and seemed to promise a storm. While we were talking I saw a triangular craft with four very large ""balls"" of light on it appear briefly just below a cloud and then disappear back into it. I said to my husband, ""What the hell was that?"" He didn't see it as he was facing me but recalls me mentioning it to him. That's always bothered me what it was. And while looking around the internet tonight for what the heck it is I've been seeing out there to the east, I happened to come onto a picture of what I saw in the western sky. It was the same triangular craft with the four lights that I've found on a number of sites like the sighting in Belgium in the late 1980s. Well, that's pretty scary! I freaked out and made my husband come look at the photo. I wanted to pass that one up as some kind of military craft too but it was just so huge and now I've seen a photo of it seen by someone else on the other side of the world! Sheesh! But again, I live close to a Naval Air Station and was raised a ""Navy Brat"" and I just suspected it was classified military stuff even though it sure seemed strange at the time. Been around airplanes all my life. Sorry for rambling here but there is just so much to tell that I have kept locked up for the past 6 years. Anyways....I have seen the ""craft"" I saw tonight on many occasions and more in the last year than in the prior 6 years. It stays pretty much stationery and always appears in the same place in the sky no! matter what time of year. Call me silly but I've always thought that if I watched it too closely, it might start watching me. That's kind of the way that it acted the first time I saw it 6 years ago. So, when I've seen it, I just kind of tried to put it out of my mind and pretend it wasn't there. Okay, here comes the part when you will think that I am totally crazy but I need to tell you this so you will understand why I made a real effort to try to see more of this sighting tonight. Last Summer, it was about midnight, and I was up late reading in the livingroom. My husband was in bed and I heard a car drive up, slow down and pull into my driveway. My first thought was ""Who the heck is coming here this time of night?"" We live in the country, we never go anywhere and we rarely have visitors at night, especially late. So...I got up and went to the front door and looked out and it was MY car that had pulled into the driveway and it was still running! Okay, okay, I know you think I'm either nuts or making this up but my husband will tell you that it happened. He woke when he heard the car pull in and thought the same thing I did...who could be coming here? And I called my parents in Florida a few days later and told them of this. They can tell you it happened. This could be related or not related but I have to add it into this report since it is a real mystery that we can't solve. Anyways, right after that, I started seeing this craft in the sky more frequently and tonight it started with the usual one in the usual place. I decided to become brave and try to take a closer look at it. It was quite a ways off..as the crow flies the coast is probably 15 miles from us to the east...and it seems to sit near there...quite a ways in the distance. I first spotted it at 7:00 PM tonight when I took the dog out. It always seems like a twinkling star but I see the colored lights on it. I went in and asked my husband where his binoculars were. He said, ""Why do you want them?"" I said I'm going to look at a UFO that has been bugg! ing me f or years. I wish I had a telescope because that thing sat there for 3 1/2 hours without moving much. It moved three times...all three times that it did move was when an airplane entered the airway between where I am and it was. Each time, the craft blinked red and green lights more frequently (more like a plane's lights will) as the airplane would near the area of space it was in, and it would move horizontally and a bit vertically. When the airplane passed, it stopped and remained stationery until the next plane came along. About 75 minutes after I spotted this first craft, a second one appeared. I watched it approach from the north and take up a position above and to the left of where the original craft sat. About that time, I told my husband there were two of them out there now. He started to take me serious and went out with the binoculars to look and agrees that he's never seen anything like it. About an hour later, two more showed up, each taking a position to the left and north of the previous. But I just checked outside and can only see the original, still there but has moved a bit north. The others are no longer visible. So there you have it. I'm glad I have finally told someone about this...it's been bugging me for years. I would love to receive a rational explanation for all this. I don't know if you respond to these reports, but I would appreciate hearing from you and if you have had similar reports and if you know what this is.",2001-01-03T00:00:00,,

They appeared to be within two hundred feet of the tree tops. We pulled over and watched them for several minutes. It was like watching two lazer lights dance in the sky.

Thsi light was brighter than any I have ever encountered.  At first I thought it might be sheet lightning and waited for thunder to follow. It never came. This light was so intense that it blinded everything around it.  I thought to myself how unusually bright the flashes were.  It had not been raining, the weather was clear, there was no wind and several stars could be seen.  I also noticed that there was absolutely no noise and did not hear a helecopter, airplane or machinery of any kind.  Approximately 5 minutes or less, after the bright, flashing lights, the front windows of our house rattled.  It reminded me of the rattling I used to hear when planes would break the sound barrier.  However, again, I heard no sound of planes, missles, helecopters etc.  We are very used to hearing those types of aircraft as the Naval Missle Base is here on our island. Later that morning, the radio was busy with callers around our small island who reported seeing the same or similar observations.  No one at the Missle Base has commented or taken any responsibility for any activity in the area at that hour.  One radio caller reported her sighting as a blue/white light dropping from the sky.

The night was clear, cloudless and cold with the temperature hovering around 0 degrees F.  The light was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and at first I thought it was a star because of the twinkling light it emitted.  But it seemed too bright and low on the horizon to be a star or a planet.  I continued to drive north on Route 83 and then merged onto Interstate 55 (Stevenson Expressway) heading in a southwest direction. The light was still in the same position when I headed southwest on I-55; the time now was about 7:15 p.m.  I still thought that the light was probably a star at this time.  About 15 minutes later I passed Route 53 in Bolingbrook, IL and the object remained in the same position.  At this time I ruled out that it was a commercial jet/plane coming in to land at O'Hare International airport.  All planes coming in to land at O'Hare will fly by within 5 - 10 minutes; it had now been 20 minutes since I first spotted the light.  Within the next few minutes I noticed the light to twinkle more and once or twice blink out for between 1/2 to 1 seconds (this is only an approximation).  There also seemed to be a slight change in altitude in that the light descended just a bit.  I then exited I-55 and proceeded north on Weber Road (between Bolingbrook and Romeoville, IL).  I then turned west onto 119th St. and drove several miles further to Book Rd. (just south of Naperville, IL across from the Naperville polo club) and turned south onto Book Rd. stopping to observe the light from a stationary position.  At the same time a white pickup truck also stopped on Book Rd. behind me just north of 119th (to observe the light I assume).  The light remained hovering in the sky in a position WSW of me.  I was now close enough to it to discern only that it was no! t a star .  Its altitude was not easy to determine, but I did notice that planes, some distance behind the light flying into O'Hare airport, were higher.  After a minute or two the light grew in intensity and became very bright, it appeared to twinkle with multiple red and white lights.  At this time (now about 7:45 p.m.) I decided to get out of the car to take a picture, but I was too late.  The light disappeared.

On arriving home shortly after dark, I noticed an odd light low in the southeastern sky.  Getting out of the car, my son and I watched a perfectly round, light yellow ball glow eerily for at least ten minutes.  The ball was about 1.5 to 2 degrees in diameter.  In binoculars, it was an unevenly lit ball that would occasionally flare up brightly or dim down to nothing.  Although it did not change position in the sky while we watched it, we did notice a wobble that on close inspection appeared to be the motion of this ball around a central axis.   My son says that when I entered our home to retrieve the camera, he observed the ball fall and rise 3-5 degrees with a falling-leaf type motion.  Although an entire disc could be seen, under magnification, the glow of the disc was not even.  It was more brightly lit at the 7 o'clock position, and faded to near darkness at the 2 o'clock position.  Though this seems more consistent with external lighting, none was observed, and both of us feel that the object was emitting visible light.  No other lights were associated with this object. Although estimating distance of this object would be very hard, my guess would be at least five miles, maybe as far as twenty five.  The ball remained fixed in the southeastern sky, 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon.  The lighting of the object appeared to be internal.  I thought maybe it was a balloon or blimp lit internally for some reason, but it did not seem to move or behave the way I'd expect.  Except for the axial motion, the object I observed was rock-steady in the sky.  We first saw it about 18:00, and about fifteen minutes later, it just winked out. The lights of several aircraft were observed in the same binocular field during the sighting.  The object did not appear to react to the aircraft, or vice versa.

Just before five in the morning I awoke (as I often do several times a night to roll-over) when I noticed a bright light bouncing around outside the window.  I looked at it for a while without my glasses, concluded it deserved a better look because of the brightness and the motion (which I couldn't dismiss as a tree branch waiving in front of a star or an airplane), put my glasses on and went to the window.  There was an object of moderately bright light (as bright as the moon had been hours earlier) with occasional fainter white and red pulses associated with it in the sky to the WSW, just more than halfway up (50-55 degrees?) from the horizon.  The object did not appear to be very close, but it kept skipping around that sector of the sky.  There were also two eratically moving objects farther to the West, perhaps 20 degrees above the horizon, which appeared as a single bright light.  I couldn't tell much about the two distant objects--only that they were ""bouncing around"" and moving in the sky.  The nearer object zigzagged about, sometimes nearer, sometimes farther (although always fairly distant).  I observed for almost half an hour.  I looked at the objects both straight-on and with my perhipheral vision and they appeared the same. I noted the position of several stars and, since I watched for a fair bit of time, noted how the stars moved.  These objects (even the far ones) did not move with the celestial bodies.  That is, I could tell that the sector of sky they were bouncing-around in was moving relative to the stars. Ocassionally, fainter objects appeared in the sky, but I think those were stars...they didn't bounce around.  An airplane at altitude flew over, but did not appear at all like the objects and did not interact with the objects.  As time wore on the near object gradually was working its way to the SW and wasn't getting any closer.  I decided I'd seen the best I was going to see and it was time to get back to sleep.

Just as I had lit the ciggarette a what I thought to be a shooting star appered out of the corner of my eye.  The only thing unussuall about this paticular shooting star was that it was fairly large, headed straight for the ground, instead of accross the sky, and it was so bright yellow I had never seen anything like it before. Then as soon as the shooting star faded, directly behind it I saw 4-5 very faint but organized what appered to be stars.  Except that these stars shaped like a rounded triangle.  And by that mean the lines we not straight but instead curved just so. Another characteristic that ws very peculier was that they to have moved very slowly but always staying the excattly the same distance apart.  Which may suggest 4-5 objects flying in formation or one large ship with just its perimiter lights on for lack of a better term. So in other words it just defined the outline of the ship.  The ship came out of the Eastern sky heading west at about 10 miles an hour tops, assumeing that in flying terms that is very slow. It almost seemed to creep along at a snails pace.  After heading west for about two solid minutes it then turned south and headed directly towards south mountain where alot of other sightings have accured.  I also believe that this is the same ship that was wittnessed on march 16 1997 over presscott, paulden, glendale, and then finnally in Tucson all on the same night.  This triangle shaped ship seems to almost haunt Phoenix, Presscott, and all of Arizona.

I watched it for a few minutes and then ran inside to get my binoculars. When I came back out, I did not see it. My friend pulled up at that time and ran out to my backyard to see what I was doing. As I was telling him about it a military fighter aircraft came right out of the sky. It swooped over the trees, low enough that we could read the writing on the wings. We got in my buddy's truck and turned on the cb radio. We heard what we thought were two pilots. One said ""I can't see it it's on ! my backside"" another said ""I am dropping down to get a better look"". That was all we heard.

It was quite cold with several inches of snow on the ground.   As we approached the university observatory my buddy noticed that the dome doors were open, there was some light inside and that the upper end of the telescope could be seen swinging back and forth in the opening about every ten seconds.  When we were passing the building, we saw that the entrance door was open, in spite of the cold, and we were curious enough at that point to enter the ground floor.  It was a fairly small building, round and perhaps about 20 to 25 feet across. In the center, some kind of support for a small telescope had been constructed  to hold the telescope mount about 10-12 feet above the floor. This was surrounded by a grille platform.  The telescope  was a refractor about6 - 7 feet long.  The man using the telescope was walking it back and forth rapidly the lengh ot the dome opening.When we began to climb the stairs to the platform, he swung around to look and then exclaimed ""Thank god you guys are here.  Come and look and tell me I'm not crazy!""Explaining that he had seen something strange in the starry sky, he asked us to each look at whatever he had been observing and not mention what we saw until all of us had a good look.  The two of us each had, I believe, about 2-3 minutes for the initial observation, with the telescope fixed in position.  This was an old instrument, in good condition, but dating probably to the late 1800's, and not very powerful.  It was a cold, very clear winter night.  The star field seemed very rich to someone like myself who had grown up near New York City.  As I began my observation, a moving light entered the field and traversed it completely in, I would guess, about 5-6 seconds. The astronomer told me to keep looking.  I wasn't counting, but I would guess that within another 20-30 seconds the next light appeared, and then another and another.....until I had seen ten or twelve.  At this point I turned it over to my friend, Dick, and he made his observation.  Fun! But what were we looking at? Comparing notes, it quickly became obvious we were all seeing the same objects. There was an unending stream of eliptical or circular objects crossing the heavens, obliterating stars as they passed at a high rate of speed.  They were apparently navigating an unseen highway, because each followed the same track.   The only details visible through that telescope were a gray bottom surface, slightly lighter than the night sky background(possibly starlight reflected from snowfields far below, but maybe not)and a thin bright yellow orange trailing edge which seemed to ripple slightly.   Some were a little brighter than others.  None of usrally had any ideas what we might be looking at, but the astronomer assured us he'd never seen anything like it.. he then released the telescope so that it could be moved freely, and we were able to track these objects from zenith almost to the horizon, a traverse that only took about 15 to 20 seconds, I think.  We each looked at another 25 to 30 or so, and then decided to call it a night, as neither of us was dressed to stand around in that weather. The other recollection which comes back to me clearly was that each of these craft, or whatever they were, arrived at approximately the same area the track they were following and appeared to make a little hop to one side and continue without losing speed, perhaps following a magnetic line to the north.  With the naked eye, they were essentially invisible in the starfield.   We never met the astronomer again, although Dick and I discussed it a number of times.",,43.05037092436975,-76.157063697479

We heard a low pitch humming noise and looked out the back window of the car to locate the noise and saw a series of very bright lights. I believe they were just white but that detail is not clear to me now. The craft which was disk shaped was either on the ground or hovering very close to it. We both watched the craft rise up off the ground 20 feet or so and lower. It then rose up vertically above the trees and then took off in a diagonal path across the sky with spectacular speed. Needless to say we were scared to death and as he drove to get out of there I followed the bright light in the sky scared to death it would follow us....it did not.

The object consumed the evening sky and the paddoch behind my fathers farm, 20 years on I can still clearly see the immense size and clour when I recall the sighting. The object was a fireball orange, against the evening blackness it stood out very clearly, The size of the object was as large as a football field, it had 3 d qualities so I assume it was round in shape, It had no distingushing features on its surface only the intense orange glow, It was landed on the ground approxiamtely half a mile away in a clearing,The instant i focussed upon the object it very slowly lifted itsself off the ground, the sheer size and toital lack of any sound still haunts me, The object stabilised then very smoothly and quickly accerated in a vertical line. It was very obvious the object had the ability to accerate quickly, the time to see it and watch it begin to acler to apoint wher it was stable above the groond was approxiamtely 5 seconds, the rate of climb was very uniform and the rate of acceration was noticably faster as each second passed.

When I was about 7 years old, I had my first sighting of an unexplained craft.  My mother and I were driving from Hunt, TX into Kerrville, TX to buy something at the grocery store one night.  As soon as we came out of the tree-covered road from our house I spotted a gloriously beautiful, long, diamond-shaped craft right outside the car window.  It was on the other side of the treeline from the road, but clearly visible as it couldn't have been but a few feet from the road.  Instead of sharp angles, it resembled more like two cones with their bases put together.  It was maybe the size of a grain silo in diameter.  It was covered in lights, with seemingly no rhyme or reason to the layout.  The lights were different colors and flashed in a seeming non-pattern.  I turned to tell my mother to look out the window and noticed she was scared to death.  We were driving about 80 or so, as fast as she could get our car to go, and she was froggy.  Her reaction frightened me, and I asked her agian to look.  She told me to ignore it, there was nothing out there, stop looking at it.  Such an odd reply, so I ignored her and looked anyway.  This craft followed us into town, and just before we hit any traffic, it hovered for a few moments then almost winked out of existance.  There was no noise, no odd feelings, no ""sense"" of being watched.  It was just there, mere yards from us for miles.  My mother briefed me on not telling anyone anything, and that it was my imagination, but she was deathly afraid of something.  To this day she denies it.  We never told anyone.  However, about a week later my brother comes home from night fishing all breathless and excited.  He was about ten at the time.  His story went like this:  He was down on the low water crossing with a friend and they were packing up their fishing supplies.  He states the coolest thing happened next.  I huge craft appeared out of nowhere right above them on the low water crossing.  He described my sighting to the letter, and when he did I looked at my mother a! nd she w ent pale but looked at me to shut me up.  So I did. He then went to say that it hovered there, and he said there was no actual sound, but you could feel a faint buzzing in your body.  It then, he claimed, emitted a very bright, foggy, blue light onto him and his friend and he said it felt warm and tingly.  The best description for me to give you would be like a sonogram treatment after about 30 minutes of continuous treatment.  He said he still heard no sound, doesn't remember anything actually happeneing other than the tingly light.  Then all of a sudden the light was gone and the craft just vanished into thin air.  We have had a few episodes in Texas as children, together.  But to my knowledge I have seen no unusual craft in my adult life.  No one in the family will admit this now, but all three of us witnessed something interesting.  Just wondered how many other people have seen a similar craft as mine and where.

It was heading basically toward San Francisco. Initially I assumed it to be a Navigation light of a large plane. I assumed it was coming in for a landing at San Franisco Airport. It began to lose altitude and surprisingly it came toward me and in front of me across the bay at a distance of perhaps a mile. Again I assumed it to be perhaps a helicopter now although to me it was still a round red ball of brilliant light. To my surprise it suddenly dove right into the bay and the light went out and whatever it was disappeared completely. It's speed at impact must have been aproximately 100 mph.

I had a weird feeling I was being watched.  So I looked around and saw (the only way I can really describe it) is like a silver space suit type thing on the side of the house.  But it was only there for one second.  From where I was standing I could see both sides of the house.  One second later it was on the other corner.  Then back again.  I don't know if there was several or if that one just moved faster than light.  I wasn't afraid of them.  I was scared because it was unknown to me.  I started shaking and went into the house and never said a word to anyone in my family.  When I walked in the front door I locked it and deadbolted it.  I walked upstairs and saw my family all watching a T.V. show.  I didn't say anything, because I thought they would think I was crazy.  I went to the big patio door and locked that to.  Then I went to take a shower.  As I was in the shower, the house started to shake and I heard this loud noise.  I hurried up and got out and threw my clothes on and ran into the living room.  My dad was the only one there.  I said ""where is everyone"", and he said outside watching a spaceship or something.  I went running outside and my mother and brothers and sisters were watching this thing that they said had come out of our woods and shot to the sky so fast and was making this loud noise.  All I could see was the dot way up in the sky.  They said it shot out of the woods so fast you couldn't see what it was.  At that time I told my mom my little story.  I don't think she would have believed me, but she said she did because when they went to run outside they couldn't get the door open because I had locked all the locks.  About a week later, my mom and dad were home alone and that same noise came back and the house started to shake and they lost electricity.  Only some beams were shining down from an object in the sky which they couldn't see onto our patio. ! Our hou se was on a cliff off a creek off the river.  They said it hovered there for awhile with the lights than just went away.  I was a paralegal for 10 years and now run a flooring business and business center with my husband.  Its weird because it seems like after that happened, no one in my family, including myself, after talked about it.  Its almost like you forget until years later.  I have just recently in the last few years, told only a few people.  And of course they just laugh at me.  I do believe there are a lot of hoaxes out there, but I have to believe there is something, because I saw like silver suited, what I think were beings, and they couldn't have been from this planet, because they moved to fast in second intervals.

It was between 8 - 10pm on a clear, cloudless night. My friends and I were on the hill in the centre of our property in a car, from which we did not alight. One friend first noticed the craft, which was the very similar in shape to a 'diamond' shaped craft. I liken it to a ""brilliant cut diamond"" which had the point removed from the base. The top section of the 'diamond', which was divided by lights, was about 1 third of the size of the bottom section. The was no noise emitting from the craft. I do not recall the colours, but I recall that the lights around the girth of the craft were a different colour to the rest of it. We watched it hovering for about 2 minutes and all of a sudden it excellerated towards us at a great speed and stopped suddenly. I could not tell the distance it travelled but it appeared to 'grow' from about the size of a full moon to something 5 times the size, in a true 'blink' of the eye. It had travelled directly towards us. We were more amazed than scared. It hovered above us, still slightly to the north and then released from the bottom section (not at the exact base) 3 smaller craft which I liken to Fire Flys due to the way in which they darted in all directions, at great speed. They were the shape of glowing balls. Two were the same colour and one was different, yet I can only recall that one of the colours of the craft were red. I don't recall if the red were the majority of the craft or not. These craft flitted all over the night sky while the 'mother craft' remained hovering near us. This scene continued for such a length of time that one of my friends got bored watching. We then lost sight of the smaller craft and next thing, the mother craft took off in the exact opposite direction it had come at us, at great speed again. It moved a greater distance away than we had seen it the first time, and at such speed that it went from this HUGE thing in the sky to only a point of light, the size of a star. If you had not seen it leave, you could not have distinguished it from the other stars in the sky. My thoughts returned to the 3 craft which had been left behind and were now nowhere to be seen. A few/one (unable to recall exactly) minute later a commercial plane flew across the night sky, with it's stationary lights flashing in the sky. The Fire Fly craft came back into view, as if following at a distance, yet taunting or showing off to the plane's lack of ability. They remained a good distance behind the plane, darting around as if to show off their abilities to us (we were very visible as we watched them on the top of the hill). The plane's appearance is what we used to discuss how big the Fire Fly craft were in comparison to the plane and their ability to turn at great speed in any required direction. It also confirmed that they were not the tail lights of a commercial plane. The mother craft still remained stationary in the outer atmosphere whilst this occurred, still appearing as a star. About five minutes after the plane had flown from view the mother craft returned, again at such speed that it just appeared to 'grow' again in size. It did not return as close as the last time nor as far as the first time sighted. It collected the Fire Fly craft very quickly and then took off, at great speed, in the opposite direction again. This time it did not halt in the outer atmosphere but continued on at enormous speed so that the 'star' that it turned into appeared to go out like a light bulb that had just blown. It was a like a tiny little flash or blink and then the 'star' (craft) was gone. When I arrived at our farmhouse I excitedly told my mother about what we had seen and she commented that the television screen had gone 'snowy' for almost half an hour. I have not witnessed another UFO sighting since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-08-16T00:00:00,,

I was heading northwest out of Colfax up to Sprague Lake where I was going to get on I-90.  About midway there I looked up and seen a large airplane traving north. I could not tell if it was a passenger or cargo plane, but it was not a small plane(not a private prop or company yet). It was your typical large airplane, what else can I say. Anyway, there was also a large dark oval or egg shaped ""spot"" following on the airplanes left flank. It was a very dark object with no distinct characteristics other than it was oval like, very dark and seemed to have no real distinct boundary. Quite small compared to the airplane... not much longer that the width of the wing - I would guess about the size of my pickup truck. I would say it was within 20 feet or so of the fusilage (sp?) of the airplane - traveling parallel with it - following it. I was driving at the time and taking glances up from the road as often as I could and started to slow down. I am thinking, ""this has got to be a figment of my imagination"". I pulled over quickly and got out and looked up and the dark object was then directly in front of the plane - both traveling in the same direction and at the same speed. Both still heading north. I was thinking at the time that it had to be a visual anomalie and starting rubbing my eyes, etc and looking around in the skies for similar anomalies. I am out there in the sagebrush desert, no one else on the road, just starring up at this event in amazement. About then I noticed two military jets coming from the east (probably the airbase at Spokane).  I am thinking ""if they are coming on behalf of that airliner, man, this is something to be witnessing"". Sure enough. The jets were moving fast and when they got within, say, a mile or so, the dark object just took off. Very, very, very fast is all I can say. There was a ""wake"" in the blue part of the sky - a dark path almost like a parting of the atmosphere directly in front of! the air liner. The UFO was there one minute and the next minute it was gone. Both military fighers came up and paralleled the airliner for a short distance and then left. And that was it. The airliner was a bit north of me by then. But I still remember that 'vapor trail' or dark path through the atmosphere. It slowly ""filled in"" or otherwise turned the normal sky blue. Another time, I was up in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness near French Ridge. Miles from any highway. At least two mountains between me and I-90 and 9 miles from the dirt road that I drove up. I set up camp near a small creek before Turquoise Lake. Was woken up that night by a humming sound. Never seen anything, but the humming got louder the softer then louder... etc in a cycle that lasted all night.  I am thinking, I am in the heart of a wilderness area at least 8 miles from the road. 4'000 feet of elevation gain by trail and backpack. What the hell could be 'humming up here'. Definitely a big machinery like sound. And very large though it seemed to be at least a quarter mile from me.  I could not tell which direction only that it was somewhere in that basin. I was pretty worried camping out there (was backpacking solo on that trip). Got up in the morning and looked around. Not much for trees up there as I was just at or above timerline. I hiked and looked around the basin that morning but could find nothing. This also happened in the mid 80's. Never mentioned either event before as I certainly have no respect for a government that hides such things. Don't want anything to do with them or talk with them. I figure it has been long enough now that they wouldn't bother. Too damn many other folks and sightings and such. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This happened approximately 10 years ago, so my details on the exact time and date are a bit sketchy.  It was sometime around 10 pm in the spring/summer time. A friend and I were driving west on Downs Blvd (he was driving, I was in passenger seat), moving into the Ridgecrest Heights area (which is very dark at night at this time).  Sky was cloudy and had been sprinkling earlier, clouds approximately 3000 to 4000 feet.  There were no aircraft that were discernable in the sky below the clouds. At the same time, we both suddenly noticed a bright, fireball-like object that appeared to come down from the cloud level and drop below the level of the hills to the SouthWest of town.  It's color was a deep reddish-orange.  It seemed to drop much slower than an object on fire would fall.  The object lit up the clouds and hills below it as it dropped, and once below the hills disappeared.  Due to the distance (approximately 5 miles from where we were driving) I was not completely certain, but it appeared to NOT be trailing smoke at all. My friend turned to me and asked ""Did you see that?""  I confirmed that I had.  We both discussed it for a few more minutes, initially thinking perhaps it was an aircraft from nearby China Lake Naval Weapons Center that had gone down... but rejected this thought later as there was no flash or explosion or otherwise once the object fell below the hills, nor was there any sound of explosion at all (we would have heard it from the distance we were at I am certain).  The color of the object also bothered me, as the fire on most burning aircraft is much lighter... yellowish orange.  As I worked on the China Lake site for a Government contractor at the time, I assumed that it would be common knowledge of a plane went down from either China Lake or Edwards Air Force Base... however, no one I talked to had heard of the incident, and no aircraft was reported to have gone down at that time.  Not sure what the object was... and had forgotten about it until I found this site.  Initially I dismissed it as some strange anomaly, but after reading more and more of the sightings posted here, I have become fairly convinced that my friend and I witnessed some sort of craft that night. A quick note on the hills in question - These hills are largely rolling hills West of town and have little real height.  Ridgecrest sits in the bottom of the China Lake valley, so seeing beyond the hills is impossible when in the town itself.  However, due to their small height, any large explosion or other like flash would easily be seen above / behind these hills. Background info - I am currently a 33 year old male who grew up in Ridgecrest (living now in WA State).  I am a Computer / Network Systems Analyst.  I grew up in Ridgecrest, and was always fascinated by aircraft.  As a result of living near China Lake and Edwards AFB, I was able to determine the silhouete of just about any US aircraft at close and distant ranges.  Working on site at China Lake I also was privy to viewing testing of missiles, bombs,  and other such weapons, which accustomed me to seeing burning aircraft in flight and falling debris from such tests.

My father did not know how to get back on the highway, so he was going to wave the other car down and have them tell us directions. My father came to a stop and waited for the other car to pull up. Except it stopped about 25 feet infront of us. That is when we notice that the head lights seemed to be floating in the sky. After a few seconds my father pulled a little further up, and the lights raised about 15 feet in the air. My step-mother freaked out at that time and opened her window. She thought that it may of been a helicopter( I have since lived by a hospital that life flights out and know better). There was absolutley no sound what so ever. Not even a car motor. It remained there for about a minute and then it raised a little more.  Then, suddenly it shot kind of diagonal into the sky. And eventually straight up and out of sight.

I was in the first year of high school and had the choice of taking astronomy lessons after school hours. As curious I was and still am about space and extraterrestrial life I decided to take those lessons and every time I came back from school and it was dark outside I took my dad into the back yard and pointed out the stars I've learned about that lesson, so also that night in December. My dad and I were standing in the back yard looking at the stars when we suddenly spotted a bright orange sphere (as big as Jupiter, but not as bright) high up in the sky moving slowly from West to East. Initially we thought it was a satellite reflecting the sun, because it didn't make any sound. I called my older brother to join us and show him what we spotted. Slowly it went straight over our heads and when it just passed us it suddenly stopped without slowing down first. We all made a sound of disbelieve. Than after a few seconds it started to move backwards at same speed and stopped again without slowing down. Now it was straight up above our heads. I guess it stayed there for about five, maybe ten seconds and than it moved so much faster than before in North West direction. We ran to the front of the house, hoping to still get a glimpse of the sphere, but it already disappeared. When we talked about our experience together we all found out that we had exact the same feeling when the sphere stopped exactly above our heads…the very strong feeling of being watched. Although I watch the dark sky almost every night I am not lucky enough yet to experience it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))",2002-08-16T00:00:00,,

I am only writing this because I have kept this a secret for almost 10 years now. I don't care who actually believes what I have seen but I have to let this out now. I was asleep beside a window on a second story. From where I lay I can see 3/4 of the sky and the other part was blocked by a green leafy tree like an oak. The apartment is in the city and lights from the city stop you from seeing any stars that arent bright. I woke up and looked out the window and froze. I saw what appeard to be a perfectly smooth disc. There were no lights on it like many people see only the light from the city reflecting off the bottom. I thought a baloon or an aircraft but I was shortly proven wrong. The object stayed only in my view as if I were meant to see it theres no other way for me to explain it. That fact alone scared me stiff because its altitude wasn't very high only within a few thousand feet maybe two football field lengths no more than 3. It moved from right to left in a line then up to the top of my view and then back down as if it had made an L movement. It stopped and lowered quite a bit. The disc got larger and then it rose back up, higher this time. It made a last move to the top of my view and back down then back toward the country side at the right of my view where it had started from originally. I was frozen completely through the duration and couldn't speak above a whisper. I had tried to wake my brother up but I couldn't speak. Through the whole incident there was not a single sound from the object. When it left I was unfrozen and then immediately jumped from my bed across the small room to my brothers bed and woke him up. I told him I had seen a UFO. He believed me and quickly we ran down stairs and out on the lawn to see if it would return. It never did. Wether it was extraterestrial or military I don't know. It seemed to be practicing manuvering more than traveling to a destination. Even though it has been so long, I can still draw the exact portrait of what I saw.

E. Warren AFB, WY At this time I was in the USAF and I frequently went to the gym to workout.  The chow hall was open for midnight chow at 2400hrs.  I had finished my workout and was standing outside the chow hall alone waiting for it to open (it was 2345hrs).  The night was extreamly clear and I could see tons of stars.  I am an avid star watcher so this was a great time to just stop and look up.  I noticed an extreamly bright star and stared at it for a moment, then it seemed to move and I looked at it harder and it almost seemed as if it noticed me, im sure that it didn't but the reason I say that is becuase when it moved and I really started to look at it, then it zipped down so fast and as it zipped I thought immediately that it was a shooting star but then then stopped, then it zipped across the sky to the left and I would have to estimate 100 Miles in air space or more within a split second then it stopped again, zipped back to almost the same location only this time higher up and then zipped what appeared to be straight up and then it was gone.  I cannot be sure of the actual distance this object was traveling but I know for a fact that there is no craft that the USAF has that can travel at such speeds and the flight pattern that this craft was making.  Picture an odd shaped triangle it started at the top zipped down then to the left then back up to almost its original position and then poof it was gone.  There were no sounds at all whatsoever.  Now to confirm something.  Where I grew up in California I was lucky to see the SR-71 Blackbird fly many many times.  I saw the SR-71 go sonic and let me tell you that was one fast plane really really fast but there is a catch to speed and that is a Sonic Boom.  When that plane went Mach whatever it did, there was a boom that shook my whole house.  Last note, no pilot could withstand the g-forces that this object would have created to instaniously move the distance and speed this object was traveling at.  This was no slow motion thing zip zip zip gone.  I will never forg! et this and am only reporting it now because I was working with nuclear weapons at the time and could have been considered crazy for reporting such a thing and lost my security clearence.  I made a simple drawing of the pattern of flight if you would like it just let me know and I would be happy to send it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

In the summer of 1994, there were several nights in which I alone, and once with friends saw. There was even one broad daylight sighting. One night we were heading back to our cabins at about 9:30 pm. There was never any planes around. We saw this round object hovering above the other side of the lake. Sometimes there would be a dark orange light on it for more than a minute, and then it would disappear while still being able to see the outline of the craft moving. Several nights later close to 22:00, we were at this building called the rec hall where we'd hand out. I went outside alone for some air. On the right side of the building on the grass there was this dark orange light in the shape of a large rectangle shining on the grass. At first I thought it was a light shining through the window. I walked nearby it and it would've been impossible for a rectangle that big to be shining through a window that small and covered with wired mesh. I then looked around and didn't see anything until I looked up into the sky and saw this round object with the same coloured light on it as that of the rectangle on the grass. I then ran back inside being affraid of being abducted. Towards the end of the summer myself and another counsellor and a couple of kids saw in broad daylight, a round silver metallic object with no sharp edges and no sound flying over the baseball field ( near the rechall). They were in shock, as was I. I saw this same object, with the same coloured light over several other nights while I was there. I saw the same thing a few times the summer before in 1993 at the same camp. I have always been a strong believer in UFO's and other planet life. I also strongly believe the government is in fact holding some sort of UFO technology and maybe life somewhere. Probably not at AREA 51 because it too well known. I truly believe there is a big conspiracy to keep aliens/UFO's quiet. All the way from Rosewell to the year 2002. I saw once on tv about UFO's, they showed the drawing of a craft that was describe by a WW2 pilot they saw, to the US Stealth Bomber. The shape and size was very similar. They also believe the Stealth Bomber came from UFO technology. Brief summary, I'm not stupid, I know what I've seen, and I know what's out there.

I was hunting from a deer stand about 20 feet from the ground in Cedar Key very deep in the woods, I was motionless for 5 hours until about 4 pm ,my thoughts were very cleand limited. I began to hear a vacuum noise or the sound of air being sucked into a a pipe?. I was listening to this for about 2 or 3 minutes still not moving at all , after a while I noticed something very big had moved over my head at about 1 mph ,Startled I looked up a saw a huge delta or trianke shaped craft, It had no engine sound it looked seemless with a very shiney tinsel type foil making a slight tinkle sound all along the back side. the front seemed to have air collapsing into the front as if taking in air. it was about 30 feet above my head and about 200 feet wide and 100 feet front to rear. it looked like a delta wing. the second i looked up i moved my rifle toward it and it suddenly shot off in about a half second, the woods were quiet again.  I have never seen anything before of after this as far as crafts ,except for the very next night 150 miles back to st.petersburg. My wife and I were both awakened in our bed under our open window at 4 am , we were awokened by a humming sound with a low dull fadeing in and out type of sound, we both looked out and with her as my witness we saw a five foot tall glowing orange ball ,looked like a dim sun' it was sitting rite outside my window! when we talked it began to move off the property and pick up speed til it moved over a very busy intersection and disapered up into the sky "" her exact words were ""what the hell did you bring back with you?!""   This is were it gets weiard and scary for me about a year ago I was awakened in my bed but I am totally paralized I could only use my eyes ,I looked up and one aliean ""your very typical looking type"" moved rite through my bedroom wall,said nothing to with words ,it used its thoughts to tell me to not be afraid we have something to do here"" the next thing I know 4 or 5 more creeped rite through the other walls from living room and a locked ! door to my room, i was laying on my side and they had inflated my lungs and used an incredable amount of force to blow somthing from my lungs ,they did this several times after they were  satisfied they all left through one wall to the outside. After about 5 minutes or less I was very slowly able to start moving ,I was laying on my side toward the dresser, the dresser was coated a vapor from lungs ""It was 3 feet from my bed"" I got up turned all the lights on and stayed up til work I was 36 at the time and not very comfortable with what I went through , .Although I am aware of a common sleep phenomenon assoiciated with this , I have never had a history of this before or after . For a 24 hour period after this my chest was hurting me as if i had over inflated my lungs.  These are the only three episodes of this type in my history. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After getting off work at Wal-Mart me and three others were traveling along Apache Street.  When we came to the radio station on Apache we saw a huge cone shaped object floating above the station.  The illumination on the surrounding street was an intense white and green.  We were not the only people who saw it - someone was across the street making a call from a payphone and was watching it as well.  After roughly two minutes the object lifted into the sky and began to proceed northeast.  We followed it from Apache to Dustin to 30th to Main Street where we drove to the hill overlooking Farmington lake.  The object continued to hover across the sky before disappearing along the south side of Animas Valley. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I will first have to apologize that I no longer have the exact date and time to provide as full an information as possible.  However, it was at least 3 or 4 years before the death of my dad, who was the other witness to this phenomona.  3 bright lights that did not move as airplanes and lined up one after the other.  Precisely, they flew in laze curves. Secondly, I have seen the standard gear on planes to know a jet, or a helicopter from an object that puts out a blinking white glow or a solid white glow.  A UFO doesn't resemble a jet or a helicopter.  And it is very easy to tell them apart.  A UFO will actually fly higher and faster than the commercial jets.  Dad and I used to spend many hours on summer evenings looking for the space ships when I was a kid. Finally, of this night in question, not meteors, meteors leave trails.  Nor do they closely trail each other low in the sky over the area near CDA.  They do not travel as though they were manned.  I have seen meteors too, they do not act as UFOs.  Folks, I neither hoax nor joke.  Dad is dead now, but I still remember this event very well. In closing, how well does a ""weather ballon"" shine at night.  Does it have an internal ""light source""?  How fast do ""weather balloons"" travel to out speed air force fighter jets?  The attempt to debunk becomes ludicrous on the facts.  Further, how fast can ""Venus travel"" if you are laying down and watching the night sky and see ""Venus"" blinking and moving very fast from one horizon to another from the north to the south, to the east, to the west.

My self and wife were visiting my parents in their farmhouse in eastern South Dakota.  My daughter was in bed and Me and my wife went to sleep in an upstairs room room facing west.  Typical to east SoDak there were no trees at all obstruction the view of the sky, and the nearest pollution light was 22 miles away in that direction.  She pointed out a light to me she said had just settled in the sky near by.  I was totally used to seeing the occassional plane or helicopter, even though it was farm country, and low level aircraft are extremely rare, cropdusters are even very rare out there, probably due to wind and a below average economy.  What I saw almost knocked me off my feet it was so out of place and obviously ""extra-terrestrial"". About 2 and 1/2 miles straight west, and slightly north there was a light hovering still in the sky.  My sife claimed to have seen it arrive there ""gliding in very fast"" If she hadn't caught the movement out of the corner of her eye while preparing for bed, I believe neither of us would have seen it and would have gone to bed.  Even though it was fairly close the ships light was not outrageously bright.  I call it a ship, because after watching it for 22 minutes I had no doubt it was an aircraft we were observing.  She said in suprised voice (amused even). What is that?  I saw a fairly bright light to the west.  I could pinpoint its location be cause for some reason the light cast an extremely faint, but discernable glow on the ground below it.  The light was normal white light, it did have what seemed to be a slight bluish tint to it.  I have always had extremely good vision doctors tell me 15/20, this is in my medical reports since very young childhood.  The land this craft hovered over was occupied by the biggest herd of cattle in the area.  I know the farmer personally, and his Black Angus are reknowned.  (Four years before, his hired man, laughed and told me how this rancher was constantly at stress at how his cattle were getting rustled with no tire prints at the the theft scene, see, load a trailer with cattle and it will chew up dirt when you leave, but then again it was one here and one there, who knows I put this together in the weeks following the siting). We watched this light hover out there, we're both intelligent and discussed opsprey and harrier aircraft. then 12 minutes into the siting the light shifted about 10 meters to the north (right) and 15 or 20 down, so fast it was mind boggling This was the first time I saw it move, and I knew I was watching a machine from another world or galaxy was right in front of me. We talked for another ten minutes and it shot straight upwards into ""the heavens"" we were speechless.  She is the product of a stoic german midwestern back-ground.  And she admitted that there was no way to explain what we saw except UFO.  6 years later, almost exactly, I figure if it was a US military craft, it was alien technology. On my honor and word, this is not a joke.  I actually wrote because after watching an x-files rerun with a guy wearing a nicap hat in it.  Not a joke. Immediatly after the sighting, myself and my wife could not drop the fact that we had witnessed something that shook our world and our entire belief system.  We were literally in a mild shock.  We lightheartedly said we would watch that weeks x-files.  I don't know how long, but it wasn't too long after that sighting that we saw the episode with the plane and the guy with the nicap hat. (by the way, I guessed date, but didn't want to guess one for fear of lack of credibility).  I know I am close.  Even for six years of memory erosion. One reason I have converted every person I have told this story to, into a UFO believer is that they know the wife.  She is the protestant prude from the wealthy family who wouldn't believe anything she couldn't see.  I have to say over the years, that event changed her more than almost anything.  And I have to say for the positive.  Please write if you saw lights in the Dakotas in that time. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) I enclosed a email to you earlier, I forgot a fact.  The light also gave me a perfect lidea of its heighth. About 250 meters.  I remembered also when the ship left, it left a trail of light, but just for a fraction of a second, not sustained.  I just remembered, I can't accept the phone call due to a person I rent from.  Please write or email I will correspond, and can give affidavits by her or me.  I have been into this since then, but this is the only real step I have taken to pursue it. ((NUFORC Note:  EDITORIAL COMMENT:  We do not understand why people wait years to report their sightings!

It was not malevolent and tolerated my questions only briefly....these beings are very assertive if you communicate with them.

I didnt relize what i was doing but i had taken my lighter out of my pocket and started flicking it as if to get its attention. then we got real scared it was real cloudy that night and i could hear a plane going threw the clouds and i could see it here ant there with its blinking lights but just before the airplane got directly above the thing it shrank out of sight, not like a light turning off but like shrinking into nothing but very fast and after the plane was gone it grew back, as if it were hiding. at this point me and my buddie were very scared we decided to jump into my other freind who wasnt home into his car and didnt want to see what was going on my freind fell asleep but i couldnt sleep i tryed but only for what i thought was a minute but we still argue about the time my freind says he slept for at least an hour but i dont realy know it feels to me we were only in the car for 5 min. anyways the thing was still the just watching us at least thats what it felt like. i was so filled with fear i felt like a trapped rat like no place i could go to hide. so we decided to leave the car so i got out and when my freind got out and shut the door the car alarm went off and it was a loud one but we thought it was weird that the neighbors dogs w wernt barking and none of the neighbors even woke up the whole time the glow from this thing was still lighting up the area  so we could see outside kinda and we knew it was still there but we didnt want to look anymore we were to scared. so finally i said to hell with it i just want to get out of sight i went and kicked my freinds door in and after all the confusion as to what was going on. out of exhaustion i fell asleep and the next morning called and reported what had happend the night before I was frusterated that they the cops didnt take me seriosly. but one of them gave me a 1-800 number to call but i never did i just wanted answers as to what happend. im sure the flathead county have me on record, Ive tryed telling freinds about that night now the freind  who was with me tells me to shut up, because when he tryed to talk to some about it they call him crazy, i mean who is going to believe us it reallly happend but it sounds so crazy that its ironic. well i know what we saw that night and it wasnt normal it wasnt earth gas or weather baloon ect. we saw something it to me it didnt have a very freindly vibe to it. since then i suffer from insomnia(cant sleep) and always have to watch the sky on a clear night because im afraid that if i dont that something might happen again. well this is my storie and every thing is told as the way it really happend i know there are many that could say things like this just dont happen but it happend to me so all i can say is wait and see .......thank you for letting me tell my storie ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I don't recall the date) my friend was driving & we  were going along on a highway parallel & east of I 93 going north.  (I am not from NH and do not recall the highway).  If my memory serves me well,  we were close to Franklin NH. It was late in the evening perhaps around 2300 or so all i remember is it was very dark outside.  We both were talking and looked ahead when a large green or turquoise ball dropped diagonally in the sky, almost as if someone had dropped a softball from high in the sky.  My friend quickly sped up as if to go after it, when we realized that if that ball had hit the earth, or if it was a meteror it would have exploded.  I very ofton think of that night in autumn 1997 wondering what it was we saw. Also, I've been wanting to tell someone who might care about what young  old daughter & I saw in approximately 1975 or 1977. (I dont remember the month.)  Again I cant remember the exact year (she was born in 1969 & was either in 1st or 2nd grade at the time. She started 3rd grade in Minneapolis, I think.  I'd need to ask my daughter for sure what grade she might have been in.  Just the other day I asked her if she remembers seeing the object and she does.  We were in St Paul Minnesota and  after crossing the Smith Avenue bridge going towards West St. Paul, we turned right onto a street ( just a block or 2 on other side of bridge close to Cherokee Park).  I drove maybe a half block (it was nighttime- we were going to a friends house on Stevens Avenue), when we saw an object hovering above the tree tops.  I looked out my drivers side window up to my right at the object, which I thought at first might be a helocopter,but it made NO noise.  It had lights on it, and if I remember correctly the lights were different colors:  I believe red and blue stand out most in my memory. I was really amazed at what I saw, it was just over the trees but I only saw part of its side, which i believe was round because what we saw was curved Most of the object was over the the trees where I could not see it. I was amazed & in awe.  I watched it for perhaps 5 minutes.  I cant remember if it was rotating.  I remember the lights and how close the object was to the top of the trees.  The area is a residential area just above the Mississippi River. After watching it for about 5 minutes,  I turned around & headed to our apartment on Stryker & King St, where I called the St Paul Airport (military airport)  I think it was called.  I thought it might be a military object.  They said none were there over by Cherokee park. I also think of that night often over the years wondering what it was I saw. Please, tell me any if one else have seen the two objects I have seen and tried to describe to the best of my ability.  I would really appreciate it.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Lights flashing this BADBOY (if you 've never seen one in action you dont know what your missing...) raked the ground with its spotlight and did a search of the area ...usually this does not get any attenton ... cause these guys are allways flying in formation and playing with the public ( shining lights on everything and everyone...) but it certanly seems interesthing in light of what i saw.. Now here is where i debunk myself and offer some Possible explanations... 1). The light was really a jet ..since the air field ONLY supports CARGO airplanes...then this would mean that what i saw was more then likely a ""Covert"" Aircraft that was not supposed to be here. 2). Training Manuevers with the idiot pilot not following safety regs. And had his lights off... but then this would bring me to the first anwser and since this craft is not currently under support in this trainign  enviromment the question remains what exactly were they (the military) doing endangerering the public..as every one knows that it's agaisnt FAA Regs. to fly ANY type of AIRCRAFT without running lights!!  3). What i saw was really something unknown ..(wouldnt hold my breath any time soon!!)  as a small note ... i called the operations NCOIC and he informed me that he was not aware of anything being out of the ordinary....but concidering what i was describing no running lights, my familiarity with diffrent aircrafts etc, he informed me that he would notify the tower and see  what was hoing on… ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They moved so fast I had to move my finger with it to show her and even then it was hard to keep up.  The others came out and they started to see them too. These light balls were also taking sharp turns, making loops and spirals.  You thought your eyes were playing tricks on you.

All of a sudden they moved opposite of each other very fast and crossed moving towards the ground as if they were crashing.  They went bellow the tree line and I couldnt find them again. They were both complete circles and had a orangish+red hue. Also all the lights in my house flickered and i couldnt here any animals or bugs. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had always been a huge UFO fan before I witnessed the object, and after I had to report it. (I may have reported this to your site before) We (my brother, myself, and the driver: my dad) were all driving down a road to get home after we had been out at my family's. This is a particularly 'country' type road and I always see lights in the sky that I ""hope are real"" UFO's on road's like these but quickly dismiss them as airplanes or other aircraft. THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS. I think it was about 11:30 p.m. when we first spotted the object. Only my brother and I were witnesses to the triangular shaped craft, my father had no interest in our ""whoa look at this!"" and other mentions of the unusual thing. He had to keep his eye's on the road, and I was bending my neck backwards just to get a look at it. What's original about my sighting was that the object seemed particularly interested in us and the car we were in. I felt it could sense our fascination of the object and the feeling seemed that it was ""curious"" of our reaction, when most might be horrified. It hovered around thirty feet OR LESS directly above our car and wavered slightly from side to side to give me a few good looks at it. It was definitely triangular without a doubt, with a red, white, and possibly blue lights on the tips (oddly). I thought I saw a light on the top which would make it a pyramid, but my brother saw no such thing. There were no odd car reactions (i.e. car suddenly stopping) and the object simply left when we got to a more populated area. I think a saw a car far behind us in the incident so we may not of been the only witnesses. Threw the whole ordeal the object emitted no sound. Which makes it extremely unlikely that it was some kind of experimental government craft, note that there were (laughs) NO GOVERNMENT BASES OR TEST SITES IN THE AREA. After a careful analysis of what I saw I concluded it was a UFO which could not be identified by any terrestrial craft or natural events.

I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of where I was working at the time, eating a snack and waiting to clock in to work, when I noticed a flock of geese circling above the river just behind the building where I worked. They were in their usual ""V"" shaped formation but instead of flying off into the distance, they appeared to be confused as to what direction to go. They seemed to be concerned because they were not making their usual honking while traveling sounds, instead the sounds where different, more high pitched and stressfull. I watched them circle and listened to their cries for 4-5 minutes, then as I was reaching over to the passenger seat for the other half of my sandwich, the sounds stopped. I took a bite, a sip of my drink and intended to resumed my observation, but the geese were gone, dissapeared within the 10-15 seconds that I looked away. I got out of my car immediatly and looked all around the sky to see where they may have decided to fly off to, but they had dissapeared altogether. The last time I saw them they were circling above the parking lot, not enough time for them to fly out of sight or to land at the Rio Grande river a quarter mile away. This was very strange, and I was in disbelief that they could have vanished. As I was still searching for the lost geese I noticed a dark, round object hanging above the river south of my position and about a mile away. I guessed it to be 10-15 feet in diameter and about 200 ft above the Rio Grande River. At first I thought it to be a large balloon tied to a string because it seemed to move a bit from side to side and up and down, but then I realized that if it were tied down and the wind was pushing against it, the movement would be in the shape of an arc, this was not. It seemed to be trying to maintain a particular position drifting +/- 15 to 20 ft on a horizontal or verticle plane. Two hours later and just before su! nset whi le on my first work break, I went back outside and it was still there. I pointed it out to someone else who confirmed it, but expressed no curiosity about what it might be. In conclusion: I am thinking that this hanging object may have caused a kind of navigation problem for the geese, causing their stress and confusion. But because of their dissappearance, it may have opened or closed a gateway in time or place. The geese may have been traveling in one place or time, and then suddenly emerged from or vanished into another. Second Sighting: I had nearly forgot about that sighting until I saw it again, this time in Oak Ridge nearly three years later. It was the first week in June 2002 about an hour before sunset. This time it was a little further away, maby a mile and a half and floating about the same hight above the ground as before, which I guess to be about 200 ft. It had the same characteristics as before of drifting on a horizontal and verticle plane, and not in an arc which would suggest it was tied to string or rope. I watched it for 30 mins or so in its stationary position, but as the sun began to set I noticed the object getting smaller and smaller, and believed that it was now moving further away from me in a northern direction. Finally it was so small I could no longer see it in the dim light of dusk.",2002-08-16T00:00:00,35.2668524137931,-106.72171655172414

The sighting did not come first - the sound did.  I was reading late at night, my husband was in bed in the next room, and I heard the deepest, most powerful-sounding, diesel turbo type sound I'd ever heard, sounding like it was coming across our yard, and getting louder.  The sound rattled the plates out of the plate grooves in the china hutch, and rattled the windows in our old farmhouse.  It was loud enough to hurt our ears.  Hubby was up instantly, and we both said, ""What on earth is that?""  We looked out the south window upward, and saw a huge dark triangle shape with rounded corners hovering about 20 feet over our roof. It had red, green and white lights, not bright, just twinkling, and about clearance-light size.  Immediately, it whisked out of sight heading SW.  We steeled ourselves to hear a plane crash, but heard nothing more. 	The next morning, I called the Federal Aviation Authority and asked if they had any idea what it was.  The man said sometimes Offutt (Air Force Base) conducts maneuvers late at night, but certainly not right atop someone's house.  He checked a chart, and then said no, we were much too far south of Offutt's maneuvering perimeter.  I could tell he wasn't too interested, and didn't want to pursue it more, so I thanked him and hung up.  When I got home from work, I asked our nearest neighbor if he had heard anything the night before, and he said, ""Yeah, did you guys start up your tractor late at night?  I wondered what you were doing, but went back to sleep.""  Hubby and I agreed not to talk about it anymore, lest folks around home think we were weird and make jokes, like they did about the family who claimed their house was haunted.

It was very slow and sometimes it would even speed up and then slow down. What really suprised me was that it would start moving and changing colors red and then orange and tend to disappear at times. sometimes I would think that I saw white little lights coming out of it, super fast. It was probably my imagination but I know the ball of light or fire more like the color of saturn.Like a miniature saturn. We do live next to an airport; the Ontario airport where Bush came for the convention. but this incident occured before the president came, way before. I really do think that this ball of light was some extraterrestial from outer space because the color of it didnt even look like a fire color, but it would change into a fire color; it was like a dark bright red at first and then poof it seemed like it blew up or something, not litteraly but in explanation. The object was hovering and then it starred to disapear sometimes as if the light was burning out; because it would do it periodicly and then suddenly it disapeared and never turned back on as if it disapeared. Im not finished if your tracking me right now but another incident happend like this just a week ago about this year in august on wednesday the 7 at about 8:30 9:00 but this time it was only a bright red color and didnt change it was coasting torwards the airport's direction and didnt do anything highly unuasual like the one I JUST explained farther back. this went out of our reach and we couldnt see it so we just went inside.

The star moved slowly towards us at an extremely slow speed, almost unseeable. Then all of a sudden it shot back to a star at light speed. When it hit, the star lit up really bright for a split second, then returned to normal. No more than 10 minutes later we were over across the street in our other neighbor's driveway, talking to him. I looked up and saw a flock of black birds flying directly overhead. They made no sound, and it was pitch black out and so were the birds. It was a miracle that I saw them. It took me a long time to get everyone else to see them by pointing them out. What i've found is that ufo sightings are somewhat strangely linked with black birds somehow, I haven't figured it out yet, but I've heard other people's sightings, and some of them saw black birds too.

I was practicing night flying with my instructor and on an approach to Tulsa International Airport coming into N-S runway out of the south.  We were in a Cessna 195 that has a the windshield extending over the back of the pilots head.  There was a flash that cast a white light like a electro welding flash.  The air was filled with airline pilots asking what had happened.  I was looking directly overhead at were the flash had occured.  I saw a pin point of light going into a cloud as if a flash point had occured and was pulled into the main body of the occurence.  It was like a pin sticking out of a hotdog.  The main body was at first white light that turned to green, to blue, to yellow, to orange, to red, to deep blood red and then to black.  The main body of the explosion roiled in such a manner to open and reveal the interior that was burning blood red.  It would close and open in a different place until it finally disapeared.  The end opposite the entry had a like needle of light which looked to me as the remainder of what was left of the object that had exploded had exited the main body.  This event was reported in the Tulsa World and Tribune.  The article stated that the flash had been observed in Dallas and Kanas City.  The event looked to be in outer space among the stars.  It seemed to me that this event was caused by some object that was filled with an explosive fuel that had ignited and blown the object up forming the lead in spike that expanded into a sausage shaped main body and then trailed the exit spike.  This happened in 1956 or 1957.  I have never reported this event and didn't interrupt the airline pilots chatter with the Tulsa tower.  I was new to flying and an airline pilot was not to be interrupted by a lowly private pilot.  This event should be checkable through the local papers or the tower records at the Tulsa Internationa Airport, if they keep records that long.  My instructor later denied that he had seen anything which didn't surprise me since he worn corrective glasses that ! were Cok e bottle bottoms. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

The result were not promising.  The event appears to have been no more than 10 to 20 miles above Tulsa.  This would put it well within the capabilities of the armed forces even at that time, 1956-7.  It was probably some military craft blowing up although it doesn't preclude something from further out.  ((name deleted)) Dear Peter:  All I can remember is it was sometime in 56-7.  I've lost my log books long ago and have a miserable time with dates.  The papers were full of the report and as I said, the tower at Tulsa International (it was Tulsa Municipal back then I believe)  I tried once some years ago to find it at the Tulsa Trib or World and was unsuccessful.  I wonder if the weather bureau would have something on such an event?  Or some astronomical group might have it.  That's about all I can come up with.  I'll try to find more if I can.  The event was way up there in the sky.  The height could be figured by running a line from the center of the earth to Dallas, one to Tulsa and one to KC, then extending the Tulsa radius into space and making a tangent on the Dallas and KC radii.  Where the two tangents intersected with the Tulsa radius would be the height of the event.  Sincerely, ((name deleted))",,36.109455879967555,-95.93524541768045

The craft's disappearance from the sky was like a blurr. In June of 1957, I was an eleven year old and playing softball at a local El Paso, Tx southside park.  It gets hot in El Paso, Texas, so we started the game around 9:00a.m.  I had been designated to play shortstop and therefore was facing North towards the local Franklin Mountains (part of the Rocky Mountain chain). This was a beautiful clear day with no clouds whatsover.  At approxiately 10:00 a.m. as we were out on the field, I  was distracted by a huge flying craft that ""hovered"" momentarily over the southern tip of the Franklin Mountains.  This circular disk was metalic and stopped in mid-air for about 2 or 3 seconds.  The craft had flown in from the Northeast area of El Paso.  After stopping in mid-air, the craft departed from the mid-air stop and disappeared in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds into the Northwest sky of El Paso. The game was finished around 11:00a.m. and I did not tell any of my playmates about the flying object.  The whole episode seemed so unrealistic!  As I started walking home after the game, I noticed an Army Green Weather Ballon flying from the Northeast part of El Paso.  The Northeast El Paso area houses parts of Fort Bliss (Army base), McGregor Range (missle testing grounds, and further north of these installations, White Sands Proving Grounds (missile testing grounds), and Holloman Air Force Base.  Even as an eleven year old kid, I knew that I had seen a ""flying craft"" that others more mature than myself had also witnessed. I had never publicly acknowledged this incident, however, 3-4 years ago, I saw a movie called ""Independence Day"".  The huge mother ship in the movie resembled the flying craft in appeareance only.

I immediately turned to my left (north) and gazed at the object. The sphere had no discernible features other than the color orange. In fact it it almost seemed to occupy only 2 dimensions like a projection of light against a flat surface. As I stared at the light I felt as though I was being observed. After perhaps 3-5 seconds the thought occured to me that the object was going to leave heading east. No sooner did I have this thought than the light sped off eastward (and out of my view as our house blocked my vision) at the same speed as coming out of the west.  Within 3 seconds I had another thought, that the object was going to reappear from the east. Again, as soon as I had this thought the orange sphere reappeared out of the east (as quickly as it had departed) and hovered over the tree again. Once again I felt I was being watched. The object then disappeared eastward and I ran to our house to tell my family. (being only 4 I was not taken seriously and the incident was dismissed. I have never forgotten it.)

This event happened when I was 20 years old, around 10 pm, it was late summer or early fall 1965.  I have only told a few people about this incident.  The eyewitness who was with me would not talk to anyone about this, not even to me the day after the occurrence. My fiancés cousin and I were driving home from Holden.  Instead of taking me home the usual way, we drove north down Route 68 towards Hubbardston.  I remember this night clearly, ----- was driving his mothers 1962 Thunderbird, we were just gabbing, laughing and having a good time. Route 68 was not heavily populated then, as it is now.  The road was and is a very long, straight and wide paved two-lane highway.  There were not very many houses back then, just a few scattered here and there.  It was about five or six miles until we would arrive at the junction of Route 56 and Route 68.  My house was located on Route 56 in Rutland and we would have to back track south on 56 for a mile to reach my home. Having driven roughly 3 miles down Route 68 past the Rutland town line, heading towards the town of Hubbardston, while I was looking at the clear night sky through the passenger side windshield, I noticed a very bright star; only this star was getting larger with every passing second.    I yelled at ----- to look up, quick!  By that time it was huge and very bright.  He said, ""What the H--- is it?""  I couldn’t even speak at this point and just kept watching the object, until it was huge and hovering over the treetops approximately 3 tenths of a mile away in front of us. It was no longer a bright white, but had turned to a radiant pulsating red.  I am sure that it was saucer in shape, but looked much like a huge cigar, floating in a falling leaf like movement, gliding from left to right, then up and down and side to side again and so on, altering from red to a blazing blue hue.  This went on for about 5 minutes.  From our perspective the size of the object appeared to be the size of a large Greyhound bus. There were maybe three or four cars behind us that slowed down when we did.  We pulled over and stopped on the soft shoulder, then got out of the car, as a couple of other cars passed us.  But two or three vehicles stopped in back of us and were watching, also, no one said a word, we all just watched.  So there were other observers, but I don’t know who they were. When it finally stopped hovering the object turned intense white again and flew off at an incredible speed into the night sky, until it was only a speck as when I had first noticed it. There is one thing that I took note of; the place where the object was hovering was directly over the power lines that cross Route 68. It was so odd, no one that I can remember said anything, and everybody just got back into his or her cars and drove off, slowly.  ----- and I talked about it a little, but when I saw him the next day, he did not want to talk about it at all.  A few years later when he came to visit my husband and me, I brought our unidentified flying object experience up to him and he almost denied ever seeing such a thing.  I know I will never forget, not ever! In case you are wondering, there was no alcohol, or drugs of any kind involved. Thank you for this Web Site, I sort of feel relieved after telling my story.  I don’t fell so crazy after reading some other peoples experiences.  This is the first time that I have ever reported this event. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate.

Back in early spring 1973 a friend and I were driving north on I-91 near Hartford, CT when there appeared three silvery wedge-shaped objects flying from west to east right in front of the windshield of the car.  The objects were small, about one foot in length and were plain, no lights, nothing at all.  What was just as strange is that they appeared and then disappeared but we didn't see them fly in or fly away - they came and then they were just completely gone.  I looked into the other cars to see if people were waving or pointing but no one else seemed to have seen the objects so I kept my mouth shut.  A few minutes later, my friend said, ""You are going to think I'm crazy....""  I said something like ""Go ahead...""  He said,""Did you see anything strange?""  I became very excited because he had seen them too and our descriptions matched exactly.  These three objects were flying in a V shaped formation and neither of us could explain what they were.  We knew we were near Bradley Airport in Windsor Locks so we kept trying to explain it on those terms, that it was experimental aircraft of some sort.  Then I said maybe they were remote controlled toys - but who would fly them across a busy highway? and why did they appear and disappear so suddenly like that?  I turned on the car radio to see if there was any mention on the news but there wasn't.  When we got to my parents' house I ran to the tv to see if they were talking about it but there were no reports and there was nothing in the papers the next day either.  I have never forgotten this incident.  Small, wedge-shaped, close-up, dark silver, appeared and disappeared suddenly, at dusk in early spring.  I shudder when I see the stealth planes now because the shape reminds me, although what I saw back then was small and just straight lines like an arrowhead.

I went out & saw a huge saucer -about the size of a football field- hovering just above the woods. We lived in the county about 3 miles from the small airport. The UFO was huge, made a humming, vacuum sound, domed on top & bottom with rotating lights around both domes & around the middle, except the lights around the middle didn't rotate but seemed to flash randomly. I felt no fear, just awe. I ran into the house & got my mother so she could see it & she did. Being mechanically-minded I focused on the sound of the craft to try to determine its power source & was very conscious to pay attention to details of appearance. I took a Polaroid picture after getting my mother but it didn't take. The photo background was brownish-black with 3 scarlet red smears in the center. I don't know what happened to the photo but now think the red smears were heat indicators. I've drawn this craft several times over the years & keep one with me in case I run into someone who claims to have seen the same thing. I was intelligent & didn't use drugs. I saw this craft, I am not crazy, & I have been trying to figure out its power source for 29 years. I am a technical mechanical engineer by trade & now have a pretty good idea about the craft's power source. I believe there's a reason some of us see these things & some don't. I don't know what that reason is but I know that my life changed when I saw that UFO & feel there was a purpose for it. Maybe submitting this report is the reason.

At that point I thought they were aircraft and joked with my little sister and cousin about them being UFO'S.  As we got closer I coud tell that they weren't aircraft but looked more like the stadium lights at FIU (Florida Int'l University). But as we approached the intersection at 107 Ave., I realized that stadium lights were much farther.  When we finally gor to the intersection, I stopped my car, got off and directly above me was this huge bright and white cigar shaped light.  It didn't make any noise whatsoever.  Suddenly, a small green light started blinking and it silently began to descend as it drew away from us.  In ended up hovering above some bushes about a block away.  To make a long story short, after almost crashing trying to get close to the UFO again, I decided to drop the chase since by then my little sister and cousin were very scared.

My wife and I were camped at a very remote site near the four cornors area.  We had just set up camp when I noticed what appeared to be 5 round lights at the canyon rim, approx. 1/4 mile directly above us. I told my wife it looked like we had some ""spotlighters"" up there, and grabgbed my binoculars.  I was surprised that I could only see round lighted objects, no vehicle.  At that point two of these lights slowly moved above us and the other three slowly began to ""float toward us just above the juniper/pinion trees.  We jumped into the truck and headed up the only way out just as the objects were to the camp site.  When we reached the rim of the canyon we could see many objects that seemed to ""vibrate"" as they moved just above the ground, around and over trees and the landscape.  They appeared to have two sections, the bottom green, the top red, and had a white tube like section that hung from the bottom.  (like a vacumn hose) Over the next approx. 5 miles we observed approx 50 of  these.  We came to a building that looked to be used only seasonally for cattle or the bean field workers and pulled up to see if anyone was there.  I honked my horn and was starting to open my door when the windows of the bldg began to glow red.  We took off again for the paved road, not stopping to see if there was anyone at a couple of other ranch houses we saw on the way in.  As we approached the paved road, we could see a glowing red object just off the side of the road on my side.  We passed it and stopped.  I got my binoculars out and told my wife to shine the  spotlight on it.  When the light hit the object it sort of ""exploded"" and the main peice flew past my window.  We were just sitting there wondering what was going on when my wife said a car was coming behind us.  Very soon we knew it was far too bright to be auto lights.  As I turned around and put the truck in gear my wife started to scream as we took off.  I looked in the rear view mirror to see a round, very bright object, approx 30' in diameter, above an be! hind us. For the next 10 miles it would drop back and then instantly be right behind us several times.  I was going 80-90 mph down this narrow country road. We turned onto hwy 666 and headed towards Monticello, about 12 miles away.  The object stayed with us until we were close to the highway patrol truck station outside of town.  I skidded to a stop in front of the station and ran inside to tell them what had happened.  They said they were having a hard time believing what I was saying but that a trucker had a very similiar story only a week before.  They had decided that it must have been a helicopter, possibly with a flame thrower of some type, because paint was burned on the truck trailer and the trucker opened his window tolook and had recieved minor burns  and hair burned off.  I offered to take any test they wanted to prove I was not under the influence but they declined.  I asked them to go with us to see for themselves and because  we had left all of our gear where we were camped.  They called the sherrif dept. and the sherrif, highway patrol and my truck headed back there.  As you might expect, there was nothing there.  Not one light.....nothing out of the ordinary.  What could I say ?  I asked them to stay up on the rim of the canyon long enough for me to retrive my gear.  As we were throwing it into the truck, we could see them leaving.  We drove up and out of the canyon and decided to find somewhere near the highway patrol station to get some sleep.  The next day, around 10 am, we awoke, sitting up in the front of my truck, at the rim of the canyon where we first saw the lights. Neither of us remembered driving back to this spot. I asked my wife if she saw the big eyed deer that was looking in the windows of the truck at us. She did not.  For two years my brother and I went back there several times and saw many of the same small luminous balls that seemed to follow us everywhere while we were in that area.  After that we saw nothing out of the ordinary for several years that we returned to the area! .  I hav en't been there for 10 years.",2002-07-26T00:00:00,,

At about eleven in the evening sometime in the second week of November, 2001, (I'm not entirely sure of the date, though I think it was the eleventh,) my roommate directed my attention out our dorm window to a strange light in the sky northwest of the IU Bloomington campus. It was admittedly rather hazy that night, though what kind of conventional aircraft appears as a bright light periodically highlighted by flashes of red and blue and stays in one place for exceptional periods of time? My roommate gathered three of his friends to watch the show; helicopters (we think, they didn't make any sound) had begun to show up at about ten past eleven and circle around the light. Wanting to be a bit more indulged, I went down to the street (East 3rd) and ventured west to Jordan Avenue to have a closer look. I'd at first thought the light was much farther northwest, but apparently it was less than a mile from our dorm and thus slightly north of the campus, directly up Jordan Ave. As soon as I made the intersection and this observation, it arced up to the west very, very quickly from a dead stop. I lost sight of it for the trees, so I kept going west along 3rd Street and made a stop on top of the Ballantine Hall parking garage. I looked around and didn't see anything, so I headed back. As I approached Jordan Ave. heading east, I saw it again, motionless over a residential area to the southeast, seemingly about the same distance it was from me before. The helicopters were gone at this time. I didn't bother going after it; the cops were prone to patrol the area for party-goers at that time of night and it was late. I thus sat out in front of my dorm and watched it do practically nothing for the next half-hour or so and went back up to my room, as there wasn't much left for intrigue. I did some work until about 3am and went out for a coffee, and was a little surprised to see that the object was still in the same place, still doing practically nothing. It was in the exact same place for the duration of the same time ! period t wo days later as well. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the object may have been a celestial body, but that is only a guess.

The second one was on July 23, 2002 at about the same place in the sky at 6:10 to 6:14 pm.  I am an amateur astonomer and I own an 8in Celstron. I am accustomed to seeing space craft in orbit (ISS, SS, etc.) and even have seen the atmospheric abberation shock wave of a re-entering vehicle.   All of those things follow the physical laws of orbital mechanics. These lights that I saw, did not. Even if they were naked eye, and even if one was pretty shakey through a pair of 10 X 50 binonculars, they must fit into the category of unexplained and unidentified, at this point.  I really thought that they were genuine weather balloons with a radiosone attached, and that still could be the explaination, but at this point, I am confounded.

Silver-White Ball. Spherical. Like a giant siver balloon, reflecting silver-white light reflex. I happened to look up into the south east sky at a passenger jet that had just taken off from DFW airport, that was traveling south west and that was turning further west. As I was watching the jet, the bright silver light caught my attention because of it's proximity to the jet. I thought it was a small plane and that the jet might crash into it. As I watched, the jet passed in front of it, occluding it just like one object passing in front of another one. My attention was focused entirely on the silver-white ball object that the jet passed in front of (from my perspective) at that point. Over the next two minutes, as I watched, the silver-white ball got smaller and smaller, as if it was receding in distance away from me, and it got dimmer and dimmer, and started to turn a soft shade of blue white, the same way the moon appears when seen in the sky during full daylight. It gradually got smaller and then dissapperared entirely, never changing altitude or azimuth in its relative position to my position on the ground, and then just dissappeard when it got too dim to see any longer. This was in the afternoon in full daylight, the sun was about fifteen to twenty degrees above the horizon in the opposite part of the sky. No clouds. Air traffic from DFW was clearly visible for approximately fifteen miles in all directions. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Peter, I also sent you another report on almost the same phenomena, but observed on a different date. And that time I was ready for it with a pair of binoculars.  The first sighting was on february 16, 2002 at 5:50 to 5:52 pm. The second one was on July 23, 2002 at about the same place in the sky at 6:10 to 6:14 pm.  I am an amateur astonomer and I own an 8in Celstron. I am accustomed to seeing space craft in orbit (ISS, SS, etc.) and even have seen the atmospheric abberation shock wave of a re-entering vehicle.   All of those things follow the physical laws of orbital mechanics. These lights that I saw, did not. Even if they were naked eye, and even if one was pretty shakey through a pair of 10 X 50 binonculars, they must fit into the category of unexplained and unidentified, at this point.  I really thought that they were genuine weather balloons with a radiosone attached, and that still could be the explaination, but at this point, I am confounded. So I figured it would be appropriate to put it into the database.  ((END))",2002-08-16T00:00:00,32.70709736842105,-97.1238705263158

PD)) Here is an unfiltered account of communications and interactions between a teenage human and a group of ET's. This happened 25 years ago  during a well documented UFO flap in 1977 in Gisborne New Zealand and the Waimata Valley near Gisborne. What I experiences seems quite different from what people talk about but this is how it happened., nothing is held back. I'm free to talk about it now as this information is publicly available in space so it may as well be publicly available here too. Here it is, complete with spelling mistakes and typos. ""Here is what I wrote on an sighting report this year about the ET's experience with me:  they had the misfortune of trying to control a highly excited, disobedient teenage boy that was loose on their spaceship. It was fun for all of us and probably put the ET's off having human teenagers as children. I didn't need hypnosis to recall this. The ET's memory erasing methods didn't work on me, which also meant they couldn't control me while I was with them like they were used to controlling humans. By time they learned that is was too late for them to do anything about it. Please write an account of what happened This can be CSV delimited for your database. Date, 1977 Location, Waimata Valley NZ - I lived there on our family farm. Event Circumstances, It Happened during a UFO flap that centred on Waimata Valley and Gisborne at the same time UFO's were filmed from a plane over the South Island of NZ. Main Event, I was a guest on a scout UFO and was taken into space for urgent medical attention on a larger space ship when the operation in my nose went wrong. We'd had UFO sightings reported for over 2 months along Waimata Valley Road near our house So I decided to sleep with a torch and the next time one flew over our house I'd get out my window with the torch and start signalling it. One flew over our house and I jumped out the window and began signalling it. There were two ET's in a window looking down at me. I could read their telepathic conversation to each other, one was saying lets carry on, this is of no interest and the other said to wait, this could be of interest. At this point I was flashing the torch and waving at them like any excited kid and I thought ""yes - I've won them over"". The one that said this might be of interest immediately telepathically told me I had not won them over and next thing I remember I'm in a corridor on the scout ship jumping up and down going it's true! it's true! you are real and there were at least 2 Et's just standing there looking at me trying to get a handle on the sight of an over excited teenage boy in pyjamas going off in front of them. What was of interest to them was that I could read their telepathic conversations to each other. I also learned they have ways of telepathically talking one on one and ensuring on ET nearby can listen on to the one on one chat. Once I'd calmed down from hyperactive to just animated the tall one walked asked me why I had been unsure if they were real and why was I out there flashing my torch at them.  I replied that we'd been told they weren't real and others were saying if they were real they were here to harm humans. I said they'd been over our house for the past few months and I was still fine so obviously they were not here to hurt us so I decided to attract the attention of the next one that flew over our house. The tall one asked who was saying they were here to harm them and I said - the Americans said this all the time but I stopped believing that when they'd been over our house for a few months and we hadn't been harmed by this. The Tall one was not happy to hear that I'd been told ET's were here to harm humans. The tall one told me they'd met humans and had not received a friendly reaction from humans. Humans had not made them feel welcome on Earth. I said well on behalf of humans they were welcome here. I think the Tall one and short ones were trying not to telepathically laugh at a human child welcoming them on behalf of humanity but I was so excited and I'd blurted it out as I really wanted them to feel welcome. They told me the Russians were just like us and that I had to like the Russians as well as the Americans as we were all one species. This freaked me out and I had a stand up argument with them saying the Russians were not our friends as they were communists and if they were our friends why were they building so many more weapons than they needed and the Tall one kept saying we (communist or capitalist) must get along as we were all the same. I just couldn't accept this concept so we dropped the conversation and went to a room. A some point they put me in a trance to keep me in one place while they went to another room. I snapped myself out of the trance and went wandering around the corridors. A little ET spotted me and was surprised as was the Tall ET but the tall ET told the little ET I was safe so to let me look around. The little ET followed me everywhere during this phase. Then my time for medicals began so I went back to the room and got on the table/bed. There the tall one told me that they had not been offered much co-operation from Humans and it would like my assistance, by this time it was standing over a bench in the corner of the room preparing some hand held instrument and I was lying on my back on a body temperature metal or plastic table. I said I'd be happy to help it, it could take off an arm if it wanted as long as it didn't harm my ability to think as that was important to me. It was touched by that remark and laughed that it didn't need an arm but would do other things. It did whatever it did then began to put a powered instrument up my nose. I said it looked like it would hurt me and it said if I liked it would stop any pain and I said yes please so it gave me the image of a moth crawling up my nostril while the instrument went in. While the instrument was up there doing whatever it did the ET dropped their guard and telepathically I picked this up so I seized the moment and jerked my head back violently with the instrument still active deep in my nostril. The ET was quick to stop the instrument but the damage had been done, it had sliced me up wherever it was inside my nostrils. The ET asked "" why did you do that"" and I said now you'll have to take me with you, you won't be able to fix that in time. There was a mini conference with the ET's in a corridor and the scout ship bolted to space. I was allowed out to watch as I felt the motion and I was over the moon as I felt this meant I was going with them to their planet. I saw the big ship as we approached it and was transferred to it to be repaired. Sometime during the repairs I realised I was to be returned to home and I was really upset by this so I tried to persuade them my parents didn't love me and I really wanted to go with them. They said I couldn't live with them and wouldn't explain why I couldn't then they showed me footage of my mother panicking in the house as she'd gone to my bedroom and couldn't find me. They used this to show me my story about not being loved by my parents was not true as my mother was panicking so I had to be returned to her. I accepted defeat and went back to the scout ship to be returned. I asked them if they'd visit us and would they please come for dinner and meet my family. The tall one asked if we would cook vegetarian and I said we had vegetarians but they were not normal, we all ate meat. The Tall one was not impressed with meat consumption. They said they would definitely be back. They dropped me off in daylight just in time for me to go to school. While wandering around the scout ship I'd pocketed a small item. I'd kept it with me and the little ET knew I had it. The big ET one either didn't know or pretended not to know that I had it. As I was being let out the door of the scout ship the little one said to stop me as I had an item of theirs. I was asked to stop so I did, no force was used. There ware about 4 of them grouped around me in the corridor and the tall one came over and said "" have you got anything"" I said no an the tall one immediately flashed me a telepathic warning that the others couldn't hear which said ""this is important - hand it over"" so I conceded defeat and handed it over and tried to justify it by saying "" I had to do it you know"" then I was transferred back to my bedroom. My father saw me being returned and wouldn't touch me until Mum made him. My mother was in the house. Unusual observations? Movements, sounds, lights, odours, etc Nothing unusual, it was a metallic disc that hovered quietly and had windows which I could see into when I was standing below it and I could see out of when I was in it. There were no surprises in the interior, it had corridors, separate rooms, a flight control area which was ergonomically correct for a 16 year old and which would have been relatively easy to learn as it looked conventional and uncluttered. The temperature was normal and the furniture was functional for humans as well as ET's. Any human would feel comfortable inside it. The ET's each had distinct personalities. The tall one who did the nose operation on me in the scout ship was very familiar with humans and was relaxed around me. I could chat telepathically with it and it loved talking, it was very enthusiastic about humans and their potential and was surprised humans had not been as positive in their attitudes towards ET's. There was also a short ET that was a bit shorter than me. It didn't trust me and kept following me around. It nearly freaked when I wandered into the flight deck and was leaning over the instrument panel/console. I told it when I grew up I was going to fly these (I meant planes as a pilot but it thought I meant fly UFO's - it dismissed the idea of me flying UFO's when I grew up as ridiculous). The short ET had very limited experience with Humans and felt we were barbarians - not to be trusted. It was watching me to learn more about this human species that it had been warned about but had not had not seen first hand before. That's the impression I was getting from it. I didn't help improve it's attitude as it caught me trying to steal a souvenir and it kicked up quite a stink when it looked like I was going to be released with the souvenir still in my procession. Describe your location relative to the sighting When the ship stopped above me it was say 10 - 20 metres above me and in front of me so I could easily see into it's windows and see the 2 ET's discussing me. It never landed I was in one spot one moment and in the ship in the next moment. Other people? Names, contact details Here are other events reported on the web concerning the UFO flap at the time 1. THE U.F.O. BBS - http://www.ufobbs.com/ufo  Originally dated 5 Aug 1993, 17:29 In the Waimata Valley, New Zealand, Decemebr 2, 1977, a farmer was awoken by his dog barking and, upon investigation, saw a landed ""flying saucer"" on the ground.  Two humanoids were carrying one of his dogs between them and moving towards the object.  They were 143 cm tall and wore close fitting, metallic silver overalls and white, opaque helmets.  These overalls were gathered at the ankles with elastic cuffs which extended over red glowing boots.  On the entities' hands were large silver gauntlets with flared arm coverings extending half way up the forearms.  The white helmets were rounded like large motorcycle helmets and extended from shoulder to shoulder without any markings or openings.  Alarmed my this sight, the farmer fired a shot and apparently winged one of the entities for the two beings dropped the dog and the wounded one ran off into some nearby bushes while the other ran into the craft which took off at speed. This happened to a near neighbour a couple of miles up the Waimata Valley road from us. It happened about a week or two after the encounter the ET's had with me. We knew of it at the time and can believe is as both the residents and the ET's seemed comfortable with each other. The residents accepted the UFO's crop circles and occasional dead cow as ""just another day at the office"" and left the ET's alone and the ET's were quite cheeky with the frequency of their daytime as well as night time appearances and the evidence they were leaving around. The farmer probably shot the ET as he's shoot anyone who was stealing and hurting his dog. A story that went through Waimata Valley as that a couple of days after the event a distressed ET stepped on the road to flag down one of our neighbours as she drove to town. The silly lady floored it and left the ET by the roadside rather than stop and offer assistance. She missed an opportunity there 2.(1. Original investigation by Bryan Dickeson. 2. Retrospective investigation by Keith Basterfield & Bill Chalker. 3. Dykes, M. (1981). ""Strangers In Our Skies."" INL. Lower Hutt. pp46-49.) Three women were involved in an abduction case in the midst of a large UFO flap near Gisborne which began in 1977. One night they were lying on a hillside watching the skies, and felt that a period of ""missing time"" occurred. Shortly after the event a regression hypnosis session was arranged and an abduction scenario revealed. In 1989, during a retrospective investigation by Keith Basterfield and Bill Chalker, a regression session was conducted with one woman. This revealed an account of being drawn up a beam of light; of seeing one of the other women inside the UFO, and of talking to a male entity. All three women were then back on the hillside. I haven't been in touch with the above organisation but I probably know the girls involved in this report. 3"" In late December 1978, air freight pilots reported seeing unusual bright lights hovering over Kaikoura, N.Z. Two weeks later, in January 1979, the mysterious lights returned and were videotaped by Australian and New Zealand TV news agencies. Following the sightings, the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RZNAF), the police and the Centre Observatory in Wellington cooperated in an investigation, the results of which were stamped Top Secret and lodged in the National Archives in Wellington. Calling the report ""a whitewash,"" Hassall was quoted by the New Zealand Press as saying, ""They discussed how to deal with the problem of (UFO) reports and they all agreed to cooperate and investigate... but not tell the public they were exchanging information. Secretly they were trying to figure it out. No one wanted to deal with the problem of UFO reporting. They didn't know what to do about them, partly through a lack of resources to adequately investigate them",2002-07-26T00:00:00,,

I was in the U.S. Air Force, stationed at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.  I was living off base inside a housing compound, outside the local town called Silvertown.  There was no light in the one roomed apartment, yet when I looked, I could see clearly.  I remember waking up on the floor.  My wife was on the bed to my left and slightly behind me.  My attention was drawn to the direction of the doorway.  I saw a large dark figure standing in the door.  The figure seemed to be wearing a hooded cloak or cape.  I think it was dark grey or black  in color. I sat there just staring at it when it seemed to start approaching me.  It didn't appear to be walking.  It seemed to glide across the floor.  I tried to back away from it but couldn't move.  I tried to call for my wife but couldn't make any sound. Although my body refused to respond to my efforts to move, I can remember thinking that if I could make a sound, the fear, and the figure, would go away.  While I can remember it moving toward me, I don't remember it traveling the distance of the room to where I was laying.  That is to say, I only remember it moving a distance of about 3 or 4 feet. I can't recall it ever actually reaching me.  My struggle to move or make some kind of sound seemed to go on for several minutes.  My heart was pounding in my chest and I was desperately trying to call for my wife. Suddenly, I managed to make a whisper/squeak of a noise.  I tried again and the noise came easier this time. Finally, I was calling my wife's name.  I could move as well, although it was extremely difficult.  I dragged myself to our bed.  I reached up and as I was about to touch my wife, everything was back to normal, if you can call it that.  The stranger was gone. So was the loss of my voice and my inability to move.  However, the room was darker and it was harder to see.  I was still on the floor and my wife was sleeping soundly on the bed.  My heart began to slow down and the pounding reduced itself to a normal beating. I just sat there. To this day, I call still recall parts of this incident with great clarity.  But I'm not sure if it was a dream.  I don't recall if I had been drinking alcohol that night but it is a very real possibility.  Nor do I understand why I was on the floor instead of the bed with my wife. I don't know if my wife recalls any of this. I don't even remember if I ever talked to my wife about this, but through the years, I've told this story to others when the topic of strange things comes up. At the risk of coming off as a nut case, other strange things have happened to me as well and are as clear or vivid but may mean nothing. While stationed at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom between 1982-83, I recalled leaving the shop one night to go across the street to another building.  As I left the shop, I was in a direct line of sight to the door that I was heading for.  Suddenly, I ran into a heating fuel containment wall some 8 to 10 feet off the original path I was on.  I don't know how I got my original course but it did leave scratches on my shins. Another incident at the same base and time frame occurred when I left the shop to catch the bus home.  I left the shop at 10 minutes till 1 AM for what should have been a one minute walk to the bus stop.  However, after I arrived at the stop, I checked my watch and it said the time was 20 minutes after 1AM.  In these two incidents, no alcohol was involved due to the fact that I was just coming off duty. And one morning while in England during the 82-83 time frame, I awoke to find myself inside my wardrode (closet).  However, this one could have been due to drinking, but I thought I'd mention it. While station at Hurlburt Field, Florida between 1991-92, I used to drive a stretch of road every night that was not well traveled or lit at that time of night.  On numerous occasions while driving, I expected to hear a loud popping noise come from the dash of my car.  The expectation was so strong that my eyes where prepared to close the way they do when someone is hammering on something over and over and then they suddenly stop, but your eyes still twitch in anticipation of the next blow. One night late 1996 or early 97, while at work with the Gate Rubber Co in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, I experienced what you would call lost time.  I worked with six presses that cure belts for the company.  On this night, I was waiting for press number 4 to open.  I decided to go check something on press number 1 about 15-20 feet away.  I looked at the timer on press 4 and saw that I had 1 minute and 45 seconds before the press was ready to open, so I turned around to go to press 1.  As soon as I turned around and started to take a step, press number 4 opened up.  I stopped and turned back around.  I wondered if maybe I had looked at the wrong timer, but none of the other timers on the unit were set anywhere near a minute and 45.  It was only a minute and 45 seconds and I didn't feel anything else was out of order, but I still recall it with great clarity. One day after I had begun working for the University of Arkansas, I experience an incident where I seemed to gain time.  I checked the time that I entered Hwy 412 at the intersection of hwy 530 (old Hwy 71). And began the 20 minute drive to Siloam.  As I entered the City limits, I checked the time again and found that I had made the trip in 10 minutes.  I verified the operation of my watch and the Curise Control that I always used and found them to be in good working order.  I&#8217;ve never heard of anyone gaining time, although I have experienced times that I felt time had past quicker than I thought it should have. I have the standard ""Scoop"" mark on my left leg that I&#8217;ve heard and read about.  It's been there as long as I can remember. And in 1999, I noticed that there was a scoop mark on the top of my left hand.  I don&#8217;t recall anything out of the ordinary having happened at the time. *********** Additional back ground information. While I was in the sixth grade, I experienced several incident where there were large scabs in my nostrials.  I remember that my grandmother used to have to use large hair pins to remove them.  This lasted several weeks. Around 1976/77 while stationed at Beale AFB in California and living in the barracks, I got up one night to go to the bathroom.  As I walked past my papasan chair, I saw someone sitting there and stepped around them to go into the hall.  I closed the door behind me.  When I went back to my room, I had locked myself out. I knocked on the door, but no one answered.  I finally had to go outside and break into the room.

It then appeared to have stopped moving in that direction (west to east) and it appeared stationary; however a few moments later, the craft which I will say had a hull of a hover craft and a canopy of a stealth fighter, was hovering about 5 to 10 feet above the water, at a distance of 100 feet. It had white lights around the perimeter of the hull and made a horrific constant sound that I cannot even describe.

I was alone and driving west on IL Route 81. At a few minutes after 9:00pm I was approximately 4 miles west of Kewanee on a section of Route 81 running north (near the intersection of Tower Road). On the right (east) are hills and broken timbers amongst pastures and on the left (west) are flat open tilled farm fields. I would have been traveling north. I suddenly noticed a reddish-orange flashing light. At the time, I thought an emergency vehicle or deputy sheriff had suddenly come up behind me. This happened without warning and I thought a vehicle had approached me without any headlights. I had not been drinking or using any drugs. I do recall being somewhat fatigued after a long and busy day. I slowed down and moved the vehicle over to the shoulder of the road. As I came to a stop on the shoulder of the road, I was still thinking I was being pulled over for some reason. I stepped out of the open driver’s side door and realized that a large glowing sphere was positioned almost directly overhead. I estimated the object to be approx 50-70ft above the ground and approximately 20-25ft in diameter. It was smooth and glassy appearing on its surface, which was most noticeable between the brighter intensity pulses. I want to emphasize that these ""pulses"" were not flashes as in on-off but were pulsations of brighter-dimmer, never shutting off completely. I also noticed a strong definite static field that increased in unison with the pulses of brighter light. I could not visualize the surface of the object when the light pulses were at peak intensity. During the less intense/dim phase of the light pulses the surface was clearly visible and totally featureless from my point of view. The surface was very smooth and glass-like transparent and within appeared a swirling, smoky, or viscous liquid type substance against the inner surface. From what was visible to me, I would insist this object was a perfect globe or sphe! re and e mitted light from its entire outside surface. Over the next 1-2 minutes the quality and duration of the bright/dim light cycle changed to a longer bright and shorter dim but the frequency of the light cycle seemed constant. It did not pulse faster, just longer and brighter pulses with shorter dim intervals until it became a constant steady light. I hope I can make this clearly understood. I could feel the intensity of the static field intensify also. I did not move from my position next to the truck between the open door and cab. I had the feeling that something was going to happen with the changes in the light emissions and static field but did not know what to expect. When the light pulses became a steady light, the object very suddenly shot west with a departure so rapid that there was a loud “pop.” I can only describe it as being like a huge cork violently pulled from a bottle. I was aware of no noise prior to this moment. The object stopped very suddenly in the western sky for a few seconds (3-5 miles away?) then seemed to change direction approximately 90 degrees to due north a couple miles, stopping suddenly again for only a moment then disappearing to the western horizon. My next recollection was the realization that I was sitting in my parked truck in my backyard (approximately 2 miles north of the site described) with the truck pointing west and watching the western sky where the object disappeared. This was not an area where I would typically park. I walked into the house a few minutes before 11:00pm. Evidently, I was in the truck for some time. It was a very pleasant evening and I recall an overall feeling of ""stunned amazement"". I do not recall ever feeling fear or apprehension. I realize that some time is unaccounted for.  I have attributed that to some kind of emotional shock. I have remained in excellent health.",2002-07-26T00:00:00,41.2608,-89.9441

A group of 7th graders were supposed to swim in a lake on the mountain top, but moss or scum was on our side of the lake, so we just started talking. The subject was Hawaiian dancing, I remember, and suddenly, one little boy screamed, ""Hey! Look at THAT!!!!"" It was silver, and looked like two saucers glued together with windows where they joined.  It was so close, we could see figures at the windows that surrounded the middle seam. This was 1953, and none of us had ever seen anything move like this craft did. It hovered and then it completely disappeared until it hovered diagonally from where we had just seen it. These 7th graders were beside themselves enjoying this unbelievable demonstra- tion of mechanical manuvering. I was awestruck and was sure it belonged to our govern- ment, and how wonderful!  The boys in the group knew it was a UFO, but I didn't until years later. My friend and I went to the Iowa State Fair, and they announced that there was a showing of a guided missile. I was so excited to see it up close, and when we got there, it was like a stove pipe with a tin hat and nothing compared to the craft we had seen. I asked the military man where the craft was that looked like two saucers with the windows in the middle, and that hovered here and hovered there and disappeared in between times, and he looked at me like I was crazy and said, ""Lady, we don't have ANYTHING like THAT!""  Well, I was so upset to think that what I saw might not belong to America, that my friend and I walked four miles home and I was in terror the whole time thinking how I was so wrong and those little seventh graders were so hep and right. I don't know how large this thing was because we had nothing to compare it to since it was above us and we were on the top of the mountain looking up. The windows were not clear glass, and we saw moving figures, but they were dim and didn't seem large-sized from where we were looking. (Years later, my husband and I heard a woman at my Dad's house in Myrtle Beach, SC, tell how the same type of craft that I saw landed on a freeway where she was driving, and it was enormous in size, and all the people moved to the side of the road and got out of their cars to get a better look. Some teen-ager was behind this woman, and he was so excited, he grabbed her and started jumping up and down and screaming...""I finally saw one!  I finally saw one!""  She was more afraid of him than the UFO.  She said she was always afraid to tell anyone about her experience because she felt people think you're crazy to admit you had such an encounter.)

Your first sighting followed a few months later. I enjoyed hearing that you were so young when it occurred for you. At the time of my experience I wrongly concluded that it would be announced in the next decade. No such luck and the Government is still keeping the lid on it. Perhaps the problem is they don't understand it themselves.       The object made an erratic arc in the sky from San Jose toward the San Francisco Bay Area. It seemed to scan back and forth over what is now Silicon Valley. I have thought about it a lot over the years.Recently, I imagined the UFO may have had a capacity for seeing the future and gathering our  future technology with some time travel to the future. This is really off the wall but once you witness an event like this it defies all our known physical laws and anything may be possible. It is always good to meet a Stanford man and especially one who has spearheaded this adventurous project. It takes a lot of courage to buck the skeptics and you have succeeded admirably. I hope we will meet. Should you visit the Bay Area please let me know. Regards,  ((name deleted)) P.S. My visual location was standing very close to where they located the  Stanford SETI site.

Subject: Web report from 10/01/1961 After reading the report about the Toledo sighting, I felt compelled to send this information about an experience I had as a child while living in Toledo, Ohio. Although I did not see the sphere as described in the report, I did have a communication encounter similar to the person in the report. Reading the report brought tears to my eyes and a chill up my spine. Born in May of 1954  (was age 7 as person in Toledo sphere sighting ). As a child time of day and days of a year were not so important as a reference while growing up. Things like school year, summer vacation, birthday, Christmas were more of a reference point for time. I did not keep a diary or journal but one experience around about the summer of 1961 seems to stand out. It seemed to last over a period of several days or even a week or more. The reason it's not clear is because I believed that my experience was just a childhood dream. It was not until decades later that I suspected my experience was not a dream and that someone or something had given me that impression to remember the experience as a dream. I lived with my mother and father in a ranch style house next to a large wooded area with a small pond and beyond the woods was a large field with a larger pond. My summer evenings were spent sitting in a lawn chair and watching the stars until my parents would make me go to bed. One night as I watched the sky, our dog (who lived outdoors year round ) began barking and tugged on his doghouse chain toward the woods. It was then that I noticed a glowing light (white glow not much different from that of a distant plane) that seemed to be moving over the woods at a slow speed. Soon the light was no longer in sight because of the tall trees. Our dog stopped barking. It was not unusual for the dog to bark at wildlife in the woods at night so nothing seemed to be out of the norm. My father came to the back door to let me know that it was time for bed and I went inside. Thinking about the light, it came to me that there was something odd after all, it made no sound, only a white glow, and no blinking lights like a plane would have. The next morning I went to the woods and walked along the worn path that led to the small pond. It was the same path I had walked and played along with other area children since my parents had moved  here in 1959. As I walked along on that sunny morning, a refection of something in the weeds just a few feet off the main path caught my eye.  I found a rectangular metallic object about 10""x 4""x 6"", it had only a kind of dial with some lines on it, no printed words or letters, no screws. I looked for some way to open it but found none. At this point I carried the lightweight object home and put it on a living room table. Later that day when my mother came home from work and noticed the object she asked, ""where did you get the new radio from?"" At this point I realized the shape of the object did some what resemble a radio and I replied "" found it in the woods this morning"" but I don't think she really believed me and she made a point of telling my father when he came into the room. That evening while watching stars in the sky, I became thirsty and went into the house for a drink. It was then that I heard a strange sound coming from the object on the table and I began to walk toward it when our dog began barking. Turning I went to the back door and stepped out on to the porch. There was the white light moving over the woods just like the night before only this time a feeling came over me that the white glow knew I was watching it. I could still hear the strange sound coming from the metallic box. I watched the white light move over the woods for several minutes until it was out of sight. Once out of sight the sound from the box and the barking of our dog both stopped. The next day would be a changing point in my routine, the last day of summer vacation. A new school year would mean early to bed,  homework and little time for stargazing.  That night sometime before 21:00 (bedtime school nights) while getting ready for bed, the strange sound from the metallic box in the living room was heard again. Within a short period of time, I could hear our dog barking.  I went to the back door and out onto the porch.  There was the white light again moving over the woods as before. The feeling that it knew I was watching came over me again and soon it was gone. Like before the metallic box sound stopped about the same time as the barking of our dog. While getting into bed, I thought that the box found in the woods had some kind of relationship to the white light moving over the woods. Maybe the light was looking for the metallic box. The same situation happened for the next night or two and I got used to the strange sound from the box. It became sort of an early warning system that the white light was near. What happened next is still hard for me to understand. While working on my homework, our dog began barking and barking. He barked for a long time but I did not pay much attention to him because there was no sound from the metallic box. Finally I decided to investigate what was troubling the dog.  I stood looking over at the metallic box and noticed the dial setting had been changed. I went to the box and turned the dial to it's marked setting. Instantly the strange sound was heard and I asked my parents ""how did this dial get moved?"" and my mother looked up from her newspaper and said "" I must have moved it when dusting"". I ran to the door and out onto the back porch where I was frozen with the sight of two small figures at the rear corner of our yard next to the utility pole. They seem to glow with a dim self-illuminating light and to be just as surprised to see me as I was to see them. I could also see our dog that was no longer barking but hiding in his doghouse. I could not move, speak, yell, or scream (I tried but was unable to do anything but watch). The small figure on the right seem to take a step and in a way floated up the utility pole and landed on the telephone wires near where they attach to the pole. What happens next is even more unbelievable. The next thing I recall is standing in the hallway of our house. I am completely paralyzed but can see my parents on the living room couch reading the newspaper. They are unaware of my presence as I try to call out to them with no avail.  At that point I hear the sound of my father's table saw in the basement turn on, saw a piece of wood and then turn off. The front door opens and my mother walks in and takes off her wet shoes just as she always has done after moving the front lawn sprinkler. I hear footsteps of someone coming up the basement steps, the basement door opens and my father walks into the room. From my point of view I now can see two of my mother and two of my father but it is apparent they cannot see each other.  It's at this point where my mind is franticly trying to understand what is happening here. This is when I realize someone or something that I can not see or hear is communicating with me. The most unusual, controlling and overpowering feeling I have ever experienced in my lifetime. The communication went like this: YOUR PARENTS ARE BEING REPLACED, replaced with what? ( I thought), NOT REPLACED WITH WHAT, REPLACED IN TIME, you can't do this I will tell, I will tell ( I thought), WHO WILL YOU TELL?,  I will tell everyone ( I thought),  YOU WILL NOT TELL ANYONE, THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE YOU, THEY WILL THINK YOU ARE INSANE. The most helpless and hopeless feeling came over me. I woke the next morning in my bed. The metallic box object was gone. I never discussed this with anyone for many years and believed in my mind that it was only a dream. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,41.66651057471264,-83.59862988505748

There were no frogs croaking, no bird sounds and no sound at all coming from whatever that thing was across from us.  It appeared to be silver and round.

Normally I slow to get a larger view of the clouds, hills, trees, buildings and roads, and except for the variation of clouds all is usual. But on this particular evening I spotted a small dark object that seemed to be floating above the the city about 1.5 miles away. I had seen this object or one like it, near where I worked in Rio Rancho, NM two years earlier. It appeared to be the same dark sphere maybe 10-20 ft in diameter, and floating around 200 ft above the ground. It had the same characteristics as before of slowly drifting left, right, up and down, but on a horizontal and vertical plane, and not in an arc which would suggest it was tied to string or rope. I watched it for 30 mins or so in its near stationary position, but as the sun began to set I noticed the object was getting smaller and smaller, and believed that it was now moving further away from me in a northern direction. Finally it was so small I could no longer see it in the dim light of dusk. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-08-16T00:00:00,35.9743,-84.28936000000002

This thing was huge, bright and bluish in color and had no tail like a meteor would have. It skirted about the hill tops just west of here...

I have approximated the date knowing it to be sometime during the first 10 days of June.  I awakened during the night with a sense of some presence in the room.  Looking toward my door, I saw, fading quickly, something which almost had the appearance of a hologram.  Next, shadows appeared outside the windows in an erratic shape.  I thought the shadows to be from trees moving in a strong wind.  The appearance was of a storm blowing the limbs to create these shadows outside the window.However, there was no storm.  I looked out the adjacent window on the side of the house facing opposite and there was no wind at all.  In fact, there were no trees positioned in such a way to cast a shadow.  I opened the blinds to see what might be causing the shadows.  I saw what seemed to be a hologram with the shape of two small eyes moving erratically outside the window.  I was frightened and closed the blinds.  I moved to another bedroom in the house and tried to forget what I had seen. Two weeks later, I was awakened late with by a humming sound and again saw the erratic shadows outside the window.  This time, knowing there was no storm or other possible source of shadows from trees or anything else, (I had investigated possible sources and found none,)I was very frightened.  I watched the shadows for 10-15 minutes and then called the police.  When the policeman arrived, we walked out on the back deck to investigate and found no visible signs of any intrusion whatsoever.  After the policeman left I walked toward the door facing the back porch and saw a large burst of bluish white light.  It looked unnatural, almost like a laser.

It was a Thursday night and I was working on three articles I write for a trade publication that was to be laid out the next day. I was in the smaller bedroom, which we have turned into a home office/guest room, on the computer. My wife was in the living room watching wrestling, which came on at 8 p.m. and ran til 10 p.m. I had been writing for what I felt to be about an hour when I just got ""the willies"" or whatever. Then the computer froze up. I got it going again and recovered all my data, saved it and suddenly felt very tired. I decided to finish my work at work tomorrow and I went out to watch television with my wife. When I sat down the wrestling program, which runs for two hours, was going off. I told my wife that I hadn't realized I had worked for so long. She said I had! only been working for about an hour and that it was only about 9 p.m. and she didn't know why wrestling would be going off after only showing three matches, which she named and described in detail. I checked our digital phone and it said 10 p.m. I also checked our clock radio and computer. They all said 10 p.m. I went to a website about the wrestling program and it detailed several matches that night and her descriptions were of the first two matches and the last one. I let it go because she scares easily and we both had a real bad case of the creeps that night and weren't sure why. We were really, really exhausted however and fell right to sleep, hard. I have read up on ""missing time"" and this seems to fit all the descriptions. Also, right after the incident I developed a lump under the skin between my left thigh and genital area.

Speonk is a tiny little town in the south east part of Long Island, right next to West Hampton. I had been out visiting some friends and was on my way home. It was about 2 or 2:30 am, and I was driving down Old Country Road. Old Country road is well named - it's long and windy, with long stretches of nothing but trees or open fields, broken up by the occasional home. I was tired and taking Old Country faster then I should have (the friends I had been visiting lived about 45 minutes to an hour away, so I'd been driving tired for a while), and so I was annoyed to discover very slow moving traffic ahead of me just as I was getting close to Speonk. I was forced to slow down to about 10 or 15 miles per hour, and follow grumpily along behind the 3 cars ahead of me. I was actually just about to stand on my horn when I discovered why they were all driving so slowly - outside my driver's side window, on the north side of Old Country road, we were passing an open fiend, and hovering stationary in the field there was an object. It was dark, so I never saw its exact shape, but there were blue, red and white lights seemingly affixed to its exterior, and bright blue cone shaped lights would occasionally fire out from underneath it, to scan the field below. At first, I thought it was a helicopter, but I couldn't hear the propeller noise, or feel any wind even though if was relatively close to the road (maybe 200 feet away, and slightly lower then the nearest treetops). I rolled down the window to get a better view, and to better hear any propeller noise, and that's when I noticed that it was rotating end over end (it HAD ends - even though I couldn't see it well, I had the impression it was spherical), that it to say vertically, and slightly horizontally as well. This removed any question from my mind that it might be a helicopter - I'd never seen or heard of a helicopter that while stationary, could slowly rotate upside down, while also turning horizontally and shining beams of light down at the ground below. Once my window was completely down, I also noticed that there was absolutely no sound whatsoever coming from the direction of the open field, and the UFO. Me and the rest of the strange 2:30 am traffic along Old Country crawled along, staring at the object in amazement until it was obscured by the reoccurrence of trees along the side of the road. We all just sped up and wend home, without ever saying a word to one another. The next day, I gathered some of my friends who lived in the Speonk/Hampton area, and told them what I'd seen. They laughed at me, and one of them reminded me that Calverton military base is just a few towns over. Those of us who live in the area have always been sure that the military is doing some thing over there that they don't want the rest of us to know about. There are signs on the fence surrounding the military base that say things like ""Do not stop"" (you're car), and such. He suggested that maybe the military was testing some new secret military aircraft. Maybe so, but I've never seen anything befo! re or si nce that day to suggest that the American military has aircraft that can do that.

It was very early evening, still light, and as I stopped at a stop sign on a fairly busy suburban throroughfare, I noticed what I thought was stadium lights on some spare ground that was being made into a park, about 100 feet to my right. Instead of stadium lights, there was a large metal, flattened ovoid-disc, machine(?) hovering just above the trees. No noise. I'm not good at judging size but I'd guess it was around 40-60 feet in diameter. It had a ring of very bright lights circling its lower rim. As I continued very slowly along beside it, it moved, also slowly and very smoothly, in the same direction. It moved with facility and seemed not to be labouring under its own weight. This continued for about a quarter mile. It was slowly gaining altitude but continued on the same path. The road I was on began to veer away from our mutual direction but I watched it until it disappeared from view, as a plane would. What I find stunning about this is that there were many cars on the road. The other travellers must have seen it - it was unmissable - but none of us did what one would expect folk to do under such circumstances, jump out of our cars and point and gawk. I never heard anything about it in local media. I can say with conviction that it was not a helicopter, an aircraft or a blimp. Dunno! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When I first saw the object I was standing on a porch outside my grand parents house so I had enough time to rush inside after a minute of amazement and grab some binoculars that were hung on the wall beside the entrance facing east. My close up look revealed that I could clearly see the craft from all sides because although it was fixed at one point in the air it spun around counter clockwise at around 20 RPM showing off all sides of the craft. The color of the craft was tarnished silver metallic and it was weirdly shaped like a cut precious stone or like a diamond kind of slanted in a 45-degree angle. I say weirdly shaped because its design did not signify any form of conventional aerodynamics. It literally looked like a rock that should have fallen out of the sky. It appeared to be the size of a small prop aircraft or it may have covered almost a nickel I think. I did not see it fly off it was simply gone after witnessing it’s presence for at least 15 minutes.

It had three lights on each side at the wide side of the V.  It was a solid object and there was absolutely no noise at all.  It was going about five miles a hour and was only about thirty to forty feet high.  I tried getting an approximate height by comparing it to our house and the neighbours house.  It came right over our adjoining driveways.  I could see it was black because the street light and our light on the side of our house gave enough light just to reflect light off the UFO.

Then I noticed 3 stars in a triangular pattern that I could not recall ever seeing before.  I began trying to get a fix on the star patterns.  I knew the location of Polaris and these stars were just left of it.  From my position, I'd say they were North Northwest.  Next I located Cassiopeia, just to my right or North Northeast.  So then I looked back to the stars to see if I could identify them and as I watched them, I thought to myself that they were moving.

I was getting ready to take a second measurement when I noticed that I could definitely see movement.  All three ""stars"" were moving in an East Southeasterly direction.

When my brother went out armed only with his BB gun I was both scared for him and curious, hoping he'd find proof of our sighting.   Unfortunately he came back empty handed. Now 31 & 36 my brother and I recently were visiting when my brother asked if I had remembered our experience.  We found it rather eerie that we both remembered it exactly the same way to the detail in the same place all these years later. We're certain It was not fireworks or any other man made device. There are no military bases anywhere near our family home.  It seemed as though it were very close say one mile away but that could have been deceiving.   There's a floodway running behind our house and it seemed as though that was where the lights should have gone.  They may have landed as far away as Bird's hill park which was about 10 miles away. We were unable to make out a ship or anything other than the lights, it seemed very close but still was no more than a bright light. Thanks for allowing a venue to tell our story, people tend to look at you funny when you tell such a story, particularly because of our age at the time.  But how could we both remember something which scared us so much so closely,  Our memory of the event is identicle.  And it happened 25 years ago!

I was walking with my boyfriend late at night.  We looked up and saw a cigar shaped object slowly moving overhead with a humming sound.  The lights of this object were most unusual.  There were approximately a hundred lightsof various colors around the ""equator"" of the object (parallel to the ground).  These lights would blink off and on making it appear that there was a continuous circle of light moving around the ""equator"" of the object (like might be seen with an advertising sign or a carnival ride).  We watched the object for awhile, but quite frankly we were more interested in each other, and so eventually stopped watching this slowly moving object.  Eventually it was gone, but I don't know how. The only aircraft that would be similar to this object would be a blimp, but I have heard that blimps don't travel at night.  Also, the lights were very unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was 17 and my friend was 16 at the time. We had planned to go to the movies that evening. We were going to the 7:00 show. We set off in her car when  she looked down and descovered that the car was on empty. We drove back to her house and she was filling up the car with gas when I looked up to the sky and saw a bright light reflecting silver/white glow. Just for fun I yelled ""Hey look at the ufo."" She looked up and saw it then all of a sudden it zipped across the sky so fast our eyes had to re adjust and relocate the object. This was in the eastern sky it had been it the south. I was more impressed with this than my friend, she wanted to get to the movies. I was saying..""Did you see that!?"" She nodded and said lets go. I was still staring at the light and it shot way up in the sky in a straight line the back to where it had been ,then it shot directly down in a straight line .stoped then shot back up to the middle where it first was. I told my friend to go and get her dads binoculars. We both walked out of the drive way..to the fence that surrounded their chicken coop by the barn. We were still looking at the object. I said to her ..Go get the binoculars so we can see this thing better. To my surprise.. she handed over the binoculars and I looked at her and said,Where did you get those?"" She said,""IN the house."" I asked How, you never left to go get them? She said yes she did and it took her a while because she had to find the keys to get in...I had never heard of lost time during a ufo encounter untill years later. I just thought it was strange. so did she. We started watching the ufo again and as it moved slowly now we walked along to get a better view of it. Through the binoculars it was just to bright. We decided to climb over the fence to go into the field. I remember putting my hand on the post to climb then next thing I knew we both were in the fiedl aprox 400feet away form the fence! We looked at each other and I said,How did we get here?"" She and I both were getting scared and started t! o run fo r the fence back to the barn..the light still in the sky tree top level .The next thing we knew we were standing in the middle of the driveway at the end of it next to the blacktop. We were both facing west side by side. We both turned at the same time to look at each other and both said at the same time,""How did we get here?"" Just then a bright light caught both our eyes over our sholders and up in the sky south of us. It was huge white ball ..it swooped down outa the sky headed directly for us we both ducked down and it went over our heads comming within inches of the driveway in front of us then shooting directly up into the sky outa sight leaving a white trail that also vaiished. We ran into the house,called my sister whow lived not far away told her what happened and she said she beleived me and told me she'd seen something strange not long ago. My friend said , WE'd better hurry if we wanted to see the movie. I l;ooked up at clock above the telephone on the wall and said ,""WHAT!WHAT happened ! Look AT THE TIME!!!! It was 10:30! My sister was still on the phone with me and she you have missed the movie. I said I had to go. My friend and I really were scared now and ran in her room and were trying to figure out where all the time went..4 hours had passed and it seemed to us that it had only been at the most 15 mins. of time that the whole thing had happened. It has been 24 years gone by now and it still puzzles me as to what happened. Over the years I would try to get my friend to talk about that night and she wouldn't untille about 8 years after it happened finally we talked again about it,and how we felt about it then never again have we mentioned it. I have told several people and most think we are crazy. But this did happen to the both of us and I don't care if noone beleives me. The whole time this object made no noise at all.

It was the night of a full moon and I had taken my dog for a midnight walk to a nearby lake reserve, and had walked some distance along the lake side under the gum trees. From this point the reserve opened into a clearing. I had planned to cross this clearing but saw some figures in the distance moving towards me. They were some distance off and I thought they must be three or four boys, judging from their hieght. I also observed a white object that was moving, wich I presumed to be a white pair of jeans reflecting the moon light as the figures moved. As I was a lone female out walking on a reserve very late at night, I thought it prudent to wait quietly in the dark near the trees until these boys had passed on there way. As I crouched there with my dog and watched them approach, I slowly became aware that the figures I had thought were children were actually small humanoids who's arms and legs seemed to be too long for their bodies. They moved with a strange gait and seemed to be unclothed with dark greyish skin (although this was difficult to disern in the moonlight). As I watched in amazement and horror the boucing white object revealed itself as a rolling ball of light trailing behind the three pint size people. At this point my dog began barking and growling at them and was obviously terrified! The figures who had been walking in single file, followed by the rolling ball of light stopped in their tracks. The leader lifted his strange long arm high in the air and let out a spine tingling cry, and at this point my dog bolted with her tail between her legs, leaving me to fend for myself. After watching my dog disert me the creatures duplicated my dogs behaviour and they dissappeared into a thicket of very high wild lupins not far off! This experience was followed up the following night when my cousin, on hearing of my encounter, some how persuaded me to return to the lake with him, armed with a camera. We did not meet anymore strange figures but were buzzed by a large craft of white light which hoverd several times over the clearing.  My cousin took photographs of the light but I wasn't so eager to rush out into the clearing. The strangest thing about the whole episode was that although I was naturally terrified, I believe these creatures were even more terrified of me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We estimated that this object was between 1/2 to 1 mile away and maybe 300-500 feet in the air.  We could not distinguish any type of outline to this object, but it did have a revolving or running style light. From our current viewpoint, it appeared to be a line of lights.  Also, we could hear no noise from this object.  We watched this for approx 5 minutes and then got back in our vehicle and drove to the highway exit and followed this object until we were directly under it.  The object was moving very slowly and we stopped our vehicle and stuck our heads out to view this.  From this angle, the lights appeared to be on the bottom perimeter of the object and formed an oval shape.  The lights also were still moving in a continual revolving or running style.  Also, there still was no sound from this object, even though we were directly below it.  We viewed this time for only a minute until it dissappered from our view over the tree tops.

We decided to park the car at the end of a dead end road, a well known spot to the local young people, near the river bottom. Facing in a northerly direction, directly in front of the car was a pasture, then virtually miles of undeveloped ""bottom"" land covered in timber and underbrush, and used for nothing other than an occasional hunt. As we sat there in the car, talking and listening to the radio, we began to notice a faint glow quite some distance away, which formed a semicircle above the tree line which we were facing. As we watched, the glow began to brighten, and slowly a very large egg shaped object began to rise from the forest at a distance of approximately three to four miles from our location. As the object began to move in a SSE direction (and closer to us), I became extremely nervous and began to ask my brother to leave. Moving very slowly some 100 yards above the earth (judging by the proximity of the 60 ft oaks),  and glowing white much like a huge florescent street light, it had no visible windows, lights, portals, or attachments of any kind. The others in the car at first seemed very curious at this sight, and were wanting to stay and watch it. I, however, was insistent that we leave immediately, and I soon convinced my brother to start the car. In order to leave the area, as we were on a dead end road, we had to travel due east approximately one mile to the intersection, and then travel south back toward town. As we began to approach the intersection, the object had traveled just to the SSE of the intersection, and had stopped and was hovering in mid air for a moment, and then reversed it's course as if to meet us at the intersection. We were moving down this small, dark backroad at an incredible speed, and as we reached the intersection, the object had almost reached it as well. The only sound that was emitted was a strange, barely audible humming noise. It was at this point that we realized that this ""ship"" was approximately the length of a football field, and twice the width. As we rounded the corner of the intersection and began heading south, the object redirected it's course as well, and began heading south directly behind us at a distance of some three hundred yards. I watched out the back window as we sped down the road, all the while yelling at my brother to ""Hurry Up!"", and in and instant this huge object literally zipped into the sky so fast that I could not distinguish it from the stars. I continued to look for it, and soon, I watched as it moved slowly in a horizontal direction, then reversed and rapidly danced around the sky in all directions for several moments. I lost track of it at this time due to the tree limbs rushing by overhead. Judging by the size of the object as I had observed it previously, it had managed to ascend to an altitude of some 30,000 feet or so in a split second, without any increase in noise level. The most bizarre part, in my opinion, is that we had spoken about the occurrence immediately after it occurred but after that night I was the only one who mentioned it again. A week or so after this event,  my husband and I had joined some friends at the lake, where they had a small bonfire and party. I was sitting on the tailgate of our pickup and again it was a very clear night. I noticed something move in the sky, and began to tell our friends of the experience we had had the previous weekend. As I started to recount the story, I began to feel extremely nervous, and decided to drink a beer to calm down. As I began to cross the parking area toward the beer cooler, I felt the most excruciating pain of  my life. In mid stride, several yards from where I began, I felt as if a bomb had exploded in my head. I had collapsed on the ground and was throwing up from the intensity of the pain. My husband picked me up and loaded me into the pickup, then drove to my parents house just a few miles away. I laid on the den floor, still sick and in extreme pain, while my father applied ice packs to my head and waited for my mother (a nurse) to return from work. A couple of hours and narcotic pain killers relieved the pain. I didn't mention the ufo incident to anyone again for over ten years, strictly out of fear. Over a decade later, after thinking of that night again and again, I mentioned something to my sister-in-law about ""the time we saw the ship"", and literally watched the hair stand on her arm. She had an incredible look on her face, as she told me that she had not thought of that night since it had happened. She wondered how she could have forgotten such a sight, and shuddered as she relived it. Based on this, I then asked my brother (now her husband), the same question. Again, the same response. In over ten years together, neither of the two had thought of that night until I had brought it up, and then all the details rushed over them as if it had happened yesterday. My husband and I were divorced just thre! e years after this occurrence, and he had never mentioned it to me in those three years. I have thought of  contacting him to ask the same question. I have always had full recollection of  the entire episode, and have remained silent due to fear. I wonder why I remembered and they did not.",2002-11-20T00:00:00,,

Since it was during the night, what I could see was somewhat a circular shape, but what I'll never forget are the lights that it had, they were orange, but very soft, they illuminated, yet didnt hurt my eyes when looking at them directly.  The object also made a very soft and nice noise I've almost forgotten know.  The flying object was stationary at about 100m high, it seemed as if it were going down, then my mother got scared, held my hand, and we went back inside.

My father and 2 brothers were in the cab of the truck and I was riding in the back with a friend of my father's who was asleep. I was laying down on a matress that was in the bed of the truck, my head was near the cab. It was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon and we were traveling east on highway 152 going toward San Luis Dam and Pacheco Pass. We were travelling about 50-60 mph. I looked to the north and saw two egg shaped objects (one slightly ahead and above the other) traveling in the same direction as we were. My first thought was that they looked beautiful and absolutly perfect and pristine. I then said to myself ""that's right, that is what they look like."" I then realized that these objects were being piloted as I could sense a ""presence"" in the way they moved, this frightened me. I watched them for as long as I could for they were going a little faster than we were and were slowly moving up and away from us. I lost sight of them as they were lost in the haze of the setting sun. I was unable to determine their size but they were about the size of a pea held at arms length and I could see that they were round because of the shadow along the rear bottom portion. They were not shiny but white and they looked just like two chicken eggs, (I always felt silly telling people that they looked like chicken eggs.) Later on in life I connected the feeling that I had recognized them (""that's right, that is what they look like"")with an incident that happened when I was nine yrs old. A neighbor found me walking down the street at 3 oclock in the morning and brought me home. After I woke up in the morning the neighbor came over to our house to see if I was OK. At that moment I remembered that I had had a dream that night and in the dream I was standing on the front porch looking at someone on the other side of the fence but in the dream it was very, very bright outs! ide, bri ghter than daylight.

On February 6, 2000 I was watching the History channel at approx. 2:00 p.m. pacific time and saw to my astonishment a show describing the exact thing that I saw, the exact words that I had spoken during the event and the feeling that I had at the time and after when I had recalled the event in the early 90's. The incident on the show had occured in Alagash Maine, which is across the lake from where I saw this thing.  It looked to me as if the Sun was rising over the mountain, but it was nearing midnight.  I thought it was the end of the world.  Then, I said that it was only the sun and never thought any more about it until some years later.  I have been frightened by the thought of UFOs ever since even though I had never really considered them prior to my memory of that big bright light rising in the midnight sky.  The report that I saw on the History channel so disturbed me and also affirmed what I had seen to be true that I began writing the names of the others that had seen it down on paper as well as the names of the hypnotists that they saw.  It has taken me this long to ask for some assistance and perhaps just to let them know that what they saw, and felt also happened to me at the same time, although I cannot remember the exact date.

Unidentified Bright Light Sitting On Road,Glennallen,AK,1980-08-05T23:15:00,rectangle,25 minutes,"Occurred : 8/5/1980 23:15  (Entered as : 8/5/80 23:15) Reported: 10/2/2002 2:52:08 AM 02:52 Posted: 10/15/2002 Location: Glennallen, AK Shape: Rectangle Duration:25 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25361.html,"Unidentified Bright Light Sitting On Road While driving from Glennallen to Anchorage in a remote wilderness area, we observed a very bright light apparently on the road from a high ridge about 2.5 miles and several hundred vertical feet above the light.  As we drove down the hill we lost any view of the light.  The road at the bottom of the hill turned approximately 90 degrees to the right, and then went up perhaps 30 feet vertically and about a quarter-mile horizontally before we could see the light again. It was painfully brilliant to our dark-adapted eyes and we slowed the vehicle more and more as we drew closer because we could not see the road in front of us well enough to drive -- finally drawing to a complete stop approximately 200' from the object.  Multiple flashings of the high beams to attempt to get the light reduced did not help, and we slowly creeped forward in small spurts until we were approximately 150' from the light source. We waited perhaps 5 minutes for the light to change in some manner or another and began to get rather alarmed at the strangeness of it.  I made some comments about the fact that the light was super brilliant on the trees for as far as a line of sight carried it, but that it didn't reflect off of the metal of the car very intensely, so that I surmised it had some sort of polarization to it.  At that point our irritation turned quite sharply to fear when the unusual and unexplained nature of the event forcibly hit us. We backed up slowly for about 50', approached the again light slowly, freaked out, turned the car around, and raced back around the curving road through the 90 degree left turn and up the long, tall, straight hill.  It's embarrassing, but in our adrenaline-flushed brains, we had felt the car was ""bumped"" or ""jostled"" as we were approaching the light the second time, and we hit a top speed in excess of 90 mph in our subsequent flight.  The car was floored all of the way up the hill and well beyond. We travelled approximately 5 miles away from the light (and away from our intended destination) at high speed before we felt safe enough to pull over and discuss contacting the Alaska State Troopers.  We shortly decided that we had been rather cowardly, and did not want to be grist for the media grill, or the subject of jokes and ribbings.  Accordingly, we elected to return to the top of the large hill to observe the light from afar. Our second trip to the top of the hill confimed that the light was still there.  And we watched it for what seemed like a long time -- though it may have only been a few minutes.  There was no other traffic in either direction, and the light was unwavering.  We were too spooked to investigate with another close approach to the light, and we attempted to restore our self-respect by making a quasi-scientific observation:  The light was of the apparent brightness of a large stadium light pack.  It had a color temperature of 8000 or higher, i.e., an actinic blue-white that destroyed our night-vision if we stared at it too long.  It seemed to be a uniform rectangular source approximately 30' by 20' in size when we approached it closely, but appeared to be oval in shape when viewed from above and at a couple miles distance on top of the big hill. We finally decided to return to Glennallen and report our sighting to the Troopers...  or at least just go back and keep the whole thing to ourselves.  We had only driven back towards Glennallen for about 2 minutes when a light source appeared to be coming from the Glennallen direction.  This time however, it was a large tractor-trailer rig, a huge truck with a huge trailer that was literally barrelling down the road at 65 mph (we clocked it). We stopped and followed the rig.  We began to look forward to seeing what would happen to the scarey USO (Unidentified Sitting Object) as the comfortingly huge and purposeful symbol of human industry plowed toward it.  At the top of the large hill, and cruising in the wake of the big rig, we saw the light still sitting there, less than three minutes away as the truck briefly hit seventy on the downhill stretch. We came to the bottom of the hill, turned the 90 degree corner to our right, and coasted along in the wake of the giant truck, an irresistable force!  As we came to where the light had been seen before, there was nothing!  We hurriedly scanned everywhere, but stayed close to the truck.  No lights, nothing!  Within the next five minutes, we passed several cars going the other direction, but never saw anything that even remotely looked like the strange light. On a return trip later in the week we stopped at the place where we had had such a fright a few nights before.  I personally walked the pavement in the area, but could see nothing out of the ordinary.  We never knew what to make of the strange event, but have rarely driven a remote road at night without remembering it.  It has been more than twenty years as I write this report, so I apologize for any inaccuracies or forgotten details.  I have not observed any other unexplained phenominon in my life. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) Hello Mr. Davenport, You may post my account as you wish.  I was quite impressed with the ufocenter site, and am sorry that I did not get a chance to record my father-in-law's experiences on that same stretch of road before he passed away.  His story was much more interesting, but never recorded accurately.  I am now sorry that I never interviewed him carefully on the subject. I plan to return to the ufo center site in the future and peruse the information there in more detail when I have time to do so.  Thank you for your fascinating endeavor -- and especially for your objective efforts to discriminate fact from fancy. ((END FOLLOW-UP))",2002-10-15T00:00:00,,

When we got just outside of Middleton,  about 500 meters from the wilmot sign, we were crossing the little hallow that spans from middleton and enters wilmot and when we got into the middle of the hallow where there are less trees, we could both see three very bright orange lights with a little blue appear from over the north mountain. they were so bright that the light reflected from the river that passes below the bridge.  ((name deleted))'s first thought was that it was probably a few stars but stars are not as bright as these were.  they were so bright in fact, that you could see the house and barn in the distance pretty clearly, where as normally at this time of night you couldn't. my first thought, maybe airplanes.   but there was no sound.  my dog (2 year old pomeranian) began to whine a little, i didn't know if she was scared, or what.  maybe she just wanted to get moving on.  The 3 lights began to blink one at a time and out of unison, twinkling like a christmas tree for about 10 seconds.   ((name deleted)) let out a little chuckle and the said ""i'm getting ((deleted)) scared man!"" i was nervous and i got out my cell phone and called my cousin who lives about a 5 minute walk away from where we were and told him to get into his FAST and come to the hollow.    then lights seemed to back away and fly behind the mountain again leaving light shining from behind the mountain and shining up through the sky simular to the Aurora Borealis effect.  5 seconds passed as the light became dimmer and dimmer and then brighter again and brighter until the three lights came back to the same exact position as they were before, accompanied by 3 more lights. Six bright orange lights flew around each other in the firefly fashion for about 30 seconds and then stopped on a dime. Then they oraganized themselves as three lights remained on the bottom and to more were over the 3 lights and one light on top - all close together , forming a small triangle.  my cousin! arrived with his car, got out,  and said out loud ""what the hell?""  my dog began barking out loud and much with a few whines in between each bark.   the triangle of lights raise up in the sky over the north mountain.  up, up, up, up, til they were like about 5 kilometers up in the sky and proceded to fly pretty quickly across the valley from the north mountain to the south mountain.   Except for the dog, we were all very silent as the small triangle of lights flew over us.  i had to cover my dog's mouth for a few seconds to hear the faint high pitched hovering or humming sounds coming from up above.  you could only hear them if you listened carefully because they were so far away but they sort of sounded like a swarm of Bees.  my cousin said in a nervous voice ""lets get out of here!"" after the lights passed over us and continued flying south, they disappeared completely. me, ((name deleted)), and my cousin were silent for a moment but the dog continued barking.   i asked my cousin what the heck that could have been.  and he didn't know, neither did i, nor billy. No one of us slept for a few nights becare it was really a hard to forget, scary experience.  we have told a few people about this but no one believes us. We don't do drugs, and as neither of us had any money for liquor that night, no one of were drinking and we were totally sober.  it's something none of us will every forget.

I had leaned back to look up at the stars and I saw a very large bright yellow/white light very high moving very fast towards the direction we were coming from.  I then stated very loudly holy shi? there is a UFO and proceeded to point up at the object and about 10 or so other people saw the object and had about the same reaction that I did. Well, after that we were able to see it for about 5 to 10 more seconds and we lost sight of it.   Well after that I had spoken of it only once or twice with my friends until I came across an article on flying wings on MSNBC today 08/05/2002 and that made me think of it.   Well that made me search for NJ UFO sightings and it turns out there were many other people who saw objects that night but none around the time of ours?   So I  just thought I would let you know about what we saw. Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Sightings over Carteret, NJ, occurred on the morning of Sunday, July 15, 2001.

When I saw the object(s), it stopped and remained that way for approximately 10 mins or so. In those days there were no aircraft in those parts, and the only things we were used to seeing were shooting stars or the Gemini or Russian spacecraft occasionally orbiting the earth at a pedesrian pace One of the lights then detached itself from the group, seemed to hover for a few seconds and then accelerated upwards at a phenominal rate.

There were 12 blue lights in a triangular formation flying at about 3 times treetop level. There was no noise at all. I was sure that no one would ever believe me and was very exited when 2 guys came running up the street yelling ""Did you see that?"" They had been chasing it for several blocks. That should give you an idea of it's speed. It moved slowly away at a steady pace and headed directly towards Langley Air Force Base, which was only several miles away by air. Having grown up in the area, I knew what planes looked like in flight and usually paid them no mind. This was not any type of conventional aircraft.

My two friends and I were returning to college in Louisiana after working the summer in Washington state. I was driving along the coast highway at dust. Suddenly we all noticed a motionless hovering white ball of light, shining a cone of light on the beach. After approximately 10 seconds the ball of light shot off toward the horizon - west over the ocean - at an incredible speed. The cone of light remained, slowly becoming dimmer and assuming a ""smokey"" apearance while maintaining the cone shape. It gradually faded away. I do not know the time of the event, but it was dusk. It was a clear day and little if any clouds. The first impression (dictated by logic) was that it must be a helicopter with a searchlight, but try as we might, there just was no helicopter (or anything else) there - just a ball of light. The distance from us to the light is difficult to estimate, but in order to provide some context, I would guess it was between 70 and 100 yards away. The size of the ball of light is also difficult to gauge, again I would guestimate approximately 3 feet in diameter. The length of the cone of light was approximately 30 feet. We stopped at the next town (heading south), Gold Beach, Oregon, and reported to the police what we had seen. They told us that a lot of people had been reporting UFOs recently but what we saw was a meteor(!). With that, we returned to the car and continued on our journey.

My father was driving, my mother in the passenger seat, my niece in the back driver's side, and I in the right back passenger side of the car. The object was in a position of about 1 o'clock (To my right, SW), hovering at about 200', over a vacant corner lot, on a busy city street, in the midst of tall office buildings.  It's altitude was below some of the tallest buildings, so that it should have been seen by anyone looking in that direction, either from the ground level or out of any of the buildings' windows.  It must have been casting a shadow directly beneath. It was a highly polished, aluminum-looking disc-shaped craft, round, about the size of a third of a city block (it covered the entire vacant lot).  The best way to describe it would be that it had the appearance and proportions of a fat silver dollar with rounded edges, but absolutely smooth.  There were no extraneous antennas, wings, tail, propellers, insignia, doors, windows, etc..  It hovered motionless, without sound that I could hear (my window was open). I watched it for about 6 seconds, thinking, ""Oh, there's one now.""  In other words, I was very calm.  There was no question in my mind that this was an extraterrestrial craft. I turned my attention to the interior of the car and asked my family, ""What's that?!""  Unfortunately, at that exact moment, a small private plane was buzzing the freeway, very low, right in front of us, from right to left (from the direction of the craft).  Everyone in the car said, ""It's a plane.""  I said, ""No, not that!  That!"" and as I turned to point to the object, it was gone.  No one else in our car saw it.  I do believe that the people in the small plane came close enough to call it a near miss.  Maybe that was why they were so low over the freeway; they had spotted it and came down for a closer look. Since it had just disappeared, or had taken off straight up (the only two possibilities, considering the close quarters it was in amongst the tall buildings), I looked up and down in every direction (as much as possible from the back seat of a car) for miles.  The sky was absolutely clear with only one small cloud to obscure any view.  I watched this cloud dissipate, as they do in the desert, trying to see if maybe the object had flown into it.  One can see for miles in the flat desert around Phoenix, and I could not spot it anywhere. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))",2002-06-12T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

Low enough where we can see it more up close. It made another sound that went ""Bloop Bloop Bloop Bloop Bloop"". I had notice that this oval shaped object was heading Northeast; maybe it was heading towards over by the Glenview Air Naval Airbase. (in which it is has been closed down known as of today) As of now. I graduated out of Little City, no longer live there. I am 43 years old and I lived out in the community on my own in the city of Chicago. As of now up until to this date, Nobody really claims that they had seen this strange looking oval shaped object! or even remember it! If anybody knows of this or recall of seeing this Oval Shaped Object in June of 1977. I would like to know what in the heck it was??? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Whisper quiet hovering craft.,Kilmarnock (UK/England),,1977-05-15T02:00:00,,20 minutes,"Occurred : 5/15/1977 02:00  (Entered as : 05/15/77 0200) Reported: 6/6/2002 3:54:44 PM 15:54 Posted: 6/12/2002 Location: Kilmarnock (UK/England),  Shape:  Duration:20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23168.html,"Whisper quiet hovering craft. I saw lights flying in the same direction as the van i was driving, but about 2 miles to my right.  They got closer to me as i approached the town, and we met just about 100 yards into the first street of the town, opposite a golf course.  The craft hovered above a row of trees adjacent to the main road, so I stopped and got out.  What amazed me most was the lack of noise, with just a very light motor noise similar to a hairdrier or vacuum cleaner, but at 2am I expected it to be more of a disturbance.  My experience of attending airshows as a photographer meant that I was aware of helicopter noise and other aircraft noises.  It was a year later that I first stood near a Harrier vertical take-off fighter jet, and the noise was deafening.  That's when I knew I had seen something spectacular.  I did not report this sighting, indeed I have told only a few close friends for fear of being ridiculed, but I feel that your site is for serious reporting so I am entrusting this to you.  The date I entered is approximate as I am unsure, but it was definitely early hours Sunday morning and definitely summer 1977 between March and June when I drove the vehicle I mentioned.  Most likely May sometime.  Visually it was difficult to tell shape because all I could make out were four lights arranged in either a square or a cross depending on what the body of the craft actually was.  It hovered at about 200 feet, a height I estimated from being about 4 times the height of the trees, and I estimated them at 50 feet being the exact height of the local rugby football club goalposts.  After about ten minutes, the craft seemed to edge away slowly in the direction it had come, and then accelerated to a fantastic speed back in the direction of the local airport about 10 miles away.  I racked my brains to think what type of craft it could be, and at that time my best guess was a Harrier fighter jet until I saw my first one in the flesh a year later.  What I saw was not a Harrier, not a helicopter and not any type of aircraft I hav! e ever seen in time as a photographer at airshows or a member of Air Training Corps on Royal Air Force trips.

A friend a I where hunting wild hogs one evening. We were running dogs all night and stopped at the end of a road in the woods about a 1/2 mile or so off the bee line express way. It was early morning around 1 am or so. We were sitting down smoking a cigarette when I looked up and ask my friend what that was in the sky. The stars were everywhere but one was quite bigger than the rest it was blue and had to be four times larger than any other star. I started flashing my maglight at it. For about 5 minutes. Then it just took off and went to the size of all the other stars in a matter of seconds with 4 or 5 littler red lights following it. It just stayed there after that. I told my friend that was really wild . We couldnt see the red ones after they took off but I could still see the same blueish star that was much closer just a few seconds ago. My friend was just blowing it off but I knew anything we had couldnt have moved like that. We sat there for about  fifteen to twenty minutes talking then my friend wanted to go home which was a bout a mile away. So we started walking back I heard a hovering sound I will never forget wasnt loud just different. I turned around and Saw a red shape above the tree tops at the end of the pasture It had a star like light below about 50 feet and it just stayed perfectly still. Then without a change in sound it just moved left then right. It was big It was cigar shaped the light below it moved like it was part the craft but you could tell it wasnt attached. We never heard it approach or seen anything around it just appeared out of no where. I wanted to walk to the tree line where it was but wouldnt go alone and my friend just wanted to get out of there. So we walked through the woods back to his place. When we got to his house we looked over in that direction and you could see a light a little smaller than a dime red in tint with a light just below it. It is very hard to put into words what we actually saw that night but believe me it wasnt right. It took me this long to w! rite abo ut it. but it was like it happened yesterday. I never believed the stories about ufo sightings until this happened to me. To me there is no other explination for it. You can try and say it was something man made but you were not there to see what I saw.,2002-07-26T00:00:00,28.519246697974758,-81.35409597886704

I looked up from a top the hill to see 3 sphere shaped bright balls in the formation of a triangle. They were moving very slowly, practically stationary and it definetly didn't seem normal. They continued to hover and then another sphere with the same dimensions and the same level of brightness as the other spheres emerged out of one of the original bright spheres. My friend had suggested that it was the apocalypse. Out of the first two original spheres came more spheres, again the same size and brightness. Then out of the clones came out another clone. This kept happening until there were about twelve spheres. The clones then started to form the original triangle pattern which the first three spheres were in. I know others also saw the incident because their were many cars all around that stoped to observe what was happening. The spheres were just as bright as they were before and then one of the spheres sort of flashed and disappeared. The rest of the spheres did the same and disappeared in an instant. We couldn't understand what it was , how they cloned each other and how they  disappeared in an instant. Note: we were observing this incident from a top a hill in manhattan.

Off the coast of Wilmington(South)about 7-8 miles out from Frying Pan Shoals, we were night fishing for some Grouper and off in the horizon I thought I saw a glimmer of something out of the corner of my eye, but didn't pay to much attention to it being that I was re-baiting one of our lines. My buddy was lying down below trying to catch a quick nap, so I kept an eye on things (making sure we didn't get runover by some freighter or something). After, roughly 5 minutes went by I saw a glimmer of something again, this time I kept looking in that direction but couldn't make out anything, but I began to hear what sounded like a faint hum. NO lights, just an object or something off in the distance. I started getting paranoid at this point and decided to turn on our nav lights just in case another boat was coming, but really couldn't hear anything outside of a faint hum. I woke my buddy up, and told him what was going on, then told him to help me look for something off in the distance, because I knew something was there. My biggest fear was that another vessel was coming straight at us and we just couldn't see the lights yet. Finally, to the SouthEast of us we both saw what we thought at the time was a freighter coming because of the size, but we both remarked about that in the probably 10-12 years we've been fishing together,we have never saw a large ship at night with NO nav lights on.  I started to grab my VHF radio to call and see if anybody knew what the hell was out there when all of the sudden there was this loud screaming sort of sound, not like a jet engine, but like a low pitch whine of a... I really can't think of anything, maybe a firework rocket inside of an empty dome stadium, sort of. It came right at us and over us by only maybe 30 feet or so, but it happened so damn fast that it almost gave us a heart attack. We stood there, both of us dumbfounded, we could almost hear each others heart beating we were so scared. After, about 5 seconds or so we both looked at each other and yelled ""What in the F--- was that."" When we finally turned around in the direction of whatever it was went all we could see was that faint glimmer again, but suddenly the faint scream and the glimmer were gone. We radioed out to see if any other boats might have been close enough in the vicinity to see or hear anything, but naturally NO!  Shape and exact size are hard to tell, when it came at us I could barely tell, but it was tapered looking and it did have a metallic type look but not shiny. If you can picture a small airliner buzzing you at about 30 feet thats sort of how it was. Not a terrible amount of wind to speak of as it came by, about like a car coming by you on the side of the road, enough to feel it, but not like it's going to knock you down or anything. Why didn't we report it sooner, I don't know. We both tried to come up with everything imaginable to explain it, and yes, we did consider telling somebody about it, well, we did tell a few people, but nobody of an authoratative type nature, but when my wife came home one night after a PTO meeting and she told me that somebody remarked"" ---- been seeing anymore UFO's lately?"" Well, I kinda let it go. I really don't say to much about it anymore except to my buddy, when he suggested that I go look up some stuff on the net and low and behold I found this sight. So I figured what the hell? Well, thats about all I got to say on the subject, but if anyone else saw the same thing that night/morning, post it on here so I can see it.

It flew very slowly and rotated. I can't remember exactly what day of the week it was, but I do remember it was a clear blue sky.  A perfect summer day.  I lived in the country on a farm, and my grandmother lived across the road.  On her front yard she had a 'mini' forest of pine trees that were fully grown.  This little forest was about 100 yards by 35.  Also, the church I attended was only about 500 yards west from my house.  (the road i lived on ran east and west) I believe it was late morning when my friend and I went across the road to play in my grandmothers barn.  It got to be close to 1:00 and we decided we should go back to my house.  We walked through the trees and down the ditch to cross the road when we both heard a loud humming/buzzing sound from above.  We both looked up and saw a large boomerang shaped flying object.  I would have to say that it was shaped exactly like a boomerang, with small towers at the three ends or arms that stick out of a boomerang.  There was also one slightly larger tower in the center.  The color was a very light blue, and I remember alot of little flashing lights on the top of it. I would also have to say that it was flying at under 1000 feet.  Probably 700-800. It was almost directly over the church when we saw it.  We then ran back under the cover of the trees and watched it move, very slowly, and also rotate as it moved. It proceeded over the church and kind of circled over it and headed South.   We intently watched it, waiting for it to go away.  It got to be about a half mile away and circled back.  It made another run over the church and went back south.  We watched it until we could not see it anymore.  We then ran across the street back to my house. We did not say a word to my parents, or to his, because we knew at our young age nobody would believe us.  I did not tell anyone until after I was 16.  I'm not sure when the first time my friend told anyone.  Probably waited longer than I did. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-07-01T00:00:00,44.020500000000006,-88.1535

It was a warm evening, the windows were open, there was no sound. I shut off the engine, the ""tower"" began to move, it moved due north at an increasing speed. One of my friends aimed his varmint rifle at the ""tower"" and watched it until it disappeared from view without any course deviation, this was perhaps a minute after it was lost to naked eye view. There was never a change in color or configuration while I watched. The lights were in the shape of a pyramidal type TV or radio tower all lights were white in color, and about as bright as the marker lights on such a tower, much brighter than any stars. My friend stated that through the 20x rifle scope he could see no features or shape only the lights. He stated there was nothing between the lights, he could see the stars through the formation. The speed of the objects could not be estimated, but appeared to move at a constant acceleration, probably at about mach 2-3 before dwindling from sight, alternatively the lights dimmed and the formation closed at a constant rate.

I was on the roof of my mother's apartment building, located in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. That's right, Brooklyn, New York just a few miles outside of the Big Apple itself. If memory serves, I believe I was locked out of our top floor apartment, having misplaced my keys. So I had to wait for my mother to return from having dinner with my father from Chinatown on the roof of my mother's tenement building. I recall it being a very nice night, kind of on the cool side, with low clouds at approximately 5,000 to 7,000 feet of altitude. Aside from the low, scattered clouds, the night sky was clear as a bell, and much of the stars were highly visible that night. What particularly had my utmost attention that night, was the elevated degree of meteorological activity that was taking place. Okay, so here I go. I witnessed an unusually low-flying ""shooting star"" decend toward the east, when to my amazement I noticed, just a second (or two) later, a oval-shaped object emitting a soft-white glow behind it as if it were in pursuit. In the next few minutes (perhaps for as much as the next 15-30 minutes or so) there were quite a number more of low-flying meteorites. One was of sufficient size, or perhaps it streaked low enough that I could actually hear it wisking through the atmosphere. The sound was brief, lasting approximately a second or so. From different directions in the night sky, I observed the same unidentified oval-shaped object fly in pursuit of several falling meteorites. By the time much of this increased meteorolgical activity was over, my mother had returned. I called her and told her to come up to the roof quickly. I then told her what I had been seeing, upon which she stayed with me for a while to gain the chance of possibly witnessing what I had seen for herself. Within a few minutes, another meteorite streaked in the distance to the east, after which both my mother and I witnessed the U.F.O. in pursuit. Before the U.F.O. ""disappeared"" and ended its low altitude airshow, it flew towards both my mom and I on our left as we faced east. (Something makes me recall there being two this time, but I can not recall for sure.) It flew level and then took a 30 to 45 degree ascent into a cloud bank and disappeared for what I thought was for good. Later on that evening, at approximately 00:30 hours, my brother had come up to the roof after having heard what was going on to catch a glimpse and mostly to poke fun. He was with me, when we both witnessed a distant point-of-light, that caught our eyes. From its distance and apparent height, it could have been a plane at high altitude or a star by appearance. Except, this ""star"" started moving irregularly across the sky and changed its relative position by a great distance. It is my belief that this object was very high up in the sky or possibly even outside our planet's atmosphere. My brother dismissed what we both saw as OUR eyes playing tricks on us. On some level, I wish I could have done the same. I am glad for my mother having witnessed the U.F.O. flying at low altitude with me, as I needed someone to affirm that I was actually witnessing these crafts, right here, above the metropolis of New York. I wish I could estimate the size of the craft to some degree of accuracy. In the night sky and at a distance, it is a bit difficult to get an idea as to an object's relative size without some common frame of reference. What I can say is that the U.F.O. conducted manuvuers that only a fighter jet would be capable of performing. Its movements were swift and precise, but not necessarily beyond the means of a fighter jet. However, the U.F.O. performed all of the above flying activity at what appeared to be supersonic speeds. Not only did I not hear a sonic boom, I did not hear the craft produce an audible sound of any kind. Nor did I notice even a neglible loss of speed when it finally made its ascent into the cloud bank from which it did not reappear.",2002-10-15T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I noticed your graphic of the 7/23/02 Los Angeles sighting on the main page and it matches precisely what I saw (with two others) on a camping trip in April, 1994. We were in what is called the Croom section of the Withlacoochie National Forest, and all three of us are university instructors. We were lying on lawn chairs around a campfire and I looked up to see what appeared to be a huge (football-field sized, perhaps) chevron-shaped formation of red lights. The other two witnesses didn't seem concerned, but did remark, as I did, that it was ""odd.""  It was either one very large object or 7-8 small ones, but my best guess is one large, black or dark gray object moving very slowly overhead, absolutely silently.  The red lights were around the periphery, from a point at the front and widening toward the back. One witness suggested helicopters, but I pointed out that I didn't think they'd be flying in formation with no lights but a single red one, at night, over the forest. The object(s) moved slowly (I don't know which direction--we were in the woods, at night) and disappeared.  It took probably 15-20 minutes. The next morning, one of the witnesses (my husband) and I went out birdwatching; I left him to finish by himself (too many blackflies) and he disappeared. That is, it took numerous searchers on horseback, rangers in trucks, a helicopter, and--finally--a tracking dog to find him at about 21:00 hours that night. He said he took a nap in the woods, and was slightly disoriented and dehydrated when checked in the ambulance afterward. He still won't discuss what happened to him that day, although he appears to have suffered no obvious aftereffects. My own interest in UFOs goes back to my childhood. The third witness has since moved to a different town and we've never talked about this. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE)) Dear Mrs.((deleted)),  Thank you very much for the most interesting report!!  I do not know what it was you witnessed that night, but I agree with your assessment that it almost certainly could not have been a conventional aircraft.  Is there any possibility that you could reconstruct the precise date of the sighting?  For example, do you have a record in a bird-watching diary, fuel receipts, or something along those lines, that would permit you to establish an unambiguous date for the event??  Is there any possibility that the sighting could have occurred in March 1994?  Thank you again for sharing the information with our Center!  Cordially,  Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE)) Hello-- I can get an exact date, but it might take a few days.  We went with a large group of ""horse people"" (the campgrounds are primarily used for horseback groups) and one is still a friend of mine.  I'll track her down and ask her, but it definitely was April.  There was a short mention in the local news about ""local man missing in forest,"" that sort of thing, and really, by missing I mean gone.  What I forgot to mention in my first message was that when they found him he was 25 miles away.  Oh, and it's ""Croom,"" not ""Groom."" I'll start tracking down the date for you.  Thanks for the respons--and feel free to get in touch if you need to.  I can probably volunteer some time, as well, to your organization.    ((name deleted)) ((END CORRESPONDENCE)) ((SECOND FOLLOW-UP)) Mr. Davenport, I just wanted to let you know I've found the woman who runs the annual camping trip.  I should have the exact date soon.  I'll be in touch. ((FOLLOW-UP)) I'm afraid no one else will be filing any reports on this one.  The woman in question doesn't know what we saw that night--she was at a different part of the camping area and has never mentioned anything ""odd"" about that night to me.  My husband is an entirely different story. I wouldn't be surprised to find that he has a history of such experiences (we've been married 13 years and I'm 50), but he's very much in denial, both about his personal experience and the experiences of others. ""Skeptic"" is an understatement. So, no--no investigators or counsellors for him.  Hard to tell what he recalls of that day (and night), because, although we've made reference to ""the time you got lost in the woods,"" that's as far as it goes; he simply won't explore it, and I don't push it.  I'll just add that my ex-husband and I had a number of incidents before we divorced, and it does seem to run in my family. (Some day, if you're interested, I'll tell you my father's story.  It's quite unusual.) ((END))",2002-10-15T00:00:00,28.55954520547945,-82.43392876712329

Both ends were the same, and more rounded than a football. Its shape was approximately a marriage between a football and a watermelon.  Oblong.  It looked sort of like a pod.  Very symetrical. It had smooth, distinct, well-defined boundaries.  Definitely an object - a craft - and obviously artificial.  And it definitely had no wings. Its surface appearance was a light...dull...silvery...metallic.  But...  I dunno.  The surface seemed to my eyes somehow...a bit odd.  Not blurry. It was quite clear and distinct.  And yet...I couldn't seem to see the surface of it clearly.  So it confused me some.  I wondered: what was I seeing? The object was flying too high to make out any surface detail.  It appeared to be featureless.  I saw absolutely no evidence of any wings, nor windows, nor anything that would have allowed me to know that it was some sort of aircraft. It was utterly unlike any aircraft I had ever seen, or ever have seen.  And it was *really* moving.  In fact, it startled me, how fast it appeared to be flying. I said, to two other people who were with me, ""What is that?""  I pointed up at it.  They both looked up, and they both also saw the object. One of my friends suggested that it was a ""cruise missile"".  (Like he could immediately see for himself that it was not an airplane or a jet.) (Some cruise missile testing has been conducted in Canada, but I doubt that any such tests have occurred over Vancouver Island.) I said no, cruise missiles are long, like cigars.  That is definitely *not* a cruise missile.  It looked to be totally the wrong shape, and far too large to be a missile, and it was also flying way too high, and travelling too fast.  Usually cruise missiles travel close to the ground.  The object I saw was at very high altitude. Several things about that object have left a lasting impression. (1) It appeared to be flying very high.  I would estimate that its altitude was likely several kilometers. (2) It appeared to be *big*.  I guessed that it was probably approximately the size of a small house.  I got the impression from observing it that its body was much larger than the body of any aircraft I'd ever seen.  I've been around Hercules transport, and even flown on one. They are quite large aircraft.  So I konw their size.  The body on this thing looked to be a lot fatter than a Herc's.  This is guessing, as you can understand, because I was seeing this thing from a considerable distance.  But right above me, on a clear day.  Its size would naturally depend on its distance.  But what my brain was telling me was: it was big, and very high up. (3) It was also really moving.  I guessed that it was probably travelling at approximately Mach 2.  It was in sight for only about 15 seconds. In that time it travelled all the way overhead.  It was just racing across the sky, at several degrees of angular travel, per second. It was definitely *not* a meteorite.  No glow, and it looked definitely *constructed*.  I could see it very clearly. I saw first it when it was almost directly overhead.  I was just stretching or something, looked up, and bingo.  I'd say it was moving at about 5 degrees of arc per second.  Fast. If the object I saw was at high altitude - several kilometers up - and it did appear to be, very high up, that means that it was going pretty fast. Probably supersonic. (4) It was totally silent.  That struck as me as strange.  I was listening intently for some engine sound, or possibly even a sonic boom. Because I thought it was probably flying faster than the speed of sound.  So I naturally expected to hear something, maybe even a boom. But I heard: *nothing*.  Just silence.  It didn't make a sound.  I heard from it not even the faintest whisper of an engine.  Just silence. So I thought: whoa.  That is pretty weird.  Why can't I hear that thing? And I was really pondering then.  There's this...high performance craft of some sort, flying high up, probably at close to Mach 2, yet it is *silent*. And I wondered, how can any aircraft move that fast, apparently supersonically, yet make *no* sound? I kept listening.  I heard no engine sound; no boom, no anything.  It just seemed so strange. But it also *looked* weird.  Like a football.  Something with no wings.  Flying. (5) And no contrail.  No hint of any conventional engine.  It was flying along like it was propelled by magic. For those several reasons - its apparent size (big), its shape (weird, round, no wings), it's apparent altitude (very high up), its apparent velocity (fast), but especially its acoustic stealth...it all kind of spooked me.  I thought: wow, whatever that is, it's *really* different.  If it's some sort of experimental aircraft, some new kind of jet, that a human pilot is flying, then it must have a pretty wickedly *different* engine in it.  Powerful, for one thing. Because it seemed to be really travelling overhead, and effortlessly.  I'd gues that even the most advanced scram(?) engines that are capable of pushing an aircraft that fast, or faster (even to Mach 5), must make a lot of *noise*, yes? I kept wondering, as I stared at it, what kind of airplane looks like a football, has no wings and is *silent*?  I just kept staring up at it in awe. Now, bear in mind, I am a skeptic.  I think a lot of the reports are due to either intoxication or imagination or are just bull.  But my report is sincere. I have attended university and I have worked in a scientific field.  (Earth physics.)  I have studied science.  (Physics.)  I'm a very logical person.  I do not believe easily.  I always want *evidence* before I believe something.  But on that sunny summer day...I figure that I got some evidence, with my own eyes.  Enough.  I saw something really strange in the sky.  Enough to warrant a report, I think. To this day I have a lot of difficulty believing that what I saw that summer day, about 12 years ago, flying high overhead, was designed and built by humans.  Because every time I've seen an aircraft flying overhead - even if it's flying at 35,000 feet - I can always *hear* something. Always.  I used to listen to jets flying over the North Pole, way up.  Intercontinental jets on their way from South Korea to Europe, or the other way, over the pole.  (We were on their flight path.  I was posted at a weather station up there for a while.)  And I could always hear the jets flying over, no matter how high they were.  Even when one was just a tiny dot in the sky.  Even then.  Always.  And I could always see wings on it.  Moreover, I could always see their contrails.  Hot gases condense, cool, and form clouds behind the jets, when they're high up.  Hot gas plus cold air leave a trail.  But this thing left no trail.  Apparently very high up, in the atmosphere, yet no sound from it, and no trail.  No wings.  An absolutely quiet football, passing quickly right overhead.  It was rather spooky, in fact. And perhaps more importantly, the many jets I've seen fly overheard - at approximately, apparently, the same altitude - were not moving nearly as fast as the thing I saw that day appeared to be moving.  Jets travelling at around 35,000 feet and at roughly 3/4 the speed of sound move across the sky rather slowly.  They just kind of creep along.  They move at maybe one degree or so of arc per second.  Ballpark. So it takes them about a full minute from the time you can first see them until they are out of sight.  So call that 180 degrees, from horizon to horizon.  Divide that by 60 seconds, that is roughly 3 degrees of arc per second, give or take. The object I saw that day covered about 90 degrees in only about 15 seconds.  That's roughly 6 degrees per second, or twice as fast. If it was indeed flying at the very high altitude that I thought it was flying, that means that it was travelling at something like 1200 or 1400 miles per hour, or almost Mach 2.  Almost certainly faster than the speed of sound.  Should be a shock wave from that.  So logic told me, that thing should create a sonic *boom*.  I knew it had a powerful engine, pushing it - it had to be, to go that fast - so I should hear some sort of sonic bang.  And if was flying at a *lower* altitude than I thought it is, then it should definitely be able to hear its engine. But what did I hear?  I heard nothing.  I heard absolutely *nothing* from it.  Not a blessed sound. So I was getting kind of weirded out about this, you know.  I was trying to make all the pieces fit, logically, in my mind, and they just wouldn't fit. I had no way to objectively know that object's true size or altitude or speed.  And I realize that they all factor together.  If I was wrong about its altitude, then I'd be wrong about its speed, and also about its size.  But I saw it very distinctly, quite clearly, for a good many seconds, and I was studying it.  I think my gut instincts are pretty good.  My hearing is pretty good, too.  I did not hear a whisper from that thing. Not a whisper.  Just silence. Then after it was gone, I began to reason it out.  (Or tried to.)  OK.  I just saw something that had no wings.  Definitely no wirngs.  Yet...it was flying. OK.  That's pretty weird but...a high performance jet that has no wings....  Hey, they make them every day.  In fact, there are some craft we've built that have hardly any wings.  (For example, the space shuttle has hardly any wings.)  This thing that I saw - I am sure - had no wings at all. None.  A flying football.  But also....  No engine sound.  Ergo, no engine, either.  And to me, that's altogether another matter.  No wings is one thing. No engine is...whoa.  Over the line. And that is why, despite my healthy skepticism, I have some *doubt* that humans built the thing with no wings that I saw that day, high up in the sky, and moving very fast.  It bothers me.  I still can't make all the pieces.  Unless we didn't build it.  Then...everything fits. Years later I read and heard about an object that apparently flew right *under* (and close to) a British passenger airliner, as it was crossing the Atlantic Ocean.  At some considerable risk to his career, that pilot bravely (and officially) reported a UFO that I believe was of similar size and shape, to my object.  I believe he reported something that was shaped approximately like a watermelon, or a football, i.e. round? And *big*.  Bigger than his airliner.  And he said it was also travelling a lot faster.  He estimated it was moving at least twice as fast as him. It just whizzed by him.  Now that would mean that it was moving faster than the speed of sound.  He was going maybe 500 or 600 mph, so it was going roughly 1,000 or 1,200 mph.  Maybe even 1400 mph.  He said it passed right under him! So he expected to feel some turbulence from it, but in their statements, he and his co-pilot both said that they felt *nothing*.  Not even a bump. They also reported that they heard *nothing*.  That the object that passed by them was silent. Now, I believe that pilot indeed saw what he claimed that he saw.  After what I saw, I believe him.  And it's occurred to me that that sighting (a fairly respectable sighting) - by two professional airline pilots (who had a lot to lose by reporting what they saw) - matches up reasonably well with what I saw with my own eyes, from a distance of several kilometers, about 12 years ago. In both cases, it was something *big*.  It was round, and fast, and silent.  I think *I* have seen that one, too.  Maybe I saw the same craft, or type of craft, as they saw.  There is bound to be some overlap in the appearance reported, if they are real.  If at least one is real. Whatever it is, I know - for pretty sure - that it's something approximately as big as a house, and it can move very fast - definitely supersonically - and yet it evidently does not disturb the atmosphere around it, and therefore it makes no sound.  Somehow, it just slices through the air without creating any turbulence or wake or chaotic vortex behind it.  It can move faster than sound, without creating a sonic boom.  Its propulsion system Is, I can verify, dead silent.  Now...you tell me, please, what sort of aircraft we (humans) have built that could possibly fit that description. Because I'm not aware of any.  And I suspect that not even the U.S. military are aware of any.  Unless they do know, about those things, and they're keeping their mouths shut.  Maybe to keep our sensitive brains from overloading.  :) I suspect that it will be a very long time before *we* know how to build something like what I saw.  Whatever it was, it just kissed the sky, a nice silent kiss.  I would call it the ultimate in graceful flying machine.  Thinking back now, on what I observed, during those few seconds... I'd have to say that it was not only impressive, but beautiful.  Somehow...elegant.  Such a remarkable craft!  To fly without any wings!  Wow! If you ever saw it, I know it would be enough to make your jaw drop, when you witnessed it for yourself, zipping along, lickety-split, and passing quickly overhead, silently, like God throwing a silver football.  You don't hear a thing.  That's pretty neat. I suppose the whole subject of UFOs alarms some people.  But if I may speak to the issue of fear.  Personally I regard it as unwarranted.  Or at the very least, as unhelpful.  It can only cloud our thinking on the issue.  Of whether or not some extraterrestrial intelligence does indeed exist in the proximity of the Earth.  I don't know if it does.  It may. They don't scare me.  I never felt scared, or alarmed.  Instead, I felt...awe.  I remember feeling just very impressed.  And I still feel that way, all these years later.  As the amusing Pat Paulsen once said, there is nothing to fear, except fear itself.  And of course, the bogeyman!  :) I figure that if ""they"" are up there, cruising around, as though our atmosphere is their playground and race track, they are probably not bugs, or critters, like us.  They are probably not green, or grey.  They are probably not even alive, in the same sense that we use that term. My own personal speculation (if I may be allowed that here) is that the pilot onboard that quite incredible craft I saw (if not human, and if that craft was not of human design) was probably the equivalent of a very advanced robot.  Maybe I saw a probe.  Something...probably self-repairing, highly intelligent, and autonomous. Perhaps - I merely speculate here, because I *doubt* that we made the thing I saw - the pilot and the craft were one and the same.  Maybe I saw one of the same sorts of things that weve sent out, to explore other planets.  Unmanned.  Yet still capable of doing a lot.  But a *lot* more sophisticated, and a lot more capable.  Maybe - just maybe - *one* of their probes, centuries or even thousands or perhaps even millions of years ago, found a planet with bugs on it.  So it set about building more probes, using materials it found here, and now they are *all* busy studying us.  :) I don't know.  I'm just throwing that out as the most ""reasonable"" explanation, as I see it, if there *is* (indeed) something of an extraterrestrial nature in or around our atmosphere, and present there fairly often.  There certainly do seem to be a lot of sightings, including a large percentage that some from very reasonable and responsible people, who have no interest in hoaxing anyone. If you don't believe me, fine.  But I *know* what I saw. As I see, ""machine"" intelligence (only) would get around the long flight time problem.  Let's suppose that matter indeed *cannot* travel faster than light, so even their fastest spacecraft travel at ""less than"".  A robot probably wouldn't care how many centuries it took to reach another star. Even if it took 10,000 years for it to get from there to here, so what?  A well-designed, very advanced, sophisticated, intelligent, self-repairing probe could still be in perfect working order after many centuries, or even thousands of years.  In fact, in theory, even a million years could pass, and it could still be fully functional.  That would violate none of the laws of physics. I'm not a UFO nut, at all.  I actually have not a great amount of interest in it, because I think hard evidence will be very difficult to come by. Basically if they're up there, I figure they're too smart and too fast for us.  So doubtful we'll ever be able to capture one, or even real close to one. But from all that I've read, and seen, of video clips of sightings - and there are now quite a number (including at least one video of things flitting around in space near rocket launches, caught on film).... I'd humbly suggest to everyone that the behavior of those apparently ET vehicles that many have seen (maybe myself included) is probably best described (and understood) as the behavior of quite logical and advanced *machines*, rather than the behavior of living creatures. They do not seem to much care what we think, do they?  To my mind, that says: machines.  Smart, analytical, but otherwise mostly devoid of sentiment. In any event, if they *are* here (and I am not suggesting they are, because I don't know what I saw), they may ""just"" be doing science.  Studying. Collecting data.  Curiosity is a trait we should easily understand.  We - as a species - are very curious ourselves.  We are already exploring other planets, too.  I'm sure that if those craft are real, and alien in origin, and are piloted by ""machines"" (as I suggest), then those machine are still many times smarter than humans. That is a logical assumption too, I think, because suppose they started exploring space ""just"" 100,000 years ago.  In less than a hundred years, from now - and maybe in only a few decades - *we* will have machines that are much smarter than us.  So...truly advanced (artificial) minds on those craft is not that hard to imagine.  If you work it out, using carbon nanotubes and molecule-scale processors, one cubic centimeter of their processor cores could have approximately the processiong power of about a billion Pentium IVs processors.  So an alien processor even a meter cubed would dwarf all of our computers, and maybe all of our minds as well. Put in those terms, one of those ships wouldn't have much to worry about, in terms of being outsmarted, or outclassed. As I see it, there is no inherent reason why even very advanced, intelligent probes should want or seek any direct or intentional contact with us. That doesn't fit within the agenda of ""study"".  Especially if we seem to them to be very primitive.  And I wouldn't argue with them on that point. We're still all pretty...duh.  :) But even *if* that object I saw flying high overhead about 12 years ago was built in a plant somewhere right here on earth, by humans who get a paycheck for building neat stuff - I would say to the guys who built it (if I could): boys, congratuations!  Your new airship is technology with a capital T. I mean...first of all, it looks *alien*.  It looks like...puh, Hollywood, move over.  And on top of looking weird and ET-ish, you've managed to build something that's evidently about the size of a cottage, that has no wings, and it can zip through the earth's atmosphere at quite high altitudes, faster than a rifle bullet, and do it without making a sound.  That's a pretty neat trick.  Where did you get the design for it?  :) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-10-15T00:00:00,48.456685618166524,-123.38397199327164

Just after dark I was looking at an aircraft through binoculars as it passed over Mt. Tamalpais. Suddenly, into the field of view from upper right came a rapidly descending wedge-shaped or V-shaped formation of about half a dozen amber orbs or balls of light. They dispersed instantly and then I could see several of them individually darting about in rapid straight-line moves, changing direction radically and instantly by 90 degrees or so. One of them appeared to move upward to where the aircraft was moving along slowly, then zipped away again, though these lights could have been much further away. After a few seconds of these highly unusual movements they disappeared. I believe them to have either been some US military test of antigravity vehicles or something like that, or they were UFOs. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Hi, Peter, Yes, I am sure that the evening of July 18 was when I saw the bizarre phenomena over Mt. Tamalpais here in Marin County, California. I wrote down the basic information the next morning, but the press of other things caused the delay in reporting it to you. (I enjoy hearing you on the Jeff Rense program, and I am really appreciative of the work both of you are doing.) Some additional background information:  The aircraft (assuming it WAS an a/c) that I had cause to look at through binoculars had a (to me) unusual appearance, though possibly explainable. Rather than the usual landing lights of airliners approaching the Bay Area from the west or northwest, this a/c had one very large, very bright light in front, and a single flashing light on the tail. It seemed to be moving very slowly. It might have been a helicopter, but night had fallen and it wasn't possible to see its configuration. I could not determine how close it was or how close were the multiple ufo's that then entered the picture. The reason I was ready with binoculars when the aircraft appeared was because I had seen another bizarre-looking phenomenon four nights prior to that, on the 14th. The 18th was the first time I had a chance to keep my eye on that view of the mountain, since I had had to work late elsewhere the nights of the 15th, 16th, and 17th. On the evening of the 18th I had an intuitive flash to keep an eye on that view, a not unpleasant task, as there was a bright sunset and the mountain was spectacular silhouetted against the sky. Here are my notes about the July 14th phenomenon, written on the 16th:  I did record on tape my immediate impressions of a bizarre phenomenon with a (probable) military aircraft night before last. To try to remember from this distance, as I sit looking out and up at Mount Tamalpais and the western/southwestern sky, the images I saw. There had been an earlier inundation of chemically induced clouds, well-mixed off the coast with available moisture, thus more filled out, less sinewy or webby. It provided for a particularly colorful sunset which in its late stages I was studying through the field glasses for any more tell-tale signs of manmade origin. Just then a silhouetted a/c came into view, seemingly above the eastern flank of the mountain. As it flew over the summit it started emitting illuminations, very flame-like at times [the bluish color of natural gas flame], the likes of which I have never seen nor heard. One of the projections of this luminous material appeared beneath the fuselage. It was very large and had a definite circular shape but it looked three-dimensional, that is, the luminous mass sagged or stretched downward like a huge bubble of light.  Then, after various smaller ""flickerings,"" perhaps near the engines, a plume of the luminous material emitted from the tail of the plane, starting small and billowing out into a parachute-shaped light. the plane stopped doing any more of this and seemingly at about the same time altered its course (to port) and left the area. It had a small tail boom. Has anyone else reported phenomena around here during that period? I am told that there is a MOA (Military Operations Area) off the coast, but I haven't had access to an aeronautical chart to see if the orbs I saw on the 18th could have been in that direction.   Thanks for your interest. Let me know if there is anything else I can do. Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  No missile launch from Vandenberg AFB reported for this date.

"Uneven ""V"" formation of white and red lights, trailing ones flashing red, with trail extending over time of a minute or two.",West Hills,CA,2002-07-23T22:05:00,formation,2 minutes,"Occurred : 7/23/2002 22:05  (Entered as : 07/23/02 22:05) Reported: 7/28/2002 8:29:56 PM 20:29 Posted: 8/16/2002 Location: West Hills, CA Shape: Formation Duration:2 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23985.html,"Uneven ""V"" formation of white and red lights, trailing ones flashing red, with trail extending over time of a minute or two. About 30 degrees elevation, starting in north east, ending in south east, travelling slowly (about same speed as small prop plane). Observed from back yard (regular family venue on summer evenings). Almost full moon rising to the south east. Vehicle started as single white-ish ball of light; I thought it was a satelite (almost same speed as a normal 90-120 minute orbit satellite of which we see several a night). But mentioned to wife ""can't be a satellite, too low"" (would have been in umbra as eastern aspect).  No other navigation lights seen (we see many small planes and I know their signature well). Then, as we watched it travel southward over the San Fernando Valley, it started to develop a long ""tail"" of red flashing lights, which grew ever loger, such that by the time it stoped extending, there were about 4 or 5 high intensity flashing lights , like ultra-bright plane red navigation lights, extending at about 45 degrees backwards from the parent white-ish ball.   By the time it disappeared from view (buildings), it was underneath the Moon's location. Overall shape by then was a chevron of lights, with one or two dimmer red lights above and back from the (now) two diffuse constant white-ish lead lights , then back wards for the 4 or 5 trailing lower red flashing lights. As the Moon subtends an angle of about 0.5 degrees diametrically, the extent of the object would have been about three Moon diamters, or about 2 degrees from upper tip, through the middle white, back through the extended red light trail.  There was no sound whatsoever while this was hapening, whereas several minutes later, a small plane in the same region (by elevation angle and navigation light brightness) was easily heard by its engine sound. About half way through the event, I called to my son, who was inside, to join my wife and I on the patio, and he brought his binoculars which he had nearby (just returned from a touring vacation).  Binoculars are 8x23mm.  I played them on the object(s), but could discern no solid connection betweenthe lights, nor any additional ""navigation"" lights, even though by then the object was close to the full Moon, and any wing structure would easily have been visible. (Confirmed later by observing a few small planes to demonstrate what should have been visible). I am perplexed, with many years of aeronautical and astronomical observation behind me, this is the first time I cannot even start to explain what I saw. The only things that come to mind to mimic the phenomenon are: 1) A ""V"" formation of Canada geese with red flashing nav lights and flashlights on the head birds.   (ridiculous of course, but would match the ""no connecting structure"" item) 2) A large silent low-flying air-refuelling tanker with its refuelling probe slowly extending as it flew, whose probe was illuminated with red flashing nav lights, and said tanker was making no engine noise, and having its wings directly in line with my line of sight all the time, and having no wing-tip nav lights.  (very unlikely). I have no real idea how big the thing was, but by its low elevation and light brightness, it could not have been more than (guess) 5 miles away, or the evening haze and bright Moonlight would have washed it out. Also, its silence indicates it was probably more than a mile away (?). This would make the overall ""structure"" very large, much larger than a long-winged plane, for example. ((FOLLOW-UP TO ORIGINAL REPORT)) This is  a follow-up to my report sent in today 28 July 02:     After I finished my report, of a triangular formation of lights, I went back to your web-site, then called my family to the screen. There, with a drawing from the observation in Iowa, was almost exactly what we had seen on the 23rd !  The hair on the back of my neck started crawling !   The only difference was that the reporter from Iowa said he saw a triangular dark shape conecting the lights.  This was not the case for me, as I could not discern , even with binoculars, any connecting structure between the lights, but the shape, elevation above ground, and general features were identical ! ((FOLLOW-UP #2)) Chevron/triangle formation of lights (central white, trailing red flashing) travelling north-south over San Fernando Valley; silent This is an addendum report to the one filed over the weekend by this resident of West Hills, Ca. re: chevron/triangle formation of lights at 10 pm local on 23 July 2002. Having filed my report, two things happened which casue me to add this addendum: 1) Today 29 July, you updated your files of reports from last week, and I have noticed that there were many other reports identical to my sighting, all at the samr time on the same day,all dscribing a large formation of lights travelling slowly north to south, with the first report from Tehachapi, and the last from Santa Monica.  All these reports (including those between these two extremes) were indicating a straight north-south passage.  This is significant (i.e.I'm not apparently crazy!) 2) On answering your questions and on reflection with other witnesses in my family, we DID see two fast military planes travelling the same path about 15 minutes behind (single-engine jet noise from high altitude, clear view of wings and nav light in bimoculars, my guess F-16's.  I thought nothing of it till today, as in my mind I was using the mil jets as reference data to compare the other object with.  In restospect, they may well have been scrambled to intercept. One reporter  (from Reseda) said he got video.  I would very much like to see that record.  From my relative size observaion (rel to Moon diam) and now knowing it flew right over Reseda, 5 miles east of me, I geomatrically calculate a MINIMUM (depending on flat plane tilt angle) dimension of center to one trailing edge of: 150 yards.    I am dumbfounded. ((END ADDENDUM))",2002-08-16T00:00:00,34.20296428571429,-118.68875714285714

I mentoned this to my friend.  Then about 5 min. later I was still looking up when an object appeared.  It was moving across the sky in a perfect straight line directly over us.  It was an elongated oval shape.  It had no color and made no sound.  There were no lights.  It was difficult to tell how high or how large it was but if I had to guess I would say about 50 feet long.  It moved sideways and stayed on a perfect line until it disappeared into the horizon.  It was traveling mabye at 100 mph.  But again it was difficult to judge speed or size.  The thing that sticks in my mind is that we could see the object very clearly.  It was directly overhead and the lights of the city seemed to illuminate the bottom. It was a dark object. We got a very good long look and talked to each other about it as it passed overhead.

Approximatly one mile South of the Elger Bay grocery store, an object crossed above the road at a height of no more than 50 feet above the treetops at a distance of about 300 yds in front of us. The object was low enough that I was only able to view it in profile. It had a wedge-shaped profile with a pointed nose. The object glowed with the luminous intensity of a fluorescent light. I was able to observe a glow on the trees and ground that helped me identify the distance as the object passed over. The object did not emit any sound that I detected. The size of the object appeared to be a wedge about 80 feet long and 20 feet high at the tail, viewed in profile. There was a small dark area about fifteen feet behind the pointed nose that may have been a window. As a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, I had developed the habit of taking a mental snapshot of an event, then analyzing it during the following moments, even while engaged in other activities. Due to this habit, I was able to compare its speed to my memory of a Phantom F-4 that I knew was flying at 600 knots at a similar range. Based on this comparison, I would estimate the speed of the object to be three times that of the F-4, or about 1800 knots. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

One the evening of April 13, 1999 my sister, 12 year old son, and 9 year old daughter, were outside watching stars.  A neighbor had recently spotted an unusual looking flashing star, and we speculated that it could've been a number of optical illusions, he felt it may have been a satellite or other manmade object. Nevertheless, we (me, son, daughter, and sister) were watching the stars that night and I attempted to point out the particular star the neighbor had commented about.  He was on the phone with me at this time (about 8:45 pm) it was dark. I was on my front porch at this time.  I was looking in a southerly direction as he attempted to explain where the star he'd viewed was.  My sister 9 year old daughter and 12 year old son walked approx 500 feet away from the house (south - towards the neighbor's house) and were looking for the flashing star.  My neighbor had looked at the star with binoculars and I yelled for my daughter to get a small pair we had.  She came to the house to get these, leaving my son and sister still watching the sky.  My neighbor was on the phone still, and as my daughter went inside a ""star"" moved across the sky and stopped. My neighbor on the phone who was watching for his ""odd"" flashing star said he saw something move across the sky. I said I had just witnessed it myself, we both felt it looked like a star.  He then said he could no longer see it from his house.  The star had dropped down considerably.  When it first moved it appeared about the size of a dime, and at this time it was much larger, and seemed to be just lower than the hill between my neighbor and me.  My sister and son yelled out ""Did you see that?"" I yelled back ""Yes"" I hung up the phone telling my neighbor that we were watching the moving star.  My daughter came out to the front porch about this time, and had just seen the movement she stood there with me for the duration of the event, and consequently did not find the binoculars.  At this point the star seemed to be about the size of a baseball or apple, bu! t was getting larger as it appeared to be getting lower. I yelled for my sister and son to come to the house. The were on there way to the house by this time,  stopping to look back at the star.  My stopped several times,  and seemed quite amaized or even mesmorized by the light. I kept yelling for them to hurry up and I knew my son was stopping to look because my sister was telling him to ""come on"". The star lowered and was about the size of a basketball, and began slowly coming towards me,  in a direction I believe is north.  It was slow and paused a couple of times but it just kind of floated or glided towards me. My sister and son had made it back near our front porch and I could see that my son was very curious about the light. It is also puzzling to me and the others that by this point, it seemed to be lighter outside, closer to just after dusk, than dark, but it had been dark (I hope this makes some sort of sense to anyone reading this).  The light came to about 100 feet from us (south of us) and seemed to be lower by a little bit, than the hill top (I should probably explain that we live in hallow)  and stopped breifly - then it made an uturn and rapidle went upward and south and was completely gone within an instant. It may be important to you to know that none of use heard anytning, no engine sounds, wind, or anything else from the orb.  It did not flash in any way, and there was no other color of light associated with it. After the light was gone,  we noticed a lot of planes were flying over, and found it to be unusual.

It got closer to where I could see it very well, and well enough to know it was not a plane, and it was not a helicopter, and it was not a balloon of any kind. I was alone, and on the phone with my mother when I saw it. I  looked at it for several minutes explaining to my mother what it looked like, and how it was just hovering in mid air not moving, when I saw my boyfriend driving down our driveway.  I hung up on my mother, while I sprinted down the second floor steps to the parking lot of our apartment building.  By the time I got to the parking lot to scream out to him to look up, it dove off to the north/east behind the trees very quickly, and it was gone, ALMOST AS IF IT KNEW I WAS TRYING TO GET SOMEONE ELSE TO LOOK AT IT.  The lights were all the way around the craft, and seemed to move around or light up at different intervals. It was very close to the ground, closer than any commercial airliner would be.

I didnt want to tell anyone for fear they'd think I was crazy, but I am more curious now than anything to see if anyone else saw what I saw.

Est. object length at 1 mile +. On about August 31, 1997 at about 10:30 p.m. I was traveling with my 8-yr. old daughter (Bridget) east on Xway from Brighton, MI toward Detroit (I-96).  Traffic was medium both ways.  We were east of the Brighton exit and about 5 miles west of the South Lyon exits on the map. There was a full bright yellowish moon but very high and heavy dense but thinner cloud cover.  There were occasional breaks in the clouds and stars were clear and bright there. Bridget said ""What's that light, Dad?""  I had been concentrating on the road.  Straight ahead of us and appearing (feeling) to be above and slightly north of downtown Detroit was an object I first related to a giant ""harmonica"" tilted from 12:00 position to 4:00 position. It was visible through a large break in the clouds and was above the cloud layer.  I guestimate that the cloud layer was above 20,000 ft.  The 'feeling' about the object was that it was 'enormous' - surely a mile or more in length and 20% of that in thickness.  We did not see depth.  It appeared to be stationary. At this time I only recall two to four rows of rectangular windows.  Each window symetrically directly above the window below, each row about a window's depth apart.  About 20 to 30 windows per row.  What remains clearest is that each window was 'square' and extremely brightly lit with a white light but no blurring, no outward beams from the light - very clearly defined. Also, although there was no illumination of the 'body', there was a definite rectangular shape of a body containing the windows.  My immediate first thought on noticing the object was of a 'harmonica' with the lighted windows being the small square holes on the backside.  The object was tilted with the upward end being at 12:00 and the lower end to the right (south) at the 4:00 position on the clockface. We watched it for almost ten minutes as we continued on the expressway to the next exit which was for South Lyon.  Although traffic was steady but not heavy, I wanted to get off the X-way and away from the other car lights to observe the object.  The lower cloud cover obscured the object just before we reached the next (South Lyon) exit. I took this exit and traveled some six miles south, then another 3 miles east, mostly on dark country back roads hoping the cloud cover would open up again but it did not.  We did not see the object again. The lights were not ""On"" but rather ""from within"" the object. There was no trail and no haze.  No beams of light were emitted.  It did not change color.  We did not see any other objects exiting, entering or in the area of the object.  No other aircraft were seen in the area.

On the evening of January 1, 1997, we observed small bouncing lights in the Phoenix sky south of South  mountain.  The small lights roughly the size of a small magnitude star were bouncing around on the horizon.  Shortly thereafter we observed 5 bright lights flying over us in a V-Shape.  They were identical to that of the Phoenix lights which were videotaped in March of 1997.  The V-Shape lights flew from the southeast to the northwest towards Las Vegas.  There was absolutely no sound from the object.  After the incident I telephoned Sky Harbor Airport who referred me to Luke Air Force Base who in turn referred me to Peter Davenport of the UFO reporting center in Washington state.  We only gave my aunt's name to Mr. Davenport.  I was quite shocked to learn of the March 1997 sightings again.  I decided to again report this when I heard Mr. Davenport on KFI radio and called in to the radio station.  They put me on the air but did not further question me.  I was left hanging.

We immediately went upstairs to the 2nd floor to the balcony which overlooks the field. My other brother, who was in his bedroom, joined us, we watched and saw the entire area by the old house light up with a bright white light, We could see the tops of trees,and the roof of the house, almost like someone had shone a spotlight on them, But there wasnt a beam of light, things just ""lit up"" like it does when there  is lightning. But it was perfectly calm that night.After about 20 seconds, it died out.Not a sound was made. I drove up to the old house with a camcorder, but  nothing at all happened again that night. This was the closest experience Ive had with these things. However, lately, these bright red, and sometimes orange orbs have been making loud noises, much like fighter jets do when they fly close to the ground, and the noise starts and stops very abruptly. The noise is usually accompanied by glowing red balls flying above the tree line, which stop, ascend, descend sometimes making noise, most of the time not. Another thing Ive noticed over the years of seeing these lights, sometimes I see what looks like a star, but Im good at telling the difference, because if I keep watching, it stops acting like a star(flashing red, gree, blue, white) and turns into a glowing red ball which sometimes pulsates or fades. Ive seen them start moving, change speed, direction, even split into two or three different balls, then go back together. Some fly pretty close to the house at times.  So what in the world is it that does these things? We can see them almost any given night.",2002-10-15T00:00:00,36.6591,-91.0066

After clearing the mountain top, the object lowered altitude slightly, to,I would say between 300-500ft. and continued to move east.  As it continued our way, but slightly northwest of us, it would travel slowly, periodicaly jolting forward, but never changing altitude.  We watched as it traveled from the mountain range, at first from a distance it did look as though it could have been a very large balloon, and was a dark metallic color (like Black Chrome... but not as shiney) but was not round or teardrop , as it got closer it looked a bit like a pyramidic bubble, rotating randomly on no certain axis, and possibly the size of a school bus (this would be at a distance less than a quarter mile north of us, and at the same altitude stated, I know we had to look upward)  as it passed it seamed to pick up speed and headed more northeast, it must have begun moving much faster, because it was out of sight quicker than the time it took to reach our vacinity from the mountains.",2002-10-15T00:00:00,40.024403601895735,-105.26873952606635

I thought it was an airplane at first then I noticed there were absolutely no lights to be seen on it though it was at an altitude that looked high enough for an approach to a landing much like an airplane.  I thought nothing of it and put my sights back to the road when my friend in the passenger seat exclaimed, ""Are you seeing this?"".  Suprised that someone else saw the same thing and it was not a hallucination I looked back up into the sky.  The clouds where being dimly lit by the street and city lights in the distance however this object seemed to absorb the light.  You could tell that it was at least a shadow of an object grazing slightly inside the clouds and when I thought it would come out so I could get a better view it seemed to change its course back into the clouds to where it was obscured.  I remember the movement was very odd.  It would zig zag slightly and it had a bell curve kind of acceleration that wasn't too abrubt but not like any plane or helicopter that I have seen and I have seen frequent helicopter landings living next to a Care-flight center.  What I can't figure out is that if it was a shadow why there was no plane in sight to create it on the clouds above or where the light source could have been from inside or above the clouds.  There were none with that kind of intensity.  It made no sound.  It was very dark and had a shape akin to an inverted delta.

As I watched it fly over, shielding my eyes from the sun, farther up in the sky was a dull grey CIRCLE flying from the E/NE toward the W/SW.  Although it's impossible to judge altitude with certainty, it appeared to be about 40,000 feet up, a bit larger than a jet, and crossing the sky at about the same apparent speed as a jet at cruising altitude.  I found the object through my binoculars at it passed through the zenith, and it was perfectly round -- i.e., no fuselage, no wings.  Obviously I couldn't tell if it was a flat disk or a ball shape because of the altitude.

The noise resembled the rough sounds of a very large grinding engine, but was overlayed with a rythmic ""swishing"" sound reminiscent of our dishwasher.  It was loud enough and sudden enough to immediately alarm us into instant wakefulness and we looked out the window to see the sky illuminated by rapid flashes of red, blue, and green lights (not isolated in any specific area, just covering the 15-degrees of arc or so we can see between the eves of our house and the trees surrounding our home).  The sounds and lights abruptly stopped after fix seconds or so.  There was a pause of perhaps ten seconds while we tried to figure out what it could have been, and then the lights and sounds resumed and lasted for another five seconds.  The power died sometime during these two events.  We ran outside at this point, but the sky was completely clear (no cloud cover to reflect light effects from ground-level). Five to ten minutes later we noticed the contrail of a high-altitude military jet coming from the direction of the Whidbey Island Naval Station and heading due east perhaps a dozen miles south of us. My best hypothesis is that perhaps the lights and sounds were an electrical effect, such as a transformer blowing.  The only problem with this theory is that all the local power lines are buried -- the nearest transformer is perhaps a mile away. I hopped in the car to drive around on the chance that the lights and sounds had come somehow from an aircraft in trouble, since the Abbotsford B.C. airport is only a few miles away.  During my drive through the cornfields I noticed that the power outage seemed restricted to an area of a square mile with our home near the center.

I was not facing directly east but more of a north east direction. Then a intense aqua blue ball came out of no where, traveling at speeds that i have never witnessed. I called into the hotline and the person there suggested that it was a meteor.... I find it impossible to belive This was not a meteor for several reasons. The first reason is that it was traveling on the horizon in a straight trajectory, also it was moving rapidly up and down, similar to a hearbeat on a computer screen only FAST!. Secondly it was a color that simply put does not exist, it was like that of a blue jet flame, only pulsating and mesmorizing,deep and rich yet light at the same time. Another reason i find it hard to belive that it was a meteor or for that matter a shooting star is that it was obviously inside the earths atmosphere, i mean it was like right there, I looked at the stars shortly after the encounter and they seemed extremly far away, compared to the object(s) which was clearly inside our atmosphere. Also one very very very important detail, both of these sightings occured in one peice of the night sky, there are two trees that block out some of the sky to the north and west and there is a strip of sky directly east that you can look out into from the hottub. Both of these objects seemed to only appear in this strech of eastearn sky, they both would ethier shoot across the strip of sky and disapear, or they where moving so fast that by the time my eyes set on the part of visible sky (to the north) the objects where gone.

All that changed two weeks ago.  On Saturday July 13, 2002 my friend and I was talking to one of our neighbors outside at his trailer park in Davison.  The sky was clear and we could see something moving across the sky.  I thought it was a satellite but then it stopped moving and did a sharp U-turn.  It was so small because it was so far away.  Then it disappeared.  I then noticed another one moving across a star from another angle in the sky.  We sighted a total of 12 UFO's that night and all of them disappeared.  Sometimes, one would disapper then reappear for a second.  I decided to email you this letter because I want to know if you have noticed any other sitings that are similar around this area.  I believe I have seen another one last night on my way home from work.  I was driving North bound on the expressway I-75 between 3:15-3:30AM.  I was heading towards Troy area when I flipped my visor up to look at the sky and there it was!  The low hovering aircraft was square shaped like a reversed minivan.  It looked blimp sized, but it also looked like a cut out shape in the sky like it shouldn't even be there!  How am I supposed so to see this object so clearly when the sky is misty!??  The whaleish-gray colored UFO had a light blue glow around it.  When I focused my attention on the sparks of light coming from behind the object,  it disappeared.  It couldn't have been in the sky for more than 4 seconds.  It was moving eastbound at an extremely fast speed!  I know what a meteor looks like because I witnessed the meteor shower we had over a month ago.  At first, I was trying to convince myself that it was a reflection in my mirror and I just saw a shooting star.  When I read the Flint Journal the next day, I discovered that a similar sighting was seen in Washington.  I am now convinced that I must have seen it too.  This wasn't a meteor or a shooting star.  It was something else.  The article in the Flint Journal stated that two F-16 jets from Andrews Air Force Base were scrambled early Friday after radar detected a unknown aircraft in the Washington area. The time was 1:00AM when the Air force jet was chasing it but it just left them in the dust at speeding over 6000 miles an hour.  I realized that their is a 3 hour time difference between Michigan (ahead) and Washington. Sounds incredible doesn't it?  Today, CNN claims the government is allowing some aircraft to float around the USA and some people might mistake it for a UFO.  Of course, they gave no details.  Sounds like a cover up to me.",2002-08-16T00:00:00,42.56675797546012,-83.15395782208589

On a Sunday in mid-September, I was driving to a Golden Corral located on the West side of Roswell, New Mexico then located on West Second Street just East of the State Police Station also located further out on West Second.  It was a beautiful cloudless evening and I was only thinking about what I might order for dinner at a restaurant that I had only visited a few times as I normally fixed meals at my apartment located on the corner of Sunset and, whatever the cross street was, that I was driving North on, when I saw the aerial object I am reporting.  I gradually became aware that something was in my peripheral vision to my far left and up in the air possibly 15 degrees above the horizon.  As I turned my head, while driving my little pick-up truck, I saw a huge gray metal saucer or disk shaped craft, full face top-view with it's top side facing me hanging in mid-air.  I saw what looked like an aerial and portholes on what I would call a conning tower.  There was no sound whatsoever and the thing was bigger than a house.  In a matter of the blink of an eye it was gone.  My immediate impression was it was either going straight down or straight up, to or out of the ground.  There was a YMCA building to the left of the object which gave me some sense of the size of the object. However, I realized I could not figure out where it went into or out of the Earth which makes no possible logical sense.  I became so excited by what I saw I abandoned all idea of going to the Golden Corral to eat and drove my vehicle all around the adjacent neighborhood going all the way North driving around the deserted runways of the old Roswell Municipal Airport which had been converted to a Municipal Bldg including housing the Police Department.  I drove all over the whole area including all of the streets that abutted to the Airport which included a golf course and a City Park.  By this time, the thought of eating had completely left me even though I had been extremely hungr! y when I left my apartment.  I drove around there up until almost dark and finally decided to return home.  I called the N.M. State Police Headquarters and the officer wanted my name and address after I gave him the basic details as written in this account.  He said something, at this juncture, which I have never forgotten, ""Well, maybe you were the only one who saw it this time""!  I became very fearful at this point and refused to give him my name etc, because I held a government job and knew stories about what happened to other people's careers and lives once they reported something like this, and knew I didn't want to go thru that myself.  I quickly hung up.  Then I called the relatively new Roswell Airport which is located out where the old Walker Air Force Base was and spoke with an air traffic controller, I assume, in the Control Tower.  I asked him if anyone had reported seeing anything unusual in the skys or if anyone there had seen anything?  He calmly answered no and he wanted my name etc., also.  I hung up again. Then I called the Roswell Daily Record and surpringly enough got hold of an editor who just happened to be there.  I told him the story, but said I would not give my name or any personal information.  He suggested we go to a local restaurant at some future time since nothing much is open in Roswell on a Sunday evening.  He wanted to meet with me and discuss the event later!  I never called him and tried to forget what happened.  But, unfortunately, about two weeks later I had what I would call a serious depressive episode which almost got out of hand. That was just the beginning of my personal and professional problems.  I had other experiences later which were terrifying and which I have rarely discussed with anyone out of fear of ridicule and social and professional ostracism which to some extent has happened anyway, and that is why I decided to contact u and file this report!  This is not a joke and I am not psychotic! ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the witness for submitting such a nice report!  Date of sighting in September 1988 is approximate.

Presently, I am an Electronic Client Specialist for a national entertainment magazine. At the time of my encounter, though, I was a columnist and editor, so I like to believe that, given my educational background and exposure to the public, I am not one prone to delusions, misinterpretations or any type of need for acclaim. It was a cold winter evening. The bus had just dropped me off near the corner of Guelph Line and Upper Middle Road. Before me lay perhaps two acres of school property that I needed to cross in order to reach home. While walking across the field, partly covered in snow, I noticed a chevron-shaped object silently hovering perhaps 500 feet overhead. Rather than immediately wondering what the object could be, I wondered how anything could hover, since the winds were quite fierce from west to east. Focusing my eyes on the object, I couldn't make out its true shape, given that the object was obscured by the thick snow clouds racing past. Yet a series of red and blue lights along its bottom ran in the shape of a chevron, so I could only assume that the craft was the same shape. I watched the object hover for perhaps a minute, and then it slowly began moving northward while retaining its altitude. I don't know why, but I began running after it, yet it slowly moved away. Pausing just south of Dundas Street and Guelph Line, the object then moved slowly westward before disappearing amid the clouds. Afterward, for all of the running that I'd done in the cold, and for all of the deep gulps of air that I'd taken in my exertions, I came down with a severe cold and had to spend a few days sick in bed. This is the first that I've spoken of the incident since it happened, and I don't know why I waited so long. It's strange, but when something extraordinary is happening, one knows that it's real, but when the event has passed, it's easy to believe that the event never happened. Or perhaps I'm like many in that I am often afraid of ridicule. At any rate, this is my account of something extraordinary th! at happe ned to me, and while I can do little with words to convince anyone of the authenticity of what I experienced, I can rest well in the knowledge that what I've written is the truth, and hope that, in some small way, it will help others or shed light on similar experiences of others.

This event occured a few years ago. I just learned of this sight and wanted to share my experience. I was outside, enjoying the few nights of good weather we get, put stars together trying to name constalations and such. I began to notice that a certain cluster of stars i was trying to patternize were not cooperating. From then i observed that there were specificly 3 ""stars"" that were in motion. they moved at different speeds and didn't appear to make any specific pattern in their movement but stayed within a certain area. i went inside to look for my binoculers for a better look. it did seem that the quickest one was ""in-charge"" and the next quickestwas withit but the one that moved fairly slow didn't seem to fit in but the other kind of gave it space and yet didn't go to far from it. the binoculars didn't help much but the lights seemed to all be in a ""teardrop"" or ""triangular"" shape.They stayed in sight for about the next 20 minutes and then quickly took off. they seemed to move in a blurred speed and motion but they also seemed to go in slightly different directions and then head the same way.i also notice a slight change in color as they sped away,they now seemed to be an almost redish-orange like if they were burning. I tried to take a grip of what i had seen considering i hadn't been drinking or anything and wasn't tired. I never saw them again but do feel strongly about what i have seen considering that a couple months later i was watching the show sighting and a man had video taped a similar occurence in another state.i also checked with the local weather station to see if there were any reports of a metor encounter but they told me that there was no weather report of any metors to have ben seen at that time.

My friend fired 6 shots of blank starter gun in the air and, suddenly the lights started to ascent over the trees, now near panicking we saw that the lights were from a big black triangular object. It then hovered just over trees and flew over us very slowly and very silently, the wind stopped,it seemed that this thing ""created"" silence. Now panicked we started to run like crazy when in a clear spot we were spotted by a kind of searchlight, it was the object , it had spotted us, camo in a forest. We ran a 45 min. walk in less than 10 min. We are convinced that our camo suits kinda ""protected"" us from being abducted.

The light seemed to come from what I thought was very late night construction. As I drove closer I noticed how strange it was that there were no cars behind me. I slowed as I approached and stopped directly under five lights that were in a pentagon pattern about 10 - 15 feet apart from each other and about 20 feet above me. I stared up through my windshield and opened my window to see better. My heart was racing. I noticed no sound, from anywhere. Everything seemed very quiet, strangely quiet. Fear overcame me and I drove off, watching the light fade in my mirror. My normal travel time for this trip was always about 2.5 hours. That evening it took me 4.5 hours to arrive.

A cool clear night mid to low 50's (best of my recollection) no wind or clouds. I happened to be facing approx. South and taking the last swallow out of a can of soda (head back looking up). Out of the corner of my eye (right - from the West) a bright light caught my attention. As I turned my head to look, the light was getting bigger (Closer) and in 4 seconds (maybe 3) it covered at least 6-7 miles and flew directly overhead. Since I was close to the top of the highest point in that area it offered a perfect view... The object was (best guess) a 20-30ft sphere-like object, traveling at a LEVEL steady altitude approx. 800-1000ft AGL (my position) and at a bearing of 100 degrees (based on aviation maps). Coming from the Youngstown Ohio area (guess) traveling East. The center or main mass of the sphere-oval was glowing like 'white-lightening' and seem to have a 'electric-blue' corona around it.This object made NO noise, did not stop, change altitude, or bearing while under my observation. The object also seemed distorted (perception of great speed?)

After turning the craft descended dissapeared behind the trees, which obstructed my view of it actually touching the ground.

Attached are two scans of a photo of a bizarre object I unknowingly (at the time) photographed. I wouldn't have noticed the object except for a relative (who has better close up vision) pointing it out to me. PLACE: Ryazan, Russia, c 250km SE from Moscow. DATE & TIME: May 9th 2001, c 9:00 (May 9th is the ""Day of Victory"" over NAZI Germany holiday in Russia, as this photo was being taken Ryazan's military were preparing for their parade. Ryazan is Russia's West Point or Sandhurst) PHOTOGRAPHY INFO: Kodacolor Plus 200ISO film with full automatic camera focussed on the tree below the object (i.e. at infinity). The lighting is sharply from the left, from the morning sun on a clear, Spring day. PHOTO BACKGROUND: Taken from the 1st floor (1st above ground floor) bedroom window of a flat in Ryazan. The block of apartments on the left is about 15 stories high. SCAN 1: Highest magnification scan I can achieve. This is a 600DPI scan of an enlargement I got at the local photo shop. Zoom out about three times to see it clearly. I have tried to get some more detail using Paint Shop Pro's photo enhancement tools to enhance contrast. SCAN 2: the full frame original photo scanned in at 200DPI. OBSERVATIONS ABOUT OBJECT: I could not say either the distance or altitude of the object from the photo. It appears to be stationery. For what it MAY have been doing hanging there see NOTES ON MY LIFE below. However IF that is a MiG31 / F15 size fighter slung underneath (see below), then the craft is about 25-30 meters from ""prow"" to stern, and would be about a kilometer away. This would put it over another residential area of Ryazan. I have seen many photos of UFOs but nothing like this. This is a very odd object, and to my amateur eye looks like either a HUMAN device or an alien / human hybrid device. I say that because of the large antenna dish apparent on the right hand side. That just looks very terrestrial tech to me. This dish would also be incredibly un-aerodynamic. There may be another on the right of the high dome (above the command center with windows?) at top of the craft. I cannot see how the craft could travel at any speed with these large dishes hanging out unless a) the dishes could be retracted during flight or b) the craft utilizes some form of trans-dimensional drive or c) it just flies very slowly. Also there APPEARS to be a twin finned military fighter jet slung beneath the object (!) like a MiG31 or U.S. equivalent. Note the ship like ""prow"" on the craft and the bump above that which reminds me of the active sonar array on the prow of some submarines. In the 200DPI scan a light ""aura"" is visible around the craft. I only have ""High Color"" on my PC and can't say if this is an artifact. I can&#8217;t help but wonder that IF this is a human piloted craft, whether it is being run by Russians (it is on their territory, but I have suffered ""phenomena"" that may be associated with this craft in many other countries), or if it is being run by Americans, doing a test of their ability to ""penetrate""  Russian airspace & influence people in that country with the phenomena listed below. NOTE ON MY LIFE & RELEVANCE to this PHOTO: To my conscious knowledge I only once SAW a UFO from the outside with my own eyes on one occasion prior to photographing this, but that was during a period when I didn't WANT to believe in any such thing and I went inside ignoring it, possibly under a form of mind control. My son and ex-wife had seen UFOs of the saucer type and also a sharp, black, isosceles triangular craft in the years before this picture was taken near my flat. I was the subject of an abduction experience when I was six years old. Prior to this I was a very happy, lucky and socially successful person. My memory of the abduction experience is one of being taken to a round ""theatre"" like room by a strange, large, being from my bed in our family holiday house. I felt an intense EVIL from the being who abducted me, and a projection of that evil onto me, such as some assaulters project on to their victims. There were several other similar aliens in the craft. I have no memory of physical examinations. But I do remember they ""judged"" me and came to some decision about me. >From that night on I suddenly lost all my good friends. Many were physically taken away. From then on I have lived under a regimen of: constant, strict isolation. The only relationships I am allowed are negative, painful or abusive towards me; despite coming from a very well off family I have been forced to live in poverty, always about 10% below subsistence no matter what I do. People associated with me are subject to mind control that puts the most awful negative ideas in their heads about me. Those who resists this and wants to be with me is PHYSICALLY removed by various means, often involving third parties interfering. I have continued to live for the interests that I had from before the abduction: studying the meaning of life and working to help humanity. It is something of a family tradition coming through my father. WHAT IS RELEVANT TO THIS PICTURE is that during the year before this craft was inadvertently taken, I and the two other occupants of that flat in Ryazan, were subjected to a massive program of attacks: direct energy attacks, such as uncontrollable itching, attacks of needles all over the body, uncontrollable coughing with no infection, incredibly disturbed digestion (including constant flatulence), extreme knife like headaches  just for starters. I never experienced such a ""full spectrum attack"" since the months after I had left my original home at age 18, several decades ago. That was in another continent away from Russia. I HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THESE ATTACKS, just not as concentrated as when I was 18 and in Ryazan, IN EVERY CONTINENT (except Africa and South America where I haven't been). These attacks have followed me wherever I have gone around the world. I have been assessed by numerous psychological experts and they can find no abnormalities of the mind, except evidence of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from the horror I have faced since I was six. I am now middle aged and my health is very badly affected. POSSIBLY identifying this bizarre craft may shed some light on what has been plaguing my life for so long. All the best to all who seek the truth, ((NUFORC Note:  Both photos forwarded to NUFORC look like a black splotch in the sky.  The photos are ambiguous, we feel.  PD))",2002-07-26T00:00:00,,

The diamonds were so colorful and they had black lines going through them like you would see on a cartoon or something. It made a very loud, hard to explain noise. The ufo flew to the left in a straight line for about 10-30 seconds, then went up, left two black marks in the sky which looked like skid marks, and completely disappeared. We sat there amazed and asking each other exactly what the other saw. About five minutes later we heard the same noise in the distance. It got louder and we looked back to see a futuristic-looking car flying over the trees not too far away. It was very close and you could see it's details easily. It was blue, had white headlights, and blue and red lights (the same color as the diamonds).. Also there was a weird oval around it that was transparent. A force field or something I assume. It flew very slow as we watched it go past the lake, a tree strangely bending over, then bending back up, on the other side as it passed over it. There were at least 10 other people in that same backyard asleep, but it seemed like the loud noise the ufo's made would have easily woken them up.

On our way we hear a loud buzzing noise like an electrical engine to a golf cart or something except magnified immensely. We followed the noise until we stopped and looked in the sky. We saw Two triangular shaped objects hovering near us. They were approximately 150 feet high if i had to guess. One was bigger than the other. They both had lights on each corner of the spaceship that were a dark red. The smaller ship then suddenly accelerated extremely fast and was gone and then the bigger ship opened a middle hatch and another ship came out of the bigger ship. Then they bothe proceded to acclerate very fast and were gone. This all happened within ten minutes. My friend left to go get someone else from the camp when the second ship left. She couldnt find any one in time. By the time they got back bothe ships had been gone for at least 5 minutes. I filed a report with the police department but never heard anything back from them.

I began to return my gaze to my friend when I noticed the light move a bit, very slowly.  I interrupted the conversation and told them to look at the object.  I asked ""Does anyone no what that is?"", and my friend replied, ""Could it be a satellite?"".  We were about to say something else when the object seemed to get brighter.  We stopped and kept our gaze on it for about 6 seconds.  All of the sudden (and I swear on my mothers grave) it seemed to dim a little bit every second, until it disappeared.

SEE DETAILED REPORT Triangular Object - 8-15-1999 At about 5:55 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. CDT my wife Karen and I were driving west bound on US Highway 64 about half way between Memphis, TN, and Bald Knob, AR, or about 75 miles west of Memphis, Tn.  We were very near and just to the east of McCrory, AR, we saw the following: We witnessed a triangular shaped object in the western sky above the town over McCrory.  It was about the size of a man's thumbnail, if your arm was fully extended.  It was on it's side (?) as we could see all three points of the triangle at the same time.  It was white not silver in color. The strange part of this sighting is that it was moving (in my opinion) slow but it left a streak or trail behind it - as wide as what it was.  I viewed it for about 10 to 15 seconds, my wife for 5 to 10 seconds - the tail extended from one side of our windshield (passenger side) to almost directly in front of the drive.  It then vanished - not just the object, but the trail as well.  There was no trace of anything. The object was traveling to the south; it was a clear sky.  It was about 15 to 20 degrees above the road or horizon.

The object was low on the horizon. As I write this now I can hear several loud aircraft in the background out my window. The object had no distinguishable characteristics other than being a ball of light, if I were to guess at the size of the object, I would say that it was probably the size of a large or medium sized helicopter. What caught my attention was the speed and VERY sudden accelerations and changes of trajecory that it made. I have seen many military craft flying at different altitudes and none of them ever approached this level of speed and directional change. At this moment I can see no less than 3 helicopters out my window. ((NUFORC Note:  Since the witness is close to the coast of the Pacific Ocean, he may have been looking to the east.

About this time last week (Sunday, November 8).. as I was sitting on my balcony enjoying my pipe 'n quiet time.. that a most unusual event took place. (By the way.. it's good Black Cavendish tobacco.. not pot! I work as a Counselor for one of the comprehensive LAUSD high schools. And unlike Bill.. I truly never have inhaled!

I have grown accostumed to the several single and twin engine airplanes as well as police, News media.. and corporate helicopters that often circle round both day and night.. the several city blocks that make up Downtown. Suddenly.. and speeding through the night sky from a southern horizontal direction.. (I would say whizzing.. but it was absolutely noiseless.. there was no sound..) came a ball of fire.. approximately 2 stories high and perfectly round.. as I compared this irregular sight with the high rise buildings. This object was heading somewhat north (northeast). It definitely was NOT not a shooting star nor comet.. heading in even the slightest downward vertical direction. It was not the Moon. It was not birds. It wasn't even Superman. My first, startled.. and only impression was: ""Lord God?!"" thinking that it could have crashed into any of these buildings just as in any of those recent blockbuster movies. This fireball appeared no further than 3/4th of a mile away.. and traveled not much more than a mile from my home. The entire event was always visable. Perfectly framed by two tall buildings.. the event ended seconds later.. perhaps, directly above the Union Station (I was a MetroLink communter to Chatsworth for an entire year.. and am aware of nearby locations).  And though my estimation of height is terribly inaccurate.. I would guess.. it was the typical and same altitude that all small aircraft fly.. here in the Downtown area.  Within split seconds.. this enormously silent ball was leaving a ""skid mark"" in its wake.. before it fully vaporized and disappeared. It was moving with the silence and speed of a missle.. but there was no explosion. Well, I sat for perhaps twenty minutes to a half hour in amazement and complete disbelief as I struggled to reconstruct and understand the all too brief and all too unusual sight.

That's what caught my attention to it. Two other hunter within 100 yards saw nothing. They had more obstructions around them. The bottom was rounded. This I could tell by the glow of the light. The top was hard to make out due to sparkling light and had no definite shape. The object dropped very fast. When it came to a stop it was very sudden, it was immediate. It hovered for about 4-5 seconds. The light was jumping outward like sheets waving in the wind. Then the light appeared to pull back into itself until it looked like a star.

I believe they are NOT alien but definitely secret UFO's being possibly tested.  I truly expected them to crash due to speed but nothing. Just disappeared behind mtns. and never flew back up from behind mtn.  It seems inconceivable that they landed at this speed.   See below for details. I discussed with my husband as this was nothing I'd ever seen and believe possibly others have seen the same and not know what they are.  I do NOT believe they are alien craft despite how they flew and looked.  If I had a ruler in front of me, each craft was over an inch long+ in the sky that many miles away.  They were flying nose to tail, one slightly above the other, but again, ruler in front of my eyes, about 1/16"" apart.  Both were bright silver metalic, no visible wings, tails or other flying parts.  Both were blinking at the top, a single white flashing light, rapid pulsatings.  They were not truly saucer shaped nor cigar shaped, but more like a flatter saucer shape, rounded at the top, flat bottom and elongated on each end but not pointed as a plane appears in the sky. Their speed was incredible, as fast as jets, and too fast for such a desent.  They were both coming from directly north, but far higher up to a lower southern spot behind the mountain range before the Cascades.  It reminded me of how the Blue Angels fly to perform stunts, but this was NOT what they appeared to be doing.  It was not a stunt flight. They appeared to be landing OR going right into the earth. When I discussed this with my husband last night, he advised me that I might be right that it was something secret we were testing, as he believed there was an old military base over behind Issaquah somewhere near that mountain range, that Boeing used to test military planes they build. I then discussed this today with a friend at Microsoft over lunch, and he asked if I'd contacted you yet.  I told him since he supported my thoughts this was ""ours"", I would send you this information tonight after work. He also mentioned that he'd seen another green ball of light and we began to wonder if all these sitings were corrolated and not alien, but just our own government's secret projects.  Remembering an incident in the CA desert in Aug. '79 near Boran, which later was exactly like the ""Harrier"" we saw (but without wings) at SeaFair, I realized that we had the technology of hover craft, rapid speeds, and wingless flights without it being a helicopter.  Because of so many sightings up here, and elsewhere, the more we report the unknown as precisely as we can, the closer we will all get to truth.  This technology could well have come from alien technology long ago, but it does not mean what I observed was alien, despite its appearance. I am in the hopes someone else has reported this same incident or a like one which you can compare the data with and see if there is a possible connection.   You'd phoned me back when my husband & I observed a bright orangish light near the I-405 near SR520, after we reported it, as being observed by others as well as a military helicopter watching it, too for some time period.  And it disappeared very rapidly.  It, too could have been observed by the military to see how it performed, a test, and if it caused folks to be alarmed.  I am seriously beginning to wonder about all the UFOs I've seen over the many decades and why I see them, over others.  Possibly because I do love this world so much and love to look at it and the magnificient sky.  I find it refreshing for my soul, but it is why I believe that I see more than others do.   It is a daily ritual to stop and look over at the Cascades to view these majestic mountains through the seasons. So, it did not surprise me that I 'happened' to see something that did not belong in the sky at that moment.  Had I not been refreshing my soul, it would not be reported now.  I wouldn't have seen it.  Maybe the desire of humanity is now stepping more as I learned to step, and maybe this is why sightings are being reported in more numbers.

It was dark, and the sky was clear albeit for a slight haze. Shortly after changing to white the objects formed two cirles and emitted trails of sparks as they descended out of my field of view, ie., behind buildings as I walked. Despite having lived near airports, both military and commercial, I had never witnessed anything similar. A possible explanation occurred to me a week later, and I made a few email enquiries. This sighting turned out to be a parachute display team, with flares, operating in darkness for the benefit of the attendees at a local agricultural show. It had me foxed.

We also like to look for satellites and shooting stars.  The evening was about 70 degrees with humidity around 65%.  We were approximately five miles from the nearest village, so light interference was minimal.  The sky was clear.  My wife and friend had gone into an open field ahead of me.  As they were looking into the sky nearly directly overhead, they observed a greenish colored light, slightly bigger than most stars, but at quite a distance.  No sooner had both of them spotted this when three white lights came out of the one green light and headed in different directions moving faster than satellites would and then all four quickly disappeared.  They informed me of this observation upon my arrival only a minute or less later, but I gave it little thought.  We continued watching the stars and saw a few shooting stars when we all turned to look at the north-east sky, not far from directly overhead when we saw a light which I initially labeled landing lights.  Very shortly after saying that, I realized the light was not moving in any direction, but was coming closer and getting brighter.  It had the appearance of a bright car headlight coming at us from a distance.  Just about the time I thought the light was getting close enough and bright enough to almost cast a shadow, it immediately started moving away, but still not moving in any linear fashion.  It became so dull in appearance that it resembled the satellites we've observed on numerous occasions.  At that time, it began moving in a south-easterly direction much faster than any satellite until it disappeared.  All three of us stood in awe of this site, not knowing what to think at that time.

It was around 11:30pm when three of us pointed out what we thought was a satelite and then realized we were seeing three seperate objects in a trianglar formation moving aross the sky.  They appeared to be satelites because of the altitude they were at, but what made us think they were not satelites beyond the fact satelites are not orbiting the earth in formation. was that the far right object would change speed as the triangle formation moved across the sky. They appeared as bright objects and there were no running lights that we could distingush.  We continue to watch them as the disappeared out over the horizon of the Pacific Ocean.

Basicly I turned my head, and when I looked back toward the planet/star, it was gone. This gave me a creepy feeling at first but was soon replaced by more wonder. Right there where the planet/star was a minute ago, there were 2 lights, not as bright as the other stars at first and they were moving. They flashed and blinked blue , red and white. They moved very slowly and finaly disappeared behind a mountain. This was to the north of me. I thought that this was extemely odd, then I saw another two lights , possibly the same ones , so I went and got my camcorder. They floated out of sight just like the first two, and as soon as they were gone there would be two more. They seemed to travel in pairs or threes. This pattern repeated. I had probably seen ten or twelve of these lights when I looked over to the east and what looked like a helicopter shining a spotlight was coming right at me. It came within 100 yards and then turned and moved into some trees , I could still see it betwwen the trees and finaly it disappeard. This object made no sound at all. The other lights came and went for about 2 hours and then finaly stopped at about 12:30 AM. None of these objects made any noise and moved very slowly. To the naked eye there seemed to be something coming off of these objects, not like smoke but more like an aura or a haze.  I haven't been given an explanation for these sightings. I have about an hour of video where you can plainly see how slow they move and that they made no noise. I have the strange spotlight on video as well, the images are shaky because it is a cheap 8mm camera and i couldnt see the lights through the viewfinder so I wasnt sure I was getting them on film. I just got lucky. And when I went to study the tapes , I came to a conclusion that these pairs and threes of lights were most likely not seperate crafts but one larger craft. I foun! d this a fter examining the video and saw how the lights blinked in a rotating sequence. My mother witnessed these events as well. All I can come up with is that they were some sort of balloons. Thats the only aircraft that I can imagine would move so slowly and so close together and in such numbers. The helicopter like light is what confuses me. The only thing that could have manuveured the way this thing did would be a helicopter. Actualy I dont think that a helicopter could have flown through the trees the way this thing did. It seemed to shine a light right down at me the way a helicopter would. And it was probably less than 100 yard away. The odd thing is that it was silent,not even a hum, so I have no clue what it was. At about midnight or just after , a jet flew through the sky right through were these other objects were, but it came from a different direction, the south.It was obviously a jet because it moved fast and made a jetlike noise. After this I only saw 1 more set of lights. My mother and I both concluded that these were not airplanes or helicopters because of the speed and the lack of sound. I am 31 years old, I have no obsession with the parnormal, I did like X Files I will admit , but that was mostly because of how hot Scully was. lol. So I am not claiming to have seen alien craft or martians. But I realy can't explain these lights and maybe someone else out there saw them too and will read this.",2002-08-16T00:00:00,37.2942,-81.1832

I was reluctant to report it because I thought I would be ridiculed for what seemed to be impossible, but, in a recent sighting report I happened across, another witness saw something VERY similar. I have since learned to trust my observations and keep an open mind to any possibility... NOTE: This object SEEMED to perform this feat with a military type precision! Quick and precise.

On or about the month of June or July of '96,in the town of Aberdeen,Md., my 15 yr.old son and I were returning from the dept.of motorvehicles(he was applying for his drivers learner permit),at approx.1330p.m.(traveling north on Beardshill rd.),we noticed a md.state police helicopter hovering above a buisiness building(on Barnett Ln.), and a couple town police cars close to the building. I pulled over to the side of the road(now facing east on Beardshill Rd.)to see what was going on if possible.My son and I were watching(facing west)the helicopter.To the north you could see a light airplane practicing flight maneouvers at the Harford Co.Airpark when I happened to look to the northeast and was startled to see a low flying vehicle(disk or saucer shaped)passing over head.I asked my son to look.He acknowledged by saying ""What is that?"" I replied,""It looks like a flying saucer!"" The vehicle was approx. 500 to 750 ft. above us. As it passed overhead it made no noise whatsoever.It was just floating from N.E. to S.W.,following I-95 toward Baltimore. I would say the vehicle was approx.50 to 100 ft.in diameter,domed at the top and bottom with a dark ring around outside diameter.I saw no windows,engines,or wings.The color scheme was that of the space shuttle. The vehicle colors were bone white(top&bottom)and a visibly black tiled ring around the outer edge.You could see the top of the vehicle because as it moved away from us following I-95,it became level with our eyesight.We were standing at one of the highest elevations in Aberdeen.As this vehicle moved away getting smaller,I turned and looked to see another identical vehicle floating overhead. I told my son to look.""WOW!"",he said. We saw six of these vehicles that day. As one vehicle moved out of our sight to the S.W., one would appear from the N.E..They were following each other in an inline group.I would say they were traveling at approx.75 to 100 mph. The next day at work I talked about what I saw but nobody I talked to saw what I did.The Md.State helicopte! r pilot& copilot had to see these vehicles,as the helicopter was facing to the S.E.,and these vehicles would have crossed their ""path"".I can say that I do not think that these vehicles were extraterrestrial,but manmade in nature.Unless we truly do have alien technology! They were so close to us overhead that they resembled the same texture of material and color scheme that the space shuttle is made out of.I have stood next to the shuttle at Kennedy Space Center.Except for their shape,they do resemble each other.It was really uncanny.My son dosen't remember much about what he saw that day except that they were saucer shaped, but I am sure that some others in Aberdeen had to see these vehicles especially those helicopter pilots from the state police.I found out later they were searching for two robbery suspects at that building.Also I must note that I saw these same vehicles on the T.V. show ""Sightings"" twice. Someone had videotaped these vehicles in 1997 and turned the videotape over to the show. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Witness Testimony: ""I was on-duty responding to an alarm call and travelling eastbound down Kirby (Street) approaching the intersection with State Street. I saw the two lights to the left (north) first. I focused on them and then noticed the two lights to the right (south). I have worked the area for four years and never seen them before so my attention was drawn to them. I should also note that the lights were due east of my location and appeared directly above Memorial Stadium. I was unsure what the objects were at first and I thought they may have been a reflection or new lights on the stadium. I also did not think much about them initially because of that reason. I had been scanning the other Police departments in the area (radio traffic) and heard several other officers talking about unidentified objects they were seeing. I then realized the objects I was seeing was probably related. The closer I came to the stadium also made me realize the objects were several hundred feet above it. The four objects hovered in place. I did not see them move or do anything else. I lost sight of them when I turned northbound onto First Street and was close to the base of the stadium. I realized the lights were further to the east and the stadium blocked my view. Later that night, I telephoned METCAD (a dispatch agency) and learned that several people, including other officers, had reported seeing up to ten unusual lights in the sky. Some believed the lights were from skydivers or parachute flares. Others believed it was the military doing some type of menuevers. I also learned that some buildings had been lit up with spotlights from these objects. Another important point that I forgot to include was that maybe five minutes after my sighting, I received a computer message from our front desk personnel that (said) someone from an apartment at 308 East Armory (3 blocks north of the stadium) called-in to report ten airplanes using orange running lights to communicate to each other in morse code. I am unsure of the loca! tion of that sighting. One last point, METCAD advised during my previously-mentioned telephone conversation that they had called the local airport (Willard) to see if they could provide any information on the unusual sightings. The airport's reply was that they knew of nothing going on and had nothing on their radar screen. Nothing further to report at this time.""

I just had dinner at the Courier Cafe' aroound the corner. I had not been drinking. I looked forward and up and noticed the light because it was unusually bright. I thought at first that it might be a planet because of its brightness and orange-amber color, though it seemed closer. Watching it as I walked, I noticed it was moving. As I walked past my building and headed down the hill, I saw two men standing at the entrance to a parking lot talking to a man in the passenger side of a stopped car. A woman was driving. I stopped to talk to them. They were all also looking at the light. They pointed me to the northeast where I saw two of the same lights moving off into the horizon. They said the lights had flashed bright white a few minutes ago. The two men walked away and the car drove ahead to the liquor store. I watched the single light continue moving. It flashed a bright white for a few seconds then returned to its amber color and kept moving. I watched it until it was disappearing into the horizon (then proceeded to walk toward the store). In the parking lot, I saw a friend who was leaving the store. He said he'd seen the lights on his way to the store. I went inside (the store) for about five minutes. When I exited, I looked to the southwest and saw four more lights emerge one after the other from the horizon in a line. They seem to be equally spaced apart from each other at first then the first light strayed a little from the line formation. The rear one in the line did the same flashing activity as the first had done. I slowly walked back towards my building. As I watched, one or two others in the line did the same flashing. I watched until they reached the horizon. Once home, I called another friend in town and his girlfriend had seen the same lights fifteen minutes ago. All of the lights appeared the same. All of them seemed to maintain the same altitud! e throug hout their path. They moved in fairly straight lines. If they wavered or altered course, they did so gradually."" In summary, this witness first observed the ""lights"" in the southwest and last observed in the northeast. The objects were observed approximately halfway up from the horizon. The witness could not begin to estimate the distance of the ""lights."" The sighting duration was estimated to be 5-7 minutes in length (from horizon to horizon). The orange-amber lights appeared to be one and a half to two times the size of a star. No sound was discernable.

I do not know the time to the exact minute, but the program I was watching on TV was about half way into the 1st half-hour segment when I went outside to see what our dog was barking for.  It was then that I saw the event.  Measurement by protractor revealed the event to have been centered about 25-30 degrees above the western horizon in azimuth, and compass measurement revealed its heading to be 320 to 325 degrees magnetic.  The total event lasted no more than 4 seconds.  Because of the position of some tree branches, I was able to make these measurements to plus or minus 2.5 degrees of accuracy.

Suddenly the whole earth lit up.  The trees in front of me were bright green.  My natural instinct was to search for the source of the light.  It was coming from over my right  shoulder.  I turned to my right and saw a brownish trail or streak.  The huge bluish white brilliant light was about the size of a full moon.  Instantly, the light went behind some spotty clouds.

The ball disappeared and the sky and the earth fell dark.  I was stunned remembering the magnitude of the spikes that shot from east to west then fell downward like an umbrella, or like cat's claws.  They were curved.   I am an audiovisual  engineer and electronics technician.  Sound is my profession.

Just as suddenly, a bar of lights appeared out of the front of the cloud, looking much like a photographer's light bar, with extremely brilliant lights. It almost emerged out of the cloud so that I just had an impression of a dark gray 'metal' in between the lights. I pointed u at it and told the taxi man, 'look at that'.. but in those few seconds, it covered itself again with cloud. The taxi man didn't catch it so I just shook my head in wonder, didn't explain what I saw or ask him if he saw anything other than the one cloud. No other clouds appeared any where in the sky during the next half hour it took to reach my destination. There was no sound from the shrouded object other than the very strong wind in my ears and whipping through the trees. I did recount it to a local radio talk show host once, date uncertain perhaps 1 to 10 years later, whose subject was UFO's. The exact year of sighting is not remembered.

There was a conjunction of 3 planets in the western sky, I had forgotten to look for it when they were in very close position, so I looked out our bedroom window on the west side to see if the conjunction was still visible. This was a night or two after, when separation of the planets had begun. I had been up late doing baby laundry. I was very pregnant with our 4th child, went to sleep almost immediately. I was awakened suddenly, startled, wide awake. At first, I lay still, trying to discern if someone had entered the house before I made any move. Then, in the doorway between the boy's room and our bedroom, (there wasn't any door), I saw a glowing white bright orangish globe floating about 4 feet above the floor. It appeared to be so hot, it was almost totally white. I opened my eyes as wide as possible, then slowly sat up. The object emitted a low hum and when I sat up, it conveyed a mental threat of electrocution to me if I moved any more. I felt it scan my children with beams that I don't think I conciously saw. Two boys were in the room it was in and it scanned my pregnant belly, then a child in another room. It seemd to convey that it discounted the child in the other room, a girl, but took note of the 2 sleeping boys and the infant in the womb, telling me that the baby was a boy. Then, it began to 'glow down', turning from white to bright ornage, to a faded dark orange, becoming transparent, then to gray and out. Then  got up, looked around, saw nothing, laid back in bed and almost as quick as earlier, fell asleep. I had placed a large chest of drawers between the boy's room and ours, it had a large mirror facing me. We lived in a corner house in the city then and light came through the venetian blinds and the kids claimed it bothered them. The door was an arch way and the house was not yet ours so we didn't try a door. As it turns out, I also ad one of those floating vacumm cleaners, a tan globe thing, which was in the closet in the boy's room. I didn't tell anyo! ne about this appearance due to several things, my being pregnant and tired when I retired, and, already having a sattelite shaped vaccumm cleaner people would have surely thought I'd hallucinated the whole incident. But those were also the main reasons I made myself so alert, I was wide awake, no in between worlds fog. About 20 years later, I did tell my family when we were talking one night about OOB experiences.. and other 'weird' happenings to us. That baby boy was born Jan. 20th, but I still had to guesstimate at the month of the experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,39.429084183673474,-87.3756556122449

Highliner Lobsterman, member of the 2 million trap club. Born ((date and place deleted)) On September ninth at approx. 19:10 hours EDST, while hauling gear on the continental shelf 125KM East, Southeast of Nantucket Mass. I overheard a radio  transmission originating from the vessel ""Flight"", made to the U.S. Coast Guard group Moriches, Long Island, New York. The master of the sailing vessel ""Flight"", attracted my ears to pay attention; by hailing the universal distress code ""Mayday"". I immediately followed the channel shift to Channel 22 alpha, which is a standard Coast Guard working frequency.  The master of the sailing vessel ""Flight"", initially established his line of work, and also the fact that he was in the company of a veteran pilot with thirty years experience. To the best of my recollection, he reported seeing a silver cigar shaped instrument, fly in from the North, heading South, at approximately an altitude of two to three thousand feet, stop, and turn due east, and propel itself out of visual range at an astonishing speed. I was listening intently to this conversation as I often due to interesting FM radio conversations. The one thing that struck me, is that, being the sensitive individual that I am, and having monitored countless thousands if not hundred of thousands of Radio conversations over the years, I could not help but sense the fear in his voice. This certainly did startle me.  I have a wordly mind, but had never actually heard anything quite so peciuliar. If anyone would like to talk with me about this, I can be reached through this agency.

I looked to the right and saw a clear light about the size of a headlight about pencil length above the rooftops of 4 story flats in that direction (I'm on the 5th floor and about the same level as their roof) The glare was bright and I'm very used to watching planes and helicopters being in central London.  I thought for a moment it was a plane but at the size it was, I would have expected it to move or change direction or something or at the very least, grow in shape if it was coming directly towards me for example, but it was stationary for a good 5 minutes.  I ran in and prayed my batteries were okay and hunted for my digicam (nikon coolpix 775) and ran back outside.  I took a couple of pictures but it was very cold out and I was shivering so they are a little blurred, but I also managed to get a couple of short videos though again they're a little shakey, as the camera has a 15 second silent video feature.  Had that been a plane it would have grown in size and neared except that wasn't the right direction for the usual flight path either.  A helicopter appeared from behind me and hung around between me and the full moon or there abouts and still the light didn't move straight away.  Eventually it moved slowly up and to the right in direction and I feared I would not be able to see it as it slowly passed behind my flats.  I ran to the other side of the flat and out to the front balcony.  First the helicopter came over the roof, (the whole time there was only ever the helicopter noise, nothing at all from the object itself.) It could have been a completely separate UFO as the look differed greatly from each view ! point or the same one with just the angle making it look very different.  Bu it climbed and began to come right over head where now, although it was dark as was the object (which did at that point look possibly like it could have been a plane) when I realised the pattern of red lights were alternating and going in a triangle shape, very clear bright flashing red lights in a continuous pattern, I could make out a basic triangle shape and confirm to myself that this was not a normal plane.  The object moved in front of me from left to right and I managed to get a photo of this. (Heathrow would now have been to my left, and the moon would have been behind me).  Having loaded the photo's to the computer it looks very odd.  One light shows only (they had alternated) and two of the outside edges  can be seen though they are blurry and look almost cloud like except there were no clouds whatsover and it stayed this shape the whole two-three minutes it took for it to pass over heading towards the direction of Hamstead (if you imagine the point being close to me and the flat side moving away)  I was asked if it looked like a vapour trail but this would have been completely reversed and was moving clearly (between the size of a penny and a twopence piece) in the totally wrong direction for it to have been so.  It didn't look like that to the eye, to the naked eye it was a triangle shape with red flashing/alternating lights that went round the inside edges of the triangle shape and possibly one in the centre when I try to think back. Just one edge red light showed up on the photo though and I'm glad to have got as much as I did considering by now I was absolutely trembling with the cold and trying to get the object in the picture at all. I'm very used to planes, (though not camera's!) I often watch and am used to seeing anything up to 18 in the air at one time from my view and am also used to seeing the Presidents aircraft landing in the American Ambassador's home in Regents Park directly opposite me.  It was not a plane, it was not a helicopter, it most certainly wasn't a meteor (as has also been suggested) as the shakey photo's can only show a split second still and nothing like what the naked eye sees by way of clear lights flashing in a continuous sequence and a definite shape etc. >From the tremors with the chair to the object leaving, the whole thing lasted 16 minutes.",2002-10-15T00:00:00,,

We stopped off at the town of Grindelwald to sight-see.  I had my zoom binoculars (7 - 21 X 50) with me and started to look at the local mountains from the coach parking area.   One mountain which was due south of us (I also had my compass with me) had a particularly pointed shape with left and right slopes of about 45 degrees.   Over this peak I saw a spherical shaped object which I thought  must be some sort of symbol erected on a mast at the peak of the mountain, but after a few seconds observation I realised there was no mast.   The object looked aluminum in color and was illuminated by the sun.   Without the binoculars I had great difficulty in finding the object, but could just about see it with the naked eye.   Over the period of 5 minutes it moved to the right very slowly and eventually disappeared behind another mountain mass.   Another person in our party also had a pair of binoculars and was able to observe the same object.   I later tried to work out the angular diameter of the object and I estimated it to be not more than 3 mins of arc.   Being a stranger to the area I could not tell how far away the mountain was but using estimates of say 4 miles distance this would place the diameter of the object at about 18 feet.",2002-10-15T00:00:00,,

I had called my wife outside to watch it with us. Shortly after Air Force One went out of site, I noticed a dark shape that appeared to be drifting across the sky. At first, I thought it was a black or dark-colored party balloon. Then we noticed it was larger than a balloon and was not drifting, but seemed to be moving under its own power.

The altitude and speed never seemed to vary. The craft would have passed almost directly over the downtown Mesa area during rush hour and would have been easily observed by hundreds, if not thousands, of people (if they cared to look up).

I was in my yard in a very rural area after midnight, and gazing at stars, as I like to do before bed.  I noticed a large shape that seemed to be changing colors, and as I glanced at it it began zig-zagging and darting around like it was on a string or being blown in a breeze.  It was probably 5 miles or so away in the night sky, and I watched it for 15 minutes or so  before waking up my wife.  I compared it to stars, and even to a plane that flew by during that time (in a different part of the sky)and it was like nothing I had ever seen.  It would hover or sit still for a few minutes at a time, then begin the darting and pinwheeling again.  I awakened my wife after about 15 minutes of trying to believe my eyes, and after deciding I had not gone mad, she dug out her binoculars.  We saw that the object had 3 different lights (that we could make out) in a triangular patern. orange on bottom, and blue and green up top.  They seemed to kind of pulse and alternate.  We stayed outside and monitored this phenomenon until about 2 am that night (Roughly 1.5-2 hours).  It never completely left our view, but seemed to be travelling further and higher over the course of the night, until it began to be hard to make out, even with the binoculars.

I was concentrating on the road when my father asked me to look into the horizon around the northwest direction.  What I saw didn't amaze me at first, There was a black dot below the clouds.  I watched it a little longer before my father mentioned that he had been viewing it for about fifteen minutes, and it hadn't moved.  I pulled off at a rest area and we both got out.  We sat and watched it, throwing out ideas of what it might be.  My father suggested a helicopter, but it sat so still for so long that I wasn't convinced.  He then suggested a weather balloon, but I quickly threw that theory out because I knew that weather balloons were metallic and were moved by the wind.  As the sun set his last theory was that it was a blimp.  But by that time it was dark and at least an hour went by and it still had not moved, there were also no lights surrounding the object.  As night fell onto the land the object slowly disappeared.  Which left me to wonder what it was.... possibly a ufo, possibly a secret government project.",2002-08-16T00:00:00,32.9929,-112.9084

I told my friend to look and at first he looked quickley and said it was a balloon and looked away. I kept looking at it and it turned side-ways and it was like thin or flatish. I told him it couldn't be because of that and to hurry up and look again! The longer we looked at it the more we were saying, ""what the heck is that!!!"" It was flying in a strange manner turning and twisting so we could see all aspects of it. Right before we lost sight of it, it turned in a way that we could see it had reddish-orange lights on it. It didn't make any noise. I keep thinking there must be an explanation for it but I don't know what it could be. It wasn't as high as a regular airplane would be, but it wasn't low enough to be some kind of remote control toy.

Looking out my kitchen window as the sun was setting I see a majority of airplanes approaching CVG to land, and even see planes pass by way up in the sky. My family are a bunch of pilots and I have been taught by them how to identify aircraft in the sky. Around 8:40pm looking out I noticed a group of birds flying just above the horzion and above a tall tree, so I can imagine the birds were about 80 to 200 feet above.  As soon as I watched the birds fluttering up and down heading from left to right across my window I noticed another object about the same size as the birds from my distance, but it didn't flutter.  It went really fast, faster than any bird and it kept very straight and steady.  And it seemed to be just above the birds, but as quick as it was I really couln't tell the distance from the object to the ground.  I would say it lasted between 10 seconds to 20 seconds that I saw it.  By that time the object has disappeared out of my sight and the birds were still just making it barely to the half way point of my vision from my window.  The object passed the whole window, so I can use that as a measuring tool.  The speed astounded me, because it was unreal.  When airplanes approach or fly over, you hear them from inside my house.  There was no noise from the craft. No sonic boom, nothing!  Note airplanes you can make out a shape because they are not that fast to the point that you can't tell its an airplane.  Everyone knows this.  Of course it could be the airforce, but then there would of been some sonic boom or some noise.  I wonder if anyone else noticed this object.  Lastly, there were planes in the sky above, and they definitly could not compare to the unidentified object that I saw, meaning there was clearly something unusual about what i saw compared to a cesna, 747, 737, 777, or any other commericial and non commerical aircraft.
