I was driving west on i40 when a bright star started to bother me. It seemed bright but at times went dim.  I thought it was just a bright star at first but then it got a lot bigger, it didnt appear to be an airplane, there was only one light and it wasn't blinking like planes do. I reached down and got my flashlight and flashed the object thru the front window while driving- the object became bright and dim like a response.  I felt like it was watching me so I pulled into the Pilot TS in Winslow,AZ and parked.  I went out to the outskirts of the parking lot/near the edge of the desert {NW corner} and watched the light.  It was hard to determine the size or distance-it was about 3 thumbs up from the horizon. I got scared and went into the ts. I came out about 20 min later.  went to the same spot and the object seemed to be at a distance toward Flagstaff.  It was 1 thumb from the horizon if even that.  I went over and got another driver and told him about what i saw and where i saw it and showed him the light, just as he looked at it, the light flashed bright again.  He confirmed that it was to bright to be a star.  The reason i didn't believe it was a star was because when I was driving I noticed it move; it was south and i saw it move from the southwest part of the highway to right in front of me.  It went about 2 horizontal thumbs within about 5 to 6 seconds at a hight of about 21/2 thumbs high.  It could have been picking up my CD radio frequency (iroc) that i was playing over the radio.  Needless to say, I didnt have a warm fuzzy feeling about these guys. I thought it pretty ironic when i later turned on the xm and heard you on coast discussing ufo siteings the very night i encountered one (for the first time).

At approximately 2100 on Friday, 09 April, my wife and I were in the back yard star gazing.  We had just finished a discussion on Big and Little Dippers and North Star.  As I continued gazing straight up (90 degrees), I noticed a faint ""cluster of Lights"".  Two things got my immediate attention.  The amount of lights that were flashing, and the high rate of speed the object seemed to be moving.  The lights appeared to be a ""cluster"" of lights, perhaps 6-10, and they were flashing, with red being the dominant color.  I watched for approximately 10 seconds.  During that time, the cluster kept flashing and moved across the sky from straight overhead to approx. 45 degrees.  I then pointed the object out to my wife who sighted it and we watched for approx. another 20 seconds until it disappeared due to long range at about 25 degrees on the horizon.  The cluster of lights appeared to be extremely high.  No  sound could be detected. Not knowing the size of the object or the size of the lights, it is difficult to estimate its altitude.  Making an estimate based on what I know about aircraft, sizes, speeds, etc., I estimate this cluster of lights could easily have been between 25,000 and 35,000 feet, or even higher.  The object traveled the entire time in a straight line from North to South.  The cluster of lights did not change relative position on each other, and the craft did not change direction.  I am not aware of any known aircraft that has up to 10 flashing lights on the underside.  As we went to bed later that evening, we listened to ""Coast to Coast"" on KMJ 580 (Fresno, Ca) and several callers had reported seeing this cluster of lights, also moving North to South, along the East Coast.  (Were there multiple targets that evening????, or was the same target making multiple passes?)   I am a retired Naval Aviator, still keeping a commercial, Instrument rating current in the civilian sector.  In over 5,000 flight hours, this is my sighting of a ""really"" wierd sighting in the sky which defied ! concepts of speed, shape, and lighting.  I trust that this information may be useful, perhaps in pinning down what took place on this evening, or perhaps in the future,",2004-04-27T00:00:00,36.29200975609756,-119.82940609756098

I was outside in my front yard looking at stars in a clear sky. I am 37 Yrs. old. I saw a small blinking light the size of a star almost directly overhead that I knew was a plane. About 1Min. behind it was another plane. They were traveling N/NE. This is normal because I live 15Min. from Fayetteville Regional Airport and 25Min. from Fort Braggs front gate. I am used to seeing planes of all types. As are most people that live here. Suddenly under the first plane flew a orange-red fireball from out of nowhere. It left a trail like a meteor. It was the size to me of a dime at arms length. It was traveling opposite the planes (S/SW.) From the direction of Fort Bragg. The fireball passed the first plane and vanished. I figured it was a meteor. Then it reappeared and passed under the second plane and vanished again. I waited and it reappeared again and vanished. It traveled like a stone skipping on water except the stone would be vanishing every time it hit the water. It did this a total of five times and was gone almost making the horizon. This event happened at 21:10 in the evening. The object went from directly over head to the horizon in less than 5 Seconds. It was obviously in a hurry. There was no sound. The planes did not change direction afterward.,2004-04-27T00:00:00,35.03683522123894,-78.92246247787611

They were going reasonably fast, but not any faster than an airplane might fly. But then, we looked around longer and realized that there were more of them, and not all of them were flying the same direction. Some where going straight and some were curving around. Others flew by that had reddish or amber lights instead.  Now I've seen lots of planes, but these did not fly like planes or helicopters, or any type of aircraft that I've ever laid eyes on. Not to mention, some of the lower flying ones appeared to have more than one light, and they tended to be in a diamond/triangular type shape. My neighbor, wife and I all stood there awestruck for minutes pointing out to each other when another one would fly into view.  This was all truely amazing, but there was more to come. All of the sudden, we saw one  fly across MUCH lower than all of the others and it flew quite slowly (slow enough that an airplane would have stalled out), where we had a plain view of the shape and lighting of it. It's very hard to explain and I wish I had remembered to grab my camera, but I was in shock and could not think straight until it had already passed out of sight. The lights were mostly blue and in a diamond shape with 5 lights, although some of the lights alternated between red, blue and green. The rear of the object was a little longer than the rest of it. There were no corners or points anywhere on the object...it was completely smooth and rounded, yet it still had a diamond type shape. It was no more than 500 ft in the air above us, and when it went right over, I could vaguely see a disc type shape on the bottom, and some sort of strange markings that were illuminated slightly by the lights, but it was hard to make out and really unlike anything I've seen. It was also nearly completely silent. I couldn't really hear it at all, but my wife said she heard a slight humming noise. It was obvious that it was not a helicopted or plane, because I've heard them both fly over at that altitude, and they made LOTS of noise. This made almost none.  I had to take the baby in, since it was getting really windy not long after this, but apparently my wife spotted two more diamond shaped UFO's a few minutes later. I had my wife come in a watch the baby so I could look at the sky some more and I noticed several other lights...flashing this time in the sky. Those were obviously airplanes (about 5 of them). They were flying around the area, sort of making passes, like they were searching for something.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,36.50270386100386,-82.5479583011583

On a flight from ((city name deleted)) on the evening of 12-07-04 ; 21:45 local time, we were approximately 150nm to the northeast of cvg at flight level 310. Just prior to begining our descent, I noticed 3 lights at our 11 to 12 o'clock postion. There was an overcast layer of clouds way down below topping at 8000 feet and crisp clear moonless sky above. The lights caught my attention because they were moving unlike those of commercial aircraft. I immediately assumed they were military and thought they might be flying in the area of Buckeye MOA. I was on with Indy center and asked them if Buckeye was hot and they said that no aircraft were in there tonight. I continued to watch the lights and their movements as we descended. I checked on with the next Indy ""low"" sector and asked this new controller if Buckeye was hot and ""No"" was again the answer. I then began to describe to the controller the lights that we were seeing and their movements and direction from our postion. Another airline pilot on the frequency backed up my description. The lights would periodically move vertically very rapidly down then back up to a hover. The lights would line up at an equal distance apart in this hover parallel to the horizon. The strangest thing that I saw was that all three lights then moved horizontally a small distance in unison. I thought that maybe I was staring too long and it was my eyes causing the movement that most people will experience when they stare at a star for instance. The star might appear to move or drift if stared at too long. So, I looked away at the fixed cloud deck below but kept the lights in my poriferal vision. They still moved. I tested my vision again looking repeatedly away in different directions and confirmed that they were all moving together in unison. Then occasionally one light would be brighter than the others and then fade. At one point they all disappeared for a couple of minutes and then all reappeared together. There were also times when only one or two lights were visible at one time as well. They were not commercial aircraft and not military aircraft in formation as I know what they look like. Also, at 150nm from cvg, it looked as though the lights were in the vicintiy of cvg but as we got closer to our destination, we could see that they were much further away in the distance and so I could not even guess on their range. Again, the most striking characteristics were the movements in unison and the high velocity they appeared to have whether it was vertical or horizontal. I've never seen any aircraft do that, military or otherwise in all my years of flying.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,,

There is a large cliff to the West of the cabin, near the back of the lake. During WW2 this cliff was the backdrop to flyovers by airplanes that drug banners to train arial gunners. Earlier that day I had made a comment that wanted to see a UFO. Around 9:30 pm, I went out to his truck to get something and I looked over the top of the cliff and saw a flashing light that was blinking red, white, and bluish-green. I stood there for a few minutes and watched to see where it would go and it just hung in the sky. I went in the cabin to get my friend and he came out to the truck too. We sat there and watched this thing through the back window and saw it move up and down, then zoom to the side and back to it's original spot. Then another craft moved in to the North of it, it was blinking in the same colors as the first one, then two more crafts moved into the same area and formed a triangle. They hung in a triangle formation for approximately 5 minutes and then took off one at a time. During their time in the triangle formation, they were blinking red and white. The original craft that we saw then flew off over our heads blinking red and white at a very rapid pace with no sound. At that time, we could hear airplane engines when they flew over, so we knew this was a different type of craft. As it got darker out, we moved into the main cabin where there are bay windows that look out upon the lake and the cliff and watched as many other similar crafts flew into triangle formations and hung in the sky. They would form triangles of all different sizes, but always triangles. We watched them for about an hour and a half to two hours before we got tired and went to bed, but there were still many of them in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

On the way, T (riding in the passanger seat)noticed a bright light and it appeared to be dropping into the atmosphere. He said ""Oh my God, a bomb is dropping!"". By the time I directed my attention to the object (only a split moment later), we were just coming to the top of a small hill, and at first, I thought it was a street light (it was the same color as a streetlight). I told T to stop pulling my leg, and then he said ""look!"" and the object was moving off to the right. As we continued down the road, we seemed to be gaining on the object. We continued forward into a Publix parking lot(It was relatively empty, because it had just closed). At that point, the object was hovering right over the treeline (however many feet up is impossible to tell), and, if I were to guess, I'd say it was close enough to see us. We were behind the grocery store looking at the object in amazement. We both stepped out of the car to get a better look, and the object seemed to be slowly getting closer. Me and my friend got a good look at the object: It was surrounded by a series of maybe 10 or 12 smaller lights (from what I remember, they were neon bluish), and in the middle of the circle there was a significantly bigger orangeish/red light. The object got closer and closer to us, untill there was no doubt in our minds that it wasn't hovering there by coincidence, it must have known we were almost right under it! After a few minutes of hovering, it took off in a blur. T and I were confused as to which direction it went in. Neither of us could agree as to which way it went, therefore, we had no clue as to which road to take to follow it. The craft made no noticeable noise.  There was a series of strange occurances that took place for a couple of weeks after the sighting, the first one being later that night/next morning:  I fell asleep at T's house that night. When I awoke (~5am) I jumped up in fright from the bean bag chair I fell asleep in, and quickly woke my friend. I didn't know why I was so worked up. I didn't recall any particularly scary dreams, in fact, I didn't recall any dreams at all.  A few days later, I awoke to my door slamming shut (~11am). There was nobody home at the time, nor had there been for hours.  While I was undressing to take a shower, I looked at my back in the mirror and there were 2 sets 3 horizontal red lines on the back of my shoulders. One set for each side. I attempted to feel them, but couldn't. They were as smooth as my skin. There were no scabs or anything. I thought they may have been stretch marks, but from my experience with stretch marks, I have always been able to feel their indentation. they were evenly spaced and about 4 inches long.  T's father awoke to a slamming door at around 3am a few days after that. He didn't tell me about it untill I mentioned that it happened to me first.  About 5 months later, me and T were playing videogames. We heard a very strange noise outside his window, and the only way I could describe it was that it sounded painfull and somewhat like a bird and a human scream combined, but not overly loud. We both paused for a few moments, commented on the strangeness of the sound, and continued playing games. I soon went home, but before leaving, Me and T investigated his backyard to see if we could find what made the noise. We found nothing, and I went home that night. The next day T said he had the same marks I had. His brother M said that he awoke to something scurrying around the room when his 1 year old was crying. M thought it was a ghost. I never saw T's marks, cause they healed in like 2 days, where mine took over a weak, so I never got to compare the marks. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

All i saw was a blue,purple and pink blur with a white dot Seeming to be on top,soaring in a zig-zag formation, Then it finally zoomed off! It scared the crape out of me! So i went to go tell my mom(who was downstairs)What happened. What i realized though, was the blanket...was exactly how i dreamt it wraped around me! And...i had an impression in my foot that hurt where i felt it hurt in my dream!So i ran downstairs and told my mom. But she just told me it was a dream and to go to sleep. I am not sure what exactly happened to me in that time i was asleep,but i KNOW what i have just told you is real! No matter what any one says or thinks! I know! I've  asked my mom if i could even go to theropy to ! be hypnotized,she said no. I think about it though, and i kind of don't want to know! But since then...i have seen different things in the sky.

It was raining on and off and there were large patches of storm clouds intermixed with clearings and breaks in the clouds.  Sometimes everything was soft and greyish and sometimes parts of the landscape and sky were in full light.  Somewhere between Espanola and Velarde, NM and just north of Alcalde, NM, I noticed a very steady solid white shape moving swiftly and smoothly in a southerly direction (parallel to the highway in the opposite direction of my travel).  Its altitude and speed at this time did not fluctuate.  It made its way from my northwest at roughly 20 degrees to slighty south of my due west (perpendicular to the highway) in a fairly short period of time.  If I had to guess I'd say it covered between 1/2 and 1 mile in no more than 10 seconds.  I traded between watching the object and watching the road, trying to determine a shape and wether it would be worth stopping the car.   I was looking for the tell-tale signs of a small engine plane or large bird and could distinguish no features, other than an ellipse seen at a subtle angle.    Then it slowed dramatically, almost to a stop, and started dropping in altitude,  It was at this time that my curiosity was high enough to stop the car.  This is only the second time I have ever done something like this.  The first time I was able to quickly determine that what I was seeing was a large shaped balloon on a tether.  This sighting lasted almost an hour with no satisfying explaination.  I crossed the 4-lane highway (2 lanes in each direction separated by a land divider somewhat excitedly because its shape was still elusive, and now its movement quickly ruled out a lot of possibilities. It was about 11:45am when I started watching it.  It stayed in the same general area for a very very long time, changing altitude in a range as high as 20 degrees (no higher than the high mountain line in this area) and as low as possibly landing. In fact, I never saw it leave.   I left only when I became convinced that it was not going to come close enough to me to get a good photo.  During the 55 minutes I observed it, it exhibited the following behaviors: First it behaved like a bee hovering over flowers, except with less erratic motion and a bit slower.  It would dip down low enough to make the mountains and hills behind it a backdrop, making the white ellipsoidal shape pop out pretty clear in spite of the light raininess.  It moved smoothly, but not perfectly smooth.  Accellerations to the left, right, higher or lower, and to and fro, were not always at the same rate, but within a range that suggested it was not at the mercy of the wind.   It was also clear that its angle would change.  There would be ""flashes"" of white as its ""top"" surface area either reflected light or simply showed more of its white coloration.  At one point, it came VERY low.  In fact, it dipped between an earthy slope and some trees in the relative foreground that couldn't have been more than 1/4 mile from the highway.  When it was behind the trees, it seemed to make its closest approach to me.  I could see its white peeking out from spaces within the trees and it appeared relatively much larger.  Then I didn't see it for a while.  But my eyes were locked on to the spot I last saw it, hoping for it to show again.  Then after some time I saw it move horizontally south as if it were a white van driving on a road behind the trees, only it lifted and appeared to move back away toward the mountains again. It made this low approach twice, and when it did, it reappeared from the very same location some time later.  I suspect it could have actually landed, or just hovered lower than I could see.   When it rose it often stayed along the very edge where the mountain met the sky, and was just a few shades lighter than the clouds there, and about as bright as the brightest point in the sky where the sun threatened to break through.  I was very excited.  I have never stopped to look at something like this for such an extended period of time with such focus.  I didn't try waving down any cars nor did I care to fetch my camera right away for fear this would be short-lived.   Once I got a sense it was restricting its range and was going to stick around, I went to fetch my Canon digital Elph.  I wasn't expecting to get anything more compelling than the movement I just described, but thought it was sort of obligitory to try.  At the very least the photo gives place and possible distances.  I am still perplexed.  I am considering going back down tomorrow to see if anyone from any of the local farms saw it (or was somehow responsible for it).  All of my theories failed under at least one of the observed behaviors.  I considered that it could be:  A prop plane - prop planes can't hover A model plane - can't hover A helicopter - no sound or discernable movement of vegetation as it neared the trees.  rises in altitide too abrupt at times. A model helicopter - if so, it was very fast, very large, very quiet, and had a range approaching 1 mile at first A large bird - It would have had to be very very large for a bird, and then again it's general shape never changed, and it's movement was not very birdlike A piece of detritus - it was windy out, and things stay up a long time in the wind, but it's initial movement was steady as a rock in altitude and shape.  Highly unlikey that the wind was controlling this thing.  Right before I gave up, it went to a dark tone, as if it had gone from reflecting light to silhouette.

I was able to see inside the craft through a small window and was able to see three small beings. All appeared to be sleeping or meditating, they did not respond to my voice. As my wife and I walked around this craft it began to levitate and eventually flew off without making any sound at all. My wife and I promised each other that we would not tell anyone about this encounter however I could not resist. If anyone else saw this craft please post something.

I also like attempting to track satellites and orbiting booster rockets using my scopes' electronic drive. The atmospheric conditions had steadily been getting worse all night and because my scope is somewhat labor intensive to set up, I decided not to bring it out after glancing Northwest and noticing a star flickering more than usual, typically a sure sign of turbulence in the air and generally poor ""seeing"", also the scattered cloud cover was quickly changing to broken while moving from WSW to ENE. At that point, I noticed the ""star"" had some distinct red flashes mixed with some green and was quickly looking like one of the many commercial jets that overfly the area heading either N-S or S-N. I then began looking at the object closer and could clearly see multiple red lights and one green light and also that it looked to be at fairly high altitude but curiously, the object appeared to be motionless and looked to be between magnitude 0 and -1. Intrigued, I stood still and stared at it, comparing the distance of the lights laterally(about the width of my fist held out at arms length) to a nearby tree for approximatley 5 minutes during which time the object never moved. At that point, the object began to slowly move ENE, decreasing the distance to the edge of the tree by about 30% over a period of 20-25 seconds before stopping again. My thinking at that time was that this was most likely a helicopter but possibly a U.S Marine AV-8 Harrier in hover mode. However, what happened next left me absolutley stunned. The lights began slowly moving ENE(left to right) again but VERY rapidly increased to roughly 5 times the speed that I've observed the International Space Station cross the sky and in about 2 seconds it disappeared behind the tree causing me to verbally exclaim ""Whoaaa..Ho Ho!!"" and blink several times. I then walked West out to the sidewalk and reaquired the object which had stopped again. I was extremely tempted by now to go inside and make an attempt to assemble my telescope, drag it out and get a good look at it but was worried that by the time I got it up and running the lights would have moved off or more likely be covered by the now increasing clouds but I had to get SOME sort of closer view besides the naked eye and after watching the lights in the new position for about 2min I decided to compromise and run into the house and grab binoculars, leaving my slippers where I had last been standing to aid in reaquirment. What I saw thru the binoculars was very clear even while holding them freehand. There were 3 very red lights in an arrowhead triangle ""V"" pattern, the point appeared to be facing ESE, directly between the 2 red lights on the ""short side"" of the triangle was a distinctly greenish-white light and in the center of the object was an orange light that was flashing on and off irratically. I then began walking North on the sidewalk about 25ft to two cars parked parallel in front of my house stepping between them and sitting on the bumper of one and resting my elbows on the trunk of the other to steady the image. I then noticed the area between the red lights was slightly but noticably darker than the surrounding sky and after about 8 min I witnessed the object ""yaw"" to my left and now point to about 170 deg. The yaw manuever took between 1-2sec. About a minute later, the orange light ceased flashing and stayed on solidly but then the red light on what I describe as the objects' right(starboard) side(my left)began flashing rapidly at a rate of about 3 times per second for 7-10 seconds then up to nearly strobe light speed for 3-4 seconds then back to solid red for about 50sec and back to flashing. This went on for about 12min then all the lights stayed on solidly until clouds began obscuring them but just as the lights were about 70% obstructed, I again noticed they appeared to be flashing again, even thru the clouds until they were completely obscured. I'm 39 and I have been seriously involved with astronomy for 7 years and am used to feilding questions about what someone ""saw"" from the public at starpartys and explaining what it was and why it appeared the way it did. I also have been heavily interested in all forms of aviation since the age of 9. I put this object thru every trial I could think of during the event, moving position to make sure it wasn't a reflection off telephone wires etc. This object was not, from my perspective, ANY kind of celestial body I know of or have ever witnessed before, including satellite de-orbits, Bolides or fireballs. This object was MOST DEFINATLEY inside the atmosphere and appeared to be solid. I would describe this event as having the highest ""Wow"" factor of my entire career looking skyward. I will most certainly be looking again! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be quite objective in his description of the object, and most credible.

I had a really weird experience last weekend...Don't know what to believe anymore...  We were driving back from Los Angeles, CA to my home in San Jose, CA and were on the I-5 near the Firebaugh area. I knew I was here since my GPS in my car showed me that area.  Suddenly there was heavy fog which almost made me not see the road and I slowed down a bit, after the fog somewhat cleared, I saw two lights like the headlights of a car going alongside my car in my window. First I thought it might be a reflection but there was no other cars around me for miles that I could see. I took my window down to see more closely. It seemed like a glider of some sort so my first thought was that maybe its some sort of radar device which the government uses to check speeds of vehicles on the highways or a helicopter. But it none of those. Then it glided down really smoothly and quite beautifully almost touching the ground giving me an idea it was landing. I was looking ahead and looking at it at the same time and slowed my car a bit also.  Being honest, at that point I was a little scared as the object without landing just took off again and went over in front of me over the highway across and it cast two lights in the field. The lights were just like ordinary white lights throughout but the object seemed like it was spinning. It stood in the field for about 5-10 seconds casting those lights in a triangulated fashion really beautifully. The object suddenly turned from there and came straight for my car, the lights from it were really bright, almost blinding; at which point I was getting paranoid that whatever it was going to hit my car. But it came on the top of my car and was gone! Yes it was just gone, disappeared totally. I also looked into my back mirror but there was nothing there except absolute darkness. I took the next exit for the gas station and a little while later an SUV stopped from which a lady emerged and I tried to ask her if she saw something. But I guess it was the time of the night, I saw the look in her eyes which was telling me I'm some kind of weirdo...I was yelling for my friends to wake up as they were sleeping but they confirmed to me later they did see some kind of light as at that point they had woken up.  I do not know what to make out of it but I know what I saw and it lasted for a good minute or maybe more.

The earliest reports I heard were 9am in the morning and it was there until dark. I personally did not hear about it until around 6pm in the evening when a small blurb was mentioned on the radio.  The object drifted slowly but not very far while under my observations and exhibited no unusual characteristics that one would expect if this were a high-altitude research balloon.  The meteorologists from the local TV stations said that it was above the cirrus clouds indicating an altitude greater than 30,000.  This would make the object VERY big indeed.  A local person with a high-powered telescope viewing it said it did indeed look like a balloon.  Perhaps that would satisfy most people's questions, but how does an untethered balloon stay in basically the same position for at LEAST 12 hours in a row?  Especially in the Midwest where fronts are blowing through every few days?  Perhaps it was the center of a very slow moving low pressure system?  Officially, NO ONE has claimed ownership for the object and there has been NO official explaination.

I observed directly ahead of me (west) a light that I first thought was a low-flying helicopter, due to the intensity of the light, and the fact it appeared to be not moving. I'm not sure the exact distance between myself and the object, but I would have to say somewhere between 8-12 miles. At first, I thought it could have been a helicopter between 750-1000ft above ground level. The light seemed far away (see above estimate) yet it was oddly bright. I would describe the color as a yellowish white. Almost like the color of a 60 white light-buld. I was watching this object for about 5 seconds when it appeared to split in two. Each of the lights were less bright than the sum when they were connected. In altitude, they were parallel. One of the objects (the one to my right) started flying north towards South Mountain, and the one seemed to remain in place for another 3-4 seconds. Then another light appeared next to the remaining craft. This time the light was definately less bright than the 'main' object (the remaining one of the pair). It was much closer to this object than distance between the initial two. It was about 100 ft lower in altitude, and 150ft-200ft to the left (south) of the 'main' object. I continued driving along Pecos and then turned right (north) on 32nd street and the trees to my left temporarily blocked my view for maybe 10-15 seconds. I then turned left (west) on Liberty ln. to go to my house, and once again saw the 2 objects. They were in the same position as before, and still remaining in the one spot. I went into my house to put my dinner that I just bought at Taco Bell on the counter in my kitchen and went back outside to continue following the object. I did not see the object I had been tracking, At least not where it was before. I saw something moving north very quickly and passing right over South Mountain, but I'm not sure which of any of these objects that could have been. It very well could have been a different object altogether, maybe a plane. I only got to see it for a second or two and then it disappeared over the mountain, and there was nothing else to observe, so I went back inside. One other thing I should mention is the air was very humid and there was an intense electrical storm at the time. Lightning, but with barely any rain. There was another car about a hundred feet ahead of me driving on Pecos, so he/she/they might have seen this as well. I don't see how one could have missed it.",2004-08-24T00:00:00,,

I don't think the winds aloft would make a ballon behave this way.

As we got onto the interstate I noticed a brightly lit object in the sky about halfway between Ankeny and DSM.  I initially thought it was an aircraft approaching the Ankeny Regional Airport, but as I kept driving the object didn't seem to be getting closer.  From my early vantage point the object looked to be at a height of around 1500 ft.. The craft was still in plain view when I passed the mixmaster area which is 6 miles from DSM, but considerably lower(1000ft.?).  I now was thinking this might be some sort of tower, but I had never seen anything like this and being from that area I'm sure I would have noticed it before.  I'm also sure that I wouldn't have been able to see it at the altitude that it was at now when I first saw it in Ankeny.  When I finally passed it I could finally rule out a tower.  I slowed down to 50mph and rolled down the window to look at it.  It was right off the interstate and I was able to look directly up at it.  It was only 250 ft up with 3 bright lights in the shape of a triangle with a moving, smooth red light that moved back and forth in a fluid motion.  My wife who is an absolute skeptic on things like this pointed out 3 cars on the far side of the road that seemed to be not working.  I turned around on Guthrie Ave.(DSM), which is about a mile from where I saw the object, to go back and get some footage with my Digicam.  I could tell it was gone though and could now determine that it wasn't a tower because they just don't get up and walk away.  I am a former Marine and I know what helicopters look like at night.  This was something I'd never seen before.  On a side note, I called a friend of mine after I got home to tell him about my sighting.  He was at the Iowa State Fair which is approx 5 miles from where I saw the craft.  I told him to watch the skies.  The next day, he said the only thing he saw that night was a news helicopter get escorted from the area by 2 huey choppers.  I thought that was interesting.

The only notable thing about this was that I couldn't match it to any entry on the Heavens-Above! website for satellite spotters. But it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of junk floating around up there isn't mentioned on that site.  2. July 14 0005 Saw another very dim 'satellite' overhead travelling northward. Average satellite speed, but still in a clear sky and just vanished after a couple of seconds (going northwards so it wasn't entering Earth's shadow). For ten or fifteen seconds after that a small dim point of light, same brightness, seemed to pop up for an instant in the same general area, then popped up again in a slightly different part of the sky (i.e. less than the palm of an outstretched hand). This happened seven or eight times and reminded me of an optometrist's test for blind spots. The flashes of light were so faint I have to admit to the possibility that my eyes were deceiving me, although I definitely saw the moving object that started the sequence off.  3. July 14 0010 Saw a brilliant spot of light (Venus x 2 in magnitude) travel from NE to SW, covering about the 60 degrees of sky visible between buildings and trees in a fraction of a second, seemingly at the same altitude. Possibly just a meteor or re-entering space junk, but notable for the fact that it was just slow enough to be seen as a point of light rather than a streak and also for the fact that it didn't leave even the hint of a trail as one might expect for such a bright light.

There were numerous planes seen in mid air approaching and leaving the airport mostly in SE/NW direction. None of the planes approached the beach where we were located.   The object, however flew directly over us and disappeared behind our hotel.  It flew from SE to NW, over the sea and then over land, where its view was obstructed by buildings. Description:  Its shape is hard to define: it looked like a diamond or a stingray while somewhat flat at the front.  At some point it seemed to be made of soft fabric and its sides seemed to slowly move up or down, as if slowly changing shape.  The bottom part had numerous lights that were much dimmer than the stars in the sky.  I would estimate the size as that of or larger than Boeing 747.  But with the shape closer to B2 bomber it had to be quite big.  No wings, however.  Can't say if it was a single object or a formation - did not have a chance to see it long enough.  Speed: approximately 250 mph.  Height: I estimate 900 feet.  Again these are only estimates but if this were a 747 or 777 it would be possibe to see detail of the fuselage, windows, side marks etc at this height.

I had a camp fire light and hanging lantern light in my eyes and still saw this extremely bright blue-white light appear in the sky at about 35 degrees above the horizon almost directly east of our position. I called my wife to look and she and a son of 11 also saw it. It became extremely bright and huge, probably four times the size of the glowing Saturn. Then as if clicked off, it turned to a dot like the smallest star in the sky and turned southward. It proceeded that direction appearing as a satellite, until we lost sight of it. It made no sound and had no other disquishing lights such as wing markers or strobes on an aircraft as we know.  Then again on the next evening about 30 minutes later, the light appeared in the same area, shining through a layer of clouds. I could see no other stars in the sky due to the clouds. Again there was no noise or other lights. This time two other adults saw it. When the bright light dimmed as it did the previous night, we could not track it due to the clouds.  Then on the night of the 19th of August we had company of two attorneys and one of their spouses at our camp. They were all from New Mexico. We were eating a late meal when we heard two loud booms like dynamite going off in the sky followed by a three thunderous, rolling booms that shook the earth, trees and camp tent. The enormous thunderous roll then turned to a vibrating thunder sound which then receded. I have never in my 60 years heard anything to compare this vibrating thunder sound with. I am also a pilot and have heard sonic booms. This was almost frightening in comparison. Relatives of ours also heard this noise 20 miles distant but thought it was thunder as they were inside their homes. Another ranch couple only a few miles away were rattled in their bed by what they could only describe as thunder from somewhere. We at the camp had a clear view of the entire night sky and there was not a cloud from horizon to horizon.  I have no idea what any of this was including the light. It is strange to have three unusual events in such short time frames and in the same area. I have been in that area for most of my life and have never witnessed anything similar.  We are just hopeful that maybe someone else saw the same things and can bear witness to what we saw and heard.

I looked to my left(south east) and out of nowhere appeared to be a hazey sphere that I mistook for the moon for a second.  It then got larger and larger and a light appeared in the middle of it.  I stopped and fixated on it.  I told myself it must be a helicopter looking for pot crops or something but it then burned so bright that my eyes hurt and I had to look away.  It was very close to a star of which I don't know the name and I used the star as a marker to see how much it moved. It dimmed out to a cigar shaped haze and zigg zagged a little and then started to glow in the middle and had a haze on top and below the glow.

At approximately 10:30 pm, an electrical storm began to develop.  I was beginning to get sleepy and was considering turning the television off and going to sleep.  When there were two very rare bursts of static on the television about a minute apart (both at 10:42, according to my TiVo clock),  my decision to go to sleep was made since I also feared that it might not be safe to leave the television on any longer.  I pressed the ""record"" button on my TiVo so that I could finish watching the program at another time, very likely made a quick trip to the bathroom (though I'm not sure), took off my glasses (I'm very near sighted), and got back into bed.  I lay down on my left side facing the large panoramic windows in my bedroom.  Even with my very impaired vision, I immediately became aware of some lights moving in the sky in a way I'd never seen before.  I immediately sat up, retrieved my glasses from the night table, and put them on.  Outside my window and over Rock Creek Park and a large residential building across the street, balls of light were moving rapidly and a bit jerkily in an oval-shaped counterclockwise pattern.  It's difficult to say exactly how many there were, but I believe that four individual lights  would be a good estimate.  After watching them for a stunned minute or two, I got out of bed, and went next door to get my sister.  Together we stood at the window and watched this light show for approximately five minutes.  Towards the end, the lights seemed to simply fade away through the heavy cloud cover until there was only one left.  That light eventually faded as well.  I did not look at the clock again until after my sister left.  The time was 10:58.  Though I've called them ""balls"" of light, they weren't perfectly spherical.  There was no hard edge to them, though I do believe there was a brighter intensity at the center of each.  During the entire event, they kept moving in the same circular pattern – very, very rapidly and very, very erratically,  Though pinpointing precisely where they were is tough, I recall that my sister and I both stooped a bit to get a full view of the ""show"".  (I usually have the blinds in my bedroom about 1/3 of the way down.)  I forgot until Saturday evening when I turned on my television and my TiVo that I had recorded during the exact time of the event.  Because I'm very sure that it was the second burst of static that caused me to turn off the television, I can time the start of the event (using the TiVo clock) at precisely 10:42.  In retrospect, the static on the television is very interesting.  Our cable service is very reliable here and is not affected by the weather at all.  Neither my sister nor I can ever recall seeing bursts of static since we've had this service (more than four years) and they are dramatic.  Both are preserved on my TiVo.  I'll add one other observation.  Living in Washington, DC,  during the months after September 11 we became very used to hearing the jets patrolling our skies.  They were always audible, sometimes even loud enough to awaken you.   Though we no longer (or only rarely) hear those jets anymore, contrails are always visible.  I have watched contrails being formed (almost daily, in fact) and, while you can spot the object making them with the naked eye, it is completely silent.  On the morning of January 8th of this year,  I was so startled by a pattern of contrails in the sky outside the same bedroom window that I took digital photos of them.  There were at least 20 (and maybe even more) in a very narrow area and I had a hard time imagining how that many planes could fly so closely together without anyone hearing a thing.  Witness Two: On the evening of Friday, 5/21/04 I was in my bedroom reading.  A very powerful thunderstorm had been right over our building for approximately ten minutes when my sister came into my room and asked me to come look at something.  I glanced at the clock and noted that it was 10:46PM.  She asked me to look out the window in her bedroom at the sky over Rock Creek Park.  I saw at different times 1, 2, 3, or 4 blurry, yet distinct white lights moving counterclockwise in an apparent oval shaped orbit.  The cloud cover was heavy, but my perception was that the lights were within or circling one particular cloud.  The lightning was intense and lit up the entire sky several times as we watched the lights. The lights moved constantly in an erratic, jerky fashion, seemingly unaffected by the lightning.  Their movement appeared ghostly to me and I thought of Casper cartoons.  Their shape is harder to describe.  Narrow at the bottom and wider at the top is close – almost torch-like with indistinct edges.  It was my impression that their blurry, undefined appearance was due to the cloud cover and extremely hazy skies.  After about ten minutes the intensity of brightness dimmed and I realized that only one light was still visible as it gradually disappeared.  The storm raged on for another few minutes.

It was very dark in colour and silent. Our cat's reaction to a slight vibration made us notice. Then our garage door started to open and shut on its own.  A few hours later we managed to fall asleep. But something really strange happened all night. I will tell you what happened to me, then what happened to my husband.  I fell asleep in our bed but my husband found me later on the sofa in the living room. The patio door was open. I was half dressed, really weak and disoriented. I felt drained of my energy.  My husband had a really difficult time getting out of bed. He was also disoriented. He found me on the sofa. He doesn't remember anything except that something prevented him from getting up.  I have a vague recollection of getting up, being guided by something, then nothing except I felt like I was in some strange dream. 3 hours went by between getting out of bed and waking up on the sofa.  The day after, still tired and taking a shower, I noticed something on my arm. When I was a child I had a triangular mark that had disappeared since then. Now it was back again and it looked like 3 dark stains and my arm was itching.  My husband felt weak the following days. Like me, he felt like he was under observation, spied on.  Then the sensation went away. I don't know what happened that night but nothing felt normal.  I had the same experience when I was 5 and living in Texas. It happened a second time when I was 15. Now I am 29 and it happened again. I don't know what it is but it's not of this world.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

Here's their report> I had gotten to bed around 10:00PM, but woke up at 11:34 last night.. I glanced at my clock to notice the time and at the corner of my eye, I saw a blinking light outside my window. It would say that it was about 3 to 4 miles away. It was in the sky blinking pretty fast.. I decided to get a closer look at it thinking that it was probably some airplane, but when I took a look through my binoculars, it turned out to be some sort of diamond shaped craft.. I can't be to sure of this, but it had turned around in circles, and its lights where in the middle of this blinking light.. I then noticed that one of the lights got bigger and as it got bigger, the craft kept turning around. Realizing that I was seeing an actual ""U.F.O.,"" I ran to get my digital camera so that I could take a photo of this.. out of my photos that I had taken, only 1 picture showed the craft.. however, it was orange now, and behind it was what seemed to be another craft!.. But this one was blue.. I am still trying to tell my self that I did not see anything, but just in case I did, I am going to look again tonight.. I will post another message if I see it or anything else like it, again.

Usually I noticed it around 2 or 2:15 am (while I was working at my home computer, I am a writer and so is my husband) and it would be noticable for about 30 to 45 minutes but since it was early in the morning I have usually gone to bed before it disappeared. However, on Monday night 10/12 it disappeared before I went to bed.  I might add the weather was good and no other stars were visible in the sky when we have seen these lights. After the first sighting, my husband up out of bed to see it/them. The object(s) appears on the Gulf water side due East and Southeast over the Bolivar Peninsul/ Texas City area.  You see a belt of lights parallel to the horizon seeming to rotate around whatever it is, changing colors from white to yellow to green occasionally with a red flash.  Normally it hovers in one spot moving ever so slightly but last night 2 of them appeared at the same time. At first they were a good distance from each other then one moved to be in tandem with the most easterly one and they were close to each other high over the roof top of my neighbors home but I have no idea how high they were, I would say extremely high.  On Monday night the one that was there was kind od darting around slightly before it disappeared. I am concerned and I do not know what to do; because as you may know there are many petroleum refineries here in this area and the salt dome oil storage is underground at High Island not far from here. I guess I am worried these might be some sort of spy vehicles but they just seem so unusual that I cannot believe others have not seen them and I have to think the US military and the Coast Guard would be strengently guarding these refineries, so why have they not seen them?

Police and the fire service received dozens of calls from the public about the blast which happened at 7.30am. But despite efforts by both services to locate the source nothing was found. Fire service spokesman Ian Bailey said: ""We had people calling from a wide area - Chorlton, Flixton, Farnworth, and Walkden - saying they had heard a huge explosion.  ""But we have not responded to any incident which would explain the blast. Some of the control room officers at our headquarters in Pendlebury also heard it."" A police spokesman said: ""We have not been able to find any explanation and there is no rubble or bricks anywhere."" Measurements The British Geological Society is investigating.Though none of their earthquake signals were triggered, it said that it may have been too shallow to register on their measurements. Another possibility is that the blast could have comefrom old mine workings. There are disused shafts in the Walkden area and at Agecroft where a pit closed at the beginning of the 1990s. Lynn Hall, of Sherwood Drive, Pendlebury, said: ""At 7.25am this morning I was locking the door of our house and my husband Carl was waiting for me to come out. He said to me `Did you hear that loud bang?' He kept mentioning it because it was so loud."" One caller to a radio station has claimed that she saw something falling from the sky. But fire brigade spokesman Paul Duggan said: ""If it had been a meteorite we could have expected to have found a crater - which we haven't, unless it is the middle of a golf course or a field.""

Small tubular craft! Burn marks! Strange dream last night. Here is what I can remember.  I was outside with a friend at night in a sidewalk cafe in Los Angeles. I was looking at the stars and noticed that there were more than usual. Then, these small, what appeared to be remote drone planes flew by with no pilots. They were probably 3 feet in length...white, and very tubular in shape. I yelled, ""Look at these!!"" and that's when the sidewalk was invaded by men dressed in black, with guns coming from everywhere. They were herding us all together and there were hundreds of people now on the street, screaming.  Then something odd happened; they were shouting orders and threatening to ""put a button in everyone's neck"" but the man in charge was looking straight at me. I was freaked!  He should have known that I already had one, but he shot this gun at me that didn't have bullets; it had some type of electrical-tingly sensation instead...not pain...but it most definitely got me to stop in my tracks and pay attention!  Then he came up with this long, round tube about a foot long, and 2 inches in diamter and put it to my left eye.  Next thing I know is it Puffed into my left eye.I was SO scared.  I didn't know what he had just done to me.  People were still screaming.  I can't hold on to much more of the dream, but I stayed awake all night once it woke me up because I didn't want to forget it.  When I did wake up, however, in the morning saw 2 very visible ""burn"" marks on me, one on the wrist, and one on my upper arm, at a diagonal.  I have only taken pics today, at your advice, on 7-1-04,...they have faded somewhat, but are still there.  I don't know why I did not take photos for a week!  I have a scar on my tail bone from a few years ago, and then, too, like this week, I did not think of documenting it!  How strange indeed!

Our house is under the flight paths for both D/FW Int. Airport and the joint reserve base in Fort Worth, so we often hear and see jets. I was facing northwest when I heard the noise. I looked over my shoulder to the south and saw a very bright white contrail (or smoke trail), very dense and wide, extending from the south heading directly north. Airliners never travel in this path -- they always go east-west or west-east.  I visually followed the contrail north until I spotted what initially looked like an airliner, EXCEPT IT HAD NO WINGS. The object and its contrail were higher than the clouds. The object had little fins at the back end like a missile. The contrail was much wider than the object. After about 20 seconds, the object faded out of view. At this point, I went into the house to get my 30-year-old daughter. She came outside and we both saw the contrail still clearly visible in the sky. The trail was slowly fanning out. However, we could both see that the trail started and ended abruptly. We took digital photos of the contrail, which show that it was above the clouds.  After taking the photos, I called my husband -- an ex-Air Force pilot -- to tell him about the object. He had no idea what it was. That night, he asked me to draw a picture of the object. The next morning, at work, he showed the drawing and photos of the contrail to his ex-fighter pilot buddies. None of them knew what it was, but all of them said it looked like a missile. They had no idea what kind of missile, but it must've been huge based on its altitude.

The objects disappeared behind a layer of high cirrus to the south.  The objects were not exactly spheres of light.  They had a bright-white central pinpoint of light surrounded by a thin faint white halo that seemed to scintillate just slightly.  The halos were probably less than half a pinky fingernail in diameter.  Couldn't get the 12X binocs on the objects quick enough to get a bead on them.  While I was watching the two objects pass overhead, they moved closer to one another and one changed course about ten degrees and veered away from the other after closest approach.  The objects were not travelling at the same speed.  The one that made the quick and abrupt course change seemed like it was playing catch up with the other.  It was just abeam its twin when it made the sudden course change and then accelerated slightly ahead of the one that maintained a more or less steady course and speed.

Planes have two blinking lights on their wings (one green one red) and one on the tail.  They appeared to be about 400-500ft in the air and about 35 degrees with respect to the ground.  They also appeared to be very small spherical objects.  The 4 equidistant objects were in a straight line which appeared to increase in altitude from left to right.

While driving home from work early 11-25 at approx 3:30 am PDT, it was partly cloudy with patchy fog that was illuminated by a nearly full moon. I was driving westbound on I-80 freeway and turned off at Truxel Rd and was turning south (left turn), heading back over the freeway. When I straightened out the wheel, from the direction I just came from, I noticed a very bright unusual looking whitish amber colored light up in the sky. I estimate it was maybe 400 to 500 ft up. at about 35 degrees up from the horizon. At about a distance of a mile or so yet down the freeway. My first thought was its just a helicopter flying low over the freeway. Then I looked for the usual blinking marker lights around the big light which didn't look like anything I've seen on a helicopter before. That's when things didn't add up in my estimations of distance and speed and relative size of a chopper. I could pretty much see that the light was too large for a helicopter at that distance and it was closing fast. The light itself was not the usual bright spot light, with its search light spot ray pointing downward. More like it was the entire craft itself. I remembered I had my digital camera with me and realized I could take a picture of this thing. It was in its case and I become really excited as I fumbled with the bag losing precious seconds trying to negotiate a moving vehicle and open my camera case at the same time. I slowed down to maybe 10 mph from about the 20mph that I was up to crossing the overpass. By the time I got my camera out and rolled down my window so as to not get flash reflection, it had caught up to me, I stuck my camera out the window, turned it back behind me and up. I immediately saw the bright light in the view finder screen. Holding the camera with both hands and trying to keep it still I pressed the button but the flash didn't go off as I expected so I just thought it 'misfired' and I pressed again. Neither time did I get a flash. I must have batteries too weak to fire the flash on my camera I thought and then it dawned on me that I didn't hear anything like a helicopter. This thing made No Sound! Then when I got home I pressed ""review"" on my camera and to my surprise it started playing back a video of what I saw and was trying to take a picture of. I had inadvertently captured 3 seconds of it in two very short movies of it. It turns out In my haste to get a picture I must have turned the mode selector button on my Kodak CX7300 past ""camera"" one notch to ""Video"" mode.  Although the video is shaky and brief you can slow it down in Quicktime by manually dragging the playback head back and forth to see the light's path overhead relative to tiny more stationary lights below it. I counted a total 22 frames of the object spread out over two seperate clips in a timeframe of 2.5 to 3 seconds. I actually saw it for almost 30 seconds total.

I was returning home from a Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's family house. That friend was driving while I rode in the passenger seat, looking out the window and just checking out the passing landscape while we talked.  We were northbound on Interstate 15 at about 11:30pm. Just before we headed up the hill towards the city of Escondido, California, I spotted an orange light in the sky above the mountains. The reason it caught my eye is becaiuse the night sky was cloudy and the clouds were actually fairly low. So, I knew this light had to be very close to the ground. I looked at the horizon and quickly tried to determine whether or not what I was seeing was actually on a mountain or hillside on the horizon. As cloudy as it was, the light pollution was bright enough to darken the horizon and I could tell that this light was indeed in the sky.  Next, I tried to see if it was moving. At first, I couldn't tell because it was so far away. It could have been stationary, but after a few moments, not only could I tell that it was moving, I could tell that it was flying to the East. It appeared to be over State Highway 78.  The light seemed to slow and get brighter. It seemed to pick up speed, but I knew it may have been flying at the same speed, just now it seemed faster because it was actually coming our way. So, for this report, I wouldn't say it changed speed. I think it stayed pretty constant. As it got closer, I peered out the passenger window, as it was now off to the right side of the highway we were on.  I noted something strange. The light wasn't flying back West. I would have expected that if it were a plane coming in to land at a local airport. I live in this area and I know that there's a flight path leading back towards Palomar Airport. Planes sometimes circle over this area a take a Southwest bound approach towards the airport in Carlsbad, California. If a plane was making it's approach, the light should have cut back to the left and soon I should have spotted other lights. I should have seen a red or a green light, maybe a flashing light. I didn't. All I saw was a single orange light.  The light flew directly South along the I-15 now, just off to the Eastern side of the highway. I watched it first out the right side of the windshield, and then out the passenger window. It wasn't over the highway, but close enough to it that it was about to pass us directly overhead in a few moments.  My next thought was that this must be a police helicopter. I'm used to seeing a single red or a blue light, but not just a single orange one, so I tried to peer up at it as it passed overhead to see if I could make out a dark shadow of the craft's shape.  It was also as it approached that I was able to tell that it was flying really low and at a good rate of speed. I compared it to the traffic coming at us in the opposing lanes, all the traffic traveling southbound along the I-15 on the other side of the center divide. The light seemed to be moving just as fast, if not just a tick faster. So, I'd say somewhere bewteen 60-90mph.  It passed right by us and almost directly overhead. It passed a few blocks East of our position on the highway. With the low clouds and enough light pollution from the city of Escondido to make the clouds almost glow, I should have been able to make out a vague shadow of a craft attached to that light. We were definitely close enough now.  I could not. The light wasn't that bright, but even as low as the light was... that's all that appeared to be there. It was just a single orange ball of light up in the air.  I looked back over my shoulder as we passed the local ice arena. I couldn't believe what I just saw. I should have been able to see the shape of something, but all that I could see was a single orange light. I can't explain how I was able to tell that it was low, other than this. There's just something about the way you look at an object in the sky and if the background behind moves fast, then you know it's close. If it moves as slow or seems to hang with the background, it might be that far away. This light was moving by us, but there was enough of a contrast between it and the low clouds above it that I could tell it was fairly low.  My guess... I would say this was just 3 to 4 times above tree top level.  I don't know where it was going, but we were getting onto the 78 at this point and I no longer saw it behind us as the landscape soon obscured my line of sight with the light. I wonder how many other people may have seen it. I wonder if it had sound. I was traveling in a vehicle on the highway, so I have no way of knowing. The trouble is it really didn't stand out too much. The light wasn't very bright. It was about as bright as you'd expect for a normal navigation light on a plane.  Probably the only reason I saw it was because I try to be more observant of these things now. I've already had a couple of UFO sightings before. This wasn't the most specatular, but the fact that this was just a single light, with no apparent craft attached to it, was strange enough for me to post this here tonight.",2004-12-03T00:00:00,,

I was very big in size and was lighted up.  I asked her to look at it and take a picture.  But the picture we took came out blurry.  The event lasted maybe 30 to 45 seconds.

I was walking to my car on my lunch break (I work 2nd shift) and I happened to look up at the moon. The clouds were moving off the moon and I saw what looked like lights or delierately moving pieces of light that had cloud around them. At first they were coming from the dark of the sky towards the light of the moon the lights would collide and go off in 4 different directions. As I watched I noticed they weren't generated from a ground source because there was no trail to the ground. I noticed that the lights moved deliberately but not always in the same pattern sometimes three of the lights would come together and the 4th would come just after. I called back into my office and asked two friends to come down and look at this. As I waited the lights started to fade away becoming less distinct and the pattern of their movement became more erratic. My two friends arrived to see a little of what I saw. They saw that the objects didn't have a ground trail like a search light would and they saw the lights moving in patterns but as we all stood there the lights disappeared.,2004-12-03T00:00:00,38.21121446765155,-85.68918456444217

We own 7 acres of land. We live in rural Victoria with our whole family. As me and my young brother and father were walking through our land on the 9th of April on a Friday night we seen an object floating in the sky. At the beginning we dismissed it as being a helicopter but as it drew closer we grew with fear that it might be an unidentified flying object. The object was coming closer. It was probably first at 12,000 feet above but we started fearing when it dropped quickly to about 7,000 feet. The object which looked like a triangle with three bright balls in each corner was resonating a bright light from all three corners. We got very scared and ran to our home in shock and disbelief but we also kept watching it to see what it was doing. We will never forget what happened for the rest of our lives. The Triangle object then dropped in altitude to about 3000 feet then 2000 feet. It was getting closer the ground.  My mother immeditly called the local police and told what was happening. The police skeptically agreed to come to our residence to see what was going on due to the fear that they could hear in my mothers voice.  In disbelief we watched the object. My mather and sister were crying as my father and brother and me watched as the object vertically dropped to about 1000 feet. It then navigated for a couple of minutes around the sky brightening the fields. The object then started moving right, then it travelled directly up into the sky - then it camoflaged into a star in the sky. It was the most shocking and emotionally disturbing experience that our family experienced. We do not suffer from a family with mental health issues.  The police arrived five minutes after the triangular object left vanishing vertically into the sky. We told them everything what had happened in exact detail. The police were very skeptical but told us to contact the Australia Government at http://www.defence.gov.au/ We contacted them and we are awaiting to recieve a response.  The sighiting has changed our lives forever, and we have been looking for groups to discuss what we have experienced but in this rural area where we live we cannot find anything.

This was a very bright light above, well above, the tree tops, possibly 1-5 miles distant.  I'd say it was about half the size of a dime held at arm's length.  Far too  bright to be a star, it caught my attention immediately as I was taking the dog out in the yard.  My exact reaction was ""What the hell?""  I moved around the yard, watching it in relation to trees, poles, etc., and could see that it was bobbing and weaving gently (rocking motion).  I planted my feet firmly and studied it in relation to stars, and it was the only thing moving.  I finally went into the house and told my wife, ""I know you're not going to believe this, but there's a UFO out the back.""  She said, ""Sure, Sure.""  I asked her to come look, and she said, ""I cannot even believe I'm getting up for this.""  But as we got out back, she watched it for a bit and admitted she couldn't really say what it was.  I went in and got a small digital camera and snapped a few pictures of it.  The best shows a round object with 'spiral arms' of light coming off it.  I also took a brief 'movie' but have not had a chance to put it on the computer.  On the camera, it appears blank.  About 15 mins later, my wife and I left to pick up our daughter from a dance.  I said, ""Well, if it IS a star or planet, it will be there when we get back.  If it's gone, we'll know it was something else.""  We returned by 11:15 and it was no where in the sky.  I climbed the high back porch on our house and scanned the entire horizon and there was nothing.  If this had been a star or planet, it could not have 'gone down' in such a brief span of time.  I'm a meteorologist, and habitually study the sky.  I feel I'm a pretty good observer.  I couldn't call this a 'flying saucer' but it was certainly something airborne that was not identifiable as anything conventional. I will submit the pictures via email as soon as I can get them transferred to the computer.",2004-04-27T00:00:00,46.31271111111111,-119.30846044444444

December 8th from the porch of our beachhouse, our first sighting occurred at about 7:30 PM just below and to the right of the belt of the constellation Orion, probably about 20 degrees above the horizon.  There were three orange lights aligned horizontally with a fourth light directly beneath the middle light. These lights seemed spherical, and larger than Mars, which is visible. They appeared for 1-2 seconds, flashed two or three more times, and  there was haze around them.  Then small blinking white strobes were visible in a large surrounding vicinity. I initially thought that these were multiple tiny aircraft, but it became evident that no small aircraft could follow such erratic courses. It was obvious that a few grouped together, flew off to the right, and then returned. About this time i called for my daughter to come look, because she said she had seen an orange light driving home one night.  We observed a plane liftoff over the ocean from the local airport, heading North, and a few moments after it turned, the lights reappeared, but with different formations. The first to appear was a line of approximately 3 orange lights, which quickly faded, giving way to a similar shape which immediately appeared about 5 degrees below and to the left, and soon accompanied by another similar construction of lights. After these faded away, there were about five or six strobes visible to the naked eye. They had no obvious destination or pattern until some began to closely group together and gravitate towards the center of Orion.  At first I thought they were afterburners, then maybe engines that had caught on fire, but realized that the configuration was wrong.  The tiny strobes made me think that it might be a prank, and that the strobes were small aircraft until we noticed the erratic pattern.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,,

While driving in our small city at very near 4:15 PM (MST)we noticed a bright red object in the sky. It appeared to be moving at high speed although we later debated the speed of the craft at some length. One of us thought that it was moving slowly and for a period was stopped, another thought that it moved at extemely high speed. One thought that it changed directions a number of times. We are confused about the sighting.  It was very bright, and the only object in the sky. It was roundish in shape but probably oval would be more accurate. It seemed big. It was clearly red in colour.  There were no other colours present. Just a steady red glowing light. This was what made it stand out so clearly. It was nearly time for the sun to go down, and the sky was white. Here the night hours start very early due to the location on the globe. The sun was down but there was still light in the sky.  This object was not the northern lights, a star, the sun, a planet, a meteor or anything else we have seen before. Other people saw this object while stopped at one of the main intersections near the hospital and Wal-mart. We could see them looking at the object from their vehicles as well.  The object appeared, from our location, to be right over the main part of the city, and then moved off over Great Slave Lake. We were driving at the time, on our way to the vets to pick up a dog, and when we came out of the vet clinic the object was gone, but the night sky was still bright enough to see that it was gone. It was no star. It moved deliberatly.  It was interesting, but we were not terribly upset or frightened.

I remember looking directly across from where I was standing on the hill and seeing an object there above the church steeple. It was a clear day with a bright blue sky. The object stayed there for about a minute, so I remember it well. It looked like two white dinner plates,one upside down on top of the other, which gave it a saucer-shape. As I was staring at it, the craft seemed to just fade out, as though it were moving away very rapidly, then it was gone. There were other children on the lawn whom I am quite sure saw it, too..but my memory isn't too clear on that.

My mother was watching my younger brothers 3 and 2 in the house. We lived Route 30 West about 6 miles outside of Gettysburg, near Belmont Rd. Often I was let out of the house to play in this foot-high weedy grass field and I played alone. I could see the house but I was 25' away from the house. I remember sitting in the grass then something picked me up by my arm and dragged me thru the grass. This being was in a solid shiny material and I believe it was charcoal grey. This being had no feelings for my being dragged over the ground. It flew across the ground. I saw a cigar shaped metallic grey craft positioned on the ground below the hill. The field has a slope and this meant the craft would not be seen from Belmont or Rte 30 West. I was terrified. A being in a buff colored tight outfit came up from the center of the craft, as up a ladder, to meet us. I was hauled inside where they put me on a table. I remember struggling to get away and being so afraid. Painful probes were put inside my nose and mouth. Weeks later I had pain in my lower abdomen and would experience pain every time I breathed. I remember thinking that they were communicating without talking which I now know is telepathically.  They had no feelings, ice-cold machinelike qualities which terrified me. I didn't remember ears or hair like we have and I think with hypnosis I might be able to recall more about them. I couldn't sleep well for weeks. In Sunday school I remembered that angels flew and I thought I was being hurt by angels. I couldn't tell my parents because I had not the language to describe this and I was terrified to relive this experience.  Also, I played an angel in my grandmother's church for a Christmas play and decided that I could never burst my parents' belief about angels being bad.  I remember thinking that I was going to die as they worked on me with metal and tubes and painful implements. At one point I think I went into shock. When I came to, at one point, I was levitated in the air about 5' off a table. There were these beings sitting around the table looking up at me.  I think they were examining my genitals and reproductive organs. During the time I entered the craft I could not speak. It was if I was paralyzed. Later I remember thinking that time had stopped and I wondered how they could have done that. I believe that the craft was moving at some point and I was placed against a wall in an upright position. I can't remember much else but when I was able to go home from the field my legs and arms were badly bruised.  I had missed lunch but my mother thought that I was not hungry as I often came home on my own. I'm not sure if she thought I may have gone up to the neighbor's house (they let us play in their field) and got food there which sometimes I did. I believe that I was gone more than was revealed by earth time.My father came home and saw me.  He was very upset and accused my mother of abusing me.  I was taken to a physician the next day for an exam. The local practitioner believed that I was showing the sudden bruising signs of leukemia.  I kept assuring my dad and mom that nothing was wrong and that mom hadn't hurt me.  I never told them about the ""angels.""  To this day only my husband and children know about my abduction.  Exploratory surgery was performed on me soon after and bone marrow was taken from both my right thigh and my left kneecap.  The findings were negative. When I was in my 20's an unpaid psychic approached me in FL where I was living at the time. She explained that I had indeed been abducted by aliens and that I am still being monitored by them.

I suddenly spotted a large disc high up in the sky. It was about the quivelent size of a dime...at arms length, and was a bit duller in color...like aluminum....and totally soundless. I estimated it's altitude later to be at or above about 10,000 feet, because commercial jet traffic enroute to JFK were flying below it. I distinctly remember watching a four-engined Boeing glide well below it, and noting that the object (which was hanging stationary in the sky above it) was nearly half it's size. I became immediately intrigued with the concept of what it could be, a balloon perhaps?...no..it didnt move like a balloon in the wind should....a planet in daylight?...no, didnt make sense  because it was too large, and definately looked like it had metallic structure to it...and I called out to Dad and Grandpa on the roof to take a good look up at it. After studying it, admittedly very perplexed , for a while...my Dad, suddenly blurted out that it had to be ""one of them there damned ufo's that everybody's been talking about""!.....Granddad said nothing,, as I seem to recall, I think he was just totally confused by the sight,,as was I. We watched that object remain airborne above the jet traffic for nearly an hour, them were distracted long enough to recall that when we finally looked for it again, it was gone.

Have been silent ever since.  Friday, Sept 28, 1973, came off the Ohio Turnpike exit at route 42 in Strongsville, Ohio. Noted looking south in traversing the long circular exit ramp, that there was an aircraft descending. Thought that very unusual. I was a trained US Customs Officer, familiar with all types of aircraft and helicopters....this one mystified me....and what was it doing in this place?...then a semi rural suburban area of Cleveland. As I got to the bottom of the ramp, saw though my driver's side window that the object was about 500 feet in the air, and had a circular bottom. Turned right onto route 42, Pearl Rd. The object passed overhead. It was then about 100 feet up. No sound emitted from it. I was behind it, moving about 35mph and it was still descending and moving not much faster than my car. Then at the intersection of Webster rd. and Pearl rd., it stopped and hovered over the intersection, in front of me. I came up to the crossroad and stopped for the red signal. The object was in front of me and hung in the air about 25 feet up. I estimated the diameter of its base at 30 feet and it was bell shaped, about 15 feet tall...the top of it like a dome. It's color was like gray gunmetal. It had no visible apertures or openings on it, nor any identification symbols. It rather scared me that this thing was stopped in front of me. My radio was crackling badly and unintelligible. Two cars had come up behind me and both had pulled to the side of the road. I pulled over too as I did not to go under it. I pulled over, got out of the passenger side of my car and looked up.... but THE OBJECT WAS GONE-VANISHED!!!! WAS Dumbfounded. The two cars that had been behind me were also gone. Thought I must have hallucinated. Felt nauseated and sick. Got back in my car and drove another 10 minutes or so home.  My family was put out with me that I had missed dinner and was an hour late. Was shocked at that. Went out to my car and looked at the clock which read 5 minutes after seven. My usual trip home from Akron, normally an hour's drive, had taken 2 hours. I could never explain where that hour went. There were subsequent events in my life that proved strange and not explicable, but my purpose here is just to report what I saw, and let it go at that.

July 31, 1984, I know date because I'd just left my parents' house in Newtown after watching CBS's ""60 Minutes"" with Mom & Dad, and a movie...10 pm...I passed exit 16, the sky was misty & rainy ... rounded a curve, saw a bright light coming in from my right (directly over the airport, heading east with me and descending fast)...it came over some trees, I saw it thru the windshield. My first thought: airplane about to circle around and go to the airport. It crossed my windshield as I started up a 25-degree grade toward the South St. bridge, a large Arch Bridge over 84 with a police tower adjacent to the bridge. As I was driving toward the bridge, the object ""Stopped instantly on a dime"" directly over the bridge, in front of me. For 1 second, my thought was ""oh! a VTOL (Vertical Take-Off or Landing Aircraft....Jets used usually on ships in the Navy)then after 1 second, I instantly realized it was a UFO! I was driving right AT IT! My heart came up into my mouth, as I realized I had seconds to decide if I could turn around, but the median there wouldn't allow it, I would've gotten stuck. I then decided to ""floor it"" and go right under it. Then I decided this might be the only time I might ever see one, so I forced myself to pull over. I watched it for 15 mins. It was about double the size of a 2-story house. It appeared to me to be shaped like a tetrahedron, with one upper side cut out of it. Many lights, different colors, all over it, about 20 lights, looked like typical Christmas tree lights, including purple, yellow, red, blue, green, white. As I pulled over, it was perfectly still over the bridge, was VERY low, and after a few mins it moved over very slowly to the tower and hovered there. I felt like I was DEFINITELY being watched, and was totally terrified. My body was violently shaking like I was cold, it was hard to control my shaking. The ter! m ""deer in headlights"" crossed my mind. I saw cars and trucks going by, and I have a photograph in my head of a split second shot of two people going by me at 60 m.p.h. and looking up at the UFO. The object was so low, I had the feeling that if I had a baseball, I ""just about"" could have hit it. Definitely could have with a sling-shot. The object was rotating slowly, and I unrolled my window. All I heard was crickets when there were no cars. I had a 1-Million candle-light power super flashlight plugged into my cigarette lighter, next to my right knee on the passengers' side floor and it crossed my mind to fire a light on this thing, and I ""just could not"" get up the will to do it, I started shaking more just thinking about it. I was cursing myself for not having my camera bag, I am a photographer - hobbyist, and usually carry it with me. I could see what appeared to be a large ""hole"" in the darkness behind the lights, and a definite grill-work pattern with pipes and such along the bottom, and smooth sides, but it was hard to see from the brightness. I remember being amazed thinking ""this was NOT made on this planet!"" The object very slowly moved away from the tower, traveling directly over 84 West opposite me, then after passing me picked up speed. I didn't move at first. I looked into my rear-view mirror, saw it, then carefully opened the door, stood up and put my elbow on the car roof, and watched it disappear over the horizon toward Southbury and Newtown. I then drove down the hill to exit 17, called my parents and I remember waking my Dad. I told him what I'd seen, we discussed it for a few mins., then I went home to my Waterbury apartment. I sat down in the dark at my kitchen table, looked out the window, watched the light from Waterbury coming in the window ....and sort of daydreamed about the whole incident for a bit...then I looked at my watch and it was 3:30 am !! I do not know if I had a missing time episode or not. I did call Oxford airport, but I don't recall if it was that night or the next ! morning. My Father is now deceased, so I can't ask if he remembers what time I called him. My Mother does not remember the episode...I don't know if she woke up or not when I called.

I have been involved with amatuer astronomy for 40 years, and am a member of the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers. Having observed the sky for that length of time, I am fully aware of those objects and natural phenomenon that are often misreported as UFOs by observers who are unfamiliar with the sky...ie objects such as Venus, Iridium flares, sundogs, balloons, meteors etc. On several occasions over those 40 years I have observed objects in the sky that I could not identify. A few years back, while observing the First Quarter moon in a 90mm refractor, I noticed a tiny object subtending about 5 arc sec transit the moon from E to W in about 30 seconds. The object was dark and well defined as oval shaped. As the object moved it was clearly seen to be changing shape slightly. My guess is that the object was probably a high altitude research balloon that was partially deflated, being pushed along by the jetstream. I mention this observation to illustrate that I am not the type of observer that is quick to label any unknown object a ""UFO"". However, there is one observation that I made on May 17 of 1988 from my backyard on Chicago's NW side, that I would definately classify as a ""UFO"". At the time I was scanning the western sky with 10x50 binoculars, attempting to locate the planet Mercury, in preparation to an observing run using my 8 inch Newtonian. While scanning in the lower Western sky, a small dark boomerang shaped object came into the field of view of the binocs. The arms of the V were inverted toward the horizon and the object was seen to yaw slightly. I immediately thought the object was a kite that some kid a few blocks away was flying, and didn't pay any attention to it, and continued scanning for the illusive planet. After a few minutes I located the planet, and prepared to swing the telescope toward it when I noticed that the ""kite"" had moved to a considerably higher elevation above the western horizon, and could in fact be clearly seen to be moving without optical aid. The V shape was still clearly visable in the binoculars, but not with naked eye. At this time I became curious about what the object could be, so I and went indoors to retreive a 60mm altazimuth refractor, since the 8 inch equatorial Newtonian would be to clumsy and difficult to use for tracking a moving object. I was able to aquire the object in the field of the scope at 28x and 78x. Let me just say that it wasn't a kite or any object I have ever seen or can explain. It had a tubular cross section almost worm-like in appearance. It was an odd flat blackish color that I can only describe as ash-like. I could also percieve faint reddish linaments encircling the body like the segmented sections of a worms body. The object filled about 1/4th of the field of view of the telescope eyepiece at 78x or an actual angular size of about 8.5 minutes of arc. The object continued climbing to a higher elevation until it passed overhead in a southeastern direction. While the object was climbing in the sky it passed about 1 1/2 degrees above the planet Venus, which was hig! h in the west. I lost sight of the object in the darkening dusk sky after about 15 minutes of observation. When last seen it was still headed in a SE direction about 25 degrees from zenith. When the object was overhead it took about 2 1/2 seconds to cross the 78x field of view of the stationary telescope, or a rate of movement for the object of about 14 minutes of arc per second. In addition to myself, my son and sister in law witnessed the object. I am probably going out on a limb even mentioning this observation, as I realize the subject of ""UFOs"" leaves one open to ridicule because of the fair number of wackos that get all the attention in the media. Hence credible witnesses to unexplained phenomenon tend to keep it to themselves. According to the debunkers ,few amatuer astonomers report UFO's because they know what they are seeing. This may be true. Most UFO reports are explainable as known objects that are misidentified by inexperienced observers. By definition this is not a ufo but an identifiable object.The small number of really baffling cases are often times reported by trained observers. These are the cases that should be scientifically investigated, rather than merely lumped in with ""Cosmic Nonsence"" by the debunkers. Amatuer astronomers DO see UFO,s, and I know I am not alone in this.",2004-04-09T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

The area is farmed out but is also generally wooded near the Blanco Bend River. Between 10:00 and 10:30pm on the aforementioned date, ((name #2 deleted)) was walking home from a nearby fast food restaurant. He was aware of the time because he had just gotten a new watch recently and was looking at it frequently. It was a quiet, dark and very cool evening with clear skies and bright stars. The new moon occurred on this night so the sky was moonless. ((name #2 deleted)) happened to look skyward in order to observe some of the constellations, ""And there it was!"", he said. His first thought was, What the hell is THAT?"" He was not afraid, he said, but was amazed. He had considered himself to be sceptical about UFO's, so the experience was impressive and highly elating.   The object was triangular in shape, but it was as if the points of the triangle had been cut off. The cut was perpendicular to the bisection of the anglefor the leading apex, and the other two points were either cut the same as the leading apex or cut perpendicular to the trailing edge of the UFO. ((name #2 deleted)) raised his armto an angle of about 60° as an indication of the initial zenith angle relative to him. He could see only the underside surface of the object and it was glowing faintly orange over it's entirety, like very hot metal.There were no lights and no visible protuberances, but ((name #2 deleted)) did appear to notice what appeared to be geometric shapes on the surface, formed with straight lines. He believes that these were part of the objects structure, rather than decals (painted). He said that the object was ""remarkably similar"" to those depicted in the ""Unsolved Mysteries"" segment on Belgium UFO's. ((name #2)) aproximated the arms-length size of the object to be 4""-4.5"" (or 10-12 times the size of a full moon). He guessed that the object must have been over 1000 feet away, but then indicated that he was not too good with scales or distances. The vehicle was moving very slowly and in a straight line from south to north (from his right to his left) perpendicular to his walking direction. There was no sound of any kind from the vehicle or otherwise-including no dogs barking. (Any dogs barking would probably have been due to the presence of the object.) He was so taken by the once sighting that he never once gave thought to the possibility that other such objects may have been in the area. ((name #2)) said that he must have watched the object for ten minutes before it passed out of site behind the trees. It never changed speed, direction or altitude during that time. After the object disappeared from view, ((name #2)) continued to stand and look for several minutes, totally awestruck by the experience. Immediately upon returning home, ((name #2)) called the Hays County Sheriff's Department and reported the sighting. The Dispatcher told him that THERE HAD BEEN OTHER CALLS REGARDING A UFO SIGHTING THAT VERY EVENING! Later, early Monday morning, ((name #2)) called a local Austin FM Radio Station and told a DJ friend of his sighting. After watching the NBC Network's UNSOLVED MYSTERIES program on the Belium UFO's during the late fall of 1991, ((name #2)) called their 800 number and reported his sighting.  In March Of 1992, ((name #2)) called an Austin ************** group who referred him to someone named ((name #3)) (doesn't remember last name). ((name #3)) pointed ((namd #2)) to some woman (name not remembered) who referred him to Austin MUFON. On March 23, 1992, ((name #2)) called Austin MUFON and told Mrs. ***** ****** of his sighting. ((name #4)) provided an outline of the sighting to me on March 28, 1992 at a regular MUFON meeting. Scott also called the Hays County Sheriff's Department to get more information on the UFO sighting. He was told that they had no record of his report or any other report of the UFO. On May, 25, 1992 at 2:00pm CST, I met with name #2)) at his residence and received his report.",2004-04-09T00:00:00,30.0279,-98.1179

Directly above my bed are three windows with 12""x""12 glass panels. The television was to the left of my bed. Suddenly, my attention was drawn to the floor approximately four feet from the desk my television was on. What I saw was a beam moving very quickly in small circles in one concentrated spot on my floor. The circle motions it made were not perfect, the best I can describe them as were ""wobbly circles"". The beam was solid, pure solid light and approximately an inch wide...it was fairly thin. The color was a pure white with somewhat of a blueish tinge around the outside of the beam. The beam itself was bright, but did not seem to emit any light beyond its edges. My room was NOT filled with light, only this beam. I was able to watch for about 5 seconds before I fled my room in a state of total panic. I was not able to tell exactly which of the three windows the beam was aimed through, but assuming that had it beamed straight into my room onto the wall parallel it would be 90 degrees, I would estimate that it hit my floor at a diagonal angle of about 60 degrees. When I got downstairs, I looked outside to see any evidence of a craft (I have never to my knowledge witnessed a UFO) and there was none. There were no aircraft of any kind besides high-flying commercial planes. I did not tell anyone in my house about what I had seen. I wasn't sure if my mind was playing tricks on me or what had actually happened, but I saw something. When I checked the area later, there was no evidence whatesoever of the beam having ever touched my floor. Two days later, on November 3, 2004, I witnessed one more anomalous event which I believe may be connected, and this time my younger brother was also witness. A PITCH black figure, which appeared to be two dimentional, in a very humanoid form quickly passed across a window and wall which were directly in front of where we were sitting, about 12 feet away. The figure had NO discernable features in its face, no clothing, no hair. Just a round head and human like torso were all we were able to make out. It was impossible to make a height estimate. It was for certain INSIDE our house, not a reflection from outside. The sighting of this ""being"" lasted 3-4 seconds. There was no logical explaination for what we saw, it was most certainly paranormal. I have seen a figure like that once before and I am certain it was of the same nature.

It was an extremely loud, very high-pitched whoop, whoop, whoop sound...very rapid and very squeal or beep-like. We thing about 80 or 90 decibels. The sound was accompanied by chaotic bright white flashing lights.  The object flew over extremely fast...I jumped out of bed and ran outside - hoping to get a glimpse, but it was already gone...just a residual sound in the distance.

The sky, then, was unusually clear (meaning that any stars were visible at all; I certainly couldn't see anything in the sky dimmer than major stars, e.g. satellites).  I noticed a hovering red light in the distance -- a helicopter, maybe a plane.  Then, two points of light entered my field of view almost directly overhead, travelling from west to east.  My first thought was military aircraft, because the points, which were yellow, were travelling in tandem with a constant distance between them.  Then the points of light veered away from each other somewhat before coming back together, essentially flying two gentle arcs before returning to their previous arrangement.  I realized, as the lights vanished (not exactly over the horizon, but out of view), that they were travelling far faster than aircraft.  That's it.  I'm writing this because the lights seemed unusual; I'm certainly not conviced I saw UFOs.

They were traveling side by side at an in determinate distance away from each other, (possably 200 to 500 feet. estimated guess only) They did not display any lights but the entire craft exterior glowed in a vibrant, almost luminessant sorange. they moved in a westery direction accross the night sky, originating in the area of Ursa Major, at a relativly slow speed for about 3 minits. then they both stopped and appeared to honer in the same spot for at least 1 more minit + and then appeared to shoot directly up to leave the atmosphere in a approximately 70 degree angle in an in determinate speed... they were amazingly fast...leaving 2 streaks of light accross the sky(1 from each craft). these were the only trails of light left behind and only stayed there for a very short second.

This is my second report to your center and it is not an isolated siting for me.  I awoke at 5:00 am on Wednesday, July 29, 2004.  I observed the large bright orb in the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains that I have been observing over the past several days.  It only appears sometime between 3:00 and 5:00 am.  (I get up frequently throughout the night and I always look to see if it is there and it never is in site before 3:00 am.)At this time I also observed 2 colored orbs that pulsated colors of green, red, and blue.  They were very visable through  my binoculars and they appeared to be circular or saucer shape.  I lowered my binoculars and watched the sky, from the bright light orb shot a colored orb.  I woke up my husband, who isn't as absorbed in these sitings as I am, after I saw the colored orb shoot from the bright object, he came and looked through the binoculars and saw the colored orbs as well.  I continued to watch the sky and as I did, 3 more orbs approached (smaller than the two already in sight) and lined up vertically between the two larger colored orbs.  As I watched, the large white orb slowly ascended higher into the sky as well as the colored orbs.  I know they are ascending slowly because the mountains are my scale, they appear initially just over the mountain and as the hour goes by, they slowly ascend upwards until they disappear into the sky.  I think that what I am witnessing is very unusual and warrents further investigation from someone.  Will someone please get a hold of me?  The other part of this sighting is the bright light orb that appears in the western sky over the San Jacinto Mountains in the evening prior to the morning that it appears over the mountains in the eastern.  It always begins to appear around 8-8:30 pm and slowly desends over the mountain until it disappears behind the mountain range.  It takes about an hour for it to descend and dip below the range of my view. (The last report that I submitted I mentioned the Santa Rosa Mountains, my husband corrected me indicating that it is all the San Jacinto Mountain range that encompasses the valley where we live.)  My husband observes the bright object as well and agrees that it is very unusual and it does move slowly.  What the heck am I witnessing?????  I do not have the proper equipment to record my sightings, however, you are welcome to come and set up shop at my home so that you can record it.",2004-08-11T00:00:00,33.80016511627907,-116.53537286821705

Driving home from my friend's house on the early morning of July 29th, I saw a light in the sky. I thought that it might just be a planet that had come close to earth's orbit, since it was so big and colored kind of red like mars, but it was flickering. I slowed down to get a good look at it, but then I realized the object was moving! I really slowed down and pulled off to the side of the road where I sat and watched the object slowly float over me. I sat there trying to figure out what the object was exactly, as it really looked like someone lit a campfire and sent it into the air. The strange thing was that I could see something flapping in the wind on top of the fire. I really though that it might be a home-made hot air balloon(not one that anyone could travel in, more like the type where you get a large sack and light a fire under it and attach the fire in some sort of way. As the heat rises beneath the sack from the fire, the object begins to float and rises away), but the object was getting higher and higher and not running out of fuel. The object was about 1000 feet into the air when I first saw it. I got back in my car and drove home (less than 2 minutes away), but kept an eye on the object the whole way home. I pulled into my driveway and watched it. By this time, the object could have been 1500-2500 feet up. Here is the rather peculiar thing about the object though-- when it was extremely high, it sort of changed shape from being a firey orb to being a sort of elongated ember looking thing. You could tell the fire was dieing down because it changed from a yellow fire to looking like red burning embers, but very bright, but then it started shooting off red sparks/glowing balls. 2 of the glowing balls shot off even more smaller balls, and all of these glowing balls flew around rapidly. I ran into my house and upstairs to watch the object. By the time I made it upstairs, I looked at the main object and it was pulsing on and off. I ran back outside to see it again, and the object had disappeared.",2004-08-11T00:00:00,47.14574063670412,-122.2924202247191

I was tying my shoes when my friend saw a shooting star which he described as being very big and very bright.He pointed in the direction at which the object disapeared behind the tree line. We then noticed a glowing starlike object peaking thru the tree line. This object then slowly hovered higher above the tree line(about 1 thumb length) and hovered there.it slowly began moving left to right , and up and down. the object was a solid glowing light and appeared to have no flashing lights that a helicopter or a plane would have.We also noticed, now that adreniline had our night vision at max, a vapour trail that my friend said was the path of the ""shooting star"" that he saw. This trail was in a spiral shape. I tried calling my friend to get him out there with his video camera because we were watching it for a half hour and at this point the obect was stationary and appeared to be going nowhere.my friend said he had no tape for his camera, so i called a girl in hamilton who i knew had a camara.she too had no film but told me she could seefrom here balcony and that it was so bright she could only stare for so long.she also told me that her cat was out on the balcony crying with itz tail between itz legs. After that we followed this object and it appeared to be slowly moving towards lake ontario, and we continued watching it as it went higher andf higher.....finally at about 7:30 am, its was broad daylight and this object could still be seen going higher and higher into the sky until it disapeared. I have friends who have seen these objects on 2 seperate ocassions but i never believed them. they too saw them at lowville park.one of them guessed what time this happened to us because he too said that his animal ran into his room crawling and crying with itz tail between itz legs at the time that it passed over the city towards the lake. we also noticed various birds flying north in v patterns away from this obeject. this has led me to believe that whatever propels these spacecraft, it must give off a high pitched sound that only animals can detect, much like a dog whistle. I also believe they can be seen thoughout the month more than once and that there is a connection to these lights and lowville park because of the numerous sightings",2004-08-11T00:00:00,43.38223451178451,-79.82626717171718

I looked through an ordinary pair of binoculars and was shocked to see what was cross-shape with may changing neon-like colors. They all seemed to glow from the center of this cross and radiate outward to all four points. I could see red to pink, blues, greens and yellow hues. Very vivid! I tried this with a total of three pair of binoculars and they all revealed the same thing. I can't say this was a craft of any kind, I have no idea what I was looking at. I didn't know if I was looking at stars - the others looked nothing like this. I was simply amazed! It was fixed for the 43 minutes I observed it until it became too light and I lost sight of it. I realized the last time I saw it that it was slighty higher than when I first took notice of it. I told a friend the next day who thought I was perhaps seeing Venus. I looked out the following morning around 4AM and looked around with my binoculars. I did see the same thing and called my friend who lives a bit Northeast from me. She did see what I described but said she thinks it is Venus.

At first I thought it was a small air craft but then it started to move to the right and then to the left then up and down. This movement happened in an area that if you held a quarter (.25 cents) at an arms length, that diameter. My observation was looking due west and up aproximately 40 degrees. I live in a rural area and it is very dark at night and there was no moon. I should also note that there was another aircraft traveling due east, the distance apart was would be 30 inches if you held out both of your arms and pointed an index finger to each object. I believe the aircraft would have been able to see the light if it were traveling in the opposite direction. The event lasted from 21:28 to 21;33 about 5 minutes(Ilooked at my wristwatch as soon as I saw the light, and when I could no longer see it). The light was bright at first then became dim and finally just went out. It did not streak off or away. I would put the light some where over eastern Connecticut although it was observed from Rhode Island. I would guess the light was 15 to 20 miles away from my observation location but it is only a guess as distance is hard to judge. I could hear the small air craft as it steadally flew in the opposite direction.

Il etait dans les alentours de Onze heure , Onze heure moins quart , quand je decida d'aller sur la terrasse exterieur pour y prendre un peu d'air !  donc je suis sur la terrasse , il est tard , il fait noir dehors ... mon attention est attirée vers les etoiles ! Elles sont belles ce soir , car la temperature a descendu de quelques degrés et cela a eu pour effet de chasser toute l'humidité dans l'air , et malgré l'eclairage des grattes-ciel , le ciel est etonnament clair .  Je continue a regarder dans les airs quelques instants , et a un moment donné je vois un corps semblable a une étoile se deplacer , en ligne droite ... Ah! me dis-je ... il doit s'agir d'un de ces petits spoutniks qui se dirige a haute altitudes et que l'on voit a l'occasion ...  Quoique etonné de voir un spoutnik filé a cette allure et dans ce ciel quand-meme eclairé de la ville , je continua a regarder les étoiles en tentant d'expliquer dans ma tete pourquoi ce spoutnik la allait si vite ... c'est vrai d'habitude un spoutnik ( ou n'importe quel satellite du meme genre ) quand on le voit c'est generalement dans un ciel noir , et ca se deplace tres lentement , mais lui il etait visible dans le ciel de montreal , et filait a la vitesse d'un avion dans les airs ...  Est-ce un avion me demandais-je ? Non impossible , un avion a cette distance la je ne le verrais meme pas , et si au contraire , il s'agissait d'un effet d'optique quelconque et qu'effectivement il aurait été plus prés de moi que je l'eu cru , j'aurais donc vue ses feux de routes vert et rouge aux extremitées des ailes ... Non ce n'etait pas un avion !  Bah ... ca doit etre un super spoutnik qui va vite finalement ... ou encore un de ces fameux ballons meteologiques qu'ont ne voit jamais , mais qu'ont entend parler a l'occasion !  je continue a regarder les étoiles , a la recherche d'une étoile filante ou d'un autre spoutnik ...  Tient me dis-je ... quel est donc cette étoile qui file a vive allure ... Une Étoile filante peut-etre ... ( je la regarde , et je la lacherai pas des yeux jusqu'au moment ou elle vas disparaitre de mon champ de vision ) , et comme elle allait disparaitre de mon champ de vision , comme ca , tout d'un coup , sans raison ... Elle change brusquement de direction ( PAF ! ) une étoile filante qui tourne dans un angle de 45 degrés comme ca ! Je continue a regarder cet evenement que je ne verrai peut-etre jamais plus , en me disant ... serait-ce un ovni ?  Ce qui semblait etre une étoile filante au tout debut , se promenait maintenant d'une facon aleatoire dans le ciel de montreal , en changeant de direction soit de facon brusque , soit d'une facon douce et courbée ... Completement atteré je continua a regarder ce phénomène extraordinaire , sans le quitter des yeux ... Car je me fous de savoir si je suis le seul a le voir , de toute facon dans ce genre de situation , quand on quitte pour avertir les gens , les phénomènes sont toujours disparues au retour ... non pas question que je manque ce spectacle ...  Toujours la tete dans les airs , mon attention est attirée pour d'autres déplacements ( d'autres ? ) Effectivement , il y en avait d'autres ... je me mis a regarder ces autres corps dans le ciel se deplacer de la meme maniere que le corps precedent , en effectuant le meme genre de virages ... j'etais dorénavant plus qu'attéré , j'etais sidéré !!!!

Un édifice comportant quatres gros projecteurs , aux quatres coins de sa structure , et projeté vers le ciel , vers un point quelconque de l'espace ! Le corps quoique haut , etait aussi visible dans ce jet de lumiere , que lorsqu'il n'y etait pas du tout ... mais c'est malgré tout a ce moment la que je remarqua quelque chose d'étrange ...  La forme de déplacant dans le ciel , et qui passa au travers de l'énorme jet de lumiere , me donnait le meme impression que si c'etait un oiseau , mais vu d'extremement haut !!!  Un Oiseau pensais-je ? Voyons donc un oiseau , on voit ca le jour a cet distance la , jamais la nuit ... j'ai vu des chauve-souris l'autre soir qui m'ont passées a moins de 5 pieds de la tete et c'est a peine si j'avais eu le temps de les apercevoir , mais la un oiseau ?? nahhh c'est improbable me dis-je !  Quoique ce mouvement qui ressemblait de loin a un battement d'aile , aurait pu aussi etre celui d'un corps enveloppé d'une structure d'ou emanait ( peut-etre ) des tourbillons de couleurs ? A cette foutue distance je ne voyais pas assé bien ... Si j'avais emmené mon appareil photo aussi ... peut-etre qu'avec le zoom , j'aurais pu distinguer d'une facon plus nette me repetais-je !!!  Tout en ne lachant pas du regard ces formes lumineuses semblables a des étoiles se déplacer dans le ciel , sans tenir compte des lois physiques je continua a me questionner ...  De toute facon , un oiseau , ca tourne pas a 45 degrés comme sur un 10 cennes me dis-je . Comment diable un oiseau pourrait il etre aussi loin , aussi brillant , aussi rapide , aussi brusques dans ses virages ... non je n'ai jamais vu en trente ans d'ancienneté sur cette planete un oiseau effectué de tels virages ... non ce n'est definitivement pas un oiseau !!!  Et pendant mes longs questionnements , je regardais les formes partir et revenir , tourner , se suivre et se separer , et puis graduellement plus rien ... Ils etaient ailleurs , ou il etaient partis ? J'allais profiter de ce moment de tranquillité pour avertir ma conjointe ...  Quelques minutes plus tard je du revenir seul , car ma conjointe etait sur que j'etais en train d'inventer des histoires ... Je m'attendais un peu a cette reaction , car c'est jamais bien evident de dire avec certitude qu'on a vu un phenomène qui est autant peu pris au serieux , du au fait que l'homme et son esprit critique n'a pas eu souvent la chance de pouvoir analyser de facon logique de tels apparitions .  Je repris mon exploration du ciel , j'en ai vu deux autres , qui cote-a-cote , se dirigeait dans un axe qui me semblait etre sud-nord , et a mesure qu'ils avancaient , il se rapprochaient un de l'autre , un peu comme la forme d'un trapeze ... A un moment donné , plus rien ... cette fois ils etaient bien parties ...  Nous sommes finalement parti vers Onze heures trentre , pour retourner a la maison ...

Hi.  I am an avid amateur astronomer with over 12 years experience (and an attorney of 18 years experience).  On the evening of August 21, 2004, I was setting up an 8"" schmidt-cassegrain ""go to"" scope on my deck when I noticed a strikingly bright red circular light (it was slightly smaller than the size of Mars when that object was at its largest in the sky in late August 2003)just a few degrees west of Polaris.  It did not twinkle; it had a constant (to my eyes) brightness.  The light's magnitude was similar to that of Jupiter's when that object is viewed on an exceptional viewing night.  The light really caught my eye, as nothing as large and luminous as it was should have been in that portion of the sky.  The viewing conditions were excellent (e.g., no clouds whatsoever, stable atmoshpere, and even with my eyesight (and this is saying a lot) I could easily discern (without telescopic aid) the split between Mizar and Alcor in the Big Dipper's handle.  I rushed my set up of the telescope, hoping to at least see the light in the telescope's finder scope, but the red light rapidly (in just 1-2 seconds) turned white and just as quickly disappeared, before I could get my telescope on it.  I was intrigued, but figured that my eyes had just played a trick on me (you know how people confuse stars and planets for ufos!!).  As the red light I have described was no longer visible, I began my evening's observing, bouncing around between different stars and messier objects, etc.  Oddly enough, after about 30 minutes or so it occurred to me that I had not seen the lights of a single aircraft since I started the evening's viewing (that was very unusual, as I live in an area where flights out of Midway Airport are frequently overhead, and small aircraft are quite frequent, as well).  That puzzled me, but I just went back to my viewing.  Around 2330 or so, I took a break from the telescope and noticed what appeared to be the lights of an aircraft approaching from roughly northeast and heading roughly southwest - but the familiar green and red, starboard and port lights I expected to see weren't there.  Instead, there were two very well definded circular red lights that ran an equidistant, and parallel course (as near as I could tell, slightly farther apart in distance than an average airliner's running lights).  I cannot tell you what altitude those lights were at, and although they passed through a good amount of sky, they passed out of view quickly.  I heard no sounds one would ordinarily associate with aircraft of any kind when I saw any of the lights I have described in this report.  I am only sending you this report because: (i) a non-lawyer coworker who lives in Tinley Park and knows of my astronomy hobby asked me Monday morning if I had observed anything unusual in the sky Saturday evening.  When I told him I had (and without telling him about the lights I had seen), he related to me that he and his wife had seen an odd red light in hee sky Saturday night, that he had told other coworkers of he and his wife's experience, that the other coworkers thought he was nuts, and that he wanted me to verify for them that there had been an unusual odd red light in the sky Saturday night (I did); and (ii) I read the reports of equal viewing date on this site that came in from Tinley Park, Illinois, which is the town adjacent to where I live.  I would like to note that when I broke down my telescope and brought it back inside my home on Saturday evening, I did not tell my wife of nearly 30 years of the red lights I had seen, but that I did tell her about the absence of air traffic, and that I then went back outside and watched the sky for about another 30 minutes - and saw no aircraft.  Highly unusal.  I have no idea what the red lights were, or why air traffic seemed to be nonexistent (at least from my vantage point) that evening, but must say that that evening provided me with the most unusual viewing experience I have ever had.  (You may contact me at my work telephone number (see Part 2, witness contact information, submitted with this report, if you wish).  Thank you.",2004-09-01T00:00:00,41.5061,-87.737

Bright hovering lights, observed in front of some low hanging clouds. The brightest of the objects was low on NW of field of view, other objects were scattered in a sort of triangular/chevron pattern spanning from NW to SW. Would easily have been identified as stars if not for a couple of obvious problems. The brightest and 2nd brightest remained visible inside of and in front of a large cloud formation and cast a glow inside of their respective clouds (glow in front of and behind). The brightest one would grow dull to the naked eye to the point of dissapearing completely and then become as bright as a high powered flashlight pointed at the eye from perhaps a distance of yards (very hard to discribe). The @nd brightest object (when observed by binoculars) appeared to have a small faint red object fly from it at an amazing speed. This was also witnessed by 2 friends, one roused from sleep, and the other at his night job where the light pollution made it possible for him to only see the bright one. The shapes were difficult to determine as they were very indistinct. The largest reminded me of a cylinder and then at times as a trapazoidal object, the others were the same but smaller or perhaps farthur. The small faint red dot was only witnessed by myself through the binoculars.The bright object is also in the sky now (05:12 on the 25 clear sky conditions). A smaller color flashing object is also present to it's south closer to the horizon. When the object is at it's brightest it is unmistakably 3 dimensional. I live close to the border of the Miramar base and many things have been observed over the years. I am usually held to skepticism but my curiosity has made me search for some enlightenment. I have scoured the web trying to find an astronomical answer and cannot. I do not use any kinds of drugs but am an ardent night owl. I've never reported anything at all and truly believe I've seen something unusual and hope that other people can give me some insight. I have met others from this area with similar stories.

Because of two other sightings in and around Denver, I'd like to mention the following event.  I stepped outside the two-story building in which I work to take a break and checkthe weather.  I was standing in the shadow cast by the two-story building just soouth of the one I work in. (A narrow parking lot separates the builidngs).  When I looked up into an area of the sky a little west and maybe north of where the sun was, behind the building, I saw a definite cylinder or elongated white light. It was in or surrounded by some brown hazy clouds with no defiinition.  This bright white cyllinder appeared to be a plane, except that it was not moving along as it should, if it were a plane. It repeatedly disappeared and reappeared as if it might have been in this small patch of brownish haze.  Outside this hazy area were small clouds with some brilliant highlights as they reflected the nearby sun.  Not sure if during the observation period the light might have drifted sligthly southward, toward the edge of the roof which blocked my view of the sun. but it seemed to be in basically one place, which caught my attention because the smaller clearly defined clouds, unlike the slight haze, were moving northward while the light seemed to be in the same spot or slightly drifting the other way from the spot where I tried to place my initial observation.  After maybe a minute the cylindrical light finally disappeared and did not reappear and a small cloud just to the west brightened intensely from the sunlight and this bright cloud started to burn my eyes so I looked away.  Possibly the cylinder was a balloon, if they can resemble the oblong ""tailhook"" type of years ago. It's bright illuminationn was similar to the nearby small clouds.  The bright light definitely contrasted with the kind of haze in the area where it was located.  Its reappearing and disappearance would be consistent with passing through the haze, if the haze had varying thickness.  But the object appeared to be a solid because it held its definite, narrow, small cylindrical shape each time it reappeared, unlike the clouds which were larger, more round and constantly shifting shape with wisps as clouds do.  i did not contact the local FAA, as suggested when I posted s multi-person sighting over Denver a year or two ago because the FAA person I spoke too was a little rude and obviously did not want ot be bothered with questions about wind speed, cloud elevations at the time of interest.  I merely post this in case someone else happened to see this unusual bright, slender object that was above and slightly south of overhead (5 or 10 degrees) and a little west of the sun at 3:30 p.m. when viewed from Downtown Denver, about four blocks west of Broadway.  I add the sky not covered by clouds or this patch of haze surrounding the cylinder was a deep and vivid  blue on this particular afternoon.  And, thinking back, I add that the hazy kind of light brownish-gray haze in the vicinity of the cylinder was different from the dominant blue sky and the bright clouds and wisps scattered around.",2004-09-01T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

We can see like portals on the top outside of the craft through the binoculars. With the naked eye they sway from side to side. A green light or red light blinking it changes. Just a few nights ago my wife and I were in Skyline park in the desert in Susanville and we were observing them. A police car pulled up and the officer walked up to us. She asked us what we were doing and we told her and pointed out a ufo. We handed her the binoculars and she looked at it. She looks back at us with a stunned look on her face and then pulled her maglite and flashed the craft. The craft flashed back at us and it moved, the officer then looked at us and said: ""Did you guys see that it moved""! and then said again to us: ""You guys are freaking me out""! and she took off! We noticed that there will be two of these objects by the moon and the rest in a circular position in the night sky around the Susanville area. Another thing I would like to add is that the objects will black out when we try to see them in our telescope, when we look away they turn their lights back on. They dont seem to mind us looking at them through the binoculars.

On a Tuesday morning, August 24, 2004, at approximately 5:45 a.m. I was driving to work when I saw a light in the sky in the southern hemisphere. I had stopped my truck just a short distance before reaching the end of my road to adjust my seat since my son had used the truck the night before and had repositioned it for himself. This is when I first saw the light. I didn't think much of it since I see planes all the time. After adjusting my seat I continued driving a short distance (about 60 ft.) before reaching the stop sign where I'd turn left (east) to go to work. Once I stopped at the stop sign I noticed something unusual about the light...now there were about 8-10  lights real close together in a arch or 3/4 shaped shaped round pattern (there were lights inside the 'arch' too) . I thought this is weird. Then these lights went in reverse, forward, up and down and were blinking at an extremely rapid pace...or at least much faster than a plane light . The lights were blinking independent of one another..not all at the same time...each point of light about the size of a round pencil eraser and were about 30 degrees above the tree leval. They looked like they were close to the beach even though I couldn't tell for sure since a wooded area faced me. I thought ""Oh my God...what is this""?!! Then they slowly drifted below the horizon. From my position there are woods facing me just across the road where I was stopped which extend southward for about a mile or less...beyond that are subdivisions. The beach/Gulf of Mexico is only about 6 minutes south of my home and I work about 3 minutes from home. The fire station is in between my house and work. I asked one of the firemen who comes regularly in the store where I work if he'd seen these lights. He just made fun of me and laughed about me seeing an u.f.o. Funny thing is I never said it was an u.f.o....I just said they were strange lights which moved in an erratic pattern.  Now here comes an even weirder part to this scene. I had a dream just before waking up that morning about visiting my Mom in the hospital. She has been deceased since 1996. I don't recall any conversation in the dream. however I remember feeling tired in the dream and decided to lay down on the lounge chair (in the dream) that extends out to form a mini 'bed'. I was laying on my side facing the wall when I felt a hand touch the back of head. Then the hand touched my upper back. Then I felt these hands and arms scoop under my body and lift me up VERY gently. I never felt any fear. What I felt was a VERY LOVING male presence caring for me. When he lifted me up it felt as though it was completely effortless...like there was no gravity beneath me...I guess like a floating sensation even though I could still feel these arms beneath my body. Then the dream ended. I woke up, dressed for work, got in my truck and WHAM...the lights appeared!!  Mrs. ((name and contact information deleted))",2004-09-09T00:00:00,30.3749,-89.1785

Object followed a trajectory that first arched westward, then northward where it disappered around 40 degrees above the norther horizon.  Along its trajectory from south to north, the object zig-zagged, slowed down, then instantaneously resumed orginal speed several times.  Zig-zag pattern was around trajectory path from south to north.  If its path were drawn, it would look like a schematic of series electronic resistors.  Amplitude of zig-zag was about 5/16"" (width of my little finger nail) held at arm's length, and seemed to be in groups of four of five over a distance of 1 1/4"" (distance from first joint of little finger to tip) held at arm's length. The object seemed to do the zig-zag pattern, straighten out for about 1"" at arm's length, then repeat the pattern in the opposite direction.  It would then repeat this pattern.  When object slowed, zig-zag motion ceased.  Before I saw the object the witness who saw it first saw it stop a couple of times.  I did not see it stop, but I did notice it slow down about three times and resume its original speed as it passed through the ecliptic.

From our vantage point, we could see everything from the NW to the SE for as far as the eye could see, on a perfectly clear night with absolutely no overcast and a new moon.  The first object was a single orange light, straight west from the lookout.  It just appeared,midway in the sky, stayed for 10 to 15 seconds, very bright (the brightest light in the sky) and then quickly dimmed and vanished.  It reappeared maybe 10 seconds later in the same spot only to once again dim and vanish.  We then noticed a trio of orange lights to the SSW of our location, lower to the horizon, and watched them for maybe 2 minutes until they too just disappeared.  That group of 3 lights reappeared  further to the east of where it previously was, and remained in the same formation for a few more minutes until a 4th light appeared.  It was then that the first light we saw straight to the west reappeared.  Both groups of lights remained visible for several more minutes until the westward light dimmed and vanished, and the group of 4 vanished a minute after that.  The light to the west reappeared after a few minutes, followed a minute later by the group of lights, now 3 again in the same original formation... one light with another directly above it and another above and to the right of that one.  The single light vanished after a few minutes, and the trio a minute after that.  That was the last to be seen of the single westward light.  The group to the SW reappeared, in the same formation while 2 more lights appeared slightly eastward of those.  These 2 groups of lights acted exactly like the first... the westward light(s) would dim and vanish and the SW group would vanish soon after. All of these lights would pulse with brightness, and would have periods of solid brightness.  They all vanished and did not return, but now a single light would appear from the south and slowly grow brighter and slightly gain in elevation.  At the closest point (still too far to be determined), you could see colors of red, blue and green pulsating around the main white w/orange  light.  The colors could be seen with the naked eye, and confimed all that much more with binoculars.  That object would vanish and reappear several times, and even sped west to east quickly but shortly, sped back to the west and even at one time ""danced""... very quickly speeding in an abstract pattern only to vanish again.  This all took place over a course of 2 1/2 hours, beginning at 8:00pm. and when we left at 10:30, the time between sightings was getting longer.  A curious thing... when the lights would vanish, we would see lights from passing aircraft pass by the area within a half minute, and the lights would reappear when the aircraft was gone.  All in all, it was an incredible sight to watch.

My training is in cognitive psychology and I no doubt lack the background and vocabulary to describe this object in precise terms, so please bear with me.  Fortunately, my training and background  did provide me with the good sense to sketch the object immediately after seeing it.  The overall shape of the object was roughly similar to that of a crescent wrench. The end-portions were like different sized semi-circles, with the one at the nose being smaller and perhaps less 'closed' than the one aft.  The portion connecting the two crescents, or the 'handle-part' to continue the crescent-wrench metaphor, was oblong--perhaps something like a cigar, the extreme aft portion of which extended slightly into the inside of the crescent and was rounded. The end 'points' of the aft crescent seemed to have rounded objects attached or were perhaps rounded themselves as if there were engines (?) or something at those points.   I cannot estimate speed or altitude reliably.  I might hazard to guess that it was roughly the same size as a commercial jet.  It appeared to be a dull black or dark-grey colored-- not the shiny metalic surface of commercial jets.  It did seem to have a noise of some sort, but it wasn't very loud and I did not notice any visible exhaust or vapor; however, I don't recall now if the sky were overcast or not, which perhaps could mask a vapor trail (?).   If it were, it must have been below any significant amount of haze or cloud vapor because I could see it clearly.  Although it was 6:22 pm, it was still early enough to be seen easily.  I did not notice any lights.  The object moved outside of my view after a few seconds (10-15?) due to buildings around me.  What struck me as odd, was that the semi-circle or crescent on the front was opened in the direction of travel, i.e. the 'points,' if you will, of the semi-circle on the front of the 'fuselage(?),'  pointed in the direction of travel. Perhaps this is not unusual in aviation today, but it is counter-intuitive to the casual observer.  I should also note that Lawrence is about 50 miles or so south/south west of Kansas City Internationl (MCI) airport.  We are also about 100 miles east  of Ft. Riley, a military base. I assume that this is some kind of new military plane or something, but  the fact that no one else I showed my sketch to (non-military, non-aviation folks such as as myself) had ever seen one made me think I should report it.  I also did a google search and was interested in the account of the engineer from Huntsville, AL who posted on your site in June of 2003.  I was very interested in comparing my sketch to his if what I describe here is not a currently identifiable aircraft.",2004-10-27T00:00:00,39.0001002739726,-95.25458794520547

WE are a mile outside the Rock Hill, SC city limits.It was clear and there were many stars visible.  Toward the S-SE, I saw a faint blink of a light high in the sky. I watched & 10 seconds later, saw it again.  There was no sound.   I looked through my binoculars & told my husband to look in that direction & saw the blink again. Through the binoculars I could only see the light blink.  I could not see any outline of an object. Several commercial airplanes flying at high altitude flew over as we watched.  The flash seemed to be much higher than these.  I switched to my monocular nightscope & continued watching the flash, which came every 10 seconds.  Through the nightscope, I was able to see many more stars & got a fix on the flash's position based on 2 stars close by.  The light moved slightly to the East, stopped, moved to the west, then north. It made several more moves, then moved due east & out of the area with the 2 stars.  It was soon out of view because of trees & my roofline.   A minute later we saw with the naked eye, a dim object moving south to north along the same area of sky.  It moved out of sight.  Another couple of minutes later we saw a similar object moving north to south on the opposite path.  I watched it with the nightscope & it suddenly flared up very brightly & then dimmed until I could hardly see it.  It moved out of sight.  These 2 objects appeared to be satelites, except for the flare-up.  After that, we observed 3 meteors in that same area. (The Orionids are visible now) I have watched every night since & have not see it again.  The next day a high altitude plane made many Y-shaped contrails across the sky. I actually watched as it cut off the contrail to connect the Y.  This happened for 2 days in a row.  I don't know if there is a conection or not. Our Bio info is as follows: I am a 47 yr old SCUBA Instructor.  I also was in Civil Air Patrol while in high school & earned my observer wings.  I have flown in many types of aircraft & spent a lot of time on Air Force bases.  I have lived under the flight path of Charlotte Douglas International airport for 14 yrs.  I saw my first UFO with my family when I was around 10 yrs old.   My husband is a corporate exec in the IT field.  He is very analytical & tries to reason through sightings like this, but was truly stumped & a little un-nerved by this.

I got the times mixed up on the 2 objects that were a few minutes apart going in opposite directions. They were right after dark on Oct 15th. The object that blinked every 10 seconds was between 10 & 10:30 PM & there were commercial aircraft flying in the same area of sky during the sighting but the object appeared to be much higher in the sky. After reading up on satelites, I believe the 2 objects were satelites, with the one that flared being an irridium flare. The 3rd object, however, has me stumped.

I awoke my girlfriend who came out to see it, she could not make any sense of it.  After a minute or so it began to pulse; going from bright red to a faint transparent red, then back to bright red.  The glow was crisp and had a pureness to it; there was no haze or distortion at all.  I went to get the phone to call a friend to take a look at it from his location when my girlfriend called me back, the light was gone, she said that it began to flicker rapidly and that it just disappeared with no trace of movement.

This morning at about 9:00 I went outside to look for the ‘red glowing object’ again.  In the exact same spot as the night before there was a metallic silver object motionless in mid air at the exact same altitude as the object I saw the night before.  It was not moving, it was perfectly still.  I went inside to make a call to NUFORC and the object was gone when I came back.  I would estimate the location of the object to be over Cave Creek Rd and the 101 Freeway at an altitude of a thousand to two thousand feet AGL.  I took a photo but my lense was not strong enough to capture anything of clear value. ((END))",2004-10-27T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

It sounded like bubbles popping or like you stuck a straw into a bowl of water and blew accompanied by an electronic high pitch sound that would rise and fall about four times per second. No whirring of blades, no engine sound either, jet or piston, whatsoever. Scared me to death!  I've never heard anything like this in my life.

The blinking looked more like a change in light intensity and I then thought it was a satellite because of the blinking and because it was moving along so steadily and it didn't come and go quickly like a shooting star would. It just kept cruising along. After a few seconds of this, I pointed at it and began to exclaim to my friend that a satellite was moving over us. As I began to speak, I noticed a slight slowing of the light's pace, and then a sudden stop. It hung in place for about half a second and then moved left at a slower speed.

While Deer hunting, three men ages 63, 61, and 35 observed strange un explainable lights. We were hunting about 10 miles east of Grand Coulee Dam, Washington along lake Roosevelt. The terrain is sage brush, pockets of brush/aspen trees and rolling to sharp cliff hills and canyons.Our method of hunting is to leave the truck at 3:30 am and climb to near the top of a 1,000 ft. ridge and commence hunting at daybreak. On 10/14/04 we were about half way up the ridge at about 4-4:30 am in the dark, we stopped for a breather, sat down an looked across the canyon at the steep ridge on the other side, this ridge has sheer drop offs of volcanic rock, has no roads and in most places it is to steep to walk. The outline of the ridge top was visable in the night sky. We then observed a light just below the ridge top and soon another light a mile or so futher up the canyon also just below the same ridge top. We commented to each other how in the heck did someone get up there its impossible! The lights were about the size and color of a small headlight, soon the lights started to move much the same as a butterfly, up, down, 90 degree turns, the movements covered about a 400 yard area back and forth up and down. They changed from a yellow headlight color to a greenish color and occasionaly a redish tone, the light farther up the canyon sometimes would split into two lights and then come back together into one. We looked at them with our field glasses and it just made them look bigger but not different. We observed this for about 20 min. to a half hour, the light across the canyon went dim and then out, the light further up the canyon continued, going from one to two lights then it moved to the top of the ridge, turned very bright and larger and then went out. that was the last we saw of them. After daylight came we hunted till about noon and met up with our 35 year old hunting partner who hunted the upper end of the ridge we were on, after talking hunting for awhile, we mentioned did you see the lights on the far ridge, his comment was, what the h--- was that, as it turned out he observed the same thing we did except that due to his position he was not able to see the secound light at the head end of the canyon. As a note it should be mentioned that the lights did not give off a beam of any kind so as to shine on the ground, nor was there a beam of any kind going to them such as someone playing a joke with a laser or other device. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter,   This is getting more complicated all the time and the sad part is I don't have the time, however I can't seem to leave this alone until I have all the facts straight, correct and no stones unturned so that I may properly retire this incident in the archives of my mind.   I will re-submit my original report or add this as a footnote, let me know which, and how to do it. There were actually four of us in our hunting party, one hunter did not see what the other three of us saw so I considered him irrelevant to our sighting and omitted him in the report.  The four hunter who was the last to leave his vehicle (10 m. behind) also had the longest distance to hike in the early darkness. He would be cutting across the ridge diagonally below where my partner and I had just come up from. He is also 35 years old and very physically fit. (two 35 year olds, a 61 and 63 year old). At the time us old-timers were taking a breather and noticed the strange  lights across the canyon, I noticed and remarked to my partner "" there is Ron's flashlight"" it was only on for a moment, then a few minutes later I noticed out of the corner of my eye his flashlight again. He was just about where I thought he would be in the dark morning. My partner never looked over on either occasion and he has since told me he was so keen on the lights across the canyon that he didn't bother looking. Normally we do not use a flashlight but generally carry one in case its needed. I guess something stuck in my subconscious about the look of his flashlight appearance as it was just a very small area of bunch grass/sage brush that lit up on the ground, and I didn't see the flashlight bulb itself, it all seemed pretty normal at the time because his body was probably blocking the flashlight bulb itself, but as I thought about it days later, I called him on the phone and I mentioned to him that I had seen his flashlight come on a couple of times that early morning. His answer to me was "" I didn't have one with me that morning"".  My only answer to this is that it was part of the strange light occurrence and the lights followed him up the ridge with enough distance behind him that he never saw them, he also stated that he never stopped and turned around as he had a long way to go before daylight.  He is a very serious non joking sort of young man that I have known most of his life, he has a degree in construction management and runs many large construction projects. I guess the part that raises the hair on my back is that it put the ""flashlight"" about 200 yards from my partner and I.

Merging onto the 805N bridge in Mission Valley of S.D. to the NE of my vehicle ( over my neighborhood ) I first saw a very bright white light and one small red fast blinking light of an aircraft flying North at what appeared to be a similar altitude of local small planes and helicopters. It immediately kept my attention as the the lights on this aircraft would change drastically. At first, it can only be compared to the waving of a firecracker. As it curved in the sky small bright lights would expand out into a wild flickering trail and then it would compact again and as I exited off the freeway into my neighborhood, I was compelled to follow it as long as I could. It was high enough for me to keep a constant visual. As I caught up to it slightly, it would dim down to just the red light almost going out completely only to come back strong again. The last time I saw the white lights expand-out I was closer and so it was more defined, appearing that the lights were attached and in a half oval shape ( very Spielberg-ish ). I have no idea what this could honestly be. It was brillant against the black sky.I followed until it had dimmed to just the red light and then it dimmed out completely. I waited one minute but it was gone.  It had continued North flying over Miramar until it vanished. I had driven to our quiet local airport, Montgomery Field. There is an aircraft show this weekend at Miramar but I cannot imagine an acrobatic plane capable.

I am also a former police officer.  I have over 25 years in either the police or security industry.  And, I am not prone to ""seeing things.""  I was working late and walking through the parking lot at approximately 3:00am.  The sky was crytal clear and the wind was calm.  I first saw the object out of the corner of my eye.  At first, I thought it was a star.  But, I noticed it was moving very slowly.  Thinking it was an airplane, I watched it.  But, it was moving too slowly for an airplane.  And, it did not have any of the warning lights common to an airplane.  The object moved very slowly from north to south.  It was moving in a straight and level manner.  It did not twist and turn at all.  As I watched, the object slowed down to almost a stop.  At that point, I was convinced it was not an airplane.  The object was just west of the town of Bolivar.  It was moving parallel to 13 highway.  It had the appearance of a small airplane flying approximately 2000 feet above the ground.  I was standing on the east side of 13 highway and it was on the west side.  It appeared to be less than one mile away and approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon.  There was some shimmering.  But, not much.  After about 10 or 15 seconds, the object sped up to its original speed.  It continued to travel south for about another 20 seconds.  The object then shot stright up into the sky at an incredible rate of speed.  It moved so fast, I could not track it.  I did not see it again. I watched for it over the following two evenings, but did not see it again.

Possibly a satellite.

When I reached the top of the stairs something caught my eye in the sky.  I turned and saw about 8-10 objects in the Northern horizon moving up and to the east.  Just to the Northwest of these lights was a low hanging strange like smoke that moved in the same direction of the lights.  I watched lights for about 30 seconds, thinking they where balloons.  Then I went into my house.  Immediately upon entering my house I received a telephone call from a friend of mine that lives on the second floor of my building, come outside on the patio immediately.  By this time, her son was on the patio as well as my neighbor that lives directly below me.  We began to watch these 10-12 of these objects in the sky.  My friends looked at them with binoculars and we quickly decided that they where not balloons but some type of light.  They seemed to launch from somewhere on the horizon and move up and to the right.  We watched this set of lights until they we could no longer see them anymore.  This went on for about an hour.  I would say we saw a total of 4 sets of these lights.  We where so amazed with the lights and the strange looking fog on the horizon that we failed to take any pictures.  Living near DFW airport we are use to seeing lots of airplanes.  We did not see airplanes last night, we even joked because we saw airplanes flying in different points in the sky.

Lewisville is a city just north of Dallas, maybe 10 miles from North Dallas.  I had been shopping that evening with a friend and my son, we got home around 6:15 or so.  I put all my bags down and went out to the patio.  There, I saw my neighbor, Rich, outside on his patio.  He was looking into the sky, nothing unusual for any of us.  He asked me to look at what he was seeing.  I looked through a break between the tree and the building next to my apartment building.  There is a 4 foot, or so, space between them.  I looked in the direction of what seemed to be the north-western horizon.  There were balls of light going up into the air.  At first I asked if they were balloons, Rich explained that he had been watching them for a while and didn't think they acted much like a balloon.  I continued to watch them, as I watched more and more would come up into my line of vision.  Altogether, there would be anywhere from 9 to 15 of these individual balls of light in a group.  This group would move upward towards the stars, but always staying in formation.  The formations were nothing I have ever seen before.  There seemed to always be a ""lead"" ball of light, then two or three in a pattern behind it.  Then the other 6 or so would be in a half circle behind the lead balls.  (weird!).  As I became increasingly curious about what we were seeing, I began to realize that they couldn't have been balloons as they went a great distance into the sky.  Once they got up high enough to where you had to bend your head backwards to see them, it resembled a moving constellation.  It would be like watching the Big Dipper move across the sky.  At that point, Rich and I were very interested in what was happening.  I called a friend of mine, Jennifer, and she came out to her patio.  At this time, my son Jake came outside to see what the fuss was about.  We all stood there and watched another group go up into space.  This group acted the same way as the first.  Then, a third group.  With the third group, my son noticed that the ""lead"" light would stop, or appear to stop, and wait for the others to catch up.  At one point, there were two smaller balls of light that seemed to be ""playing tag"" as my son discribes it.  One was in front of the other and the front one would zig zag from left to right and the one behind it would ""chase"" it.  Very interesting to see.  On the fourth batch, we had two pairs of binoculars out (myself and Rich) and we couldn't get a much clearer view of them.  Almost like they were either too far away to actually see, even with magnification, or they were so bright that it seemed distorted when I tried to see them.  During the second group rising, Jennifer noticed a very odd, very thick and extremely white fog (for lack of a better word) on the horizon.  She pointed it out to us, we all saw it and watched as it rose, but it rose staying intact.  Unlike a building fire smoke, this seemed to stay just as white and just as thick as it was when it was lower on the horizon.  This display lasted approximately one hour.  I will never forget the way that these objects seemed to have a purpose, a direction.  They seemed to almost communicate in that they all knew where to go and how to take their place in ""line"" (although they never traveled in a straight line).  The best way to describe them, for me, was moving constellations.  Very bright, very large (although there were smaller ones as well), very organized objects in ""flight"".  When asked how big they seemed to be in relation to a star, my feeling is that the brightest star in the sky that night, was half the size of the objects passing by it.  This was the most awesome, curious thing I have ever seen and I hope to one day find out what it could have been.  Please let me know if you have any information.  Thank you.

As I went outside I heard a cat crying out in pain. Long story short, i found a stay cat that was reall just skin an bones.... it ate 5 cans of cat food... :\  But as I was feeding this poor kitty, I saw a bright white light off in the distance. I would say it was SOUTH WEST of true north.  This is not the first UFO I have seen in these parts. Last time I saw a UFO WEST of my location.  I live OUTSIDE of Edmonton, Alberta.  I am near 2 SMALL air ports. So I see alot of planes. I even remeber once I saw a black unmarked helecopter as a child that flew no more than 10-20 feet over out house... I never thought about the importance of that incedent till recently. See as how thoes unmarked helecopters have been reported many times when it came to UFOs and even more CATTLE mutalations. Altought as far as I know I personly have not heard of cattle mutalations in my area.  Anyways, as I was feeding this poor cat, I saw a bright light off in the distance. Off in the direction of SHERWOOD PARK. It is a town outside of Edmonton. I wanted to eyeball this light as long as I could, but trying to keep attention to the poor sick cat and the fact that small trees where in my way. I did not stay entirely focused to it.  I would say about a minute or 2 after I saw the bright light, it just vanished.  I would say it was VERY far away, but it could not of been a star consider how low it was to the horizen.  This time of year up here it gets dark quite quickly, and I can honestly say I have never seen a star that was that bright at this time, or even moved around for that matter.  This bright object moved around a tiny bit within the 1 to 2 minutes I watched it. It did not move in random patterns... But I would say it moved UP... not UP UP like into space or the atomsphere, but UP....  It was a LARGE distance away, but no plane or anything of that nature could produce such a bright light from that far away.  I really wanted to get my binoculars, so I could view the object, but being only human, I could only help the poor starving cat. I lost site of the object, (from my view from beyond the trees) quite quit.  All the trees around here have lost thier leaves, but I still was not wearing my glasses. But for a bright object to dissapear like that within the time period and direction it was moving and the fact there was no red or blue lights, which rules out any airplane, just leaves me boggled.  I lived on farm land, and from whats I have noticed on this web site is that sometimes ""Advertizing lights"" can be a factor in a UFO report. But let me tell you this, never have I heard or seen or even considered the fact that advertising lightings will be within or around the area of Edmonton, Alberta.  OH, and if your wondering, the stray cat is at a SAFE shelter now. :) By now he will of been adopted.  If I had to estimate the distance of the object I would say......  Quite far.....  From my current location, I would say I was still a large distance away...  Even if I got over to the closest highway, I would still say I was still 1/6 distance away from it.  It was far... but very bright.   FYI: I also saw this object, while an Meteor shower was occouring, and I can tell you that this was no Meteor. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At 16:50 local time in Spirit Lake, Idaho on November 28, 2004 I was observing the International Space Station moving overhead from west to east.  The sky was not totally dark yet, I would say it was about 20-25 minutes before max darkness.  When the Space Station was approx. 60 degrees above the eastern horizon I observed an extremely bright light develop rapidly about 5-10 degrees to the left (north) of the Space Station and apparently slightly below the equivelent elevation of the Station.  The light developed rapidly to a brightness about ten times the magnitude of Venus, about 4 or 5 times the brightness of a landing light.  It lasted for about 4 seconds and then rapidly dimmed to a glowing pinpoint as it traveled very slowly from my right to left.  The trajectory appeared to be about 10-15 degrees apart from a line directly between me and the object, I could not tell if it was coming toward me or going away (although my initial impression was that it was coming toward me), and I estimate it's position as somewhere over northern Montana. It continued to dim and vanished as it moved slowly.  It appeared to move much more slowly than a meteor, although the shallow angle might account for that.  It was the brightest thing I have ever witnessed in the sky other than the moon or the sun.  I have witnessed many meteors but my first remark to my mother, who saw the object also, was, ""what the hell is that?!""  I thought it might be a module that, according to the NASA website, would soon detach from the Space Station and burn up in the atmosphere, however that would most likely appear to be UNDER the trajectory of the Station, and I doubt they would do it over a populated area.  I have been an Air Traffic Controller for the FAA at six different control towers for a total of 21 years, 4 years before that on a carrier in the Navy, I have close to 1,000 hours of flight time with Commercial License, Flight Instructor, and Instrument Flight Ratings, am a qualified Weather Observer, and have never seen anything like it.  If it was a meteor it had to be very large, but appeared to be moving MUCH slower than a meteor.

It was really bright. At first I thought I was seeing things, then I called my father. As soon as my father came to see, the object made a sharp right turn and then the light dimmed out.  Then maybe 5 minutes later I saw it again, a really bright red circle. This time it seemed it like it was climbing. This time my father did see it....and saw how quick it was gaining in altitude without actually covering any horizontal distance. As it went up in the sky the lights once again turned off....bizarre, If it was a plane flying at night wouldn't it have headlights on....I'm used to planes flying over me, being close to the airport. But this was not the same......both my dad and I decided to check it out further and we went outside to look at it and we could see all the lights were off, but you could still see that greyish oblong shaped object in the sky....it seemed like it was going around in circles around our neighborhood.

My wife noticed it as well, and she agreed to keep an eye on it as I ran in the house and got my camera. I shot several images of the craft. In the max zoom of my telephoto lens (70 to 210) the object appeared to be a series of chrome spheres that seemed to be constantly moving and changing shape. Several times the objects formed a verticle ""V"" shape. The ""V"" shape was made twice in a very short time of say 3 seconds. I have photos of this, (as negatives as I haven't developed the images yet.) The group of orbs totaled 7 objects in all. They approached our house from the west and then began to travel south once they where over our house. Soon another sigular orb apeared from the north and started to follow the grouped orbs south. The group of orbs picked up speed slightly, and were soon covered from view by trees. Sight was lost on the sigular orb after the group moved south. The group continued to change shape the entire sighting.  I reported this with the understanding that I may be reporting a few Mylar baloons that got loose from somewhere.

It was too large and much too bright and in the wrong place to be a star or planet and it was relatively stationary. As I watched it began to move slightly down and to the right and then it remained stationary once again. It was not blinking or 'twinkling', though the light appeared to shine much like a diamond. There was no sound. I called to everyone else who was home at the time to come and look at it. They saw it move as well. When videotaped, the object appeared to grow larger and smaller, though we think it was just becoming brighter/dimmer and it was difficult to see what it was since the night was very dark and there was no other stationary frame of reference for the camera. When viewed through binoculars the shape was spherical, rather violet in color with rotating green rings about it with a slight red/orange trail. We called some friends, who lived in other areas nearby, but a few miles away to ask if they could see it as well - which they could. We sat watching it for some time, while it continued to 'hover' and move slightly up, down, left and right. It (very) slowly began moving West and then disappeared at around 10:30pm.

They reported the object as being larger than any planet seen in the night sky and much brighter. Again the object sat low in the sky over the trees in the distance. As the husband and wife watched the object for a short period of time, it just up and vanished. They said the object was visible for approx: two minutes. The witnesses told me that there was a mountain behind the object so they knew it hadn't dropped down behind the back of it. They did say it was a strange sight.

I had just picked up my Son from work in Manassas, and we were driving in a Westerly direction, toward home, at approx. 07:55 PM (EST). The night was dark, clear and starry weather...no moon in sight...with some, not many,  scattered clouds. Several, easily visible, and identifiable commercial jet aircraft were inbound to the Dulles Int'l Airport, and were flying their regular approach traffic patterns...of which we are very familiar. Suddenly, we witnessed a growing green glow approaching from the west, and increasingly lighting up major portions of the sky, very bright, almost neon green. Clouds rapidly became brightly backlit, and sillouetted. Then we were stunned to witness a huge, brightly glowing, green object traverse the sky, almost horizontally, from approx. southerly to north / northwest direction. It appeared, at first to only be a few thousand feet in the air...but this was hard to judge....it flew on very rapidly , trailing a sort of vapor in its wake, and then, just as suddenly as it appeared, it suddenly descended to earth, with extreme speed,and this was followed immediately by blackness (darkness). It appeared to us, from our vantage point, to have come down to earth, either crashed, or landed, perhaps within several miles to the west.... We were puzzeled because there was no sound, no sonic boom, no sound of a crash, and no smoke on the horizon... We discussed the incident together, and thought perhaps it was a meteor???, but dismissed that because we had seen several meteor showers before, and they never resembled anything like this object. It was extremely large...glowed very brightly, neon green incolor...had a vapor trail, traveled at extreme speed (at least ten times faster than jets in the air that night), and then suddenly dived, or descended rapidly....and almost certainly landed, or came to earth via a crash...all without a sound. It lit up an enormous portion of the sky..from our vantage point.

Two were brilliant white & one orange. As I was driving west-bound at approximately 9:50pm, December 11, 2004, I noticed two bright lights next to each other straight ahead that were increasingly getting brighter.  A third light was directly between and a little above to two brighter lights.  The three lights were in a formation of an acute triangle from my perspective.  At first I thought it must be a very large aircraft approaching in my direction.  However, upon further observation, there was absolutely no movement among the three lights.  The two brightest lights were brighter in magnitude than any star in the sky.  They were exactly side-by-side of each other.  The magnitudes of those two lights were even brighter than the star Sirius (which was in the sky that night to the east) and about as bright as Venus sometimes appears.  The two brightest lights had an equal magnitude.  Those two lights slowly faded to nothing over a span of about 5 to 10 seconds, again with no movement.  The dimmer third light, which had an orange tint, remained for a few seconds then faded to nothing as well.    The lights never reappeared.  The sky was clear and only slightly hazy to the north, but stars were still visible above and around the area in which the lights appeared.  I saw no clouds in the area at the time, although I had observed a few thin clouds in the sky to the east about an hour earlier that evening.  I observed the sky for several minutes after the lights disappeared and never saw a reemergence of the lights.  My located was south of Fort Worth, TX and north of Crowley, TX while observing the lights to the west.  I could not tell how far away the lights were due to the lack of movement.  I have never seen a sight of this nature.  When referencing the lights against the stars in the background, there was absolute zero movement among them.  Two of the lights were too bright to be stars; yet they had the stillness of stars.  Any aircraft would show evidence of movement unless they were ALL on a course DIRECTLY toward me or extremely far away.  However, the lights faded off with no movement, either in reference to the background stars, or each other.  I cannot explain or understand what they could have been.   The lights completely disappeared; a sharp contrast to the bright magnitude they had, especially the two brightest lights, just seconds before they faded to nothing without movement.  Many times in the past, I have observed aircraft lights which seem to get brighter in magnitude as they approach in a path directly towards my location, only to dim as their paths change.  But their movements are always apparent in such cases and the lights never disappear.  Although I was driving at the time, the lights were directly ahead of me and I had slowed down to nearly a stop observing them because I could not get my eyes off of them.  While waiting for the lights to reappear I took note of the surrounding stars and, from my perspective, they were located in or below the region of the constellation Pegasus.  My vision was very clear in this case since I was wearing my corrective lenses at the time, which gives me a vision of 20/20.  The dimmer, background stars of the lower portion of the Pegasus constellation remained quite clear.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,32.757366003227546,-97.34710441097364

Two of my old friends, my friend's dad and I were shooting the breeze around a campfire behind the barn beside their house in the country when my friend's dad points in the direction behind me and says ""what the hell is that?!"".  As I turned we all saw a formation of three lights in the western sky I would say anywhere from 1 to 5 miles from our location east of the town of Van Alstyne and about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon.  It could have been hovering anywhere between the airspace above town center and past highway 75 above the fields to the west.  It was a very clear night, no clouds and high visibility.  At first I thought it may have been a plane or 3 planes headed in our direction with landing lights on wich is strange because the flight path to DFW International Airport has traffic that usually heads east to west in our area.  What was unusually strange is that it did not move at all for at least 10 seconds and then all 3 lights faded simultaneously for about 5 seconds all in complete silence.  All four of us definately agree to this part of the description whereas the details are mixed.  I seem to remember that the topmost light in the middle was bright yellowish white much like an airliner's landing light while the 2 lights on the side where a duller blueish green much like a street light.  My friend and his dad seemed to remember the opposite with the greenish light in the middle and the white lights on the outside.  I did not see if there was anything in the middle while the friend and his dad seem to have noticed a dark triangle in between the formation of lights.  While the other friend vehemently belives that they were 1 or 3 airplanes they did not follow the normal patterns of any airplane I have ever seen in a low approach (I live just south of DFW airport and I am used to seeing exactly how airliners behave at low altitudes).  Also there were no port and starboard running lights or strobe lights and the other major detail, no sound.  I am thinking about reporting to the local news in the area because it would have to have been seen from the highway if not seen from the locals who where at the time throwing a Christmas parade and festival.  I have seen only one other unexplained phenomenon in my lifetime on lake Ponchartrain in Louisiana and have reported it on this site but this is far more inexplicable than anything I have ever seen in the night sky before.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,33.4366,-96.5553

I was on a down hill slope and looked up at the friend who was also on a large wood pile. I seen directly over his head in the distance a large Disk. It was four times bigger than the house( which would make it wide as a football feild and tall as a three story building. The best was I can describe it is - someone drew it in the sky with a pencil and then erased it. I could see it but at the same time I couldnt. Basicly transparent, the only way I seen it is because I was looking right at it when I was looking at my friend.  Me and my brother seen it at the same time and yelled to the friend.  He turned around and fell down from the quick shock. Being far away the first thang we could think to do was run to it so we could make out what it was. In our we asumed that it wasnt aware of us but as we ran close it droped down and dashed out of sight. No flames , no sound , and it was gone in less than a sec.  No human could live through those g-forces and what ship do we have that fast with no sound. Every one we told did'nt understand. I was about 12 and know im 24. I have found jesus and here latly I have been talking to people about what I seen and I have a lot of questions for the lord when I reach hevan. As for now I pray what I saw is answered in time.

MUFON/ISUR (GEORGIA) REPORT:   Investigation-Glowing Orb Chases Church Van,Wedowee,AL,1995-07-01T19:00:00,sphere,Appx. 30 minutes,"Occurred : 7/1/1995 19:00  (Entered as : 07/01/1995 19:00) Reported: 4/1/2004 11:14:53 PM 23:14 Posted: 4/9/2004 Location: Wedowee, AL Shape: Sphere Duration:Appx. 30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35948.html,"MUFON/ISUR Investigation-Glowing Orb Chases Church Van Background   This investigation was conducted jointly by MUFON of Georgia and ISUR (International Society for UFO Research) beginning on 15May97.  This event actually occurred on an UNKNOWN DATE in 1995, but believed to be in cooler weather, perhaps the autumn, as it was getting dark about 1900 hours.  At the time of the investigation, this writer was serving as Chief Field Investigator for MUFON of Georgia and as an investigator for ISUR.  John Thompson of Lagrange Georgia was State Director for MUFON at that time and also on the ISUR Board.  The multiple witnesses were all Georgia residents of that area, and attended the same church.  The occasion leading to the event was a church trip to Anniston Alabama by this small group of church ladies.  They were being driven in a large van by a male member of the congregation who was a prominent local businessman, and also known as a trusted community leader in that African-American neighborhood.  Accounts vary, but there may have been 10+ total witnesses on this trip, this investigator interviewing 6 of them.  This harrowing account was held confidential by these witnesses for about 2 years, only being discussed among their small group of friends.  Eventually, the information was related to John Thompson in his Lagrange office, and he asked this writer to follow up on it.   Investigation   15May97, this FI began by interviewing the Primary Witness (PW) at her home in Lagrange.  She was found to be a 62 YOA retired Nurses Assistant.  She lived in a well kept home in an older, established neighborhood, with many family photos and signs of serious religious faith being obvious.  PW stated that on the night in question, she and her church friends were riding up to nearby Anniston Alabama to play bingo.  They were seated to the rear of their friend, the van driver, and as usual talking and having a nice ride, enjoying the nice clear weather.   (Note......the driving route was determined as follows; west out of Lagrange and across the adjacent state line into Alabama, then turning north on Alabama Hwy 431 which carries them to I-20 which is about 35-40 miles distant to the north. Anniston is near the intersection of Alabama Hwy 431 and I-20).   As the van approached the vicinity of Wedowee Alabama on Hwy 431, the witnesses decided to roll up all of the windows because of the poultry plant located just off the highway (Braswell's Farms).  PW indicated that the odor of the production there was pretty strong, and this was something they normally did enroute to Anniston.   As the van approached and passed the plant, PW and some others noticed what they thought was a large new light over the top of the building (which is located on a rise).  It was large enough that they commented on it being newly installed.  One witness stated that it WAS NOT a light, but some ""FLYING THING"". Another witness commenting that no, it was just a new light. Then the other witness replying something to effect of ""Well if that's so, HERE IT COMES""!   The light flew down from over the plant and approached the moving van and then began to pace it as it drove north.  The light was described as being round like a globe, about the size of a ""dishpan"" in diameter (bigger than a basketball).  The light was described as being ""yellowish"", with the brightness of a lightbulb or street light.  It continued to pace the van, with descriptions of the light varying it's distance and altitude to as low as about 12 feet and then back up to 100 feet or treetop level; as close (and closer) as appx. 50 feet and backing away to perhaps 75 yards.......sometimes over the van, sometimes beside it, but always pacing it.  This episode began near Wedowee on Hwy 431 which, at this point in the route, is about 25 miles south of I-20 and the Anniston vicinity, their destination.   During this wild ride, the ladies became FRIGHTENED, trying to get down below the window level and still taking an occasional peek.  The driver stated that he was trying to drive and look at the same time which he found difficult. He verified that the light appeared to be about 100 feet over the poultry plant before it swooped down and began following them.  He added that eventually he DID IN FACT think about some form of UFO due to having read such accounts. Adding that it was definitely a large globe of light.   During this ride up to I-20, the PW at one time saw what she described as a shape within the light, a shape very similar to a ""human embryo"", which she indicated in her sketch. Further that it seemed to be ""moving around"" within the light. At another point, she recalled something like a beam projecting out that hurt her eyes, and those of her friend.  Adding that they both later developed watery and sore eyes. Another witness did not describe a beam, but told of a ""sparkling effect.  Another witness described a ""bad glare"" that beamed through the window.....just suddenly clicking on.   This activity continued as the van moved northwards closer to I-20, passing through the small Alabama ""hill country"".  At one point, the vehicle drove through an underpass, finding the globe of light waiting on the other side. This light also demostrated terrain avoidance maneuvers and continuously adjusted it's speed to that of the van.   As this group finally reached the area of the intersection of Hwy 431 and I-20, the light flew off over a field, then accelerated steeply upwards, leaving a streak, then became the size of a star and vanished.   A hoax was ruled out in this matter due to the sincerity of these witnesses and their strong church background.   Considered was glowing plasma/spook light, helicopter, and advanced military recon drone.  These were ruled out.......this writer does not believe ANY kind of natural ""plasma/spook light"" would act as described......over so many miles.  Even though it was during darkness, the van was approached SO CLOSELY that a helicopter or drone fuselage would have been observed, as well as engine noise heard.   A spokesman for the mainly rural Randolph County Sheriff's Department recalled no similar reports from that time period and knew of nothing that might be related to this event.   During this investigation, there were only the normal differences noticed from witness to witness, due to their personal interpretation and recall, seating position within the van, and level of fright.  This writer classified the event as a SIGNIFICANT UNKNOWN.  This FI also believes that there may have been more evidence in the offing if there had been a timely report of this event.  The witnesses are not to blame.  They were found to be good southern folks, that did not know whom to contact at the time.

I saw about 7 of them, one was on the point or say the vertex of the V.  It was flat and it was silent and swift. It was like it came into the range of sight and went right out or the lights were suddenly turned off.  It was so big that if I put my arms up into a wide V that was how much space it took up in the sky when you looked up at it.  Like when you see a plane you can put your thumb and finger next to each other about 1/3 of an inch and that's how it seems to be from where you are standing. It was silent and it just glided by so fast and went out of sight. Now my son was with me and he didn't see it, he only saw me run.  I ran to the back of our townhouse building, from front to back and on the side of the building was a young couple and they were kissing and the young man saw it, I'd guess he was around 18 and I said ""What was that?!"" and he said ""I don't know did you see it, too.?"" and I said ""I sure did."" and we didn't know what it was.  It was the most fascinating thing I've ever seen in the sky.  I wish I would have talked to him more about it and found out his name and where he lived.  I kept waiting to hear something about it on the news but I never did.  A week or two later I was watching TV and this UFO show came on (I forgot the name of it) and they said that in the desert they had spotted something in the sky that was similar to what I saw and it was supposedely a big sighting they had found.  One more thing about the squares they weren't really shiny but they silverish and luminescent.  I never reported this, but I did tell a few people about it through the 6 0 7 years since I've seen it.  I don't discount UFO's, I'm also not a person who studies them.

It actually caught our attention because of it's color, it was a beautiful greenish blue, and like I said, BIG. It was moving very fast, it didn't seem at the time to be very high up in the sky. In fact we slowed down and looked over to see if it had crashed in the wooded area to our right. A few months later I was talking to a co-worker and I mentioned it to him, and oddly enough, he had been out in his boat on Lake Greenwood at the time, and he had seen it too. Lake Greenwood is 160 or so miles from Savannah, so what we saw was either a really big UFO or an amazing meteor! I've watched meteor showers before, and none of the ones I've seen can compare.

We were driving north to our farm on a dark moonless night. I saw a white smudge in the sky to the northwest more west than north and another almost north. They looked almost alike. When we got home I ran into the house, got the binoculars and ran back out to look at the smudges. The one to the west was a group of round white moonlike objects with fog surrounding them. By this time clouds had moved over the north group. As I watched, all the ""little moons"" moved slowly to form one larger ""moon"". The ""moon"" was still surrounded by a kind of fog. After a few minutes it all disappeared. I have three drawings I made on my computer.  Additional Information Below:  We live 6 miles north of Rupert, Idaho (50 miles east of Twin Falls, Idaho, southern Idaho USA)  First looked at it through binoculars at about 10:00 p.m.. It was sometime in about 1999.  The only way I can describe ""smudge"" is that it looked like a elongated very small chalk line in the sky....not round like a star. The first computer drawing shows both objects. The right group disappeared behind clouds before I got out with the binoculars.  They were like a cluster of white round grapes surrounded by a wisp of fog when I first saw them through the binoculars. Fog was white like a thin cloudy material.  The object was about an inch at arms length with unaided eye.  The computer drawings show about the amount of small round moon-like objects....can't remember counting them but there were many of them...some larger than others.  They didn't move in any way except to very slowly gather into one moon-like object.  My husband and I were the only witnesses on our farm. Didn't hear of any other witnesses.  Weather conditions: clear dark skies and a little cool.  No aircraft seen or heard....no sound.  No beams of light coming from them and no tails or trails.  Drawings made by witness.

This report involves a single object.  I use a Panasonic GS-12 mini-DV camcorder. I had the shutter speed at approximately 1:200, and manually focused.... (I never fish with 1:60 normal shutter speed or auto focus). The cam has 20x optical/200x digital zoom, I had it set to around 60x. It was a mostly clear night and I was filming out my front window toward the East (had glass and screen down). The moon was rising and at about 45degrees. I didn't observe the object until reviewing the film.  The whole thing takes place in well under 1 second. The object enters the frame at 7:00 position (quickly), then it seems to pause/stop for the slightest fraction of a second before accelerating at incredible speed at slightly less of an angle.  The interesting things to me are the apparent change of direction and acceleration. These factors, (as well as object size to camcorder zoom ratio) decrease the odds of it being something immediate to my position (bug,bird,debris,etc). It's behavior is inconsistant with a plane or satellite.  I higly reccommend anybody curious to get out their camcorder and give this a try. MANUAL shutter, MANUAL iris, and MANUAL focus help a great deal. Also don't zoom way in... try to keep it as much in the optical zoom as possible.  I encourage anyone handy with photo or video editing to PLEASE examine this. I am including my highest quality mpeg of this event as well as 1 jpeg of the object when it's apparantly still. And 1 jpeg just as it starts to accelerate. (e-mailing to ufocntr@nwlink.com).  In the future I plan to record in tandem with a friend across town (parallax is really what's needed).

We have viewed the video footage, and our suspicion is that the object is not inconsistent with the flight of an insect in proximity to the camera.  However, it the camera was focused at infinity, that might militate against our theory.  On the other hand, the object crosses the entire disc of the Moon in approximately 1 second.  If it was in proximity of the Moon, some 2000 miles in diameter, that angular velocity would translate to 14 million miles per hour, which seems unlikely to us, given that the object appears to change its course halfway through its passage across the disc of the Moon.

I have been seeing various lights and objects during the past month and reported a sighting to you a week or so ago and gave info to contact me but no response. So this time I will not leave info and we will see what happens. On thursday night I was outside with my video camera looking for another object to film. I saw the usual yellowish orange ball to the east of me when I noticed a blinking light near it. It either came out of it or was circling checking it out. It kind of darted back and forth then slowly headed my way. I filmed it as it passed over a little to the south of me and as it went by I could hear a faint roar like a jet. But the sound kept getting louder behind me instead of in the direction of the objects path as would be expected. I turned around and about 3-400 feet above me was some huge craft several hundred feet across with two large lights in the back of it heading in the direction of the orange ball. At first I thought it was two fighter jets going to look at the ball but soon realised it was one vehicle and it was moving way too slow for a jet. A jet would have fallen out of the sky moving that slow. I jumped around to film it and got about 10 seconds of video before it went behind some trees, that is how low it was. As I watched the video, all but around 3 seconds was jumping and shaking but in slow motion there is definitely something there. But no dicernable shape is visable. But the lights I thought were flames were blinking. They stayed on but blinked intermittently through the white light. It was strange and I showed the video to people at work and they had no answer either. I saw a show on the Phoenix Lights the other night and clear as day was the same type of lights as the object passed overhead. I am open for suggestion and have video footage if you are interested.

Eve/Nov. 4 6:25 PM my freind, ((name deleted)), was driving in a Boeing semi-truck southbound past Brooks, Oregon on I'5 (just 1/2 hour ago) spotted a large white light (round/ball-shaped) in the night sky. (I don't have all the exact details but he called me on his cell phone in a highly excited state to give me some basic info.) Apparently he could see the object out of one of his windows and said if he'd had his arm stretched out it would be about the size of a quarter. Thus, it appeared MUCH larger than others stars and typical night sky objects.  The object seemed to be keeping pace with his truck as he continued south on I-5 and for a time seemed not to be actually moving at all but it looked so big and odd that he elected to keep his eye on it.  All of a sudden the object shot across the sky at an extremely fast speed then stopped.  He said it came to an unbelievably ABRUPT stop.  It hovered in that spot for a few seconds then shot across the sky again in a different direction and came to another abrupt stop. I'm not clear how many times the object did this but he continued to watch it.  All of a sudden he said the object faded to black and disappeared right where he last viewed it hovering.  He said he never saw it dart away instead it was like it faded to black.  Because ((name deleted)) is on a tight trucking schedule he is not able to make a report himself this evening.  He will be back home in Auburn, Washington on Saturday afternoon, Nov. 6 and will e-mail you then with more precise details.

I was looking between some large Queen Palm trees, so those managed to give me a feeling of scale. There were no clouds that I could tell, the stars were out. The sky was a bit hazy. We are near John Wayne International Airport so I am always seeing and hearing planes flying overhead, usually on takeoff, and usually flying from east to west (opposite to this things flight path) I also have a strong understanding of visual recognition of aircraft from many years working at/near air bases - I am in the aerospace industry. Note that we are about 1 mile south of Interstate 405.  At about 6:45 PM, I saw a motion in the sky that attracted my attention. It was moving from the west towards the east, straight in front of me. Since I was looking west, it appeared to move up in the sky. It was moving at a high velocity compared to the aircraft I usually see flying, perhaps twice as fast or more. It flew up to almost directly overhead, then turned abruptly to the southeast. It appeared to be increasing alitude, although that is a bit speculative. It flew between the fronds of the palm tree, and finally up over the roof. By the time I got to a better viewing angle, it was gone.  The vehicle itself looked triangular in shape and was black/gray, looking more like a mottled gray shadow against the black sky. It seemed as if the bottom of the vehicle either had a slight glow or was reflecting lights from the city below, as there seemed to be a bluish mottling over the bottom surface. The leading edge had a number of fairly dim lights, perhaps five to seven. I think there were a couple of lights on the trailing edge, but I'm not certain of that. There was no sound whatsoever, although aircraft engines were heard a few minutes later as a airliner flew over. The size of the vehicle seemed impressive .. I see aircraft through our typical haze all the time, including planes flying around tonight, and this seemed much more diffuse, so I think it was fairly high up, higher than typical commercial aircraft. The overall impression was a large triangular shape flying high above the normal traffic pattern at a high velocity, but that could be way off. I did notice a decrease in traffic around that same time.  Bear in mind I do not think this was ""alien"", more likely some sort of secret military surveillance vehicle.

I'm now attending college for culinary arts. I have lived in a high rise penthouse apartment for almost 27 months now. What I saw this morning was different then anything I have ever seen in my lifetime. I've seen shooting stars from my apartment balcony which faces southwest. I look out my huge window daily and nightly to catch glimpses of the beautiful philly skyline that i have from my apt. I can see the airplanes turn and descend then land at the airport from my apt. Especially on clear nights I can see them coming and going extremely well as they pass back behind the skyline.Another thing is I'm constantly checking outside for good shots to take of the changes in the season with the leaves and the city with my digital camera. This morning at around five am I got out of bed to get a drink of water, as I was pouring the water I was thinking to myself what a cool night it was and how it was probably really clear out. so I walked over to my balcony window and looked outside as I drank my water. I noticed it was extremely clear out and almost twilight. Although it was still dark out I noticed that it was going to be a clear day to come. I could see the blueness of the sky along with some puffy little clouds about too. As i was looking at the blueness of the sky and thinking to myself how it was pretty amazing how I could see the color in the sky even though it was still dark out. Then I noticed two extremely bright lights that were very close to each other. they were too bright too be planes and on clear nights you can clearly make out the shapes of planes, and also see the flashing lights on most of them. Although it was clear there wasn't much to see of any stars like in the summer time. these were not moving at all, if so very slow then. Not stars, not planes, not a helicopter, these were way too high up for that. They were extremely bright though, I was thinking to myself that someone else must be viewing them also. They were almost as bright as the moon when it is half full. I watched them for about ten minutes looking about thge rest of the sky at the same time looking for stars or planes to try to determine what it could be, I knew it wasn't something normal, it was interesting enough for me not to want to go back to bed, so I proceeded to go and quickly charge my dead video camera battery for a few mins. I then returned to record the footage. They were still there too close together to be airplanes, and besides they weren't moving, but they weren't stars. i taped them for about ten to fifteen mins. I zoomed in on them with my cam. very bright white light surrrounded with what looked like some type of fire or electronic field of energy. Then they both dissapeared for a moment, or so I thought, that's when I noticed that they were indeed moving because they had passed behind a cloud briefly just very very slow. I started to wonder if they could be sattelites or something, but why two so close together, and why did they move so slowly, yet seem to never change the distance between them. Then I thought maybe some type of anti-terrorism patrol craft that the military is testing or something. what better time to do it then 5am when normal working people aren't quite awake yet, and the partiers are sleeping. Not as much chance for someone sighting it. I've seen numerous planes in the sky flying about the city around a month ago with what looked like spotlights on them flying around the philadelphia skyline, but they were moving quickly enough to tell that they were defintly moving. They also were much, much closer to the ground. These I don't know what they were. In read some other ufo reports and there is one on sept. 23rd 2004 in Hartland that sounds very similar to the two objects that I saw. I remeber starting to get tired after watching them for about thirty minutes and turned the camera off and went to bed. I should have stayed up to finish watching them but was too tired. Please respond to me and let me know if anyone else has seen what I saw. thanks ((name and number deleted))  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.

There wasn't much overcast or haze, just stormcloud or clear blue sky. I need to take frequent breaks when working on the computer outside, because of glare on the display. So, at one point, I leaned back and looked straight up into the sky. I noticed that there was a very well defined thundercloud to the north, scattered cloud overhead and blue sky west and east.

In the centre of the smoke ring was a grey dot or small circle. At first, the dot was almost as large as the area inside the smoke ring, about the size of a fingernail at arm's length.

I was on my way home from work in Mesa AZ on August 17th 2004 at Approx. 8:25 pm.  I had gone an alternate route home than I usually do because I stopped at a gas station in my area with the lowest price for fuel as my vehicle was low.  Haveing gone this alternate route allowed me to travel on a street that gave me a clear view (Than I otherwise would have had on my normal route home.)of what we in Phx call a green belt which are various strips of land with huge power lines running through town. As I rounded my turn,1 street away from my home, I noticed a  dark/black triangular object seemingly hovering (Extremely low in an area with limited light.)facing west, directly over the power lines.  I was in astonishment and rapidly drove toward the object.  As I approched I rolled my window down as to try and hear engine noise and there was none.  As I came to a stop in the street I observed the object. Moments later Three bright white forward lights turned on along with a red strobe in the center and white strobes on 2 tip sides blinking.  The object Then began to rotate and turn sideways turning north moving off rapidly.  I pursued it as best as I could and observed it turning westward two streets further up.  The object seemed to be mimicking the flight paths of commercial traffic approching westwardly at that time both north and south of the object's position. The object however did not seem to be increasing altitude. It instead followed the same height and flight path (Which would be just south of the Phx airport.)as far as I could track it from my perspective. I then proceeded to observe commercial traffic from the north of Hwy 202 and south of Hwy 60 approching like fireflies in line on thir normal flight paths for a westward approch into the Phx airport.  All the other air traffic altitudes seemed much higher. Later I returned home and related my expirence to friends and family.  I then remembered I still had a phone number for an individual I spoke with over three years ago,who is a member of MUFON and gave me a card. I called him and gave my account of my sighting.  I,however, am not a member of any related group.  I felt that mabey my information could be useful in the event that someone else might have witnessed the same thing.  We talked of details and found it interesting that this occurred on the nite after the new moon, a dark, clear nite sky.

The row on the left was higher up than the one on the right.  They appeared to be several football fields long and very close to us. The lights were a pale yellow and cast no light, but only glowed.  My brother, who was beside me in the front passenger seat, was lightly dozing.  I screamed for him to wake up and look out the window.  We were both amazed at the sight and kept saying, ""Oh, my God, what the hell are they.""  The lights on the top row on the left side suddenly went out, one after the other, in rapid succession, starting with the light closest to us.  The lower row on the right followed immediately after in the same manner.  The entire viewing lasted less than 3 minutes.  The first thing my brother said was, ""You know we can't ever tell anyone about this because they'll never believe it."" We are both middle aged Grandparents and neither drink or do drugs.  We also aren't prone to exaggeration, and my brother has always been a pure skeptic, though I have never doubted their existence.I have read about about, and seen many, many, pictures of UFO's but, have never seen pictures of anything quite like these two.  Three or four months later in broad day light we were driving north somewhere between Los angles, and Monterey, CA and watched one doing bizarre movements above the mountain tops ahead of us on the west side of the highway.  It flew straight up and would disappear, and then suddenly reappear several miles to the left just above a different set of mountain tops.  Then it would fly from right to left, and left to right horizontally.  It did a number of these seemingly impossible movements for about 20 minutes before it disappeared for good. We kept wondering if any of the other travelers were seeing what we did.  It was almost as if they were saying to us, ""See, we are real and you didn't imagine what you saw the other time.""

The object was moving in a straight line.  No lights were detected or trails behind it.  Numerous things stuck us initally: 1) It was agreed amongst us that it was moving significantly faster than other satellites or shooting stars we have seen. 2)It seemed very low for a satellite.  I can not give an estimate of height, but, it appeared that the object was almost close enought that we could pick out details of the object, not just a general shape profile. 3) It seemed of reasonable size - potentially due to the low height??  Larger than other satellites I have seen by approximately 4-5 fold.  At approximately a 25° angle, the speed of the object slowed slightly and it moved in a half-circle profile.  I would suggest that the radius of the bend took place over 5-10° of the horizon.  On completion of the half-circle profile, the object then resumed a straight line course.  It appeared to be on a fairly similar path as to the one it was following prior to the half-circle.  Observers: #1 - 32 year old male.  Engineer #2 - 54 year old male.

My 14-yr-old nephew and my 18 yr-old babysitter saw UFOs first. I arrived home with my 22 yr-old niece at about 10:30 pm on 8/25 and they were excited, having seen about 10 ""sparkling"" objects flying in the sky above Long Island Sound.  As I spoke with them about it, several more appeared in the sky, and by midnight we had seen approximately 40 of them. They would fly from over the ocean to inland, all in the same direction, approx. SE to NE. Several of these objects would fly in triangle or trapazoid patterns and looked to deliberately fly close and then closely cross each other's flight paths. At times, they looked like they might crash. Two flew very low over our heads and we could see the bottom of one. It looked like a triangle with a light at each point. When the objects flew over, a low flying helicopter appeared and at first appeared to follow one of the objects, but then contiuned straight on its path, away from the object.  During this 2 hour period, there was a very low ""planet"" sitting over the water. It was motionless, large, shiny and sparkled red, blue, green and white. At 11:50, it stopped sparkling, dimmed and flew off in the direction of the other objects. None of these objects made any noise - all were completely silent.  The next night we sat out at 10:15 pm to see if we'd see them again and did. We saw approximately 30 ""sparklers"" flying in the same direction as the previous night and behaving the same way as had the others.  We also sat out last night and saw approximately 10 ""sparklers"" - same MO.  I contacted an Air Force office in New Haven (a number I received from 411) and they said there were no bases in CT, Montauk was not being used (closest military base to us, although it was closed decades ago), they were not flying over Madison, Ct and the objects ""were not ours.""  We will sit out tonight to see if any more of these strange objects appear.  Post Script: Also: On the second night, a large bright white object appeared low in the sky over the water, arced directly down towards the water and disappeared.

It did this 3 times as if it were spinning and the shiny part would hit the sun.

We first noticed the first one on the 30th of Aug. as a cloud bank was building in the west, we watched this for about 15 minutes until it was obscured by the cloud bank. The next day of the 31st. one object appeared in the west and as we were watching this another appeared in the northern sky. As we were looking at the one in the west it blinked out then reappeared to the right of it's origional position. Then to the lower left of this object another object blinked on then off very quickley. I viewed both remaining objects through a pair of binoculars and both were seen as objects that were reflecting light off the right side with a dark outline to the opposite side. It looked like they were reflecting the light and not emitting it as a source. These objects remained in the daylight sky for aprox. 2hrs. time. As we were watching the object in the north began drifting to the west towards the object in the west at a slow pace. As it was nearly to the half way point between it's origional position and the object in the west the object in the west blinked out. This object came to a position that put in in almost the same place as the first object in the western sky. It remained in this position until almost sunset then began moving to the north west and eventualy turned red and then blinked out. My two friends and other people that were walking back from the beach after the launch were witness to the lights as we pointed them out to them. All of the ones coming fron the beach were talking about the strange show in the sky, but I did not see this because I was involved with the lights.

He pointed above the trees, about 45 degrees up to a fuzzy but distinct patch of light approximately a degree in diameter. As an experienced amature astronomer my first impression was that it was the moon heavily obscured by clouds. I dismissed that idea since the moon would have been just rising in the east and this object was only a few degrees SW of corona borealis. Plus the sky was completely cloud free. I said to the guards that I was baffled and had never seen anything like it before. It resembled a comet but without a tail.  At first it appeared stationary. The water display began, but I was more interested in this object and kept checking it out throughout the display. It passed through corona borealis slowly in a straight line. I would guess it moved about a degree a minute. As it moved it changed shape from what appeared to be elongated to more or less spherical. It also gradually and steadily diminished in brightness. I continued to track it until about 9:25 PM EST by which time I could no longer detect it. By that time it was entering the constellation Cygnus which was high overhead. The object never changed speed or course. It was probably visible well before it was pointed out to me. Other people in the crowd were looking up occasionally but as the water display continued they seemed to have lost interest in it. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.

As it slowly and steadily moved upward toward the eastern sky, it dissipated into a fainter cloud til it was no longer visible (~30 degrees above the western sky).

It was a perfectly clear, entirely cloudless and starry night, more than one hour past sunset and just a quarter-hour after moonrise. I first noticed the object relatively low and distant in the sky as I looked to the west-southwest. It appeared well above the treeline as a white, somewhat fuzzy, oval-shaped splotch in the sky, about the size of an aspirin at arm's length. After staring at it for a full minute, it also seemed to be moving extremely slowly toward me. As a lifelong stargazer and skywatcher, it caught my attention due to its relatively large size, its relative brightness in the night sky, and the fact that, for me, if didn't fit any category of previously observed aerial phenomena.  I yelled to my wife and grabbed two optics -- an 8x20 monocular and 16x50 binoculars. By this time we were certain that the object was slowly moving toward us. As I viewed it for at least 15 minutes through the 16x binoculars, it never changed its shape from the one shown in the sketch I previously referenced -- its appearance was that of two large, equal-sized parabolic shapes that were back to back but slightly separated and linked through their middles by a somewhat cigar-shaped element that was slightly pointier at the left (south-facing) end. These shapes appeared to be gaseous, almost cloudlike in nature, but they were sufficiently defined and unchanging.  As I looked through the 16x binoculars, I also saw an occasionally-blinking white light at the left tip of the cigar-shaped central element. It blinked at an  irregular rate, and my wife could not see this aspect of it through the 8x monocular. At one point midway through our roughly 15-minute observation period, I also saw (through the binoculars) a yellow-red dot that moved quickly toward the south; it originated from the same tip where the white light was periodically blinking. I could only track the low-intensity yellow-red light briefly through the binoculars' field of view before it vanished; I could not see this light with my naked eye.  The dual-parabolic-shaped object's line of travel took it directly over my house at a high altitude. As it slowly approached the point directly overhead, the object also had begun to lose its shape, size, and intensity of luminosity. When it was directly overhead, the object ceased to exist, although I continued to observe this overhead location for another 30 minutes and could still (but barely) make out a faint amorphous form in its place. At this point, and all throughout the observing period, there were still no clouds in the sky, and we heard no sounds from the object. There were occasional commercial aircraft traversing the sky at various altitudes, but none had any interaction or effect on this object, which was at an unknown but seemingly high altitude. I did not see any reports in this morning's (Wednesday) local daily newspaper. I don't know if it was mentioned on any local radio or TV stations.  I am a marketing / public relations profesional and my wife is a finance professional.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Cape Canaveral.  PD))",2004-09-09T00:00:00,,

I thought it was a satellite at first because of its slow speed. I often spot satellites at this time of night traveling slowly across the sky, but never one this bright, and I have always watched them travel for several minutes. My next thought was a meteor, but it was traveling slower than any meteor I have ever seen. It got very bright in intensity for about 5 seconds and then faded very fast, moving through about ten or 20 degrees of the night sky. I have never seen a meteor travel this slow, nor have I seen a satellite this bright and short. It was much more intense than most meteors. What really grabbed my attention was another object of the same intensity followed the exact same path about three minutes later. Could this have been pieces of space junk burning up?

Triagular craft hovering over I-70 in OH,Lewisburg,OH,2004-07-17T03:00:00,triangle,5-7 mintues,"Occurred : 7/17/2004 03:00  (Entered as : 07/17/2004 3:00) Reported: 7/17/2004 11:08:06 PM 23:08 Posted: 7/25/2004 Location: Lewisburg, OH Shape: Triangle Duration:5-7 mintues",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38180.html,"Triagular craft hovering over I-70 in OH Me and two friends were returning from a visit to Cincinnati. We were traveling west on I-70. it was slightly rainy out, but not enough to obstruct your view too much. I'm not sure where we were the first spotting, but it wasn't far out of Dayton. My friends both saw it and pointed it out. It was maybe a mile up in the air and was triangular in shape. I only saw a glimpse of it, but it appears to be illuminated. The whole ship was lit up in a light blue/white glow. It passed us pretty quick and we kinda shook it off as a plane in town for the air show at Wright Patterson this weekend.  We proceded to drive down the interstate when my two friends pointed again at an object in the distance. We were near the Lewisburg, OH exit. It was only a light at this point, but it was dead ahead of us. We kept driving towards the light, which never seemed to move. It wasn't going left of right. So I assumed it was flying in the same direction as us. The closer we got, the more you could make out of the craft. Again, it was triangular in shape. But not a perfect triangle. The nose was more narrow, then it contoured out, but difinetely triangular in shape. There were two lights on the outer ""wings"" that blinked in sync about once per second. The front of the craft put off a decently bright glow, but was not a beam of light. I can't estimate the exact size of the object. It was bigger then a stealth bomber, but not by too much. It wasn't very tall either. Very flat in appearence. It couldn't have been more then 10-15 feet tall. The only way I know it wasn't a stealth bomber is it wasn't jagged in the back. I've seen the stealth upclose, and I can definetely say it wasn't one.  We continued to get closer to the object, and as we did we started to realize the craft wasn't moving. We slowed down pretty good as we got within a half mile or so from it. By now, you could see that it was maybe 500 feet in the air and was simply hovering. We could now also see the underneath part of the craft. This to me was the most significant part. The ship appeared to be facing us, and on the front underneat part was the light. After that there was a narrow and long opening, rectangular, that was lit up. Not brightly, but enough to tell that you were looking into the craft. I'm not sure what was inside the opening, but to me it looked like red pipes are bars of some sort that were red in color. This also made it seem like it put off a red hue with the white light around it.  We slowed down to around 40mph while we drove under it. I hung my head out the window and looked up at the craft, which was posistioned directly in the median off the interstate. I couldn't hear anything, but then again I was driving down the insterstate with the wind in my ear. I also happen to be deaf in one ear, so not hearing anything didn't suprise me much. I didn't even really think about that fact until later anyhow. All the traffic seemed to be slowed down with us. No one passed us and the semi ahead of us wasn't pulling away from us either. I think everyone was looking as close as they could at this unexplainable object.  I wanted to pull over, but I was hesitant too. I had two females with me, and they were a bit spooked by this, as was I. After we went under it we watched it as best as we could. We decided we had to have another look. We sped up to the next exit and turned around. I drove about 80mph to get back to the spot. It wasn't long before we realized the ship was gone. And then I realized I did something pretty stupid. I had my camera phone on me the whole time, I just never thought of it. I will never forgive myself for not thinking of it. But I was so in shock that it just slipped my mind.  I can only really give you credible background for myself. The two girls I was with I've only known a short time. I believe they are good people. And I know they saw what they saw seeing as I was there with them. As for myself, I've always been a believer in the paranormal. I've always believed there is life outside this planet or solar system. I've listened to Art Bell many times. I've watched anything UFO or alien related I came accross. I even went as far as to have a tattoo of a cartoon alien in a spaceship made of wood on my arm. I'm sure all this leads you to believe me less on this story, and that really doesn't matter to me. I know what I saw. I never in the world would believe I'd see something like this. And knowing a thing or two about UFO's made me think that even more. I mean why would it happen to someone who would love to see such a thing? I can only say that I'm an honest hard working 32 yr old American man. I don't lie, cheat, or steal. I've never made up a story in my life for attention, and I frown upon those who do. I know what I saw, and what I saw was a huge craft hovering in thin air.  I haven't reported this to any local authorities. I really don't know what I would say when I called to report it. I'd think they would think I'm just some drunk guy seeing things. But it does so happen that one of the girls mother is a corrections officer at the county jail. We're waiting for her to return to work this week and inquire about any UFO sightings reported.  Feel free to contact me via email. I don't feel safe giving out addresses and phone numbers at this point.",2004-07-25T00:00:00,39.8421,-84.5561

I complained that he always sees ""everything"" and went outside to let him explain where it was.  He described it as a tiny light, which looked like a star moving swiftly from west to east and disappearing from his view.  He pointed where it came from and then we gazed at the sky longer and I saw either the same or another one going from south to north.  It truly looked like a star flying because it was the same size as all the other stars.  But it just kept going in a long straight line until I couldn't see it anymore.  I went inside, having my curiosity satisfied.  He came in later and said he saw it again going from west to east.  It was absolutely not a plane.  It was far too high.  It wasn't in the usual paths of the planes which fly (very close) to our home and there's no way the aviation people would have allowed their paths to cross like that, being so close together.  They made no sound and left no trails that we could see.  There were no auxillary lights near them, as airplanes even flying very high, still have that flashing red or green on them in addition to the brighter white light.  I've never seen anything like this.  The span of time from the first one to the last one was about eight minutes but each took about a minute and a half to pass from our vision.

What is in it that only the government knows but cant let the citizens or anyone else knows about it? That is something that only the western has it.

There are so many other countries, vast lands, continents, etc... but why those objects lands only on western lands???  3. If one of your family members are captured at an enclosed area, would you go to that place to get him / her out? Would you try all means and ways to get your loved ones out? Would you fight to the best of your ability to free those who are captured? Imagine...  4. (Not referring to anything or anyone) Would a thief announces his stealings to everyone and wage a war with the authorities and people who goes against the idea of stealing? Or rather, would he use his stealings quietly to his advantage?  5. And if you have ever watched a sci-fi movie, how would the baddies use their stealings to their advantage?

I was standing, facing away from the house, looking up at a ""star"" which I believed to be the planet Mars because it had a reddish tint to it.  I was distracted by an object moving diagonally and downwards, coming in over the neighbor's roof to my left, possibly 1000 or so feet off the ground. At fisrt I thought it was a bat or some sort of bird. It was moving quite quickly and was about to go behind the tree in my backyard when I got a better look at it.  The object was almost translucent. It looked as though it had the texture of smoke, or a cloud, yet it retained its shape perfectly, as it flew threw the air. I would define its shape as an arc, a sort of more rounded boomerang. The object then went behind the tree, and was temporarily out of view. I saw it come out the other side, only to change direction, and head in an almost downwardly only direction.  I realized then, that what I was looking at was not a bird or bad or smoke or cloud or any terrestrial craft I have ever seen. Then the object simply disapeared.  I was, and still am, in a heavy state of panic and awe. I was in tears at the overwhelming site of the unknown.

I had gotten to the exit that goes to the Beeline Expressway(Hwy 528), and was in the left lane, since I don't take that route. Looking straight ahead, at about mid-level in relation to my windshield, I saw a shooting star - a meteor - which, in and of itself, isn't unusual. However, this one was ""fat""...the tail was thick in width, and the size change from end to end was not very extreme. Well, it dropped from about midway in my windshield field of vision, to just above the horizon, then vanished.  And now comes the weird part.  I was still looking in its direction, still north on I-95, though I had pulled off the highway to watch. Right at the lowest point where the meteor vanished, at exactly that point, something else began to come into view. Not a sudden appearance, like ""poof"" there it is...but a gradual visibility, taking about 5 seconds to come fully in sight, though it didn't ""grow"" in size(as an oncoming headlight, or light source, might do). What it seemed to be was a craft, oblong/oval in shape, no blinking lights, but it was illuminated...a dull glow, as opposed to brightly lit. Once it was fully visible, it sat in that spot for a couple of seconds, then proceeded to move in a westerly direction, the quality of the illumination never changing. There were no blinking lights at any time during this observation. I pulled back out on the highway, and watched it until I could no longer see it.

We were driving and had just turned off of state road 22 eastbound onto county road 1350 heading north when we immediately noticed an extremely bright white light hovering just a little to the right off the road about the height of what a small plane would fly. Ruling out that it was'nt a plane (since it was not moving) and seeing other aircraft in the vicinity, we kept our options open to see if it was moving towards us, it was not. As we continued to get closer we could most certainly tell that this was no aircraft with wings. This object appeared to be very large with a very bright intense white light that we could see some five miles away. Looking straight up in front of us wwithin a quarter of mile, it just vanished. The light had just completly turned itself off. We all three said practically at the same time, ""hey where did it go?, it's gone"" We were amazed at what had just happened. This is just the first one we saw. We continued to talk this over with each other for the next 7 to 10 miles i would guess approaching our turn onto the Miami-Wabash county line. When we were just about to turn right (this is in the Mississenewa lake area) we saw out in front of us a somewhat dim amberish orange light appear out of nowhere just about a half to a mile out in front of us. I stopped the van at our turn and we watched this light which seemed to be traveling at a super slow rate of speed for around 30 seconds. Once again, this light just semmed to turn itself off as quickly as it came on. That was it. I just have to say that i have seen unexplainable lights like this before when i would be driving alone over different periods of time but, never have i seen two different sightings on the same night within minutes of each other and having two other witnesses with me.

Faded out. I am a first officer for a regional airline. I fly an aircraft called a Do328 JET.  I flew a one-day trip on the said date, from our hub to Des Moines, and back the next morning. It was approximately 10:30pm, and we were flying our 32 passenger regional jet westbound at 29,000 ft. It was an absoutely clear sky-the overcast was below us, and we could only see stars above. I had turned down the cockpit display lights to look at the night sky. It's amazing how many stars you can see with the clounds below you blocking out all the ground lights. The aircraft was on auto pilot, as it always is in cruise, and we had approximately 30 minutes remaining until our destination. I was focusing out my side window (right side of the aircraft). Our cockpit windows are curved, so the visibility is great. You can see up, down, forward and back just by looking out the side. Anyway...I was focusing on the night sky. I have seen quite a few shooting stars lately, so I was looking up at the night sky in hopes of seeing one on this night. I noticed that if you use off-center viewing, which we are told to do at night- you can see many more stars than the normal ""bright"" ones. It is amazing- millions of them. Anyway, I slowly started looking toward the horizon, and I stopped on two stars that were staggered kind of horizontal from one another. One was ""higher"" than the other, and they were staggered. I have absolutely no idea why my eyes stopped on these out of all the stars in the sky. They were not the brightest, by far, nor were they the dimmest. Just two average stars. And they were stars- not airplanes, not lights colored any different than any of the other million stars in the sky. I looked at them for probably three or four seconds (estimating of course)and to my complete amazement, the one in ""front"" (the ""higher"" of the two) started moving. And not gradually- there was no gradual acceleration- it was like someone flipped a switch, and this ""star"" started moving. And a moment later, the star behind it did the same thing. As if it was saying, ""wait for me!"" The two stars moved at rapid pace across the sky- I looked over at my Captain to get his attention, but he was updating his company manual, using a personal light that we each have built into our side panels. I looked away for only a second, but decided not to bother with him. I looked back up at the sky, and they were still there, moving across the sky. Two lights, that looked absolutely IDENTICAL to an average star, travelling as a pair, still staggered, just as they were before they started moving. The total distance the moved was from approximately 20% above the westerly horizon, the direction we were travelling, to just aft of straight above our aircraft, which is a huge distance. My point is, it's not like it was a night illusion where you stare at a light and after a while it appears to move. This was not like that. The lights moved almost half was across the sky. And to reinforce what I was watching, the two light came to a complete and SUDDEN stop. No deceleration, no gradual change. They went from a fairly rapid pace to a complete and obvious stop. The entire episode lasted, if I had to estimate, 20 seconds. At this point, I was still staring at the ""stars"" wondering what exactly I was seeing. I didn't want to take my eyes off of them again. They were now stationary, and straight up from us, in relation to the sky. As I stared, BOTH lights went from their ""normal"" brightness, and slowly faded out to nothing over the course of approx. another 10 seconds. They both faded out int the exact same manner, as if controlled by a dimmer switch. I realize this is a very wordy explanation for a sighting (or whatever you want to call it), but it was absolutely abnormal. I see aircraft fly by us daily, day and night. This was not in the normal operational altitude of a jet. It was, to use a general term, definately up in ""space."" It absolutely blended in with the stars, and originally was stationary. Why did I choose to look at these two particular stars out of the millions available? I have no idea. That's what really intrigued me- I thought, after it happed- holy cow- I've never really spent any amount of time really looking at the stars....and I spend a minute or so doing it tonight and I saw THAT????? It was an extremely odd sight. The very mechanical staring and stopping, the fading of the lights simultaneously when all the other stars around them did not change, and especially how the second light started to move in the exact speed moments after the first one. That's what really did it. Aircraft that approach us head on, with a relative closing speed of close to 1,000mph can take minutes to pass us on a clear night. These two lights covered almost half of the entire night sky in probably 15 seconds or so. And the fact that I took my eyes off of them, and came back and they were still there proved to me that it was no illusion. I was not scanning the sky hoping to see something odd--I did not imagine this. It was very very odd. I hope this is helpful to anyone interested. Thank you.

I first saw the unkowns when they were almost overhead.  They crossed the sky in only about 7 to 10 seconds.  They seemed high up- about the altitude airlines fly.  But hard to judge.  Just after I saw two satellites which moved much slower than the three unknowns.  The satellites were the typical faint white.  I very carefully listed for noise/sound from the nknowns...cupped my hands around my ears to hear better.  They were absolutely silent.  I live in a rural area; it was very quiet at the time.  One of the objects was considerably brighter than the other two.  The brightest object was not quite as bright as Arcturus.  The two dimmer objects about as bright as Polaris.  All were reddish in color.  The trails were reddish also.  The trails did not remain visible.  I heard several dogs bark 20 or so seconds after the objects dissapeared over the horizon.  They were quiet before the sighting.  Were any known American or Russian satellites undergoing orbital decay to enter atmosphere over Waterloo/Chelsea Michigan (about twenty miles west of Ann Arbor) tonight?  A satellite breaking up reentering earth's atmosphere seems the only logical explanation.  This sighting was a first for me, I have never seen anything like this.

Approximately half a degree to the right (SW) of the brightest object, two smaller, dimmer objects flew along side, one behind the other close enough that the second one seemed to fly inside the trail of the leading object. A fourth object flew to the left (NE) of the bright one; it was perhaps 4 standard magnitudes dimmer than the brightest.  All four objects traveled at a uniform, unchanging speed relative both to the ground and to each other (they never changed formation), and all four left a long trail behind them (approximately 4 degrees long), narrow at the emission point and fanning out much as an aircraft contrail does. None of them blinked or winked in any fashion and burned steadily for their entire transit across the sky. Their speed was much slower than the standard streaking ""shooting star"" but still 300-500 mph faster than a typical high-altitude jet liner. As mentioned earlier, they made no noise. It is difficult to estimate altitude but I would guess it to be somewhere between 10,000 to 30,000 feet (but this is could be very wrong). They traveled approximately 20 degrees to the north of the zenith (they passed close to the two ""pointer"" stars of Ursa Major, through the ""bowl"" of Ursa Minor, through the coil of Draco, into Cygnus near the star Deneb, and into Delphinus before disappearing behind a hill).

Within approximatly 30 seconds, they had travelled from my first sighting, on a west-east track and out of sight.  Approximatly 40 to 60 nm in distance.  The objects were in a formation with 2 objects above and to the left of 2 other objects  with one object in the centre, but at a lower altitude.  The lower object was the brightest and most defined.  They looked like a shooting star, with a defined, and bright white tail.  However, unlike a shooting star they didn't burn out, and were at an amazing speed.  No sound at all was apparant.  For these objects to cover this distance in this time period, they would have to be travelling in excess of Mach 7.

Shortly thereafter, maybe 5 minutes, I saw a airplane (slow moving) or helicopter fly directly into the formation or very close to it, and the shapes did not move or fade.  This area had a lot of air traffic from Midway and O'Hare airports and what was unusual was that these lights did not move at all as far as distance but they did seem to rotate after awhile as if a flag was being turned in the sky and rotating.  I went back to the neighbors house and everyone came out on their deck.  My neighbor took pictures with his camera and then videotaped the incident.  Wild!  After a while, one of the 3 red lights would fade for a second or two, then reappear.  Eventually one of the red lights disappeared altogether and then about 2-3 minutes later, the 2 remaining red lights began to fade and then they disappeared completely.

She was walking out some friends of the family and her sister to their cars and all 5 of those people noticed the lights. My mother then called myself, my Father, and my sister out to the driveway to see the lights. We then went and got our next door neighbors to come and see the unknown lights as well. Since I work at a 24-hour news station here in Chicago I called the station to try and let the news director know what we were seeing, however, they were unreachable. I then called two friends in two different parts of our town (yet still within Orland Park) to look up and see the lights, they too were able to see the lights. One of my mother’s friends (who had been walking to her car) she called her husband who was in Tinely Park (an adjacent town to Orland) and he too confirmed that he saw the lights. One of my friends in Orland that I called also saw the lights from his driveway with a family that was out ""trick or treating"". The ages of the witness' varied in age from 13 at the youngest to mid-60's.  DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS- there were three distinct Bright Red lights in the sky. These lights were similar to the red lights that are on top of Radio and Cell phone towers.  However these objects were moving, incredibly slowly. They maintained a steady pace similar in speed to a dirigible. The three lights were too far apart and too high to be planes, dirigibles, or balloons. Since we live in an area that has a high air traffic concentration (the O’Hare and midway flight path triangle) we are used to seeing lights in the sky, several commercial planes flew below the lights on there way to and from the airports. There was full cloud cover at a very high altitude, so we were unable to see any stars, however these three lights remained totally below the clouds during the entire 20 minutes.  DESCRIPTION OF WHAT OBJECTS DID- the three lights came in from the southwest when we first noticed, them moved toward the north (towards us), the three lights proceeded south east then after several of the people in our group had begun calling friends and family on our cell phones, the lights were too far away to be seen by 8:17pm. The lights maintained an obtuse scalene triangle formation during the twenty minutes. The distances between the objects remained relatively constant throughout the sighting. The lights did not change speed at all during the sighting, nor did they move in directions that would be impossible for conventional aircraft. Although the near ""hovering"" speed and the high altitude maintained by the objects completely rules out any helicopters. There was no noise heard from the objects.  DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUNDS OF OBSERVERS- I'm a 23-year-old college Graduate and I work at local 24-hour news station covering the Chicagoland Area. My father is a 53-year-old college graduate and has worked in sales for over 35 years. My mother is a 53-year-old college graduate and homemaker. My sister is a 15-year-old high school sophomore. My neighbor’s are in their mid-60's and both hold masters degree's in education, one is a college professor at a nearby college, the other teaches elementary school. Our friends of family included our former neighbor (ties in her 40's and a business owner), her husband in his 40's and is a business owner as well (whom she called on the cell phone), and her daughter (13 in junior high school). The two friends that I called on the phone are both 24 and are currently enrolled in college.

It was flat however, with no limbs of any sort such as wings found on an airplane. I could slightly tell the shape was reminiscent of a disk or saucer.  It began its journey in the near proximity of the moon. As it neared larger cloud formations I could at times see that it was going behind them. The only clouds present in the sky were the high cirrus clouds, yet like I said earlier, I could roughly discern a shape.  As it came from behind a cloud, it had lost its glow and now its shape was much more clearly prominent. It was then a dull metallic hue. Moments later it vanished from sight.  Its descent across 1/4 of the sky had taken no more than two minutes. Keep in mind that this was not traveling away from me. It kept its size and girth throughout and seemed to be traveling in an arc or semicircle around my location.  I frantically searched the dusk sky for the object but I could no longer see it. Resigned to thinking I had hallucinated, I walked away defeated all the while fighting the urge to run into a nearby restaurant and shout ""Did you see the UFO?!""  A quick glance caught me off guard as I realized that the object was back in the sky and glowing- only now it was suddenly traveling the opposite direction.  Correct me if I speak wrongly, but can a plane suddenly begin traveling the exact opposite direction in mid flight?

I will give you his email address also but for some reason he hasn't reported this as of yet.  I'm urging him to and I'm sure he will, but for now here is the info I have.  He lives in view of the Bremerton ship yard approx. a mile north from the water.  He told me tonight that this was the 3rd time he's seen this in the last couple months.  What was described to me was two balls of light, one bigger than the other, both hovering over the water and changing colors rapidly from blue to red to green to white then staying white and pulsating, then going back to rapidly changing colors.  One would move slowly to the left and then come back.  The other stayed there, hovering and moving to the left then right then holding position. The bigger one finally moved off to the left then vanished instantly, the smaller one stayed there until finally moving off and getting smaller, then gone.  I was on the phone with him while he was describing this to me. What I wrote down was this: approx. 8:40 pm to 8:48 pm on Tues. night Sept. 21st, 2004.  One big, one small, both pulsating and changing colors from blue to red to green to white, one moving off to left etc. I'm repeating myself so I'll wrap it up there.  The first time he called me after seeing these same objects was a couple months ago and I can get the details of that sighting also.  Both previous sightings he ran into the house to get his binoculars or monocular and when he returned to the deck they were gone. Tonight he had the mono with him and watched the whole time through that. I could tell he was quite impressed with what he was seeing and kept saying ""god, what is that, I don't know but it's not helicopters or military planes, I'll tell you that much.""  Then they were gone and our conversation basically ended a minute or so after that, I told him I would send a link to your website and also report the incident myself. He agreed.  So, since I have actually sent a picture of something in to you before, I decided to report this first, and then let you pursue an email conversation with him if you wish.  His name is ((name deleted))and just for the record does not drink alcohol or take any drugs etc. Sober guy and not likely to be making this kind of thing up.

My wife and I were looking towards the Big Dipper when we noticed a very bright white light traveling through the constellation.  It was headed in an easterly direction over Puget Sound, about 20 degrees above the horizon. My first thought was that it was a plane, but there were no colored or strobe lights. I see airliners in flight patterns all the time because my house looks north towards Sea-Tac Airport, and there were a number of commercial aircraft in the air at the time. The lights flight path seemed to be crossing the flight paths of the air traffic. My guess on the altitude was about 10,000 - 15,000 feet, and there were no clouds to interrupt our sighting.  We used a pair of binoculars to try to determine what the light was, and all we could see was a very bright light traveling in front of a star filled sky.  As we determined that it wasn't a plane, and way too low to be a satellite, it started pulsing then dimmed for about 3-4 seconds turning a soft redish color; and then it just vanished in the area of the constellation of Cassiopeia.  I used the binoculars to try and see if it was still visible, but I couldn't see anything moving among the star filled background.

Hopefully the text image below will come out correctly.  You should see 3 O's portraying the 3 sets of circular light schemes with each O at a corner of an equilateral triangle.  O O O  It hovered over the highway for maybe 30 seconds and quickly sped off to the right hand site shoulder behind the overpass.  As I approached the overpass it came speeding back over the high way.  It hovered very low.  It actually passed right in front of my car twice and then hovered off to the left and shined a light (almost like a small white flashlight) right at me from the right hand side.  This light came from one of the sides, not from one of the corners of the object.  It followed me for a little bit and I was going just over 80mph.  Then it crossed over the northbound side again and then went back to the right hand side where it vanished behind the overpass.  I saw it for probably close to a minute or two total but it seems longer.  I believe the color was black but i couldn't quite see it because of the lights.  I basically only saw the lights from it.  It may have been some one playing tricks on people because it was a very small object.  Not exactly large enought to hold little green men.  It probably close to 3 or 5 feet in length.  It was definitely not wider than my Civic.  However it had great agility and speed and it was silent.  I was definitely not the only person to see this.  Aside from my parents in the same car, there were a bunch of trucks on the freeway at the time.  I did a search on the internet at about 5:30 PM the same day to see if anyone had more info on this and I can't seem to find anything so I am entering in this info.

The light came on then after about 15 seconds, it slowly faded away. Approx. a minute or so later I saw the light again come on in roughly the same area. A few seconds later another to the west of the original came on, then one just to the east of the original, then another just to the west near the original and the last appeared between the 2nd and 4th. Here is how the series of lights appeared: (2...5...4...1...3). The shape of the lights when all were lit was slightly curve-shaped. After about 15-20 seconds the lights began to fade away. I pulled off the highway onto a road just on the south edge of town where I would be able to gain a better vantage point in a field. After stopping and getting out of my vehicle I ran to the field and looked again. It took a minute or so for me to notice any lights again, but one came back on then faded away as before. No other observances were noted this evening on the rest of my way home. There was another vehicle on the highway just behind me that should have seen it as well as we were driving north and they did appear to slow down once the 5 lights came on, but I can not say that this is why they did slow down. There was no other immediate reason for them to given our location on the road and no traffic signals to stop at. There were also other commercial aircraft in the sky during this time, but in no close proximity to the lights observed.",2004-04-27T00:00:00,,

The faint light was moving at a very fast speed in comparison to the aircraft. I was saying, ""wow!"" to myself, wondering what the heck it was.  And then, within a few seconds, a second light followed, on the exact same N to S path of the first light, also NOT blinking.  The first light seemed to intersect the path of the aircraft directly above me.  The second light was behind the aircraft with the blinking lights.  I tried to see if I could see the lights further south from my position, to see if they were continuing on the same N to S path, but just about the time the second light went by, my porch light went on (it's on a motion sensor), and I was blinded from seeing their trajectory after the initial sighting.  The first light had given me that ""wow!"" feeling, like the ""goosebumps"" type of thing, but when I saw the second light go by, it was a big WOW!, and I probably woke my neighbors!

Never increasing speed. There were times as I watched that the object would bounce up and down and side to side as if being affected by turbulence.

After passing the Lebanon exit, I began noticing lights moving inside the clouds closer to Nashville. As we got closer, I could tell that they looked like spot lights shining down from above or inside the clouds instead of from below, and they were moving in large circles. This night we saw two of them moving in large circles and figure eights from east to west over Nashville. One of the main reasons I became so interested was that my wife and I have seen similar lights before.  I filed a report back in 8/03 about lights we saw clrcling around inside the clouds during a big thunderstorm. We had pretty much conviced ourselves that this earlier sighting was a spotlight promoting something, or maybe lights from the Starwood Ampitheater, which we're kind of near (although I don't know why anyone would have continued to shine these types of lights during one of the biggest thunderstorms of the summer). These lights looked almost exactly the same and were moving in almost the same fashion, except there were only two instead of four. So now we had a chance to try to find the source of these lights and prove to ourselves that we weren't seeing anything out of the ordinary.  We closed in on the city from about 30 miles out and the lights became increasingly obvious. I'm sure other cars must have seen them, but there's no way to know. I had slowed down a lot because I was fascinated by these lights clrcling and seemingly swooping around just above the cloud ceiling. We kept expecting one to become more visible or distinct though a break in the clouds, but it never happened. They stayed very fuzzy and shapeless. The lights would circle opposite each other, then move together and back apart or do some crazy zig zag. However, we never saw a beam of light from the ground, and that was primarily what we were looking for.  We got off the interstate on Stewarts Ferry Pk., when we thought we were finally getting below the lights, and went east. I was driving, but my wife could still see them northeast of us, so I took a left on Lebanon Pk and went north. Now we were very close to the Nashville airport, but the general movement of the lights seemed to be to the northwest and we could never get under them. We were also getting around more city lights and it was harder to see them, and they seemed to be farther away from us. We were tired from our drive so we went on home, but we satisfied ourselves that these lights were not originating from spotlights on the ground. I don't know that it proves anything about the first lights we saw, but it makes me wonder. I know other people must have seen these lights, as they were all over above the city, so I'm hoping someone else will come forward.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

We had a clear view of the sky looking east.  About 20 degrees to the left of the moon there appeared one light, then two, then three; in horizontal configuration and equidistant apart from one another.  The width of the three lights when all of them were illuminated was approximately the distance of half of a full moon. They were brilliant white and several times larger than Jupiter’s appearance.  All three stayed on for four or five seconds and then disappeared in unison.  Five to seven seconds later and five or so degrees left of the moon one appeared again, then two, then three, in the same configuration and disappeared again.  To me, a plane or jet could not have traveled that amount of distance in that amount of time.

I was out walking my dog, came to a spot on the bluff where I can see the Sound clearly as well as the mountains and across to the Olympic Peninsula.  The sky was scattered with clouds, probably mostly clear, but as I looked to the West, I could seen an extremely bright object fiery object, the size of a baseball, that seemed to come from above a low-lying cloud and shot downwards from a slightly easterly direction toward the West.  My impression was that the object must have hit the water somewhere west, beyond the midpoint between West Seattle and Bainbridge Island. I could not clearly see where in the water it landed, mainly because there are some trees that would block my view, but as you said to me, and as I ponder it more, it seemed that it fell down below the horizon line.  At one point, I was certainly above it.  It took no more than a couple of seconds to move out of my sight down toward water.  I now wonder if it may have been something that fell off a plane or was shot up into the air and fell downwards?  The reason I say this is because of what you said to me in our conversation:  it made no sound or if it did, it was not much of one.  It was, however, very bright.  I looked around the water and saw a ferry crossing from Bainbridge Island going toward Seattle.  The boat was past where it might have landed, in my mind’s eye anyway.  I even checked with the ferry service to see if anyone reported it from the boat.  None of the TV news stations had any reports.  What did I eat??? It did not seem that it was something the trajectory of which would indicate that it had been shot up and then fell back to the earth.  It had a definite trajectory, east to west, and if it does not act like a meteorite, then maybe it was from an airplane.  It had that feel of something falling from the sky, not going up from earth and falling back down.  Does that make sense?  Also, if it were a flare, I would have easily heard the shot, and it didn’t act like a flare. I know you’re doing a show right now, but if you’ve got any other ideas later, let me know.  It sure was fast and furious, the way it landed, or maybe didn’t?!  And if it was a piece of airplane or space/satellite debris, then it was quite amazing too. Thanks for your time.

As I told her this, she replied that she had seen a similar ""shooting star"" about a week before in the area of New River, a town about 30 miles north of Phoenix. She said it occurred early in the evening, while it was still very light, and, again, had been an overcast day. She said the ""shooting star"" disappeared from view behind the mountains north of New River. The details stuck in my mind because November 8th was my birthday. I also investigated several websites dealing with meteorites and found that smaller ones are usually only traveling a few hundred kilometers per hour that low in the atmosphere. If it had been one large enough to be incandescent at that altitude, it should have made a large hole somewhere in west Phoenix, but there was no report of any such event the next day.

I thought I would share with you a recent sighting I had whilst staying at a friends place in the victorian country side. I had just left my friends home to go to the caravan that she had set up for me to stay in while I was visiting as I had not had the chance to view the night sky so clearly in years I spent some time gazing up at the stars. The property was in Dunkeld which is about 3 hours from Melbourne and was  in sight of the Grampians (which is a series of Mountains with very dramatic rock formations on them).I had a good torch which I was using to send beams up into the sky,  as I have always been a believer in Ufos since my first sighting as a child on the great Australian Bite....  I turned around and saw a object high in the atmosphere that was just hovering near to where I was standing. I shone the torch in its general direction and flicked the torch on and off a few times. The object proceeded to descend towards where I was standing. I did start to worry that maybe it was not the best of ideas to try it as you never know... It was about twice the height of the house when it was just hanging there I could see that it was a metallic grid like pattern underneath with a faint reddish glow.  I was thinking about calling out to my friend and her boyfriend to come and see but I wanted to observe it for as long as I could.  I am not sure how it changed but the next moment I saw it had a Pyramid shape and glowed a faint golden colour. I saw 2 spots of light one was red and one was green on the  bottom part of the Ufo. I called out to my friend and by the time she and her Boyfriend had come outside it had moved about 1 kilometre down to near the neighbours house ( Being on a rural property). They both saw it as a series of bright lights zig zagging in the sky.",2004-04-09T00:00:00,,

It moved at different speeds could stop on a Dime. This day while traveling home on 295 S from Baltimore to Bladensburg I looked in the sky when I was around exit I 197 and saw a bright object in the sky shaped like a football.  It was leaning to the right as if it was in the kickoff position.  It looked as if it was the smoke of a plane but the definition was too detailed on both ends. And the smoke never got dense from the air.  It was 350000 feet and was huge in size. It was as if you could see through the lines of smoke.  It stayed still and did not move.  I called my wife on my cell phone and told her what I was seeing.  I told her it is not moving. Then it moved staight down after I had watched it for 5 to 10 minutes. I lost sight of it because of the trees by the highway.  So I hung up on the cell with my wife and told her I would call her if I seen it again.  Miraculously, when I got near to my exit to get off I seen it right in fron of the place where we live.  I quickly called my wife and told her to look out the window and tell me what she sees. She saw it and was amazed.  I told her to keep an eye on it until I got home because I was almost there. When I got to the front of the apartment where we stay, she was on the balcony of the 8th floor watching the object.  She told me it had just went out of view.  She descibes a CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT, very bright luminus object, speeding up and then slowing down in mid air before going out of view.  I know it was not from here because we saw this object from different angles and I contend it was shaped like a football and she saw a Cigar shaped object from the 8th floor apartment.  With these two calculations I contend that the object was a disk shaped object that moved unlike anything we had ever seen in our lives.  It is almost unexplainable what we saw.  This was the real thing.  I first reported this incident on a sight called LUNA but the sight is now gone and it disappeared 1 day after I reported it on that sight.

I observed two lights that appeared to be stars upon first glance, but after closer and longer inspection I came to the conclusion that the two lights were far to bright and also to large to be typical stars.  The lights came to my attention as I was exiting my driveway at around 4:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, although, I simply disregarded their existance at first as the area that I was viewing them was just 3 miles away from Selfridge Air National Guard Base and to have planes and various other aircraft fly over and around this area are typical on any given day.  I proceeded to drive to a local cafe which had a drive through window and continued to notice the two lights that were fixed in the northern sky. The food order that I had placed took a considerable amount of time (about thirty min.), and I became to be interested when I noticed that these lights could not have been from aircraft as they had stood completely still for slightly more then a half hour. After I collected by food I intentionally drove to a dark secluded parking lot in Harrison Township which is just outside of my mount clemens where I had initially observed the lights, and I parked and gave careful consideration to their continued existance.  Upon closer observation and comparision to various stars that appeared in the same area as these lights I could see that ALL of the stars that were in the sky were so lacking in their brightness in comparision to the lights that I had now been observing for an hour that there was no way that they were anything except that of being man made in their nature.  After about two hours of careful observation the lights still remained in exactly the same location as when I first observed them, fixed very high into the northern sky. After the two hours of my time had passed, I tired and retreated for the night, last viewing the lights at around six a.m. eastern standard time.

I let our dog out around 10:25 last night and thought I would look around in the sky as the night was crystal clear and the stars were bright.  Grand Prairie is a suburb of Dallas.  There are always planes flying around and I enjoy watching their lights at night.  This night was different than any other I had evr witneesed.  I looked toward the east-northeast over Dallas and saw a star configuration of three stars perfect aligned, one above the other.  I noticed on either side of the middle star and equidistant on each side of that star, two objects which I could not discern as they were so far up.  The objects appeared to pulsate with a red,blue,and white or silver lights which were lined up vertically and in that order.  I thought it was odd that they did not move as planes do as I see so many from my neighborhood.  As I stood and watched these objects, I noticed they started moving in what appeared to be a lateral fashion in quick motions.  They moved in step with one another.  After watching these lights for several minutes, I went a got my wife, my 14 year old son, and my cousin who was visiting us to come see if they could tell me what they saw.  They were all astounded by these lights as well.  They witnessed what I did.  No one had any explanation.  The three stars aligned vertically were probably part of a constellation but none of us had ever seen pulsating or alternating lights in a constellation before.  That what led us to belive that we were witnessing something unusual.  At least to us it was.  The objects appeared much larger than the vertical stars.  It was just impossible to tell how far up in the sky they were.  I hope I have described this to some degree of specificity.  Never in my life have I seen such so this is my attempt at a description of unknown objects. We watched them for approximately an hour and then went back in the house.  I tried taking a digital photograph of them but the pictures did not come out as the objects were too far away.

It was bobbing up and down and wobbling back and forth and side to side all the while moving linearly from my right to left. It covered about 5 - 10 degrees of arc in that easterly vector.  The surface of the craft was like  polished black granite. The shape was circular about 30% high as wide and the sides seemed to be made of flat triangular sections that reflected the sun in a clear blue sky as it bobbed and wobbled. After watching for about 20 seconds I left to get my binoculars for about 20 seconds and when I got back it was not visible. There was no audible sound from inside the house during the siting. Temperature outside was about 60 F.  No wind. Slight haze on the horizon. No other visual observers present. Described the experience to my father as it was happening.

We were just sitting back relaxing and I saw a dark dot south of us moving northeast.  As I watched it I  was trying to figure out what it was. As it got closer I was looking for  wings and thats when  I SAID TO MY friend I see no definition to it. By then it was getting closer. We could see something dark that looked like a squsished donut. It was oblong but not too long.  Then the horses, dogs, two loose goats, started acting up, the wind started blowing, a cottonwood branch fell and and all three of us felt strange after that.  The wind was blowing just a little north of west, at about 20 to 30 mph. It lasted 10 or 15 minutes.  We observed the object for 2 to 3 minutes but the time is hard for me to calculate, it could have been 5 min. We ran around a tree to look at it, because the tree leaves were starting to block our view.  Then we couldn't see it so we ran around the corral which took 6-9 sec.  Then there was nothing. no sign of it.  I stood there with 2 other people looking, wondering where it went.

I am currently babysitting my grandchild fulltime.     My daughter and I were on their deck at about 8:30 or a little after because I was telling her about the curious jet/chem trails I had seen earlier in the day. We noticed a jet in the distance going straight up, and I mentioned how odd that seemed to me... I see them every so often and wonder where they came from... anyhow, we watched it for a minute or two, and then it just disappeared, the trail ending abruptly. We remarked that that was odd, because we could no longer see the ""jet"" either.   A few seconds later, we noticed an object moving in a south easterly direction which meant it was horizontally moving right out where we were looking... which was to the north.  As it came closer, we could see that it was actually more of a stunted blimp shape, but cigar shape is the closest to it that you have for me to choose from here. I was, I believe either silver or gold... the sunset seemed to make it look slightly reddish, but I could tell it was not red. It moved slowly overhead..we could both see it clearly. We waited to hear a sound, so we could be sure whether we were looking a plane or not. One can hear the sound of a jet that is so high you can barely see it. This object was not that high at all. NO sound. Nothing. We both watched it until my daughter suddenly asked her husband to get the camera. He ran to get it, and she tried to get a shot of it, but said it didn't appear in her sights. It didn't register. It was pretty much gone by then anyhow. Just wish we had thought of the camera right off. Would have been a great photo opportunity. Her husband saw it too, but didn't seem interested. It was her birthday, so I just looked at her and said ""Happy birthday. You have seen your first UFO. The only reason I feel so is that this object definitely did not have wings, was certainly ""metallic"" (not a blimp) And was absolutely silent in its passage.

This night we were sitting on our deck star gazing and tracking satellites.  We are only able to see a small portion of the west and northwest sky above and between the trees in our yard from this vantagepoint.   It was a partially clear night with a sporadic cirrus partial overcast.  We observed many planes and satellites.  The satellites were very visible when the sun reflection was prominent and would fade as they tracked across the sky.   Additionally, these lights would fade and reappear as they past through the wispy clouds.  Pretty typical sky watching fair.   At this time of year, at this time of night, the Big Dipper is at about 1:00 to the W NW.  Perpendicular to the bottom of the cup of this constellation and at a distance near equal to twice the length of Big Dipper is a bright star (planet?)  As I was gazing in the general direction of this bright star, another apparent satellite appeared over the treetop.  It came out of the west and was the same brightness and size of the star.  It was tracking toward us just to the left of it.  I called my wife’s attention to it and we watched it move.  Perhaps it was the viewing angle, but it seemed to slow in the sky.  Then there was an appearance of a momentary horizontal flash that emanated outward from opposite sides of this light.  The total length of this flash was perhaps a centimeter at arms length. The light then returned to its original size and brightness and changed direction.  As it traveled to the right, it got smaller and smaller, then turned orange or dim red and faded from view.  Interestingly, right after the flair manifestation, a shooting star was observed behind and to the left of the light.  (It was quite distant, only travelling an inch or so at arms length.)  At no time did this strange light travel past my sight line with the bright star, always staying to it’s left. ((NUFORC Note:  Flash from Iridium satellite.

After approximately 8 minutes the object started to move towards us, north, and to the west the and rapidly moved up behind homes to the west of our home approximately 500' due west. The object was now heading due north behind homes.  As object moved, we ran down stairs and out the front door. The object moved out from behind and directly above neighbors home and shape appeared to be diamond shape with cylinders at each corner extending up 20' high with white light, bright white light! It appeared to be solid light. The object was estimated to be 150' to 185' long. I purposely listened for any type of engine sound similar to aircraft, none detected. As the object gracefully moved past or from behind house accross street, it headed west with out tilting like typical aircraft and settled below ridge west of neighbors home with out noise and with in 150 to 300' of horizontal distance/travel.

I didn't actually see this object until it was pretty high in the sky due to the trees. It was going slow, like the speed of a single engine prop plane, and was bright like a planet such as Venus. The jets were going in my spa so I don't know if it was making a sound or not. What is strange is that it didn't have any flashing lights like a plane. There is airplane traffic that does come from this direction at about this speed, but as they get closer you can see the nav lights. It looks like it is pretty high up and I am thinking that since it is high up, has no nav lights, and is pretty bright then maybe its a satellite and its being illuminated as it heads toward the sun that is still below the horizon (sunrise is at 6:50). Then it slowly fades at a steady rate until I can no longer see it. It never changed speed or course, was going much too slow to be a meteor, but just dimmed out just before it go directly overhead.

I have done this in the past with good results. All one needs is a TV set disconnected from its cable input. A simple three or four element TV beam, hand held, is connected to the TV set. Now, it is simple to show that light travels at very close to one foot per nanosecond. The horizontal scan rate of the TV is 15750 per second. This corresponds to 65 microseconds or 65000 nanoseconds. So 65000/5280 = 12.3 miles across the screen. If a duplicate image image of the TV program is seen and is moving, such as an aircraft it will be reflected and changing. I have used this and have seen secondary reflections from stationary watertowers and it is quite accurate.  Good luck,  ((name deleted))  (elect engr)",2004-08-11T00:00:00,,

I was sitting out on my back patio at around 10:30pm and just looking up in the sky as I normally do at night, to check out the stars. I noticed a light in the North sky about halfway from the ground to zenith. I first saw it out of the corner of my eye and thought it was just a plane. When I turned to look at it I noticed it was not a plane at all. It was about the color and intensity of Mars was last year at its peak. It got brighter and brighter untill it was about the size of a small pea, stayed in one spot for 2 seconds, then it moved down the sky at about a 45 degree angle. It only moved about a foot in the sky and then disappeared without fading. It is totally clear here tonight. I said to myself what the hell was that? I don't think it was a meteor because it moved too slowly and I have seen some pretty good meteors in the past. Also I don’t think it was a satellite. I am pretty good about pointing out satellites to my wife and daughter, and this was not like them. It definitely was pretty high up and I did not hear anything. I have noticed weird things in the sky before but this is the first time here in Virginia. I reported sightings on this sight in the past (Coverse, TX 9/10/03 and Randolph AFB 7/5/03) I have also seen some weird stuff when I used to live back home in Rochester, NY when I was in high school about 12 years ago.

This light moved from south to north with no noise and no flashing lights (we live near McChord AFB and SeaTac flight paths and frequently see planes in the distance).  My second thought was a bird, but the light moved very smoothly, with none of the obvious ""Bobbing"" of a bird, plus it was illuminated from the east side, not the west where the sun was setting.  As I got to my front yard I could no longer see the silver light, however as I looked into the west I saw an orange colored cloud (from the sunset) off to the west.  As I looked at this cloud, I saw a gold colored ball appear.  It appeared to drop from the cloud (the best way I can describe it is like when a plane, coming out of a cloud, kind of fades into view)then travel in a northerly direction and then just flash out as if someone had turned off the switch (it could have re-entered the cloud cover, but I'm not sure of this).  At first I thought someone was burning and I was seeing embers flying through the sky except that you could clearly see them come out of the cloud and move toward the north.  About the third one I saw looked like it was moving toward the ground, then went back up and continued its flight to the north.  In all I watched about 10 of these gold balls of light.  At one point there were three in the sky at the same time each appearing to come out of the cloud and then moving to the north and disappearing.

It was moving south at the pace of a low flying airplane (reasonably quick), but it had no flashing lights and made no sound.  Because of this, I assumed it was VERY high up.  But I wouldn't think a plane that high would move quite that fast.  After watching it for a couple of minutes, it began to dim.  I watched closely as it faded to complete invisibility within about 20 to 30 seconds.  At this point it was still near the highest point in the nights sky, according to my vision.

This object was following the usual flight patter for aircraft going to Los Angles International Airport. However, what caught my attention was the color and brightness of the object and that it had no flashing lights like many aircraft do. The object was an orange color and seemed to be about twice the brightness of the other aircraft in the sky. I observed it for 2 minutes as it moved from the east to west in the southern horizon. Approximately halfway across the sky the object seemed to have stopped.  I then observed the object though my window screen using 10x binoculars. The object didn’t appear clear due to my screen being dirty, so I went out to my balcony with my binoculars and observed it there. This time I got a much better look at it and could not see any aircraft or shape in the bright orange light of the object. It appeared like a bight star about 5 times the size of the surrounding stars. Its color was that of hot burning coal, being that of a light orange color. While I observed it, the object was motionless and appeared to be hovering in the sky. I observed very closely thought my binoculars and this object didn’t move or drift at all. I could tell that it did not drift due to its distance from the background stars.  After 2 minutes of watching the object hover, it ejected a much smaller object about 1/10 its size. The second object was the same color as the first object and appeared to be about half as small as the background stars I was viewing though my binoculars. It appeared to fall straight down from the first object and left a streaking orange trail as if fell which then disappeared the farther it fell from the first object. This smaller object looked like a falling hot coal or ash, like someone would see at a fireworks display except there was no smoke or flame, just an orange glow. It might have been possible that there was another object in the streaking trail when the first one was ejected. It was hard to tell due to the glow of the streaking trail. I followed this second object as it fell for about 3-5 seconds. In that time it fell about half the altitude of the first object. I then looked back up at the first object to see if it would eject more objects. The original object didn’t eject anymore objects but this time it appeared to move towards the northwest. It moved slower to the northeast than it originally moved when it was going east to west. As it moved it went over the roof of my apartment and I lost sight of it, so I went downstairs to the parking lot to see if can follow its movements. When I got down stairs and looked to the northwest it was gone.  The object when first sighted was probably 3-4 miles to the south of me over the cities of El Monte, CA or Temple City, CA and then it moved north over Arcadia, CA where I was located. It was very hard to tell the size of the object or its height. I estimate that it was about 3000 to 4000 feet in altitude. However, it was very hard to tell its true altitude or the size of the object since it had no shape except that of an orange glowing light. Its speed was from what appears to be 100 MPH to zero.  It traveled about as fast as the background aircraft traffic when it was moving. There were numerous background aircraft traffic to the south of its position along the usual LAX landing patterns. Also there is the smaller El Monte Airport to the south about 5 miles away with mostly light private planes flying out of it. However, there were no background aircraft near the object itself, just in the distance several miles away. This object and the second object made no noise during the whole sighting.  When I first saw this object I simply thought was the standard aircraft that fly in the area. However, it was the brightness and the color of the object that got my attention. Observing it made me think that it was something other than an airplane or helicopter. First I thought that it was a balloon that was on fire, especially when I saw the other smaller object dropout of it. I thought that it was a burning ember falling from it and that it might land on someone’s house and set it on fire. Then I thought about it and realized that this light showed no flames and that if it was a balloon on fire that it would have burned up very quickly.  If it was a helicopter then I would have heard noise from it and it would have drifted a little even while hovering. This object made no noise and didn’t drift in the slightest when hovering. The light it emitted hid the shape of whatever object it was. Whatever this object was I don’t believe that it was any conventional flying aircraft.",2004-09-09T00:00:00,34.1326358974359,-118.03654871794872

It was just hovering over the mountain as noted.  At first we thought it was a radio tower light as it stayed in one place too long to be a helicopter.

We face north towards Grouse Mountain and the light was a slight North East direction. We noted it Fridays and Saturdays for about three weeks.

We usually observe said lights on and off for about three to four hours each night now as they appear early now; usually around 9:00 PM.  They do change position after a few hours but as we do not sit outside for the full time we do not see that actual change of position, but the spacing between said lights always seems to be consistent.

I have seen 3 sightings on 3 different days, but this is the latest one which happened 2 days ago.  What I saw was a sphere shaped craft hovering over my house at nearly 2500 feet. It did not move at all, and there were 2 times when it was non-visible then reappeared in the same original location. Although it was a nice day out, the craft appeared to be equipt with  the most personalised self luminous white light. This light looked somewhat neon white, or a flourecent white that was obvious to be seen.  My sister was outside with me, and I was pointing over the house but she was not able to see because she was seated under the umbrella for shade from the sun. I said, ""look at that in the sky.. If you see what I am looking at, you will believe in UFO's"" but she did not bother to get up.  I did have my camcorder with me, but was hesitant on filming at first because it is very difficult to find small distant objects in the view finder and LCD. Now this is a brand new 3 week old ""P*n*s*nic"" digital camcorder, plus I wanted to absorb it mentally, but then changed my mind.  I tried to look at the location of the craft by sight, this way I would not spend too much time looking for it with the camcorder. When I first pointed the camcorder into the sky and hit record I did not realize that the craft was in the bottom left corner of the viewfinder so I tried to zoom in thinking I did not yet find it. Shortly after I gave up when the light was no longer visible.  As I said before, this was the third sighting. This one appeared to be a stationary self luminous neon white light that disappeared and reappeared twice.  The other sightings were black spheres. The other sightings were also with my sister, and I again pointed out to look in the sky over the backyard which she did and saw what she described as ""birds"" possibly out of denial.  Just some backround info. I have lived in my relatives house for 20 years, and then moved out to an apartment complex in Brooklyn 13 years ago. It was great to get out from home but I have much difficulty adjusting to confinement in a small apartment with no yard. That is why I am always outside looking up in the sky from time to time enjoying where I spent many of my years as a child.",2004-07-25T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

It started with one white circular object that came out of almost nowhere and dropped above a tree on a corner of my girlfriends street.  The tree is proably 30 feet high and the craft hovered about 20 feet above that.  It sent down 4 beams of light to the street and just stayed there.  My girlfriend and I noticed darker squares or rectangles towards the middle of the circle.  After hovering with NO NOISE for about 20 seconds it lifted slowly then bolted out of sight.  It flew up first then down then out of sight. After this I was a bit excited and looked towards the skies.  Out of nowhere a triangular shape came into focus.  It was a pulsing red color and then as it got closer and in front of us it turned BRIGHT WHITE.  We saw about 15 of these, that came from the same direction, SE.  About 5 of the craft seem to flow back and forth, and change altitudes the other 10 just flew straight.  All started red, then proceeded to change to white.  I tried to put it all of this off as maybe a helicopter for the hovering object and maybe just some military aircraft for the other 15 but it just didn't seem right.  All were color changing (red to white for the triangles, and white with small dark squares or rectangles for the hovering craft) and seem to just handle much better than military aircraft. We called the local police and guess what the craft stopped coming, so the police thought we were crazy.  Maybe I was just exaduating, but to me this was more odd than usual.

They seemed to be in a tringle formation at first, then these lights began moving very fast, at first I thought  we were seeing spotlights. However, I realized that they probably were not due to the fact that they were ""following"" the car while they were chasing one another. Also, they seemed to zoom in and out, causing an interesting perception of distance in relation to the activity displayed. First they were to the left of the drivers side, then they came around to the front, then circled around the vehicle. One of the lights then began to appear yellow in colour, then blue again. I began to get a bit nervous (wondering if the lights could be following us), and decided to take the next turn during the drive home. My daughter said that the lights were following us. I did my best to ignore them, and about five minutes later she said they were gone. We made a call to tell my mom, she called back two hours later stating that she and my dad could see these lights as they drove home from a relatives house.

I thought wow thats a lot of airplanes at once, but as the blinking lights moved closer i saw that they blinked in a pattern, a huge triangle pattern. one light blinked at the top and then 3 or four blinks down the sides simultaneossly (spelling). this thing was huge and it moved toward the air force base. when it reached about the edge of the military property line it changed direction and instead of moving toward me it headed right towards the flightline and center of the base. I was on a cell phone with the a freind and she pulled up to see the top of the triangles blinking light before it disapeared behind a row of trees 2 steets away. It was high up enough that I could make out all the lights it, even though it never got on top of us,but it was not way up either. I would say about the level planes fly when they are mid level in the sky. it should have been low enough to be heard! they lights moved across the sky together never geting farther or closer apart so I kow they could not be a bunch of different planes. Well my freind and I stood staring into the sky and about 2 minutes after it disapeared a red circular light came from almost exactly where I had seen the triangle last, it moving swiftly our direction. It was solid red never blinking and it was at about the same level as the triangle in height. If it was a plane It would have been audible. It flew at the same level as planes in the sky that night that were clearly heard. this is where this gets military. I am at the far end of the base and I only hear planes take off when they are fighter jets. right when the red circle was overhead of us, we heard fighter jets or jet take off, the roar is loud and unmistakeable. as soon as we heard the roar the red light just was gone, blinked out. it did not zipp off or continue flying it was just gone. like someone turned out a light. I wanted to call military authorities but then I did not want my husband to be blacklisted or something. We are not a fighter base, but my husband says we have a few for defense purposes.  I think it is odd at the timing the fighter took off, and that it made the red circle go away. I have not slept all night long and i watched the news and no one said a thing. this triangle of lights was huge maybe a half mile across, and the red circle was about the size of an airplane. Large not the usual size of the blinking or non blinking lights on a aircraft, the light itself was as big as a plane. I think the red circle came from the big triangle. also odd was the fact that there were a number of airplanes in the area, so many so I commented to myself about it before this happened and then directly after it the sky in are area was completly empty. no more planes. I dont know if that is relevant or not but it stuck out at me. that the once busy sky seemed empty when these other craft arrived.",2004-10-27T00:00:00,,

Our house is about 6 to 8 houses from the lake, which gives us clearer skies away from city light. These things we see show up very often. They enter the sky or into view like a slow meteor getting brighter from yellow-brown to white-yellow. It got no larger or brighter than venus. It becomes visable directly over head going north. It also fades slowly in and out of brightness. From dim to bright to dim again, it takes about 10 seconds. It does this 4 times, while traveling a little slower than a satalite, until it goes out completely at an 45 degre angle from the horizon. I seem to see many of these things lately with different paths going north most of the time. When they come from the north, and become visable aroung the same angle to the horizon, they always stop when dim for about 10 to 20 minutes and go back north while doing their pulsing til they go out at the usual angle some where over the lake.

I am driving southbound on Jester Blvd. towards Ranch Road 2222.  We had just left my friend Tony's house on Crab Tree Road.  I have made it about a quarter mile away from Tony's house.  I had the fog lights turned on because there was so much fog i could hardly see 30 feet in front of the car and I am driving very slow because of the weather conditions as well as the many deer out in that neighborhood.  Plus I am driving my room mates 2004 Nissan 350Z Roadster and I am very aware and careful when driving his car.  I am heavily concentrating in the foggy road ahead then all of a sudden I see this green light right there in the fog in front of us in the sky.  it seemed to be about 50 to 100 feet high from the ground.  If I had to guess I would think it was about the size of a school bus.  The object flew from the right to the left covering about 100 yards within 1 or 2 seconds, then it disappeared.  At that moment I was barely able to get the words out of my mouth to my friend ""What was that?"" and as he is saying ""Did you see that?"" the object appears again after it not being there for at least 3 seconds and it seemed as soon as it reappeared it shot upward into the sky at a left kind of angle, the same direction it just shot towards, but upward this time.  I had two lady friends following us in their car riding together.  As soon as this happened I was concerned and pulled immediately over.  My friends pull up in their car next to me and I ask them ""Did you see that?""   The passenger (Lisa) says ""That thing in the sky?  I thought I was just seeing things"".  And the driver (Robin) says ""See what?""  So I know that since Lisa saw it that there is no way it was a reflection, or anything we were able to comprehend.  We only stayed about long enough to pause for a moment and then we decided to go ahead and continue to head home.  I looked down at the radio and the time was 4:14 am.  I do not know what time it was prior to leaving, but I honestly do not think there was any missing time lapse.  The more we spoke about it, the stranger it seemed.  I was driving a 2004 Nissan 350Z convertible and even though the top was up, we never heard a sound of a helicopter or a plane.  The headlights on the car are florescent lights and gives a good visual in the conditions we were in and there was nothing to justify what we saw.  Grand-it was 4:14 am and you may be thinking what were we doing up so late, that we must have been drinking and just seeing things.  And I will admit we had been drinking earlier that night out at a bar, but had not had a drink for over 2 hours, since last call in Texas is 2 am.  I had had 3 beers all night long and was totally sober and the designated driver.  For the record.  So anyway, Yesterday I was thinking still how strange this occurrence was and that I wanted to find out more.  I was thinking of calling my local Airport, but thought asking some desk clerk about a UFO she would think I was nuts.  So I got on the internet.  I came across www.ufocenter.com and thought this is who I need to contact and report this strange sighting.  So I spoke with Peter Davenport on the phone.  He asked me to document this report and this is what I am doing.  Mr. Davenport took my report verbally and during the process he has pointed out some things that now has me a little worried.  I am referring to Sleep Paralysis.  Just last night, one day after this incident I had what I call a ""Sleep Paralysis Attack"".  I will not get too into it, but it sure is strange timing.  I have these attacks maybe about once every year or year and a half since I was about 12 years old.  You can do a google.com search for sleep paralysis and read up more on it.  I did not have any visual during my attack.  So in detail about the object in the sky.  I will describe this object in the sky that I can not identify as anything I have ever seen.  Like I mentioned earlier the soul foundation of the object appeared to be about the size of a school bus.  It was long and narrow.  It had this distinct green light glowing in the shape of a bus.  And underneath the largest green light I described was this thin green line the same width of the large object.  And to the right of the object was a orange or red colored ball of light.  It all happened so fast, but the bright light of the object in the sky burned the image in my head and I can recall it like I am just seeing it now.  I will get my friends to try and give a statement of this occurrence as well.  I might be the only one out of us that is taking this so seriously, but I will try and get them to participate in anything you at the UFO Center need as well, because 3 out of the 4 of us were very fascinated and interested in what we saw.  Thank you for your time and interest in our story.

It appeared to be very large and many miles north of us, about 10-15 degrees above the horizon.. the lights did not appear to be moving at all, and overall had a slightly saucer shaped silhouette. After viewing for about 15 minutes, object dissappeared instantly, only to appear 45 minutes later in the same position but not as bright, as only a saucer shaped white light.(The individual lights were not distinguishable.) Again, after a few minutes of viewing, the object instantly disappeared again. No ""twinkling"" as most aircraft lights appear through the valley smog, and it appeared and reappeared in the same position over too long a span of time to be commercial aircraft on approach to Sky Harbour airport. If it was a jet, it must have been enormous, and I can't explain its spontaneous disappearance and reappearance ...

The lights were initially in a straight line from my perspective and slowly transformed into a triangle.  They seemed to continue in a triangular pattern although their reletive positions changed throughout its eastward course. As I watched their eastward progression with binoculars the triangle seemed to have its peak pointed north and the base to the south.  The top south light seemed to move down quite quickly and become lower in the sky than the light that was initially lower than it.  It then disappeared and only 2 lights could be seen.  There was no sound.  I could not see any structure around or between the lights.  Because there were clouds and no stars visable, I could not tell if anything was visable through the triangle.  Just now I came back in the house. At 21:25 I received a call that another single light was coming from the west.  It could be seen due west above the house line moving on a course east northeast.  This single red light flew over the house and as it approached a 1:00 position it was lost in the clouds.

I was driving west just passing Brookpark at Ridge Rd. and saw the triangle in a banking-type manuever. It was quite clearly backdropped against the sky, and I saw the VERY bright lights at each point with a subdued somewhat pulsating red light in the center. It was approximately 10 to 15 degrees above my straight-ahead line-of-sight and almost directly in line with my car, and seemingly only a couple miles up. There were more than a few vehicles also traveling around me, but I was too fixated on the craft to notice whether anybody else was also observing it. It banked to the south and traveled at a relatively slow rate, while I was able to keep watching it out the window. It was a starless night, at least in that location due to light pollution, but I could still make out the low, thin profile and the lighting beneath it. As I was still viewing it, I passed a tree line at the same elevation obscuring the view, and as I cleared the tree line, it was no longer visible. I have seen the Triangle type before in the late 80s on my way home to Connecticut, where it was amazingly low over the highway traveling at an exceedingly slow speed. The entire highway was apparently watching it as well, as we were creeping along and there was no place to pull over for the people stopped on the side of the highway. Last nights sighting wasn't quite as dramatic, but having been in the Marine Corps, there was no mistaking it for a conventional aircraft or other natural phenomenon.

I was on my way to an evening class.  I exited Cumberland Parkway onto I-64 ((CORRECTION BELOW:  I-65)), about 15 miles north of Bowling Green (or 75 miles north of Nashville).  I was travelling westbound on this 6 lane stretch of highway;it is  generally a N/S highway but this stretch from the Mammoth Cave Area to BG is east/west; traffic was moderate.  I saw in the sky in front of me what looked like three military jets.  There is often air traffic from Fort Campbell to the west.  The three ""planes"" were close together, but all three seemed to be going in different directions.  They were about 1/4 to 1/3 up from the horizon. Because they were low in the late afternoon sky it looked like they were illuminated by the sun.  It was a mostly sunny day.  Two of the objects looked like planes moving directly away from me, i.e. also travelling westbound, because they looked like little reflective, vaguely diamond shaped points of light.  As represented by the scale of my hand at arm's length from my face, the appeared to be about the size of wooden matchheads, about 10 inches apart, and both at the same height;  the third object just looked like a short contrail line (maybe 1 inch long on that same scale, in a horizontal plane, and appearing to be moving to the north, VERY SLOWLY.  They were quite distinct and quite bright.  I thought little of it, but the odd thing was that they seemed to be together, yet going in three directions.  Actually, the two  diamond objects, I observed, did not seem to be moving at all, but the line object was moving to the right, ever so slowly.  They were directly in front of me and quite bright, thus easy to watch continuously.  After about 10 minutes the diamonds still had not moved, but now the line, which didn't change shape, started moving back towards the diamonds.  After 10 minutes I knew that this was something that I could not explain.  I did notice that the objects were beginning to set like planets or stars.  Perhaps they were satellites, but were very fixed, except for the line one. After about 20 minutes, I stopped at a rest area right before my exit, to see if I could talk to someone else about this phenomenon, or corroborate what I saw.  I asked one man, and he noticed it and saw it for a long time as well.  I also asked a trucker and he hadn't noticed it.  By this time it was getting close to sunset, and the objects were too low in the sky to see.  When I got to class, the professor was tardy and I took the opportunity to ask my fellow students if any of them had seen it.  Only one man, who came along the same route, saw exactly the same thing that I described, although he though that the thin ""line"" object was spinning.  He also agreed that the two diamond objects were in a fixed relationship, the one to the other, while the other object moved back and forth.  Does anybody have any explanation for this?

I was traveling back home from trip to Washington D.C., and was observing air traffic out the window.  After traveling through an area in which contrail activity seemed suddenly elevated, I used the knowledge gained from a sighting I had, which I reported to this site, last month(3/31/04), to search the sky for unknowns. I spotted what I thought was Venus, except that it was brighter than I have seen before.  We were at 35,000ft. (our Captain reported this as our altitude) so this object was, in my amateur opinion, at about 50-60,000ft. It was either at a stand-still or was moving very slowly, because we passed it within a couple of minutes.  Our flight was steady, and we did not bank in any way at any time during the sighting(any banking would have been noticable because of the distant cloud cover providing a horizon-line for comparison).  This seemed important because the object moved from the front left of my view, slightly rising then lowering,then moving to the right, and then out of my view. To the naked eye, it appeared as a bright, bluish-tinted orb.  It seemed reflective and was much brighter than the surrounding sky. I was able to get off one shot with my camera, before my camera's battery died. Upon reviewing the shot, when I returned home, one can see that it appears more like a cigar than an orb.  I thought that what I had done was take a picture of another plane, and it being so far away it's detail isn't easily noticed.  But I have issues with this. First of all, I was viewing a large number of air craft on the entire flight, and every single one of the other planes left some type of contrail.  This craft left nothing that I could see, either at the time of the sighting, nor in the photo. Secondly, it was much higher than we were(as I said, we were at 35,000)and was moving much slower if at all, leading me to the question of what kind of plane would fit this descrption(i.e., SR-71 or U-2 for instance).  Not that some other more ""ordinary"" jet aircraft couldn't fly at that altitude for what-ever reason, but, again, it was barely moving. I am submitting the photograph, in it's original size, at 916kb, so as to keep it as close to the original as possible. I had to angle the camera up at approx. 45 degrees, and it was zoomed in to the max, 3Xs.  It is a ""Sony Cybershot"" digital camera.",2004-04-27T00:00:00,,

This ""object"" was apparently motionless but after about 15 seconds a long tail of ""flame"" appeared behind the object, indicating that it was entering the atmosphere from the north, thus the bright reddish glow and tail. The tail lasted about five seconds after which the object began to fade steadily and it turned to the east at a high altitude at a rapid speed, that of a fast jet. There were no aircraft style lights or beacons from the object. It faded in intensity after it turned east.  This unnerved me since I have never seen anything like this, and the apparent direction was from the north, which would be a strange direction of reentry for a typical spacecraft.  I am familiar with meteorites, which at the rate of speed on entry, streak across the sky in about 1 second. This episode lasted the better part of a minute and was obviously not a meteorite. I wonder if you have any information on this episode that you can share. A driver behind me also pulled over to observe this object. Whatever it is, the sight was extremely unusual and compelling. My daughter was with in the car and saw the object as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))",2004-04-27T00:00:00,26.136914681280647,-80.21914075569657

I asked my friend if he had seen the same light. He stated that he had. There was another couple standing in the lot as well and I believe that they had heard me say something about the light, but I do not know if they saw it or not. We continued to watch the sky for any further events. The conditions of the night sky was dark and mostly clear with a very slight haze as the light emminated tonight was not as bright as the night before from the objects. I did notice other commercial aircraft in the sky, but not near enough the obect or travelling in the same direction that would suggest that it may be from those. The lights were high enough in the sky to obviously not be any city lights just as they were the night before.

I happened to glance NW of my position and pointed at three large, bright lights in the sky. They seemed to be motionless, and almost looked like airplanes, but were too close together and in a triangular shape. My mom ran inside the house to get my digital camera while I stared at them to see if they were moving, but they appeared to be either at a stand-still or moving directly towards me. My brother came outside and looked at them and said they were probably airplanes, but I mentioned that they made absolutely no sound at all, and were close enough that they should have been rather noisy. He shrugged, watched for a second and walked back inside. I took four pictures of the lights, but only 3 showed anything other than colored pixels. After the first flash of the camera, the objects began to move slowly southward, toward Ahtanum Ridge. There was a large, distinctly triangular object in front, moving extremely slowly, and a smaller craft following closely behind it, blinking red, white and blue. If it had made noise, or moved in a different direction, it could have easily been an airplane. But it didn't, and as far as I'm concerned, it wasn't. There was a third one, the same size as the one in the front, following a little farther behind the smaller craft in the center. They were all traveling exactly the same speed, which was also why I decided they weren't airplanes. When you live in the same place since you were born, you know the air traffic and where it moves. Airplanes don't fly over Ahtanum ridge unless there's an emergency or touch-and-go training. Another reason I don't believe they were airplanes is because of their speed. All the planes I see, flying that closely (I couldn't give an accurate estimate as to the distance between myself and the three craft.) would make at least a tiny bit of noise. Considering the size of the outer two objects, unless they were stealth bombers, they would make quite a bit of noise. The smaller one, if it hadn't have been following the others, I would have easily dismissed it as an airplane at a much farther distance. Then they turned left at a slight curve and vanished over the ridge, heading towards Wapato, Washington. Mom and I got back into the car and headed north, and upon reaching the stop sign at a T-intersection, heard a car alarm sounding, coming from the left towards the fire station. All of the lights at the fire station were on, as well. The only reason the car alarm took us by surprise is because we live in the boonies and I had no idea anyone out here even had a car alarm. If they did, we've never heard it before and we've lived here for 18 years.  The reason I'm not attaching the pictures I took is because my mother sent them already in a previous report.

But I soon noticed that it appeared to be more than one light. The lights would converge and get slightly brighter. Then they would shoot outward spinning in a counter clockwise motion then coming together again before repeating. It looked to me that there were four of these lights. The lights were soft, diffuse, white in color and would become elongated the further they moved away from their convergence point. My wife saw this also, she called the local police to see if anything was going on in the area but they said no. We live in the country just outside a small town. I did not see any beam of light coming from the ground like you would normally see with a bright light and I would assume you would need a powerful light to illuminate the clouds as these clouds were very high. The only variance I saw with the lights was that sometimes the lights appeared to shoot farther out after coming together. My wife said she thought the lights changed shape slightly but I could not tell. This lasted for about 20 minutes. To be honest I have no clue what these lights were, I wondered if they may have been coming from above the clouds.

June 5, 2004 at 23:53 my wife, my sister and I were out with a telescope that we got at Christmas. We were in Charing Park in the Craig Henry area of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  The night was partly cloudy, mostly clear skies. We were facing directly at Jupiter, we had been viewing it with the telescope. I just now checked the evening sky map at skymaps.com and found Jupiter to have been due west of us. Earlier, I called the hotline to report our sighting, and I reported on the phone that the object was Northwest of us, but I did say that it was righ next to Jupiter. I correct myself here, for the record, it appeared just a few degrees South of due West.  All three of us were facing the right direction, at the right time. I can't speak for the other two, but I'm sure I was looking right at it the moment it appeared. It was a bright object, moving from South to North by Northwest OR from South to North with slight declination. It seemed to be moving in a slight arc, but that may have been an illusion created by its trajectory. It first appeared brighter and bigger by far than any of the stars in the sky. It appeared in the sky about as big as the eraser on the back of a pencil, held at arms length. We estimate that it was 30 to 45 degrees above the horizon, we all slightly disagree on this, but  I think it's a small enough range to consider it an accurate estimate. We all agreed that it travelled a handspan (at arms length) avross the sky, ending one fingers width south and two fingers widths below Jupiter. During this time it flared brightly three times, bright enough to illuminate a small portion of the clouds with each flare. I have been told that a bright flare from an object close above the clouds will light up a large area of cloudcover, but a bright flare from high altitudes will illuminate a smaller area in a 'beam'. This was probably the latter. It did not die out in one of the flares. It appeared, in the first instant, a constant intensity, flared, returned to original intensity, flared brighter (I think), back to original intensity, had its third flare, then a distinct period of slightly lower intensity tham at the start, before vanishing without a trace.  Two more observations that we made, but I think are suspect. We all thought it slowed down as it flared, BUT that could easily have been an illusion created by the flares. My other thought on that, and I'm not educated in this, so don't take my word for it, but maybe if it was something breaking up in the atmosphere it actually would slow down with each flare. We also thought that it may have slightly changed trajectory, its angle descending slightly with each flare, but again, perhaps an illusion.  In shape, I suppose one could call it a ""fireball"". It had no tail, no debris could be seen coming off as it flared, but maybe if it had been daylight we would hae seen debris, or a tail. The colour, though, we had to discuss. After the event, we tried to note all the details right away, but none of us ever said ""What colour was it?"" So now, 3 hours later, I remember it being red and green, when it flared it was more red with yellow. The other two remember it as being blue/green and flaring just brighter blue/green.  So this was all very exciting, seeing a ""UFO"", filling out this report, talking to the guy at the UFO report center. But in the end, I really don't know what we saw. I've seen pleanty of shooting stars in my life, and this was worlds apart from a shooting star. This moved way too slow, it was way too big, bright, and flashy!! On the other hand, I have no reason to thinks it's an ""unexplainable phenomena"" or a flying saucer. It made no maneuvers, no course change significant enough to be sure of, nothing to indicate that it was controlled. Though on a side note - if AVRO built an actual flying saucer that successfully lifted off, hovered and maneuvered a little then had a rough landing FIFTY YEARS AGO, imagine what 50 years of development would have done. SO I do believe in flying saucers, but not necessarily aliens. I'm pretty sure that what we saw was not a flying saucer, but we did see something. It wasn't a shooting star, it wasn't an iridium satellite flare (which I just learned about at heavens-above.com). So what was it? I gave this organization permission to contact me, so if you have any suggestions, or if you witnessed the event, report it to this website and they can contact me. I'd love to get a reasonable explanation.  OH! I almost forgot! Two last details, there was no sound associated with the sighting, air traffic seemed heavy in the area in the hours before the sighting.",2004-06-18T00:00:00,45.3813825,-75.70850071428572
