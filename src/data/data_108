Possible near Earth pass by a large asteroid. Event Date: 01/17/2016 Event Time: approximately 14:56 Central Time (GMT – 6:00) Location Coordinates: 32°37'55.0""N 95°27'34.0""W Location Name: Mineola Nature Preserve, Wood County, Texas Weather Conditions: 52° Fahrenheit, clear with scattered thin high altitude clouds, a light breeze, and with wind gusts up to 13mph. Object description:  The object appeared to be oblong in overall shape but irregular similar to a potato.  It appeared to be silver blue very much like the moon seen during the daytime.  Its apparent size was slightly smaller than your thumbnail viewed at arm's length.  It appeared to be blurry or hazy like an object viewed through the atmosphere at great distance.  This is in contrast with the commercial jets seen at the time that were in sharp detail and white in color.  This object made no detectable noise, made no condensation trail, did not appear to be burning in any way, and was very obviously at an extreme altitude. While visiting the Mineola Nature Preserve out on foot, me and one other family member we were watching the local aircraft.  There was a small Cessna aircraft and a biplane flying at low altitudes, intermittently performing aerial acrobatics.  This location is approximately 100 miles East of the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) area and other commercial aircraft were traveling from West to East leaving the major airport hubs of the DFW area at midrange altitudes as they climbed towards but have not reached cruising altitudes.  As we could easily hear the engine noise from the commercial aircraft, we would look up at them pass nearly directly overhead which is when we spotted the unknown object.   At approximately 14:56, as a commercial aircraft passed almost directly overhead traveling East South East we spotted this object traveling North.  As we watched the object it progressed from almost directly overhead to the north.  It became difficult to see as it reached an inclination of about 35° above the horizon. The time it took to travel from approximately 90° above the horizon to 35° was between 15 seconds and 20 seconds.  Immediately after loosing track of the object I checked the International Space Station (ISS) tracking website (http://www.isstracker.com/) to rule out the object as being the ISS.  The website showed the then current position of the ISS as being over the Northern section of the Red Sea Moving North East.  Conclusion:  After waiting a few days to see if this object was reported by any news agency I decided to see if I could calculate the objects speed. Knowing that I can not accurately determine speed without knowing its altitude, I calculated this objects speed using two potential altitudes.  These two altitudes were 35,000ft for a possible commercial or military aircraft and 200 miles for something passing at an orbital range.  With the 35,000ft altitude, I came up with a minimum speed of 1,700mph up to 2,500mph.  With the 200 mile altitude, I came up with a minimum speed of 51,300mph and a maximum of about 68,000mph.  Given that there was no sonic boom and that the object was hazy and indistinct in a perfectly clear sky I believe that this object was outside of the atmosphere and passed very close to the Earth.  The downside to this belief is that any object that could be seen during the day at that distance with that apparent size would have to be very very large.",2016-02-04T00:00:00,32.6746,-95.4217

Tuesday, 19, 2016, at about 6:25, south-side of Little Chute, on the north-side of the Kimberly/Little Chute Bridge an orange oval globe appeared.  The globe was not emitting light as a street light does.  It had a defined oval shape and larger than the streetlights about 2 blocks away.  No noise, stealthy at our location. It was traveled east at a rate about 5 times faster rate than an airplane for about 15 seconds.  It stopped and hovered for about 4 seconds.  Then it moved back west the exact same path but only ¼ the way for about 3 seconds. It stopped and hovered for about 5 seconds and slowly descended at a much slower rate than when it was traveling east and west.  It was descending because the size of the oval globe did not change size. I lost sight of it when it went below the tree line on the other side of the bridge. A few weeks prior on a Thursday evening around 20:30, at the same location, 2 of us saw the same orange oval globe, but 3 appeared in a distinct formation.  They appeared at the same location, traveled the same path going east and at the same rate of speed.  The globes did not stop, just continued east until they were out of our sight. We were trying to figure out the size and altitude comparing it to an airplane.  We sighted a plane going west but higher than the oval orange gloves did.  The globes were definitely moving at least 5 times faster than the plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Its color and shape changed from looking like a distant white landing light initially, to slightly larger rectangle of reddish/yellow color flickering like a waving flag.  The sighting coincided with the time of sunset that day, however I ruled out reflected sunlight due to the many layers of clouds creating relatively flat light. As I approached the object, I had a growing concern that it may be a balloon of some type possibly on a cable or cable suspended below it.  I changed course about 5-10 degrees east to avoid possible hazard. After about the 6th or 7th minute of observation the object completely vanished!  The rest of the flight was uneventful.

On the evening of December 31, 2015, and into the morning of January 1, 2016, at Fairbanks, Alaska, I witnessed the following:   While driving my vehicle south on the Parks Highway, near the vicinity of the University of Alaska farm fields [Geist Rd and Parks Highway off ramps] I noted five objects rising from the left [west], at near-ground level and move across the highway at an altitude of 300-400 feet.  They appeared under independent control and seemed to be making a 5-sided 'sign' in their arrangement.  I initially assumed they were fireworks on parachutes. The time was just before midnight and fireworks were evident in this built-up area that includes residential and light commercial development.  The area of activity is between the Fairbanks International Airport and the University of Alaska. The objects were both stationary at one moment and then in motion as a unit. I stopped the vehicle, exited to the roadway for a better look.  There was no sound.  The objects appeared to be circular, 15 to 30 inches in diameter.  There were no other discernible details of surfaces.  Each appeared to be emanating a red/yellow glow or pulse that remained constant.  The 'fire' color conformed closely with the area where it was coming from.  The light appeared to make a small protruding tail to the steady pulse/glow. It was brighter at the center. Over a period of 20 minutes, I continued to observe the phenomenon.  The objects did not dip, as a helicopter does when it moves forward.  Once climbing, they did not move to a lower level.  The original 5 units slowly climbed into the sky, spread out, moved to the east [toward U. S. Army Fort Wainwright].  The lights appeared to blink out and the craft vanished in the darkness. After stopping, I had doubled back on the highway, and stopped again, where I noticed three new craft, similar to the first five.  They were flying over the roadway in the same fashion to the others.  When near to the ground they were tightly grouped and as they climbed they spread out.  They, too, headed east, climbed higher and disappeared. I am aware that the University of Alaska has a DOD contract for development and testing of advanced drones.  During daylight hours I have observed a drone flight a few miles from this vicinity.  Further, as mentioned, DOD maintains a large post within 6 miles of the sighting location.

Sacramento area. Midnight 2016 New Years On December 31st/January 1st very close to midnight while traveling south on Ca. Hwy 99, from Sacramento to L.A.. Just south of Sacramento, about Elk Grove area. I noticed 6 to 7 light peach colored, illuminated objects in the sky. Moving in a Easterly direction. Having been in the Air Force and seeing many air shows at first I thought they were a formation of military helicopters, they were moving about that speed. Slow and steady.  They did not appear to be that high up (less than a mile. Maybe a half to 3/4).  Being night time it was difficult to tell.  Also, being in a big rig and on a hwy it was not possible to tell by sound (too noisy).  For that same reason I could not tell if it made any noise. The formation was very odd as well.  One I've never seen before. 4 points to make a square, then one above to form what would look like the pitch of a house. Then another 3 times the length out from there.  Pointing in the direction it was going.  East, north easterly. I've been a night driver for many many years.  I've never seen anything like this before. My gut feeling was this was not E.T.. I did not stop for a better look. So I could not tell if this was one object with lights or several objects (by seeing if there was a star field between them).  They moved in perfect unison. I watched them for about a min before they and I passed beyond my windshield view. The color of the lights were very odd.  Like no color I've ever seen on a flying craft. Not red nor orange. More like a faint peach color. Or a spot light turned down very low (color wise) yet the light was very illuminated.  Having flown and taken lessons planes have two colors.  One on each wing.  Red and blue or blue green.  White lights forward.  Never peach. I thought about a blimp for New Years, that's possible, but I sure could not make out its message?  For what it's worth.  Much further south out around hwy 41 and 46 on both hwy 99 and Interstate 5 we have many night time crop dusters that you can get all kinds of crazy light formations (not different colors) because they fly in very weird positions to prepare for crop dusting in a very short span.

In the winter of 1990, I was driving my girlfriend back to Winthrop College in Rock Hill, SC, from Columbia, SC, where I lived.  We would often take back roads, rather than I-77, to break the monotony, since we made this hour long drive twice on most weekends.  I think we were on Hwy. 200, or some other curvy secondary highway near lake Wateree, north of Fairfield County, when we saw the object on this otherwise abandoned and empty road.  It was a cold night with a cloudless sky. My first thought was that we were witnessing the undercarriage of a large blimp because the object seemed to be moving slowly and silently at about the pace of a light breeze.  I soon realized that it was far to big to be the undercarriage of a blimp, and I could see stars above it.   I stopped the car and got out to watch it.  I did not know what I was looking at so I crouched down behind the open door of my VW Golf to watch, and started shaking.  It was cold, but I was also scared and excited.   What we saw was a triangular object which seemed to be at least a couple of hundred feet long, but possibly much larger.  It also appeared to be made from beams and cross members because I remember seeing stars in the sky through it.  It also had lights on the corners which reminded me of the can lights you see in theaters (the ones which you use different color films over to light a stage).  The color of the lights were a dull greyish blue-green.   The object was not very high over the pine trees as it passed and If I had to guess I would say it was no more than 200 feet off the ground and possibly only 100 feet high.  The object was almost silent, but I remember hearing a low rumble which increased and decreased in tempo so that it sounded like I was hearing a diesel train engine a mile away loading cars.  I have often asked myself if I was hearing a train in the distance or if the low rumble came from the object.....I am unsure. After we watched it pass we stood in shock, speechless.  We got back in the car and talked about how we would need to contact the authorities or the news paper to see if anyone else had seen this huge object, but it seemed to completely and strangely slip our minds that we had witnessed this.  It was not until about a year later when a friend and I were making fun of someone on TV who claimed to have been abducted by aliens, that it all came back to me in a rush.  My friend was incredulous and did not believe me so I asked him to call my girlfriend which he did.  She told him exactly what I told you but was also surprised that it had completely slipped her mind from that night until a year later. About 15 years ago, I wrote down the details as best as I can remember them and drew a sketch of the object.  It was not until about 10 years ago, while I was telling my father and his wife about the event that I was introduced to the idea that others have seen triangular object too.

It would move in any direction up, down, left right, it was crazy and amazing at the same time.  We didn’t know what we were looking at but we were not scared.

I'm a grad student at the University of Georgia in a physical science.  I was looking at Orion and noticed 4 dim lights moving across the sky above Orion's head.  The lights were dim (about as bright as the stars in Orion's sword or bow) but arranged like an equilateral triangle pointed in the direction of movement and the fourth light was on the left back side (if you extended the left triangle side back along the angle of the triangle's side).  All lights were pretty equally spaced (except the fourth light from the far triangle's other vertex).  No odd color or flashing seen.  No sound.  Overall size/spread comparable to the Pleiades. They moved pretty fast in a ~330 degree heading.  I tried to see if the shape would eclipse a star (to see if they were four lights on a single craft/plane) or if they were separated with nothing between the lights, but the lights didn't pass over any stars I could see.  I lost it in the city glare about 10-20 seconds after spotting the lights, when it had covered about 1/4 of the sky. It honestly looked very similar to a simple satellite crossing the sky, except there were four moving in motion together.  I didn't notice any obvious individual light movement or change in relative position between the lights, but I think I saw a slight change in the relative positions due to perspective change as it flew farther to the northwest. No way to estimate altitude, although it was large enough that if it was a plane, it would've been low enough to hear probably. If four satellites could be placed together and move together across the sky, that would look just like this.  But I can't find evidence of that actually happening (plus that seems risky for satellites) and I've never seen that in years of looking at the sky.",2015-11-19T00:00:00,33.94030647482015,-83.39980047961632

While driving a passenger vehicle east on Oregon Highway 212 in Clackamas, Oregon, I observed a golden-yellow object in the sky southeast of my position.  It appeared to be one very bright object, a square or diamond shape at the top and a bright ""starlike"" point of light at the bottom of the diamond.  As I watched, the bright ""star"" separated from the square looking ""top"", and drifted very slowly away from the ""square"", appearing to be descending toward the ground. Both the ""star"" and the ""square"" were visible against a clear blue, brightly lit morning sky, the sun had not yet risen above the horizon.  The golden-yellow color of the objects were similar in color to a sodium vapor street light, but much brighter, and appeared to be shiny and metallic.  Neither object appeared to be moving horizontally.  My first thought was that the object was a cloud, but there were no other clouds in the sky and this object appeared to have clearly defined boundaries, and the top looked like it had straight edges.  The objects were between me and the rising sun, seeming to be backlit and not reflecting sunlight. The objects were very bright, the larger of the 2 being much brighter than a full moon, the smaller being much brighter than Venus in a dark sky. I was working at the time so had no opportunity to stop and observe, or get a photo.  I lost sight of the objects when I had to change direction to get to my destination. My wife was traveling the same road in the same direction about 5 minutes behind me and observed the same objects, but because she had a different destination she was able to observe the objects until 07:25, whereas I lost sight of the objects at about 07:15.  She was able to intermittently observe both objects, the ""square"" lost its brightness and disappeared leaving behind a puffy cloud that faded from view. I believe the objects were a few thousand feet in the air and 2 to 8 miles away, somewhere over Carver, Barton, or Redland Oregon.  If they were any farther away than that they would have been huge.  The ""square"" was about 1/2 the size of my little fingernail held at arms length, the ""star"" was a very bright point of light.

My incident happened as follows:  I parked my car and got out to walk into work.  I immediately saw a very large, white static light coming out of the west.  Too large and bright for anything I had ever seen before.  I don't know how far away it was when I first saw it, but, I knew it was coming right at me.   I kept walking through the parking lot towards the door because I was a little scared.  As it got closer I could see a slow blinking green light on the left (if I would have been in the craft it would have been on the right) and slow blinking white light on the right.  It then went directly over my head.  There were four large static bright round white lights underneath.  They almost looked as though each of the lights were made up of two half round lights.   The lights were positioned like there would have been one in each corner of a rectangle.  I could not see the shape of the craft.  I was desperately trying to, but between the  bright lights from the craft and the light at the door I was standing at I couldn't see a shape.  Plus it was also completely cloudy that morning so there was no light above it.  There are large trees there, probably 60 to 70 feet tall.   I estimate the craft to have been 700  to 800 feet up.  It was not flying high.  What freaked me out most was the lack of noise.  It was a very soft sound of air moving as it flew above me.  As it moved away, I saw a slow blinking red light.  It moved in a straight line towards the east.  It never made any erratic moves.   That's what I saw and I would love to know what it was.  I can't stop thinking about  it.

This was not a small object like a toy drone.

How much bigger than that it was, I don't know because I couldn't see a shape.   Please if you have any questions or  know what this was please email me.

This is an analysis of the details of a “sonic boom” event reported along the New Jersey coast and surrounding areas.  The shaking was reported to have occurred around 1:23:45 PM local time on January 28, 2016.  After initial reports of ground movement came in, the USGS determined this was not an earthquake, but originating in the atmosphere.  They estimated that as many as 9 sonic booms were reported, which the US Navy has since attributed to a supersonic flyover by two jets in Naval airspace, located approximately 14miles offshore. However, when one digs deeper, this explanation doesn't adequately explain the facts.  To clarify the details, I have included a diagram.  The diagram is based on the USGS ""Did you feel it"" map of the event, which recorded eyewitness shaking reports made to the USGS.  I should point out that people generally contact USGS to report an earthquake, not a loud sound.  In my personal experience with several low-altitude supersonic flyovers, I have heard a sharp sound/air blast, but felt no ground movement.  However, in this case, ground shaking was reported as far away as 70 miles from the Navy airspace, as shown on the map. The effects and range of sonic booms has been carefully studied.  Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately 1 statute mile (1.6 km) for each 1,000 feet (300 m) of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at 30,000 feet (9,100 m) will create a lateral boom spread of about 30 miles (48 km).  In this case, we have reports from as far away as 70 miles.  So if the sonic booms were generated offshore in Naval airspace, that means the boom width is twice that, or ~140 miles.  Plugging that value into the equation gives us an altitude of 140,000 feet.  This is more than twice the stated operational altitude of the F-35C, and 3.5X the operational altitude of the F-18. Therefore, I find it rather difficult to accept the official Navy explanation, as it simply does not explain all the observational data.  Even at first glance, it's hard to imagine how two small aircraft could displace enough air to cause ground shaking 70 miles away!  All the observational data should be considered to find a better explanation, wherever the facts may lead us.",2016-02-04T00:00:00,39.4628858490566,-74.48528679245283

These lights were bright white in front and flashing red lights from side to rear.  After I passed and looked back they were no longer visible, however there were several more ahead of me. While driving, I noticed several vehicles pulled over and people standing on the side of the road staring at the objects which drew my curiosity to watch these lights closer.

Roughly 200 ft. west of Hwy 87 and approx. 500 feet above ground. I didn’t become suspicious until about the 6th light that I passed, I then pulled over about a mile before Bush Hwy exit and got out of vehicle, it was very quiet, no sound and objects remained very still, hovering.  I tried to capture a picture but it only looked like a bright dot (crappy cell phone camera). After approx. 5 minutes of watching these objects remain motionless, thoughts began to run through my head, as I was trying to rationalize what these were, drones, planes, or military crafts etc. My only logical conclusion was UFO’s which prompted me to get back into the vehicle and drive away, heading northbound on highway 87.

I got closer to it and identified the shape as rectangular; proportions similar to a semi trailer or possibly slightly longer.  It was traveling slower than a helicopter and slightly higher than helicopters usually fly.  It was pretty low. The craft was sharp and clear.  Size, thumb at arm’s length would probably cover the height but not the length.  It seemed to have two sections.  The back section was the same height but only about ¼ or &#8531; the length of the leading section.  The sections were slightly separated although there was some sort of narrow bar between the sections connecting them. The rectangle was a burnished silver color.  The bottom was darker, I suppose because the sun was not shining directly on it.  Between the two sections it was much brighter except for the bar.  It either had a light source or perhaps it was the angle of the sun. I don’t know.  There were disruptions in the texture along the side of the front section.  They were indistinct.  They didn't look like windows but there was something different along the side in four or five noticeable areas.

She witnessed the three lights in triangular formation, and the two lights following closely behind.   I ran back inside, and woke up my visiting parents so they could also observe.  The four of us watched as the three lights in triangular formation separated from formation and slowly rose in altitude in to the clouds illuminated by their light.

All lights were moving in the same general path, rising in altitude above the clouds and out of view. Yes it was early New Years day - No, we were not under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

There was absolutely no sound and they appeared as perhaps the brightness of an average star with a fuzzy-red quality to them.   Earth-bound aircraft must have strobe lights.  These had none.  One sped into view going in a straight line and, within one second, another followed even faster, catching up to the first one.  They then diverged from one another, making several immediate and instantaneous sharp angle turns.  This is something our aircraft cannot even come close to achieving.  It was as if they were doing aerial maneuvers in a somewhat playful way.  At one point it appeared like they might run into each other.   I cannot tell how fast they were moving because I do not know how far away they were.  One is a function of the other.  My best educated guess would be they were one mile away which would put their speed at something like 600 mph.  I base this on seeing airplanes flying at a given pace at 30,000 feet knowing they are moving at 500-600 mph.  However, they could have been 20 miles away putting their speed 20 times faster, or 12000 mph. Both scenarios are equally plausible.   The whole viewing lasted maybe 5-10 seconds and it was frustrating that I couldn't see it over and over again in a rewind/play/rewind fashion.  It leaves more questions than answers....Could these have been drones?  That thought entered my head but I've seen drone flight aerodynamic characteristics on line and there is no way they come close to what I saw....I was just lucky enough to have been looking at the right section of the sky at precisely the right moment.",2016-01-29T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

It was a particularly clear sky that morning, I recall, as I had been on the road before the sun had even begun to rise.    About 10 minutes after getting over the Sunshine Skyway, I kept thinking I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, to the SW of my present position.  Because the Tampa airport is so close, MacDill AFB, and many private air fields, I normally wouldn't think twice about anything in the sky; but it seemed unusual.   The road took a slight bend, and the treeline disappeared, allowing for a much more clear view towards where I was noticing something.  I then saw what I would have to assume was 2 lights?  It was too far from me to decipher much, and I was going 70 mph, but it seemed stationary.  Considering that perhaps my rate of travel was off-setting the stationary appearance of the object, I moved into the right lane so I could slow down to see it more clearly.  The object moved in a pattern that formed a small vertical circle, but did so very quickly.  Judging by the distance, it was atypical for anything I have seen to date.   It did this several more times, while intermittently flashing light(s) so bright, it seemed difficult to tell if it was so bright that it appeared blue, or was alternating more than one light with various hues.   It then moved about 25 degrees to the south in what seemed like the blink of an eye, before vanishing so fast that it left a silver hazy streak behind.  The streak disappeared within a second or so, but as a first time observer of an object such as this, all I could do was close my mouth.   I have never experienced anything remotely close to this, nor have I been aware of any manned/unmanned craft capable of such precise movement, at such a high rate of speed.

The craft was surrounded a glowing haze that made it slightly blurry, and was illuminated by six or seven white lights, one of which was flashing.  The lights appeared to run around the perimeter of the craft, It also had one red light which seemed slightly off center of the middle.  The lights were so bright they lit up my bedroom and illuminated the ground and trees, it was like lightening.  The craft also made a really loud sound, that reminded me of an airplane and a lawnmower joined together. We often times see helicopters and planes flying over Baldwinsville, some quite low, so I am very familiar with normal air traffic.  I am positive this was not a helicopter or any airplane that I have ever seen.",2015-11-19T00:00:00,43.1587,-76.3327

In the daytime and a very physical looking object it was. The below described phenomena was quite different. I am a professional photographer (sorry did not have a camera on me - I was outside smoking my first cigarette of the new day) and was raised as an Air Force brat and have always watched movements in the sky just out of curiosity.  I guess it comes from always wanting to know what kind of plane was flying over head.  Hey, I was a cold war baby. OK so now to what I saw this morning. Looking up into still very dark morning sky, many stars still quite bright and visible, and just at the head of a vaporous string of light clouds moving to east, I noticed two perfect illuminated semi circles creating a broken full circle of light moving together as if facing each other.  They were traveling South West directly overhead, over Gresham, at a very consistent rate of speed. That broken but perfectly shaped semi-circle expanded slowly until it reached a consistent point, that if it was, let’s say at 70,000 ft, would be three or four hundred yards across.  Off to side there was a flash of bright but contained light.  Almost as if a large star just appeared and then disappeared. The broken semi circle of illuminated light kept moving in it’s original direction.  The bright flash of light happened again but this time in front of the moving broken semi circle.  The light again seemed to disappear.  But then reappeared almost immediately at the head of the the forward part of the semi circle.  At this point in the dark morning sky there were no illuminated vaporous clouds that were visible in the slightly to the north sky when I first noticed this phenomena. The trailing part of the semi circle band of vaporous light just disappeared and the forward semi circle now reshaped itself into a strange funnel shape as if illuminating directly out of the bright star like light, but off to it’s side - in a different orientation then it’s preceding travel shape. Both the bright star-like light and the funnel vaporous light traveled together in the same South West direction and then both instantly disappeared for no apparent reason. I would like to back up and rephrase that when the leading semi circle changed it’s shape and orientation, it’s shape defied what one would think of as either a light illuminating out into the atmosphere or a plane’s light or illuminated rocket exhaust. Imagine a star moving that had a headlight shining off to side at an angle but the light pattern was semi thick for several hundred feet as it moved away from bright light and then mushroomed out in a strange pattern and at the end point of it’s beam and made a perfect concave semi-circle.  Almost as if it was a strange, physics defying light that was illuminating an invisible perfect circle, while moving.  Again, the concave pattern at the end of this vaporous light range stopping as if it was illuminating an invisible large circle off to the back and side of this bright star-like light. I have never seen anything like it in all my years.",2016-02-11T00:00:00,45.49032888888889,-122.40389111111111

I was located roughly 3 miles south of the local municipal airport and was outside stargazing before going to sleep, when I noticed a light and what appeared to be the underside of a vehicle lit from below traveling overhead. My first instinct was to get excited, thinking I was viewing the ISS traveling past. I knew that at those altitudes, they are usually still lit by the sun while other areas are in pitch black.  I then realized that this object in no way resembled the ISS and would have been far smaller if it were. Being near the municipal airport, I then tried to guess if it was a plane or helicopter, but the object consisted of a single light (approximately as bright as Sirius) and a main body that split into a “T” shape that appeared lighted from below.  It seemed to be traveling low, but there was no sound at all – we normally have helicopters flying overhead and can hear them very clearly, especially when all other daily traffic is gone.  The “T” shaped section was moving approximately 30-45 degrees off axis, so I knew it could not be a plane. Located along the coastal highway, I watched as this object moved into the tree line.  I was unable to grab a picture with my camera phone, so I jumped in the car to a lookout point along the ocean about .5miles away.  By the time I pulled in and got out (about 2 minutes max) it had already disappeared, having flown off over the water in a west-southwest direction.

At around 5:15 am in the morning on February 10th, I took my puppy outside so she could go to the bathroom.  As I stood on my lawn, I looked up at the sky.  It was still dark and the stars were out.  It was a nice, quiet morning. I glanced up at the northeast sky and was startled to see two white orbs about 20 degrees above the horizon.   My immediate reaction was “what in the heck are those things?”  They looked about half a mile away.  They were stacked vertically (one above the other).  The objects had a fuzzy quality.  It was like viewing something through fog.  Even though the sky was clear.  They were moving silently in my direction at about the speed of a sailboat. At a distance it looked like two objects, however as it approached it appeared to be a single object.  It was difficult to see the whole thing, as if it was partly invisible.  It was either dark colored and therefore blended in with the black sky or it was transparent in parts.  It was odd, like looking at a jellyfish-- parts of it seemed transparent and parts of it appeared solid. As it glided overhead I got a good look at the underside of it. The center was the most distinctive and clear thing that I could see.  The outer edges were barely visible and dark.  The center was a bright white light that was triangular in shape.  There was another circular white light in the center of the triangle. The lights were steady, not blinking or flashing.   I drew a picture of what it looked like (attached). The sides of the triangle in the center were not exactly three straight lines as pictured (I’m not that handy with drawing tools).  It had three corners, but the sides of the triangle were bowed-in by the arcs of the circular things surrounding it.  As you can see in my drawing, there were several faint circles that seemed to make up the perimeter of the craft.  The dot in the center of the triangle was also white but distinctive from the white triangle.  I believe it was a little darker. As it moved overhead, I pulled out my cell phone and tried to record some video.  However when I checked the video later, it was too dark and nothing came out in the recording. The object was pretty big, about the size of a large dinner plate held at arm’s length. It made no sound at all.  It was difficult to judge its altitude.  I would guess less than 500 feet. The object continued on its straight path, heading southwest (bearing about 210 degrees).  I lost sight of it behind the trees on my property.  The entire event lasted about 30 seconds. This is the 2nd time I’ve seen something strange like this in the sky.  The first was on 9/9/2015 from the same location (which I reported to your web site).  However, in that case the objects were red, white, blue, and orange. I have no idea what this thing was.

There were very low clouds moving one way, and the clouds above it were moving a different way.  It was fairly windy, and it smelled like it could rain, but it wasn't.  Weather like that is uncommon (low clouds), and I was periodically looking up at the sky.  There was a break in the lower clouds, and there it was.  It was so large it filled the whole break.  It had a dark, apparently flat bottom with features that had straight lines and gentle curves.  The shape is unknown as the edges ! could not be seen.  It was low in the sky, and the part that was visible appeared to be at least 2 wingspans of a 747 across.  It was moving north east at a fairly slow pace, and it made no noise.  The clouds were only open for about 3 seconds, and then they closed.  I immediately go the attention of the man catching up behind me, and I pointed up.  There was another opening a moment later, and it was there for another 3 seconds.  The opening was slightly smaller, and about half of the object was part I'd just seen, and the rest was an adjacent part of its bottom.  When the clouds closed the man looked at me in awe, and then did a couple double takes back to the sky.  It disappeared into thicker clouds, and it would be impossible to see it again.   We immediately went back to the car and headed east on Geronimo Trail, but it was hopeless.  It was gone, and the road didn't go in the right direction.  For weeks it was just about the only thing I talked about.  We don't have any! thing nearly that big - and it was bigger than that.  It moved! silentl y in a straight line in high winds, flying fairly slow and low.  When I first saw it it was about 30 degrees off of being straight above me.  The last view, maybe 10 seconds later, was about 45 degrees over from there.  The breaks were in the lower clouds.",2016-01-14T00:00:00,31.502214285714285,-109.48432857142856

In the fall of 2002, (I do not remember the the actual day, exact time, or month) I brought our german shepherd pup Greta outside to do her business.  It was approximately 10 or 11 o'clock in the evening and the night sky was clear.  We went out to the front yard and as I usually do, I look up at the stars, always in awe.  I remember thinking to myself God who or what are we when I noticed a large bright white ""star"" in the northeast over my house.  I always gaze up at the Milky Way so I kind of know how it looks everytime.  I asked myself ""is this the North Star or maybe a planet I have'nt noticed before?""  	At that point I looked down to ((dog's name deleted)) and gave her the command ""hurry up"" so she would do what she needed to do.  I looked back up at the object and after a couple seconds it shrunk down in size and moved right or up and disappeared.  I was and still am in shock.  I still cannot believe what I saw but I know I did see it.  If you held your thumb and forefinger 1 inch apart and held it up to the night sky, then you would have the distance this thing traveled before it vanished.  This was large enough that I thought it may have been a planet, but after it reduced in size it looked like any other small, very distant star. 	I immediately went in when ((dog's name deleted)) was finished and told my wife and our 2 boys.  They just smiled and thought it was pretty amazing.  Now I do not know if there is a connection or not but both ((dog's name deleted)) and myself became ill over the next few months.  She started scratching all the time so much that she was losing large patches of fur.  The vet treated her for mange but was unsuccessful.  Even though the blood test did not show any mange he gave her an amount of medicine he normally would give a horse because she did'nt respond to the normal antibiotic dose.  That didn't work either so he made an appointment for her to see a pet skin specialist that came up from the Twin Cities.  We never made that appointment because Greta was killed on the highway just days before she was to see the doctor.  This was in February of 2003. 	Concurrently with ((dog's name deleted)) suffering with her condition I started scratching a spot on my left arm.  It was a small white spot that itched terribly and I had to scratch it extremely hard to even make it bleed meaning it seemed like that little white spot was very tough, hard to dig out with my fingernail.  Well I went to the doctor who of course did'nt know what it was, and she burned it out by freezeing it.  Things got worse because I was feeling an aching of sorts deep in my upper spine area.  At the time I was driving long-haul big rigs and it became harder and harder to go back out every Sunday.  By July of that year I was totally disabled and could not work anymore.  That doctor put me on Lortabs for pain but did not know what was wrong.  The lortabs were not working and that doctor failed me not knowing what to do so I sought out a doctor who specialised in pain control.  His diagnosis was Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome.  I underwent many tests, seen numerous specialist! s and took many different painkillers and other medications.  The only thing that kept me alive and still true today are the opioids. 	In the last couple years my neck has been curving downward and that led to an appointment to see a rhuematologist.  He looked me over and said I have psoriatic spondylitis.  Wow.  It seems my neck bones are fusing together.  I now take Enbrel shots weekly at home but that is about 60-70% effective so I still need the narcotics because I am so stiff and hurts too much when I move around.  I have no clue if Greta's and my disease was a result of the ""light"" in the sky, but I don't know what that thing was and the timing of everything does make me suspicious.  I just wish I had a video camera at the time because I've never heard anyone describe any light orb that behaved the way that one did. 	I bought a video camera asap after that experience and incredibly, I seen another light orb in 2012.  Unfortunately, I never became proficient with it and the video is shaky, zooming in and out.  At one point I had to pull out and focus at the moon and then reacquire the orb, which I did, before it moved slowly and disappeared like the other one.  I have placed the clip on Youtube.  I now have a better camera so I hope to do better if I ever see another UFO. 	Finally, I would like to point out that neither of the objects made any noise or had flashing lights.  And I find it interesting that we live about 5 miles from an international airport and a Air National Gaurd base and I heard no guard jets take flight on those evenings.

Black Triangle Sighting Monday, 13 Sept., 2010, 2330 hrs (11:30 PM) Camp Mackall Military Reservation, Ft. Bragg, NC. Richmond County NC. Sandhills State Game lands (MGRS): 17SPU357718 / (UTM): 17S 635768 3871862 / (Lat-Long) 34.9802,-79.5126   I am a retired US Army Special Forces operator and instructor.  I have spent a career honorably serving my country with the highest level of integrity and I swear that the following statements regarding my observation of the events I describe here are true and factual. While assigned as cadre to the JFK Special Warfare Center, I spent the majority of my time teaching tactical combat patrolling to Special Forces candidates in the pine forests and swamps of both the Federal Mackall Military Reservation and NC State Sandhills Game lands, surrounding a small military training facility called Camp Mackall located about 30 miles southwest of Ft. Bragg, NC. At approximately 2330 hrs (11:30 pm) on the night of 13 September 2010, our student squad of 15 men was in ambush posture on the west side of a small trail located at vicinity grid (MGRS) 17SPU357718 facing east.  It was a clear night and my assistant instructor and I were located in position together roughly 20 meters behind their assault line waiting for the enemy role-players to approach.  It was at this time in my peripheral, I heard something moving in the sky behind us to the west.  Looking up in that direction over the tree line, I first observed 2 fast moving F-15 fighter jets traveling in formation.  They were about 10,000 ft above ground level and heading north. I knew these were fast movers because both had multiple blinking lights and I could hear the distant but distinct roar of their jet prop engines.  Other than my own vast military experience directly using numerous types of these air platforms to include the B-52 and B-1 Stealth Bombers for close air support during combat Operations during the invasion in Northern Iraq in 2003, it was not at all uncommon to routinely observe numerous types of military aircraft in the skies around Camp Mackall.  There are active runways at Mackall Army Airfield and Luzon Drop zone both of which are within the immediate training area, frequently used in support of military training and airborne operations. I lifted my PVS 14 night vision goggles (NVG’s) to my eye so I could get a better look at them in the night sky and it was at that time to my complete surprise I noticed something startling.  Approximately a mile in front of the two planes at a significantly lower altitude of approximately 2000 to 3000 ft above ground level, was something unimaginable that I immediately knew I had never seen before.  Immensely larger than the fighter jets behind it or for that matter any other aircraft I have ever seen it was what I estimated to be about the size of an NFL Football Stadium.  The vessel was triangular in shape, gunmetal or carbon black in color, making absolutely no sound as it flew ominously straight line and precisely steady undoubtedly under some form of highly advanced intelligent navigational control.  I immediately brought the sight to the attention of my assistant instructor who then also observed it as well. Though my (NVG’s) I could see that the unknown craft had at least one light located at each corner of the triangle under its massive dark outline blackening out the night sky behind it, however upon lowering my optics the lights appeared to be pale blue in color and barely visible with the naked eye.  Awestruck, we stood and watched this amazing spectacle pass directly over us and for the span of about 2 minutes until it disappeared over the low tree line with the two jets in trail towards the small town of Hoffman, NC, on the horizon to our north. About a minute later while we were attempting to rationalize what we had just witnessed, it reappeared having had changed direction, returning from over the same northern tree line now heading south and bit further to our west.  There were now three fighters in formation behind it and the craft seemed to have pulled further in front traveling at a higher rate of speed.  By this time the majority of our 15 student squad had sensed our excitement, overheard our conversation and was now also watching the event curiously as the triangle and following jets disappeared again this time over the tree line to the southwest. In an immediate after action review and analysis with my assistant who is also a senior Special Forces operator, we both agreed that the fighters behind the craft seemed to be in pursuit rather than in escort.  There must be record of the sortie as I imagine they flew out of Pope AFB co-located with Fort Bragg 30 miles east.  There is also a possibility the event was observed by radar by the air control tower at Mackall Army Airfield which is in constant operation positioned approximately 3 miles northeast from the location of the sighting. Again, although having served in special operations for many years with vast experience working with helicopters, fighters and bombers in support during training as well as combat operations, I am absolutely positive that I have never seen or encountered anything even close to the advanced level of technology we observed that night.  Its massive size and capacity of flight in absolute silence and complete absence of any force propulsion disturbance such as wind defies all reason and known laws of physics.  In my opinion it was definitely not something made by human hands and moved as though it could have possibly been using some type of electromagnetic anti gravitational method of propulsion. Immediately following this incident my assistant and I debated if we should even share this story in concern of our professional credibility and or sanity but the very next morning a news story appeared in the Richmond County Daily Journal that there had been numerous other sightings reported in the area that night including one from a law enforcement officer, a Sheriff’s Deputy in Wadesboro, NC, which was also reported to MUFON.  Although I have since searched the papers online digital archives for the article to no avail, I still maintain an original copy of that report in my personal possession.  It is a night I will never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere, and credible.  We suspect that he is an excellent, and highly reliable, witness.  PD))",2016-01-14T00:00:00,,

At this time they directed me to look up and in a southern direction. It was summer time and quite clear outside lots of stars shining. There in the sky looking like a star to fare away to see any structure was a flying object very much looking like a star but much brighter. While it was flying you could clearly see the stars disappear beyond it.  But it was very high much higher then local aircraft fly.this flying object was flying in a darting back and forth manner or away and closer in a small tight area and at times would just stay still. at the end of the sighting the object at such a fantastic speed it went up in a direction towards the stars to the point which it disappeared.

I am setting up my camera Nikon D7000 with Nikon 300mm f 2.8 manual lens, a large lens and heavy.  Manual settings pre-set on my camera.  I was ready, at just a couple minutes before 9:00 pm.  I make my way out into my driveway where I set up my camera on a tripod and a chair to start the waiting game of Sky watching, I barely had the camera set in place when I looked up, it was a cloudy but warm evening.  The clouds were less than a mile up, lots of room between me and the clouds but they were not real high, the city lights could light them up a little.  When I am outside I have to look to the sky, it is impossible for me to not look up, I always feel as though I am being watched from up there, weird I know, but so am I. So I look up towards the East over my house, just below the clouds is a Pinkish light moving very slowly due West, I immediately jumped on the camera thinking, (Couldn't you wait till I got set up?)  I started snapping picture's, I took 32 pictures of it as it moved across the sky.  I had to reposition the camera a few times because I can only take so many pictures before the object moves out of the frame, and with a 300 mm lens the field of view is rather small.  While taking pictures and looking through the viewer I saw a Red light flash and I thought to myself, that I was wasting my time taking picture's of an airplane or Jet plane.  So I stopped and looked at the pictures I just took on the camera because I could enlarge them, that's when I saw the light formation with the large light in the center, now I knew this was not a plane, and looked back up to find the object and continue photographing. Big Mistake on my part because the object was gone, and I didn't see how i! t could have disappeared, either it went up into the clouds or it shot off at high speed, because it was right up in front of me. I can and would be excited about forwarding my picture's to you via email. Mine is a very short story but I have pictures and that says it all. As far as I can tell the craft is a Triangle, it has a Bluish light on 3 sides with a larger Redish light in the center.  I am guessing because the craft was at least a mile from me when I say it in the dark, it had to be somewhere 30 to a 100 feet in size.  I could not make out detail of the craft or it's shape, because it was dark up in the sky, but the pictures lead one to believe it is of a Triangular shape",2016-01-14T00:00:00,42.874890140845075,-112.40116197183099

While attending my daughter’s soccer match at Leander High School in Leander, Texas (30 minutes north of downtown Austin) on the evening of February 23, 2016, something in the sky caught my eye around 6:15 p.m..  I was sitting about mid-field on the home side of the bleachers, which face northeast toward the away team side.  A former private pilot years ago and growing up in an aviation family,  I have always kept an eye on the sky and have a very good visual familiarity with planes of all sizes. I knew what I was tracking was not airplane at all. I surmise the object was a little lower than normal airliner cruising altitude, somewhere between 20,000 to 25,000 feet above ground level.  It did, however, appear to be about the size of an airliner, but there were no wings.  Given this, I would say that the object was “cigar” shaped and rounded on both ends.  It was also, in my estimate, not flying at airliner speed, approximately 500 mph.  I would say that it was going only about 1/3 – 2/3 normal airline speed.  It appeared to be white or metallic as an airliner appears, but again lower, slower, and with no contrail.  It was tracking across the sky in a straight line traveling roughly north northeast to south southwest.  I was able to watch it for two minutes or better before I lost it behind height of the bleachers.  That I know, no one else around me noticed the object. I didn’t mention it to anyone because I happened to be seated between away team parents that I don’t know. I have seen weather balloons at high altitudes track across the sky in a very slow fashion, but they’re little what dots in the sky. Some I’m confident it wasn’t one of those.  To be honest I’ve never in all of my years of watching the skies seen anything like this – with one exception. In early April 2015, my youngest daughter and I went to an airshow at the little airport in Burnet, Texas, about an hour’s drive west from our home in Leander. At some point as little Pitts Special aerobatic light plane completed a round of stunts with smoke, I notice something not quite right in the sky. I would say this object was at or above normal airliner cruising altitude, approximately the size of an airliner, and tracking slowly. This object was white/metallic like an airliner, except the shape is what I can only describe as “bowtie.” Looking at Google Earth, I would say that this object was moving west to east as I was standing looking north down the runway.  In either case, I would definitely say neither object was a standard plane/airliner or any weather balloon that I’ve observed. They could possibly be drones or experimental aircraft. But my gut tells me that’s not the case.",2016-02-26T00:00:00,30.524145045045046,-97.92676216216216

I ran inside and upstairs in order to view this formation above the valley from a West-facing window in my home.  The formation was clearly visible and still moving West at a steady speed. Suddenly, from the East appeared a huge formation of 10 additional bright objects heading in the same Westerly direction at the same speed.  These were in a distinct formation, and I was able to photograph this second formation with my iPhone as well as take a short video. The lead object was out in front of the second formation by a considerable distance.  There were 8 bright objects in a pattern.  The photo I took shows that this could also potentially be 2 formations:  One formation of 4 objects in a backwards “C” formation, and a second formation in a distinct triangle formation. Under this single cluster of 8 objects was the 10th object which was slightly brighter and moving in the same direction and speed as all of the other objects. Both the first and second formation vanished into the distance to the West.  Both formation never changed speed, shape, or direction at anytime.  It was a very deliberate path and speed. I have been a life-long amateur astronomer and know that these were not meteors, fireballs, or bolides based on my observations.  I am also familiar with what a satellite looks like as it breaks apart re-entering the Earth's atmosphere, and this looked nothing like this.  These were brighter than the visible objects in the night sky with a brightness between Jupiter and Venus on a clear night. According to the NWS data for last night, the wind speeds in the area were averaging 9.6 miles per hour, and the wind direction was East...therefore, it was in the opposite direction these objects were flying.

Etched in my mind for the past 30 years is a dreamlike experience i went through when i was about 10 years old, which no one believed and which brought riddicule upon me from my brothers when i attemped to tell them the story.  I promptly shut up,and desperately struggled to push it off my mind for the next 35 years, when eventually i talked about it to a friend , whos complete trust i knew i had gained and thus had no fear of being riddiculed again. Still on background information, i have to state here that back in those days, as a small boy in the small town of Nakuru, i definitely did not have any knowledge of these matters and only came to make sense of the experience in 2009, soon after my first exposure to the internet, where i inadvertently stumbled upon a story similar to mine.  I was stunned beyond words, and after a slow process of regaining my balance i shared with my trusted friend who had nothing more to say after asking a few questions which i duly answered. I remember two events which hitherto seemed unrelated until after i learned about abductions.  The first one ; I (aged about 10) am outside our home when for some reason i turn sideways only for my eyes to lock onto a landing craft some 50 meters away from where i was.  It was  reddish in colour, somewhat spherical in shape but with edges like a diamond, with clearly visible landing gear below.  After it landed something happened that made me very scared and which i successfully pushed out of my mind over the years. With indescribable fear in me i turned and ran away towards where i knew my siblings were, (there are 6 of us ,i being the fourth child) where i had to go through a cornfield . I know i never got to where i was going and in all those years, even soon after the incident my memory used to register great confusion every time i tried to recollect what happened next. End of the first event.  In the second event, which never seemed related to the one detailed above, i am wide awake in bed but completely covered with a blanket .  There is a ringing noise , a continous sharp sound seemingly coming from directly above me.  It goes on for what seemed like many minutes then stops, and suddenly something cold passes through my body at the chest  painlessly making me feel like i have been cut into two.  Then the bed flipped over taking me through a complete 360 degree turn, like what we used to call a 'back somersault'.  Then complete silence.  In great fear i slowly moved my hand to the blankets edge, turned my head sideways towards it (i was sleeping on my back facing upwards) and lifted up the blanket  for a peep outside. I remember what i saw vividly, and never was able to blot these images from my mind though i know i really tried. I saw non human creatures.  Pale green/ grey colour. Small stature, like skinny boys.  The room was circular and not lit brightly. One of the creatures really helped to etch the experience in my mind, such that i never could convince my young mind that i never saw it. It was the smallest of them all at about my size (remember i was about 10 years) . As i was fearfully looking at the scene it/he saw me peeping and came fast towards me which made me drop the blanket . Nothing happened and i lay there quiet for some time untill i mustured enough courage to peep again. He/ it came after me again and i covered myself up. this happened three times and eventually i stopped peeping and lay ! there terrified untill i fell asleep. End of recollection. Now , since then i have fought a long battle with these images, pushing them as far back into my mind as posible and trying to tell myself that, like my big brother told me in riddicule, it was a dream. I was never able to forget it.  Today , i am willing and ready to share my story with the world. I expect few people to believe me, some even to think that am looking for some monetary reward or fame, which is not really what motivates me to come out.  All i would like them to know is that there strange things going on in our planet, and humanity would do well by listenining objectively to what witnesses to these things are saying.  There is a sinister plot unfolding here, which all men should be wary of. ((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to correspond with the source of the report, but the e-address provided is defective.

Then it took off into the sky... basically just disappeared.  It left a trail of yellow behind it.  It also didn't make a sound when it took off. That event changed my life.  Ever since then I have been a believer 100%.  I know there is something out there.  It may be the government..  But I believe it is Alien life. Not a single person has ever believed my story and I just feel like a crazy person most of the time.  So I just don't bring it up anymore. Another even happened in June about 6 months later.  I was having a fire in my backyard with some close friends and out of nowhere a craft appeared above my house and flew away..  But it had a light shining on me and I had a sun burn in the morning.  My friends didn't see this object, but I DID. I would love to meet more people out there who have experienced events like this.",2016-01-20T00:00:00,41.650030882352944,-91.5039944117647

It was a very large, “U” shaped object, orange/rust in color, glowing brightly, approximately 25 degrees above the horizon.  It looked fairly similar to a crescent moon, however, it was lit from the bottom, to create a “U” shaped appearance.   This captured our attention very intensely, because firstly, it is impossible for the moon to be lit from the bottom, and secondly, the moon would not be 25 degrees above the western horizon at 10:40 at night.  We confirmed that the moon’s illuminated side was not even facing Earth on this particular night, according to www.moongiant.com. We continued driving southbound for roughly 4 minutes, observing the object in astonishment, and asking each other what the heck it could possibly be.  It appeared to be both very large and somewhat distant from our location.   Wanting to get a better look at the object and observe it more, we exited on exit 481, and headed west bound on View Road toward where we had last seen it.  An overpass obstructed our line of sight to the object momentarily before we could turn on to View Rd. and once we turned west the object was no longer visible. We continued down View Rd. until it intersected with Lois Rd.  Headed south on Lois until we could head west on 455, but were unable to locate it again. The size and shape of the object was incredible.   It was a very strange and memorable experience.",2016-01-20T00:00:00,33.3538,-97.1965

As it happened a few minutes ago. Also the reason I'm writing this.  Because I had an uncanny thing happen that made me think twice.  I'd still explain the first sighting I saw which happened around 15 January 2016, 20:00~  And is probably the most special one, apart from my own experience with the latest sighting. I went outside to get some water from the car.  I have bottles of water stored in the car.   When I need to get some bottles I simply walk to the car.  It stays cold that way and I don't have to bring them inside, heat them up unnecessary refrigerate them again ect.  When I wanted to open the backside of the car I took a second to look into the sky and I saw so many stars.  The longer I looked the more stars I could see.  This is an unfamiliar sight to me. But the sky was very clear this day. At this moment I suddenly saw something moving in the sky, it had a bright white and red flashing light to it.  A plane I first thought, obviously.  However it was on a very strange attitude.  It seemed much lower than a normal aircraft.  It was hard for me to pin down mentally at that moment at what kind of attitude it was flying.  There was just something uncanny about it.  I can't quite put it to words what it was. At this moment, which was maybe 10 seconds after I had initially looked into the sky I noticed another 'thing' in the sky. It was exactly the same just at a different location in the sky.  They were flying towards each other and I kept looking cause I thought they would collide.  They seemed to fly past each other though.  After that I saw another one, and then another one, and another one.  I saw at least 5, across the sky.  Before I stopped looking.  They seemed to be flying symmetrical of each other.  And all moved at a constant speed. Although I was confused about what I saw, I didn't think too much of it. 3 Days later I was laying on my bed watching a movie.  In the corner of my eyes I can see my window.  (In the attic) It was around 3AM when a very bright light caught my eye.  I instantly recognized it from my earlier encounter.  I walked over to the window to look at it. This time I could see much clearer what I saw.  It was much closer. (I've been here for years and I've never seen a plane or flying object like this before)  It was flying on a very low attitude compared to air planes.  However there was no sound to be heard at all.  It was flying in a straight line and kept going until it would disappear in the horizon.  There was only one that I could see at this time. Now what makes me write this report is because something really weird happened while I was watching it fly away into the horizon; it suddenly moved mid air like a gyroscope.  This really send chills trough my spine because at this point I realised I've either gone crazy or seen something that to me is definitely a unidentifiable flying object. A description of how it looked is as followed: It had a constant dull red light at the back side.  (Back side being the opposite direction it was moving towards).  A red strobing bright light at the front.  And 2 or 3 bright white flickering/strobing lights at the back. Do note that these lights also were very uncanny. Very bright. While writing this I've seen it fly by another few times on the same path around 3 times, within an hour. I'm not claiming I saw something extra terrestrial or something.  Or anything special at all. I just can't explain what I saw that's all I know.  Perhaps they were drones from the local government scanning the area, or whatever. I don't know. But someone linked me to this page so that's why I'm writing this. If this turned out to be something obvious explainable to you, that's fine. like a new airliner trajectory or something.  I'm not here for any drama.  I just want to know what it is. PS:  I checked animals responded because for some reasons all the birds in a local park started screaming a few times this night.  This happens when they are disturbed. I know because sometimes I light fireworks there and the same thing happens. Not saying it is related, but just letting you know. Also a weird strange humming sound in the sky the last few days.  Across the country actually.  But when I saw the thing I didn't hear nothing.  Still letting you know though.

Very strange sighting, and my only sighting. If people are interested, I will go into more detail, but for now I will keep it short and sweet.  Was up early for one of my 2 required Saturday shifts for work.  Happened to go sit on my balcony to stargaze and relax, before heading in to work in a few hours.   Saw what initially resembled the usual airplanes that come through to go to the Phoenix Airport nearby, however, this object quickly approached and I could tell it was much too large to be an airplane.   It started out roughly saucer like with your typical yellowish white light, but then literally started to morph green, blue, red, orange, etc in a fashion such as fiber optics would look like.  Still not that shocked, I continued to watch it approach from the north and it eventually completely stopped and just hovered, only making a few impossible maneuvers for any (declassified) man-made tech.  To make things really interesting, as it hovered, it twice descended while dropping what seemed to be small disc like crafts with the similar cycling of lights the ""mothership"" had.  The only reason I wasn't sure of how many came from it was because I was too focused on all of the helicopters and airforce jets sneaking up to get a closer look.   The object hovered a good 30 minutes before this happened and I never took my eyes off it.  It would morph and change from the saucer like shape to almost a crown or diamond type shape, but the color now stayed mostly yellowish white.  When approached by what I believe to be a helicopter (that or a jet) it appeared to playfully recede at any probe too close to it.   As the sun was beginning to come up, it lowered what looked like a few hundred foot ""ropes"" of light, 3 to be exact.  The smaller craft that were closer to the ground sort of just hovering as well then slowly ascended up and merged back with the ""mothership"", all the while the jets and helicopters were EVERYWHERE.  I mean they weren't making it obvious, but I could hear the helicopters and see the jets.   Finally, the object made some crazy ""skipping"" like maneuvers and as it did so, one of the tiny little clouds that were in the sky came as if it was called over, and the object slowly dimmed and went higher and higher.  It was the most insane thing I have ever seen.   I am a college educated male, 25 years of age, and only drink on the rare occasion.  Wide awake for a good 3 hours of witnessing all of these strange events.  I really would like to see if anyone else witnessed something similar!  I have always been somewhat of a believer, but still do not know if I am witnessing new experimental aircraft, or ET phenomenon.  I am open minded and will not jump to conclusions, but this has me very, very intrigued.  I will continue to watch that area of the sky in the same hours now to see if I can catch any more glimpses of what went on.

I have filled out numerous form on a plethora of sites with no response and I just heard your program on Jeff Rense from Friday November 20, 2015. I would like for the video to be available for your next program with Jeff & too see if those that have reported these orbs/fireballs are witnessing the same object if possible.

The winds were blowing from West to East and the orange red orb that I recorded was moving from East to West (so a Chinese lantern could be eliminated).  After moving to the West for about 2 (two) minutes, the object changed direction to North for about 5 (five) minutes. Once the orb stopped directly above me, it stay there for about 4 (minutes) at which time my neck became to sore to look straight up at.

It appeared to be a uniform dull light brown or khaki color.  If it was a small aircraft then by its size not only should the witness have been able to see distinguishing features but its N number should have been observable.

I have been trying to figure out this whole time what exactly this thing was & was so shocked to find that someone had actually reported this thing & saw it besides us.  On this night, my brother left his house on one side of town (but on the side of town our home was located) going wherever he was going, when he phoned me to tell me about this incredible thing he was looking at as we speak.  Some big square/rectangle like object just slowly cruising through the sky not far from the ground.  I listened & payed him no mind really as he can be kind of goofy at times.  But I did hear him out only because he sounded so ecstatic while telling me.  Shortly after, I had to leave to go to my daughters house, (also on the same side of town as me) when I turned on one of the streets to get there, as I approached the bridge I noticed a big foreign object in the sky. Exactly the! description the person reported in this list, almost invisible but only because it blended into the night sky & I was only able to make out some strange rectangle like shape in an upright position just cruising on over the bridge right above me as I slowed to a crawl continuing underneath it. I watched this thing float over the bridge from right to left as I passed under it. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It amazed me so that the only thing I could think to do was to call my brother as fast as I could & tell him what I had just witnessed.  I only had a cheap flip phone at the time & was not able to catch a picture, plus I was driving, riding in my car, freaked out at the sight of it anyhow.  Unfortunately, I was the only one on the road at the time.  So no one else saw it on this back road on the outskirts of town. We reside in the county.  All of us do. And it was dark. I phoned my husband immediately after, to tell him that I think I saw what my brother had just seen.  And of course I told my daughter when I arrived at her house.  ! I hate that I wasn't able to catch it on film but I did do a drawing of it as soon as I got home.  I still have that sketch & have just been sitting on it since then because I honestly believed that no one else had seen this thing other than me & my brother.  It did have huge black windows across (what I would believe to be) the front of it & only a few little flashing lights in various places along it. It was like a dark greyish color with a ""boxy"" type shape.  Like a square nose, then a vertical rectangle like body with a triangle like top but off to one side.  From my direction the triangle top would be off to the right top side. It was very strange.  No sound at all. It made no noise.  Just hovering but moving at the same time.  Slowly. I watched it as long as I could while continuing to drive & trying frantically to make a phone call to my brother until it had gone off in the distance opposite to where I was going.  I watched it until I couldn't see it anymore.  But this thin! g couldn't have been more than several hundred feet above the ground because with the bridge I was on, the thing wasn't more than 100 ft or so above me?  Or so it seemed. It was huge & seemed to float right over me?  But I'm not very good at measurements, so I can't say for sure.  I have just been curious if anyone else had seen anything similar in or around our town.  Then I found this site.  Never knew it existed til today but I am relieved to find that someone else may have witnessed this thing also.   Sorry for the long, drawn out story...I am just excited to be able to tell it again.",2015-11-26T00:00:00,35.8826,-80.082

What really interested me was when I applied normal ""filters"", which would typically just increase the contrast, or fade the saturation of a photograph.  In pictures taken at 1am without flash, I did not expect a variation when applying the filters.  However, to my surprise the filters resulted in wild colors being shown in the background, while the object remained white.",2016-01-29T00:00:00,39.2891,-77.22

I did not have the chance to look in the sky.   A few minutes later my son asked me, ""Mom, has man invented a flying craft that can just hover in one spot and stay there for a little while, than just leave?"".  He and his brother explained to me that they saw what appeared to be an oval shaped, dark 'thing' in the sky, just hover, than slowly fly further northwest.  They said it did not fly fast, but rather the speed an airplane in the sky appears to fly, at lower altitudes.  It was not too close to the tree tops, but much further up.  They described it as small, dark, oval shaped, with two orange flashing lights on its side, hovering and spinning.  They said they knew it was was! spinning  because they could see the sun's reflection light up different parts of the object, like windows would on a spinning object.  There was no obvious sound coming from it.  I immediately thought a drone, but I honestly did not spend too much time online to make this determination.  We live in a rural area where the general population would not really have drones, and honestly, I don't think I've ever seen a drone around here, thank goodness.  So, I'm stumped.  My twin boys are 9 years old. It was a clear, autumn, late afternoon.  Sunny, but the sun was not in an area to obscure their vision.  They do not wear glasses or have any vision problems.  They have never 'played' a joke like this in the past, so I believe they saw something. What, I don't know.  My other children were outside also, but did not see anything.

Date and Time:  November 12, 2015.  Some time between 11:30pm and 12:15am at night. Location:  Texas, Brown County.  Three separate locations on Hwy 183.  I was driving. 	First appearance:  At roughly the following coordinates, 31.8792102,-98.918499 	Second appearance:  I was still startled by what I had seen so I wasn't really paying attention to exactly where I was.  But it was somewhere between the coordinates listed above and the coordinates of the third appearance. 	Third appearance:  At roughly the following coordinates, 31.9639032,-98.920559 	 What I saw:  Two objects, possibly one, above the road.  One long, oval shaped object with a shorter oval shaped object directly below it.  The reason I say 'possibly one' object is because each time I saw it, it was identical in shape (though not in size) to the time before.  Which leads me to consider the possiblity that what I saw was a singular object with two oval shapes or projections that may have simply been more obvious than the remainder of the object which I may not have been able to see. 	On the first appearance, the object about 20 feet away from me.  It was directly above the road.  From the top of the larger oval shape, to the bottom of the smaller oval shape it was possibly 10 feet long.  It was stationary as I drove directly under it.  If I had got out of the car and approached it I might have been able to just reach the bottom of it and touch it.  However, when I turned back to see what it was, the object(s) had gone.  The first time I saw it, the object(s) was not particularly bright.  That is, it did not seem to shine its own light, but was well illuminated by my headlights.  There was another car behind me who had to have seen it as well. 	Oddly, I hardly remember the second appearance.  I only remember that I saw it and it looked was smaller.  As I sit here writing this, I'm trying to remember, but I just can't. 	On the third appearance the object(s) was to my left, about 5 feet from the ground and about 10 feet away.  This time it seemed about 15 feet tall from top to bottom and seemed to be brightly illuminated from within.  I went back to try to get a better look, but again, the object(s) had gone.  During this drive I was traveling at about 55mph.  When I turned off of Hwy 183 onto the road that leads to my house, I drove at about 30mph, hoping that I would see the object again and be able to stop before I passed it, but the object(s) did not reappear.  I'm curious to see what happens tonight on my way home.",2015-11-19T00:00:00,,

After getting free as it was slippery and the snow was just starting to pick up- my 15 year old JUMPED out of the back seat and started toward the sight trying to take pictures of it, I was terrified for him.  At this point we all noticed that there was a 2-4 foot tall GLOWING NEON GREEN humanoid type being standing directly beside this craft. It would look toward my son with the camera, then back at the craft floating beside him about 6-7 times quickly to each thing, then after about 1 minute my 15 year old took off RUNNING full speed back to the car.  He was scared becaus! e he said that the being was ""noticing his picture taking"".  Of course our luck,,,,right when my oldest started taking pictures the snow really started to pick up and it did not help us to get very clear shots.... He said that he tried to take 4 pictures but could only take one...then on the way home as we discussed the incident- the other 3 pictures mysteriously appeared.  Furthermore, when my son took off running towards me to get back in the car because he was scared- the car doors locked!!!  My 9 year old, who was in the front passenger seat said ""MOM! UNLOCK THE DOOR!""  I was pushing the button but I could not unlock it!  Then my 12 year old son manually unlocked his back door and let him in....and we took off! It was a scary, yet awesome experience for all of us.  My oldest kept begging me to turn around and go back, but I would not, he said ""something"" told him to walk towards it, and also go back and see it again.  Also, after we got home and e! xamined the pics we saw a donut shaped glowing orb that we did!

It looked like it was spinning rapidly.  I walked further down the road almost into the next state as I like right on the border of new hampshire.  The object started to move back and forth slowly and as it did that i noticed that it moved up and down.  It got really bright for a moment and then really dull to the point that it was almost faded completely out.  I became really tired all the sudden and felt like i should go home.  As i did i noticed a car pull off to the side of the road.  An older man got out and was looking at the light.  He was to far away for us to speak and it was dark so i did not want to approach him as i thought a young man popping out of the dark side street would probably cause alarm.  I took a picture with my cell but it only showed up as a little red and white dot that you need to zoom in to see.  So as i finally finished up my walk i noticed that it faded out and i fell like the whole event wasn't important.  I decided to report it anyways because this was my first ufo sighting and i didn't want to let my experience go to waste.   p.s. I've never felt this tired before I'm in my 20's and run track still.

This bright yellow light suddenly became dimmer and kept moving vertically in the sky.  Eventually it was so dim it became as bright as a distant star.  Shortly after that it just vanished from view.  Unfortunately, I was interrupted by a family member at the time it went so, I missed part of the sighting. However, this all happened in a matter of about 2 minutes roughly I would say. Not seen anything quite like it.  Certainly not a plane, I did wonder if it was a helicopter, but it was moving rather strange, plus it left so quickly, which almost rules out a helicopter I think.   I do not believe there was any sound, but I was inside the house looking out of my window.  So its hard to say if there was any sound, I certainly don't recall any sound at all.

This is the northwest. I was traveling to work southbound on the 95 freeway.  I was late for work.  I always watch the skies.  I don’t know why, it's not like I ever see anything.  On 1/5/2016 between the hours of 9:25pm and 9:45pm, I actually did.  As I passed the Santa Fe Casino, on my left, right above the casino I witnessed a triangular V-shaped object over the casino.  I cannot remember if it was over the parking garage area or closer to the casino part.  I am not sure.  What I am sure of, however, is that I was seeing a V-shaped aerial object.     The object that I saw was ""hovering"" in the air, as low as a helicopter could fly.  (I have had airplanes fly by or helicopters sit idle near me and I hear a sound)  This object was  emitting absolutely NO sound. It was close enough for me to hear a sound.  I would have heard a sound.  Were this a helicopter or an airplane, I'm sure I would have heard sound.  I thought maybe it was some type of military stealth flying object.  But why would it be just hovering Non-stealthily over the nasty old Santa Fe Casino?  Also I saw lights.  I cannot say for sure what other colors I saw besides white.  White was the dominant color, I do know that for sure.  There could have been other colors as well.  What I can say for absolute assurity is that the lights were chasing.  Chasing like those Christmas lights that people have.  The lights were chasing in the shape of the object that I was seeing, which was a V shape (acute triangle) two long sides with a shorter bottom.  The bottom was invert! ed to another v.      As I was seeing this, my psyche attempted to explain away my optical.  The reason I was unsuccessful at explaining this away, was because of the motion of the object.  As it hovered in that spot, it rotated at a half circle as it bobbed up and down slightly, while slightly tilted to the right.  The movement of the craft, the location of the craft and the fact that I could hear no sound from a craft that was in such close proximity to my vehicle are the reasons why I am writing this report.  The behavior of the craft frightened me more than the sight of it.  I felt an immediate fear mixed with excitement mixed with dread mixed with sadness.  A combination of feelings that I have never felt.     Please be advised that I was driving when I witnessed this.  I pulled to the carpool lane and started to drive very slowly to ensure that I was seeing what I was seeing.  I started to swerve cause I was looking at the object instead of looking at the road.  I turned away to keep from getting pulled over for a traffic violation.  I was afraid to stop and pull over. This happened to me.  I do not have any history of mental illness.  I have never made a report of something like this before.  I believe in the existence of something other than human beings for several reasons that I will not go into, because that is not what this report is for.   I just want whoever this gets to, to  take my accounts seriously.  I am a previous member of law enforcement.  I have had to listen to reports like this frequently from crazy people.  I know the difference.  I hope you do too.  I know what I saw.  I just would like someone to tell me why I saw it.",2016-01-14T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

This caught my attention because there are never planes taking this flight path, and it was low enough to see details of the craft, but did not emit any sound.   Because of the position of my back door, as it traveled right to left I lost sight of it when it flew over the barn next door.  I think it was roughly 1,000 ft off the ground, (clearing the tree line) and the size was a little larger than a Cessna-maybe fit 4 people.  There were 3 white lights positioned in a triangular shape with multiple lights inside the body.  The whole event last about 10-15 seconds before it went out of my vision range.  I am interested in knowing if anyone else reported a sighting this morning.",2016-02-26T00:00:00,,

I wanted to yell at my husband but he was asleep on the couch after a grueling day of going to the doctor in St. Louis so I didn't wake him.  I ran to our back door and looked out...I felt scared..I heard no sound.  I was afraid to go outside.  I returned to the window and watched it float over our farm field to the east over the Mississippi River toward Quincy Illinois. It made no sense to me.  I hesitated to make the report because I don't know what it was.  Why didn't I take a picture or record it.?...that disturbs me that I did not do this.. I was so mesmerized that it didn't occur to me until later. I watched it for six minutes until it was out of my sight.  An airplane would not take six minutes to go over my house.

Now to quickly paint a picture; our house sits high up on the side of a small mountain; the back of our house faces east (facing the Los Angeles National Forest Mountain Line). While watching TV I noticed a large object hovering still over the top of one of the mounts in the LA National Forest, the morning sky was just starting to light up with the sun rising in the east behind the object, but the sun hadn’t peaked over the mountain just yet.  The object caught my attention since it was the only object in the sky; at first I thought this was only a cloud, however there wasn’t any other clouds in the sky.  I took a couple photos and then sat back down on the couch continuing watching TV but still keeping an eye out the window when all of a sudden 5 or 10 minutes later the image moved a bit and had looked like it broke up showing other objects hovering below and to the sides of the larger object; that’s when I confirmed to myself its only a cloud since it had broke up a bit..  But then what happened next is when I realized it’s a UFO.., the object came together as one again and started to leave; it moved east away from where I was. After the UFO left I noticed the morning sky filled with more then a dozen fighter jets. About 1 hour later around 0730 the object repapered; the UFO was cloaked and appeared as a large cloud; next there were 2 fighter jets which flew over our house and headed east toward the UFO.. as the jets approached, the UFO started to leave and head east away from the incoming jets pursuing it; in the distance I noticed what looked like the first jet to plummet down (as if the jet was shoot down or it pursued a drone or something).  The scale of how large the UFO was enormous, in the pictures you can tell that the size of the jets in comparison were tiny, this UFO dwarfed our jets, this was their mother ship as it's referred to or a floating city. One hour later the object reappeared and headed west toward our house and then north and dropped down behind the mountain ridge.  In the distance you could see jets flying all around in that direction.  Further I saw another plan flying overhead, this was a radar plan, the plan with the large circle dome on the top of it. There was a lot of activity over the Los Angeles National forest this morning; I called the news station and the LA National Ranger Station, but no one followed back up with me.

Is it moving, or am I seeing things?"" and pointed above our roof.  So I looked up and saw what appeared to be a teeny tiny, but extra bright, version of the big dipper constellation. The tiny non-constellation was sitting in a place that I had never seen stars before, and where my friend confirmed no stars had been visible ever before. After we stared for a few minutes more lights turned on, and instead of looking like mini dipper, it then appeared to have 2 parallel slightly curved rows of about 7 lights each.  The lights blinked or flickered individually, but not in any particular pattern.  One light, in the middle on the upper row, that had previously appeared to be the start of the mini dippers handle, didn't seem to blink and was brighter than the others. It had been stationary (aside form the blinking), and we couldn't tell how far up it was, just that it was above the clouds.  There was no sound coming from it, but I had been on the phone with my mom for about half an hour precluding the sighting and for the duration of it (relaying what I was seeing on the phone).  My phone did break up quite noticeably when we were standing beneath it.

As it was a heatwave, I decided to spend the evening looking at the stars, watching for anything unusual.  I had seen several meteors and very tiny hard to see satellites pace across the sky.  One of the satellite sightings was unusual as two tiny pricks of faded light followed the exact same course North to South across my garden.  I have never seen that before.  I had also seen a bird with stiff looking wings fly over which surprised me as it was dark.  I noted the wings were being lit up by the orange streetlights around here.  I decided it was gliding and thought I saw it flap as it went out of sight.  We have seagulls here which I have seen fly at night in the past, but not often. The heat wave drove many people outside, countless voices jabbered around my tiny garden and I didn’t want to eavesdrop so I put on the radio and listened to C2CAM.  The atmosphere was noisy but not really loud. I should point out that I spend hours at a time in the garden for the specific purpose of understanding what is in the sky and how things move up there.  One night a helicopter circled over my place (and a hundred other peoples places) for over an hour, it drove me back indoors as it was so loud and ruining my peace. I am an amateur sound engineer so I am always fascinated by strange sounds and their origin.  If there was a conventional craft passing over me that night, I am sure I would have heard it, and had a good guess at what type of aircraft went over from the sound.  At 23:05, I was laying back on my recliner, watching the stars, relaxed and listening to George Noory, my eyes were instantly attracted to the speeding orange shapes cutting across my garden from South to West North West.  I sat up!  The objects were about to go out of sight behind my bathroom so I sprinted forward, knocking my DSLR as I went and looked round the building to see them fly away from me.   At first I thought the trailing object was attached to the other three and they were all part of the same structure, but the trailing one did quick, insect like speedy movements making it easily appear separated.  The objects had a wobble, like they were all independently moving.  When I watched them leave it felt exactly like the moment in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the scene where the little red light acts like a comical puppy trying to catch up to the other craft with playful moves.  The trailing light flitted toward and away from the formation of three with incredi! ble speed and fluidity.   I watched until they were gone.  That area of town is very highly polluted with light, there are lots of main roads and roundabouts in that direction.  The craft sped away and I was left dumbfounded and annoyed that I had a camera right there and I could not use it.  It was in the middle of another 25 second exposure photograph and was not ready for a fast encounter like this one!  I ran into the house to tell my partner and write down what I had just witnessed.  I was not trembling as hard as I expected, but I was trembling as I wrote and related the tale to my Partner who was napping and had just been woken by my sudden excitable appearance, bless him.  I also went on to make a short video blog whilst the event was still fresh in my mind.",2015-11-26T00:00:00,,

Unidentified Flying Object Sighting   Date:  November 1st, 2015  Location: Wimberley Texas  Time: Approximately 11:00pm CST  Duration of sighting: 3-5 minutes  Distance:  Less than 1 mile away  Size: Approximately 100 feet in diameter   	 On the night of November 1st, 2015, around 11:00pm CST, I left the house to go get a pack of cigarettes.  My road, Wayside Dr., when heading into town goes straight down to River Rd. which follows directly along the banks of the Blanco River.  Turning right out of the driveway theres a hill that you go up as soon as you start going down the road.  When I reached the crest of that hill I first saw a light through the trees, that was also obstructed by hills partially as well.   Now since literally the day before, our area was hit once again by severe flooding, especially the Blanco River and its estuaries, for the second time within the past 6 months.  The first flood being the epic Memorial Day flood that was the absolute worst we have on record, causing millions of dollars in damage as well as several deaths.   So since we just experienced another severe flood the day before and there were people still missing, I just thought at that moment first seeing light down by the river it was probably just another helicopter flying over the area.   Driving a little over a mile down my road I finally got to see my first unobstructed view of the object, at the beginning of a short straight away less than a mile away from the river.  Realizing immediately this was not a helicopter or any sort of aircraft I am accustomed to seeing.  It was moving slowly from right to left, pulsating light from bright white to a dim yellowish/orange color and appeared to be flying directly over the Blanco River. 	So I then promptly grab my cell phone and begin snapping pictures of the object after stopping in the middle of the road, realizing I only had a few seconds before it was going to move behind more trees and would be obstructed again once it moved farther to the left of the clearing I had at that moment.  Once it was obstructed, I continued down the road to try and quickly get to the river so I could possibly get closer, better and more defined pictures of the craft.  Once I got to the bend in the road at the end of the straight away where I took the first two pictures, I had the opportunity to capture two more clear/unobstructed pictures of the object.  Then I sped down to the river as quickly and as safely as I could, the whole time I had limited visual contact with it through the trees but could absolutely still see it moving and pulsing the whole time. 	Nearing the end of my road where it intersects with River Rd. there are several quick “S” shaped curves right before you get to the intersection, it was at that point through the trees I could see it was in fact flying right over the river.  The craft was approximately the size of a small house but in an oval/funnel shape, illuminated as well and flying approximately 200 feet above the rivers surface.  There are cliffs on the opposite side of the river from where River Rd. runs that are around 100-150 feet tall and this craft was only about 50 feet above those cliffs.  Then before I could even get to turn down River Rd., which I would have had to turn left to go toward it; the craft flashed extremely bright, shook in place rapidly (like a trembling motion) and shot off unbelievably fast going up in altitude as well as heading Southeast, in the same direction the river flows.  Once it shot off it was totally out of sight with in a second, gone, no sound or any sign of it in ! the distant sky. 	Unfortunately I was unable to get anymore pictures of the craft before it took off once I got down to the river.  Which I regret not just taking video of it while driving even if it was obstructed by trees, because you still would’ve been able to see its rapid departure through the trees as well as the flash and trembling it did before shooting off.  But the deer in this area make night driving very hazardous and having had several encounters with them on the roads at night here, 2 of them ending in impact right on my road alone and driving our new car (we just bought literally a week before), I was absolutely not going to video tape and drive at the same time. 	The whole time I was driving down to river from my road, I was hoping and looking for someone else to be on the road.  Thinking someone else could be seeing the same thing.  But that made it even more strange because even after the craft took off from its slow cruise over the river, I did not see a single car on any of the roads on the way to the only 24hr convenience store in town. The whole trip I only passed one car on the way home and that was on the main road that runs through town, Ranch Road 12.  Also since the river had flooded the day before, I’m pretty sure most of the houses on the river were totally unoccupied, either because of flood damage or because they evacuated.  So theres a very good chance that there wasn’t anyone who saw it from their river home simply because no one was there.  Even though if they were, they’d have a front row view of it from any window in the house that faced the river on either side.  Also, my girlfriend works at a coffee shop in dow! ntown Wimberley so she kept an ear out for anyone talking about anything out of the ordinary, but never heard anything.  Neither did I hear anything from anyone about seeing anything. 	Lastly I wanted to describe the landscape of the area of the sighting a little more.  From where I took the pictures of the craft you can tell the altitude it was flying was very low.  If it were daytime you would be able to see that it was below and in front of the hills that crop up less than a mile or so across the river.  So there was no way it was something in the sky farther away simply because it would’ve been completely obstructed by the hills. 	I hope this report is helpful and informative, as well as a good group of usable photos. Thank you for your service,  ((name deleted))",2015-11-26T00:00:00,30.0279,-98.1179

Let me start this by saying that I have had a lifelong interest in the ufo subject.  I am 29 years old and was born and raised in Bakersfield, CA.  Despite this, I have never seen anything that I could not explain in the sky.  I believe that changed on Sunday, November 15, 2015. I was driving home on Rancheria rd. which lies about 10-15 miles east of Bakersfield. Rancheria runs north and south and will take you from east Bakersfield all the way up to the Alta Sierra area. This particular day was a very rare and stormy day for this area. There was rain, snow and tiny hail coming down all day.  I am a 4x4 enthusiast and was going up a trail called ""Freeway Ridge"" with a small group of friends.  This trail starts at hwy. 178 and ends at Evans flat campground and traverses through the southern sierras.  After a long and muddy day of 4 wheeling we finally reached the end of the trail.  Rancheria road is the quickest way back to Bakersfield.  Rancheria is winding road that is very dangerous, especially when wet. We were going south at an average of about 15 mph.  It is 25 miles back to Bakersfield as the crow flies but it takes at least an hour to drive on any given day.  Visibility was very low because of rain, fog, and mud covered vehicles.  This day it took us about 1.5 hrs to travel this 25 mile road.   Now on to my sighting.  About 15 miles south of Evan's Flat campground, I see a light coming down towards the mountain.  It looked like a small plane at first and was approx. 4-500 yards to my left.  I am a golfer, so I feel like I am a good judge of yardage.  I almost panicked at first because it looked like this small plane was going to crash into the mountain to my left.  It was very low to the tree line.   As I focused in on this light (difficult with mud covered windows/windshield) I could see that it was not a plane of any kind.  I got a clear look at it for about 3-4 seconds.  It was 2 bright neon white round balls with a thin neon white line connecting them.  It did not produce any halo of light behind it.  It was traveling on a horizontal plane and coming down diagonally towards the ground.  Its flight is why I originally thought a plane was going to crash.  After the 3-4 seconds, I could see it fly behind some trees, and then it disappeared.  Let me also mention that this was 15 min. after sunset with complete cloud cover and rain.  It was basically dark outside. While this whole experience was seemingly mundane it was also very spectacular to me.  I couldn't begin to come up with a logical explanation of what this thing could have been.  It gave me the chills and made the hair on my body stand on end. I apologize for the wordy post but I wanted to be as thorough as possible.  Strange things are definitely out there. Thank you!

Deep Cove sighting Report    As we sat to eat some pizza at a park table and bench near the canoe rental at Deep Cove, looking North,  I noticed a small light that caught my attention, as it was moving quite rapidly in many directions at the North West end of the Inlet. To put it in perspective, the mountains at the end of the Indian arm inlet are about 1500 meters in height and they are the North Eastern Horizon, when looking from Deep Cove’s Gallant Avenue. The sighting occurred in the South East face of Seymour Mountain while we were looking from the South side of the canoe rental outlet at the first of two park’s covered table. It was night time and the fog line was about four to five hundred meters above the water at the mountain face. Directly in front of us was Deep Cove Yate Club and to the right of our vision range, would be mid sight a place called Cory Rock, past the Marina, the sighting was to the North East of Cory Rock. A small light was moving around almost at the fog line at the mountain side definitively at the forest located at the North West end of the Indian Arm Inlet, past Cory Rock, past the Woodlands community and above it. The small light, caught my attention and I asked my daughter if she had seen it.  She replied yes, it may be someone with a flash light in the woods in the woods.  It did not make sense to me, as the trees are all over 100 feet tall in that forest, and whoever was passing around the light, should have been way taller than the tree line. Suddenly, the small light transformed into a huge search light like beam of intense white light (halogen type). The diameter of the light was larger than anti aerial search lights.  Suddenly, it was overlapped by a light of the same diameter and size (easily the diameter of a two levels house) given the distance, the aerial phenomena suddenly expanded to a series of round lights with three to four square or semi rectangular windows of light in between also observed by my daughter however omitted in her report. Then it came the most spectacular encounter with extraterrestrial intelligence ever; a large beam of light came from the center of the apparat or flying disk that illuminated the fog and created a daylight effect at the mountain, which allowed the true three dimensional perspective of size to be seeing. It had at that point no less than three and up to four of the round  search lights with the large semi rectangular windows of light in between, it had come from behind Mount Seymour, to hover silently above the inlet, when suddenly started a display of lights equal only to the PNE show of lights.  However, these beams were more potent. Given the distance and the fact that the object covered a great portion of the Mountain and horizon.  A conservative estimate of height or thickness of the saucer like object, could be 100 meters and its full diameter 7 to 10 full moons which could equate given the distance to a quarter to one third of a mile or 400 to 600 meters in diameter.  Minimum, hovering over 100 Meter above the water. The object in the same manner that materialized itself, dematerialized or placed all multiple potent search beams and lights going in all directions, off. Leaving a dome with what I perceived to be some windows, as the sole visible lights. I managed to take two pictures.  Picture 1. Is a total blank image white color in my black berry (never had that happen) the second one amazingly enough, shows an angle that was not the one I was focusing but the picture shows more of the village, or no less than 30-45 degrees left of where my camera was actually pointing at the smaller light. Afraid of the whole situation given the sheer size of the spaceship and lights show, we fast walked, almost run to Deep Cove to talk to someone.  Our friend was busy, so we went back to the ocean lookout at the end of Gallant Avenue. There was no light yet, it suddenly returned not for long or in full splendor but it did, hovered there for a while and disappeared in the fog at the end of the inlet sky. I could only equate it to a spaceship the size of Independence day. Having had multiple experiences with these machines, I declare the one we saw, was something that if it was seen in any city of the Planet, general world panic would ensue. When I sought I had seen many large UFO in Deep Cove with my daughter last year, this one, was a close up, mother ship and a half.

Unfortunately I was out of town on business at the time. As my 16 year old son left to drive his girlfriend home, he noticed strange lights in one of our fields/pastures on our property.  He thought at first that some lights may have been left on down near the hunting lodge about 200 yards from the main house.  Upon returning, he summoned my girlfriend to walk outside and look.  They determined it was in the field and nowhere near the lodge and in fact all power to the lodge was off.  They both described it as capsule shaped but vertical not horizontal.  It was three separate orange lights stacked on top of each other forming the capsule/cylinder. What is important to note here is this:  There is no access to that field other than our driveway/road which is 3/4 of mile long and blocked with a security gate.  The field is surrounded by thick (really thick woods) and a large creek surrounds the field in a horseshoe fashion.  Again... the only way in and out is to drive directly by our home. They watched it for 5 minutes and called me.  I tried to convince them to take a shotgun and drive out in my 4x4.  They refused.  This actually angered me because I was thinking there may be trespassers on the property but they said they could hear nothing and there was no movement.  They literally locked themselves in the house for the night and had trouble sleeping.  Upon returning home, I asked them separately to draw the object.  They did, and they both had the same exact description.  My son's girlfriend described the same thing, as she saw it 20 minutes prior.  They never stayed outside to watch it until it did whatever it did to go out or ""leave"".  This is due to the fact that in order to see it, they had to walk about 50 yards from the house in the dark in order to see it. Personally I'm upset that they did check it out.  I may sound like a bad dad, but I'm a firm believer in protecting my property.",2016-01-14T00:00:00,32.83452903225807,-86.66456451612903

I was sitting on my couch in my house And I noticed a light outside through  my window. I live near the intersection of highway I-71 where the bridge goes over West West Salem Road in Burbank, Ohio.  I was facing west looking Southwest out of my window.  The back ground is a fairly large open field with a high tree line in the back.  I've lived in this house and seen this view of this area for most of my life so I understood that this was something strange in the sky.  I'm trying to explain this is best I can and I'm using a voice recorder so I can actually talk and that makes it easier for me.  I saw a very small bright light in that said area and it caught my eye right away so I shut the TV off and I walked to the window I open the window which I had to kneel down band open the screen on the window and I just looked at the object.  Within 5 minutes, the whole thing lasted 5 minutes.  The pin sized object groove a fairly large glowing ball the same color as fire.  I would have to say that it lasted around 5 minutes.  I wasn't looking at a clock or anything I I just focused on it.  It stayed bright in the sky for around 5 minutes and then it just faded back out to a pinprick and disappeared.  It was still the whole time it never moved from one spot which automatically indicated to me that it wasn't a helicopter or something.  To describe myself I am NOT a a UFO buff by any means and I've never reported anything before.  But this is been significant enough to me that something was very strange and this is my first step in finding out what it possibly was.  Thank you!",2016-01-20T00:00:00,,

As I passed it and looked back in my rear view mirror it looked as though it had 3 bright engines on the back.

Liverpool, New York 13090 Friday January 15, 2016 Approximately 7:15 pm Traveling by car on Longbranch Road north towards Rt. 57 First sighted a bright, round red/orange light moving slowly above the tree tops from the right hand side of the road.  After a few seconds observed it was very unusual and pulled over to the right shoulder of the road.  Exited vehicle and walked 15 to 20 steps forward, towards the object.  Watched it as it passed over the road ahead of me, and then slowly passed over Longbranch Elementary School (ahead on the left side of road).  Object moved towards the North West in a straight line, at uniform elevation, until it faded from view.  There was no sound from the object.  As it got closer there seemed to be a corona effect around the center of the light.  The light seemed to vary within the confines of the corona (slight flickering).  At two points (first before it crossed Longbranch Road, and before I exited the car) it seemed there was something dripping from beneath the object, and the dripping material was brightly illuminated, like a small flame.  Observed that again while standi! ng on shoulder of road outside the car, just after it crossed above the road.  There was a light wind coming from the East (checked the National Weather Service afterwards). The object was not a plane, not a helicopter, not a balloon, not a flare, not a chinese lantern.  Had it been a flare, I would have seen the parachute, it would have descended in altitude, and the quality of the light would have been completely different (I’ve seen flares before and know what they look like).  I do not know what the light object was, and have never seen anything remotely like it before. I drove further up Longbranch Road, looking to the left side trying to see the object. The view was obstructed by buildings and trees.  Arriving at my destination, Rite Aid store on corner of Rt. 57 and Longbranch Rd, I looked back in the direction of original sighting and saw the light in the distance, perhaps a mile away.  It was much fainter at that distance.  It moved approximately to the west, then doubled back 180 degrees opposite direction for about one second, then reversed to opposite direction again continuing beyond the point in the sky where it first changed direction. I went a little further and blinked out of sight.  Then it blinked back in sight, but further to the west.  It continued on that trajectory until it faded from view.  I did not see it on the return trip back home. I do not drink. I don't take recreational drugs.  I know what conventional aircraft look light and their flight characteristics; both jet and light aircraft.  This wasn't anything conventional, and nothing I've experienced before.",2016-01-20T00:00:00,43.1345515625,-76.20640078125

As I observed further I noticed the object had an angular shape and was not rotating or changing shape as you would expect with paper/plastic debris in the wind. Observation through the binoculars confirmed it was the shape of a chevron or sharp boomerang and the object appeared to be a dark blue-gray very similar to the color of the sky.  It looked like there were 2 very dim and diffuse white lights on each ""wing"" or else these lights were bands of dim reflected light.

At first, I thought they might have been flares, so I kept looking at them as I was driving.  I was heading home which is further out on the southern edge of Buckeye.  It took me approx. 10 minutes to get to my street and the lights were still hanging in the sky.   I decided to drive down a country road in that direction to see them better.  I thought I could get closer to them, however after driving a few more miles it seemed I wasn't getting any closer so they must've been further away than I thought.  They were fading in & out and re-appearing either in the same spot as they disappeared in or they re-appeared in a different spot. At one point I saw  a couple of small lights develop out of one of the bigger ones and hung at the same altitude horizontally from the bigger one and then faded out.  They kind of reminded me of Christmas lights blinking but more randomly.  Sometimes they would all disappear and then return.  I did observe one of them very close to the ground. Interesting to note, before I became aware of these strange lights. I saw 2 military jets make a huge U turn around Buckeye flying over the area where I saw the lights, then the jets made a U turn and headed back towards the direction of the AF base.  I thought that was rather odd as they usually head in the direction of Yuma, AZ, where there is another base.  A coincidence or not?  I don't know. I've seen 2 lights in the sky just like that flying back in 2013 coming from the northwest in Buckeye.  No noise from them, no other lights except the amber color.  One flew towards the Luke AFB and the other went straight east towards Phoenix.  They disappeared as they went past me as the amber light appeared to be on the front of the craft and no other lights were on or flashing which was weird in and of itself.

((NUFORC Note:  Report was originally posted for November 15, 2015.  However, Saturday night was November 14, and we have amended the date.  The correction will appear at our next update.  We apologize for the error!  PD)) Saturday night, November 15th, 2015, 19:40 pm - Carroll, IA.  I was standing outside in a residential neighborhood close to the business district on crisp fall night facing east.  I caught a glimpse of something in the sky about 10-15 degrees above the horizon through some power/phone lines and over the buildings a block away.  The sky was pitch black, but only a few stars visible due to the city light pollution. A very clear night regardless, no overcast or clouds to speak of.  I've never seen anything like this in the sky before, and my eyes don't lie. I have always had perfect 20/20 vision my entire life, I do a lot of hunting and feel like my keen sense of sight has always been one of my greatest attributes in the field.  Being able to detect the slightest movement in any environment, sometimes distant has never been something I've struggled with. I spotted something, quickly in 1/2 a second my eye keened in on the movement.  At first I thought it was just a plane.  In the next moment I knew this wasn't a plane, or commercial airline.  I can't rule out that it might have been some military or government aircraft, but if it was, it was pretty damn impressive; top secret stealth kind of impressive.  The sky was so dark all around the object.  And the object didn't have any lights, not as most every other plane or jet I've seen in the skies. Clearly it was the shape of a triangle, at least the leading two edges were, which came to a point and pointed in the direction of flight.  It headed on a path from north to south as I watched in the eastern sky over town.  Carroll is appx. 10,000 in population, not a huge town, but pretty well lit at night.  I was standing in the central part of town, and would say that craft had to have been flying just over the eastern out skirts of town, maybe 3-4 miles away and low flying.  I'm not sure exactly but I'd have to say it was flying somewhere around 1,000 to 2,000 feet, it looked close. The object was black, matching the night sky.  It was meant to be undetectable, like a stealth spy plane, I guess.  But it looked completely out of place, flying low over small town Iowa like that, and cruising along silently.  The color of the object matched the background sky, but because of my location relative to the object and the city lights below, I could see the slightest reflection from town on the bottom side of the craft.  It was big, but again very difficult to estimate it's size, possibly B-2 Bomber size, possibly bigger.  All I could see was what appeared to be a slight reflection of city light on the leading edges of this triangle shape, gliding through the sky, effortlessly, and without a sound that I could hear. If I were to illustrate the sighting, it would be a black page with the slightest bit of light visible on the leading edges of the triangle.  There was no tail to the object, at least not that I could see the difference between it and the night sky. As I watched through that first two seconds I thought, I need to grab someone inside to witness this with me.  And before I could even put my hand on the door handle, to call for someone, it abruptly vanished with a fade to black. I kept tracking it anyway, hoping I'd get another look at it, but did not. This all happened in around 4 seconds time.  I kept my eyes on it for those brief few seconds until it vanished. I reported this because it shook me up when I saw it.  If it is one of our top secret planes, I can't imagine why it would be flying around there and especially that low.  I was lucky enough to catch the light of the city on the bottom of it as it passed by town for about 4 seconds. Whoever's plane or craft it is, they don't want anyone to see it, and it did an amazing job and being undetectable.  I'm not positive, but I'd imagine I could have heard a jet or plane from that range pretty easily even through the white noise of the town, but I didn't.

It was an orange fireball, moving east to west.  I continued to watch for maybe one minute and it passed out of sight over my house.  I figured if it continued on the same path I'd be able to see it from my West window. After about 1 minute it appeared directly overhead as I thought.  At an arm's length, it appeared 1/2 the size of my thumb (1/2"").  The fireball continued at the same altitude, color, and speed. The sky was mostly clear with patches of thin clouds, thin enough to still see stars through.  I'd say it was moving within the clouds as the clouds collected some of it's light.  My rough altitude estimate is 1,000-4,000ft. Amazed at how long this object was lasting I debated to grab a camera, call a neighbor, or continue to watch. I went to another room to grab my camera and was again amazed it was still visible and continuing on in the same manner when I returned.  I thought I was recording video.  I switched my attention from my phone to my window until it was no longer visible in my phone screen. I called my dad and told him what I was looking at and it disappeared from sight halfway through our conversation.  Judging by the phone call and timing running from room to room, I'd say the event lasted 10 minutes. When I say it disappeared, I mean it was too small to see.  I watched it from pretty much horizon to horizon. When I look at a map and think about its trajectory, it's likely it was traveling precisely east to west. As for the video I captured, a disappointing, shaky second long video.  I later realized the following week my touch screen had dead spots in it.  So, activating the video was clunky.

I was driving east in my semi on I-94 came upon the colorful fireworks display the city was putting on that night. As I rounded a bend in the road, I suddenly noticed lights in the sky emerging from the smoky haze generated by the fireworks.  The lights looked like three (3) orange balls arranged in a triangle shape, as if they were the 3 points of an equilateral triangle. At first I thought it might have been a plane because of the airport in nearby Madison.  But then I dismissed the notion because I saw no blinking lights which are the signature markings of such a craft at night.  Then I considered the possibility that it was a drone, but I believe FAA rules currently prohibit the flying of drones at at night without marking lights. The 3 orange globes appeared not to be connected by a structure in anyway, in spite of the overall triangularity of the whole, but it was dark and I couldn't tell.  The haze lent an eerie orange nimbus to whole array.  It was kind of weird the way it just emerged phantom-like from the fireworks haze. The object(s) flew directly west along the interstate, I estimate at maybe 80 to 100 feet overhead above the traffic. I don't know which direction the wind was blowing that night.  But the UFO moved with definite speed and seeming purpose, relative to the fireworks' smoke, which just sort of hung in the air, slowly dissipating.

This incident took place on the evening of Sunday, August 7, 1994, at 2230 local. It was a hot, humid evening, with the temperature in the 80s.  The skies were clear. About 2220, I received a call to pick up a passenger at St. Joseph hospital, in Ypsilanti. I proceeded to cross street, which then became Washtenaw Ave. While heading towards the hospital, I saw, off in the distance, three lights, flying in a V formation.  One was in front, and two following behind on either side, the same distance apart.  They maintained a perfect triangular formation. I lost sight of them for a few minutes, due to heavy tree cover. At first, I thought they might be hot air balloons.  But being it was after dark, I know they usually land before dark, and take of at first light. When I got near Hewitt ave., I broke in the clear, and I could see they that they had moved much closer. In fact, I pulled off on to a side street, and got out of my cab, to watch them more closely. Each object had a very bright white light, and an alternating red and white light on the rear. They weren’t moving very fast, probably less than 50 knots, and were fairly low. Taller than tree top, but not much more. They moved from the WNW, passed almost directly over me, and continued off to the ESE. There was another car that parked behind me. The intensity of the lights was so bright, that you could see the reflections of the light off the roadway. I also noticed that these objects made no sound at all.  As closely as they passed, I should’ve heard some sounds. When they were directly overhead, and the light cancelled out, I could see the objects quite clearly for about a minute. They were amber in color.  And they were shaped like a bell.  They were darker in the center, and lighter yellow on the points. I continued to watch them as they continued to the ESE, for almost 45 minutes. Just as I was losing sight of them, they appeared to make a shallow bank to the right. I could see they were heading in the direction of downtown Ypsilanti, so when I got back into my car, I called my dispatcher, who was a friend, and without telling him why, I asked him to step out of the office, turn to the north, and look up. After a few minutes, he returned to the radio, and I asked him if he had seen anything unusual, and he told me, yes.  He did. Well, that made me feel a whole lot better.  At least I wasn’t seeing things. After that, I went to the hospital, to pick up my passenger. After picking him up, I asked him to wait a minute. I then went into the hospital, and went to the nearest payphone.  I didn’t have a cellphone then. I then called 911.  And first told them that I was an official SKYWARN weather spotter, and that we work with Washtenaw County Emergency Services department.  I then told them what I had seen, and which way they were heading. At first, I thought they might be skeptical. But they took my report, like I was reporting an accident, and then I asked them if they had gotten many reports concerning our visitors. They then told me, that they couldn’t say. Very suspicious. Before I left, I made a call to a local TV station, and left my story with them. I got the opinion they really weren’t interested. I then called one of our local 24 hour news stations, and left my story with them. They too were very polite, but all they said were they were going to check Detroit metro tower, and maybe Selfringe, AFB, and ask them if they had seen anything unusual on their radar screens. So, there being nothing else to do, I went back to my passenger, and took him home. Next evening, at about the same time, I got a call to pick up the same passenger again. This time, after picking him up, I went inside, to ask several of the security guards if they had seen anything unusual the past evening. They told me that they were off the previous evening, so they weren’t there. However, while I was talking to the security guards, two local ambulance attendants pulled me aside, and told me that they had seen the objects. Well, again, that made me feel better. At least I wasn’t seeing things. While I was talking to them, I saw a state police officer talking on the phone. I made it to point to wait until he finished and I then I asked him if they had received many calls concerning our visitors. He told me yes. That they had received numerous, and numerous was the word he used, calls on these objects. A week or two later, I talked with the commander of the local state police post. He told me that they were, in fact, following those objects. I then asked him what several folks had asked me. What would you do if they had landed?  He never did answer me, but just gave me a grin. Myself. I would’ve probably seen how fast I could drive my car in reverse. A day or two later, there was nothing in the local media.  Radio.  TV.  Or newspapers. However. One of my co-workers had shown me the front pages from the flint journal, and grand rapids gazette. The ufo sightings were full front page news in both those papers. I wish I had saved those papers. I’ve since tried to get copies of those papers, and it’s been hard to come by. However, those papers said that on the day I had my encounter with those objects, there were sightings all over the Midwest, both on the day and a couple of days on either side. They were seen all over Michigan,  ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin.  In Michigan, they were seen in Ann Arbor, cadilliac, traverse city. Ive talked to other people here in ann arbor, and they had also seen those objects. But they kept a very low profile. And told very few people.",2015-12-10T00:00:00,42.23633504273504,-83.60297037037037

I was stationed at the Coast Guard base on the industrial canal.  It was a Sunday and I had watch.  My watch included walking to the docks and ensuring the vessels were properly tied off. I had the 0800-1200 watch.  The weather was clear with no visible cloud deck, the temperature was 70-80 degrees.  While I was walking on the dock, I stopped and talked to two other coast guardsmen who I had known from Bootcamp.  One was fishing around the docks and the other was going to relieve me in the next hour or so.  While we were standing there talking I noticed a slight line in the sky approximately 20 yards away and a 50 degree angle south.  I focused on the line and realized it was a small (4-5 foot diameter) disc rotating.  The bottom and of the disc was the same color as the sky.  The top of the disc during a slight uneven rotation was dark.  The line was the slight uneven rotation appearing like a line. I pointed to the object and offered simple orientation verbiage until both of the other men saw the object.  For the first two or three minutes we stood and stared. I asked the men to describe the object in as much details as they could.  The object was within 20 yards of our location and clearly visible.  In fact I commented that if I had a sidearm, I could easily shoot it.  There appeared to be small circular deviations in the surface below the center of the widest part of the diameter.  We discussed the lack of sound, vapors, lights or purpose for the small circles.  We discussed the possible propulsion system and observed no evidence to indicate a source. At that time I begin to use common aircraft taxiing signals to attempt to communicate with the object.  The airplane signals were not responded to however, when I started using helicopter signals the object would respond by descending in small movements to the landing signal.  At that time we observed the upper portion of the object was dark in color similar to the color of the water.  I attempted other common movements including pointing, waving and signal the object to come closer without response. According the one of the men, we had at that time engaged the object for 15-16 minutes and the only response had occurred from the helicopter signals.  I moved closer to the object until I was at the end of the dock and my position was approximately 10 yards from the object and it was at about 75 degrees.  I continued to describe the physical characteristics of the object. When the two other men moved toward the end of the dock, the object moved rapidly to the west until it disappeared.  We used dead reckoning and all measurements in angle or degrees are approximate. We report the incident to the Watch Commander and met with an officer from the Air Force.  He listened to our statements and advised us “to forget about it because by the time we were debriefed we wouldn’t know our own family.”  This is a discrete incident and I have conveyed the complete event.

I ran inside to get my binoculars and when I got back outside it took me about 5 minutes to find the object again as it had dimmed again to a point barely visible to the naked eye.  The object was about 40 degrees N.E. and still 70 degrees off the horizon.   At that moment, a bright flash came from the object.  It was as if a large camera flashed.  I followed the object with my binoculars as it moved E.N.E.  Slowly, and every minute or so, the object flashed brightly.  In all, I saw eight flashes as the object moved E.N.E. and out of my sight.    The sighting lasted about 30 minutes.

As it banked to the left ,the top of the wings got bright white because it was sunrise here to the south west.  It kept moving to left and disappeared from view because of the trees.  It never went any further to the left of the tree line.  It was lost from my view.",2016-01-14T00:00:00,44.6949,-69.1331

It started with me and my wife walking onto our back porch for a cig. right after it got dark. She actually had to point it out to me but when she did I noticed a bright orange/red ball of light fade into brightness, hold for a second to three seconds then dim out, only to reappear in the same spot and then suddenly split into two which faded out almost immediately. Normally we both try to throw off easy possible explanations, seeing as I have been into space and astronomy my whole life, but could not find any logical explanation other than maybe it was a missile from a military aircraft. After my wife walked inside to get out of the cold, no more than 5 minutes later I witnessed the same light. I did not call out to my wife because, as before, the light faded after the same appearance, but quickly after is disappeared it came back and went out a few times. Which is when I yelled for my wife to come out, even got a neighbor curious. She came to see the very end of this appearance which was the light flaring up again only this time it split into 2 evenly sized lights which immediately faded and did not return . As if that was not enough I was so amped up I told her I was going out front to get a better view and watch longer to try to see if I could spot patterns or anything.  Once I got out front it took a good 20-30 minutes before my next strange sighting.  This time it was a bunch of individual blinking lights.  No pattern whatsoever to how they blinked which is usually what I look for to debunk it as a known aircraft, but as I watched I noticed the blinking lights, which were much smaller and whiter than the previous one, had started to make 180 degree immediate turns.  As if they bounced off a wall and started going the opposite direction with no certain heading. For example on would go straight, immediately turn around , then suddenly head straight up or down. It was not just one it was all of them.  It literally looked as if lights were popping all around all at once  , and then as if related, the bright ball of orange/red light appeared just off to the left center of the group ! or blinking starts. only this time it flared and died out and did not return at all.  Soon after the blinking lights disappeared.  They did not leave, let me be clear of that.  They disappeared. Meaning I was watching them all blinking, and one by one , sometimes two at a time, would just vanish, and stop blinking.  I tried to think maybe cloud cover was causing the sudden loss of the lights but I pinpointed background stars in the same general area to which the lights were and could still see the stars. Finally after my mother arrived she was getting groceries out of her truck and I was still outside maybe 10 minutes after my last sighting.  I suddenly yelled at her to look, because she is a big anti ufo person, and as she did she pointed out that it had went out and moved to the right.  I heard her then get into her truck to get more stuff while I was still staring and the light was still there it amazingly suddenly had another exactly same light appear next to it and unbelievably came together into one and vanish just like the first sighting but backwards. After which I did not see that light anymore. No more than 30 min later I witnessed several more small blinking lights behaving really strange, like disappearing and reappearing going the opposite way, or suddenly appearing and then as if it was never there it is gone. I know how silly this sounds but I have been a firm believer of science and facts my whole life.  For 20 years of my life I have lived at this house and looked up at the same sky countless nights without seeing something even relatively as strange.  I know how aircraft lights behave and satellites.  They have patterns.  The closest pattern any of these lights had was only once when me and my wife saw the cluster of lights blink shortly almost in sync.  I really would like to know if maybe it was just some strange military testing or flying that was going on, or possibly military flares, but the way it happened, I can't, for the life of me, begin to understand what I saw.

We watched the ""star"" flicker between reddish orange and white as it slowly moved East across the sky.  My father noted that any plane moving that slowly would have fallen from the sky.  The light dimmed as the ""star"" turned South and began moving faster toward our house.  My mother and I quickly went outside to see if we could see the actual craft instead of just the light.  It changed course slightly, instead taking it higher and further to the side behind some trees rather than directly overhead. We never heard the sound of a plane engine or rotor of a helicopter.

After about a half hour of us talking about random stuff, I noticed a bright orange star looking thing at around 5,000 feet altitude..  But much bigger than a star.  When I first saw it I knew it couldn’t be a plane or a shooting star, it was too big and too bright to be either of those.  I pointed it out to my friend with a little alarming tone, and he shook it off as a plane. I tried to explain to him that it just couldn’t be a plane and he began to believe me after the object moved about 6,000 feet and vanished.  Now we we’re both at an alarming state.  We stared at the sky after that non stop and in a few minutes.  It re-appeared in its original location and did the exact same thing.  Moved a bit more this time and soon vanished again.  Now we knew we weren’t imagining stuff.   1 minute later, I spotted a huge bright white circle at about 2,000 feet altitude zooming past at immense speed. It immediately grabbed my attention and I showed my friend.  We watched it fly across the sky until it dropped past the horizon.  This thing was giant!  It’s not possible this was a balloon or any other man made substance...it just doesn't make sense.  Meteors aren't that big and neither are comets.  And I'm sure at that low altitude it would be on fire.  But not a perfect circle.   We have no explanation for either of these strange incidents but one more thing happened, soon before the white circle went out of sight a white firework light up at the opposite side of the circle without any sound which was kind of coincidental but I’m not sure that was anything of significance.

The speed either way was very fast.  No sound.  None.  Had it been a fighter at that speed it would be Mach 1 + easily.  Tracked E- W until going out of view.

Slim object with band of flickering lights seen hovering above nearby mountain peak - making unbelievable erratic maneuvers.,Mill Spring,NC,2016-01-16T19:35:00,cigar,5 minutes,"Occurred : 1/16/2016 19:35  (Entered as : 01/16/16 19:35) Reported: 1/16/2016 6:27:01 PM 18:27 Posted: 1/20/2016 Location: Mill Spring, NC Shape: Cigar Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/125/S125299.html,"Slim object with band of flickering lights seen hovering above nearby mountain peak - making unbelievable erratic maneuvers. A bit of info on my background: I am disabled with RA and heart problems so I spend a lot of time here at home.  I was a chef and restaurant manager, but I've also worked as a journalist and photographer (which is what I studied in college).  I mention that because I do consider myself a good observer and I've been trained to notice details... for descriptive purposes and setting up photographs. I'm an amateur sky-watcher and often spend nights outside with my Son during meteor showers or other celestial events.  I've seen plenty of aircraft, satellites and often the International Space Station. Many times we have observed strange lights or craft, but in every single instance we have come up with a rational explanation.  For example I'll mark the time and direction of travel and with a bit of research on the internet or with an app on the iPhone it's not too hard to name a satellite or natural object that fits perfectly with what we have seen.  I'm open minded about UFOs, but I'm always going to look for the most logical explanation... a way to identify that object first.  To me the truth is what is most interesting. Well, tonight I'm at a loss. I was sitting on my couch in my office watching a football game when a flickering light in my window kept getting my attention.  I'm naturally curious about everything in the sky and I thought it was a helicopter which I don't see often at night.  So I turned off my TV and decided to watch it. I live many miles away from a small town so there is no light pollution. I don't have any immediate neighbors or streetlights.  The area is wooded and extremely hilly, nestled nicely in the western NC mountains.  The lights from the craft were to the northwest of me over some nearby peaks.  There are trees between me and the mountains, but the lack of leaves in the winter allowed me to keep a visual continuously. It took me less than a minute of observation to realize this was not an airplane or a helicopter. At the distance of my viewing I never got to see the solid body of the craft, but the outline of the of the lights led me to believe that it was a cigar type shape.  There were four or five lights in a horizontal line that constantly flashed on and off in linear sequence.  The timing of the sequence was fast... less than a second... and then it repeated throughout the entire sighting.  All I could think of that it reminded me of was the flashers on some police cars... but stretched out. If the craft I saw simply displayed these strange lights and moved off in a steady manner like a conventional aircraft I would have just shrugged my shoulders and went back to the football game.  But, the way this thing moved got me clamoring for my overcoat and smartphone.  Standing on my back porch gave me a much better view and I could not (and still don't) believe what I was watching!  I found a nice gap in the trees and stood there amazed as this thing with strobe lights moved around in the night sky like something was wrong with it.  Nothing, and I mean NOTHING should be able to maneuver like this object was. It was jumping/skipping from spot to spot; not great distances, but up, then over, then back where it started.  The movement was erratic with no pattern that I could discern.  It almost looked like I was seeing some sort of video game glitch. I watched this same action for, I'm guessing, about four minutes.  There was no sound, but that really doesn't mean much because I see many aircraft in these mountains and often there is no sound or very little, it just gets swallowed up.  I mention that because there were planes in the sky at the same time.  I had been seeing another aircraft to my left (farther to the west) and didn't pay it much attention at first. All of a sudden the second craft moved rapidly in a straight line toward the first, pausing for about twenty seconds when the two were extremely close as if investigating - but, that is just conjecture on my part.  This new craft then moved around the strange flashing object (I could not tell if it went in front of or behind it) and flew off out of sight into the mountains to the north at a high rate of speed. This second craft very likely could have been a helicopter as it moved like one... but I have no way of knowing for sure. I do know that the interaction of the two objects was very unconventional.  Manned aircraft don't get that close to each other on purpose, especially at night. I tried taking a video with my iPhone but, I'm pretty sure I got nothing... too dark, and too far away.  I did grab my camera and got in my Jeep and tried to ride to a better vantage point to get a picture.  I saw an aircraft that could have been the possible helicopter involved, but I never could find the strange object again. If anyone has an explanation I'd love to hear it.",2016-01-20T00:00:00,35.3566,-82.1574

It was a mesmerizing sight to see the plane fly under the object, but have none of the blue rays reflect on it, which led me to believe the object was very far away.   Another exceptional observation was to consider the scale of the shape compared to plane.  The plane appeared to be the size of an ant compared to the object which gave me a sense that the shape was a lot further and a lot larger than the plane.

Driving west on Fred Waring in Palm Desert,  I saw two disk-shaped objects in the clear sky.  They were headed relatively fast towards west, seemed to be quite high up in the air, and I couldn’t hear any sound.  (I was in a car so that may have been the reason.)  The two objects were close to each other and kept the same distance and configuration.  They were both identical in appearance:  Oval, dark in color, somewhat metallic looking.  At the time, I and the driver of the car had no idea what they may be.  They didn’t look like anything I had seen before, and I couldn’t think of anything known they could be.  They went too fast for being a balloon.  They were definitely not birds.  It was daylight so they were not obviously planets or meteors.  They were not civilian drones since they went fast and continued over the mountains.  They did not have the shape of any airplane I have seen. Thinking back now, it is possible that they were two helicopters and we didn’t see the rotors or any of the things normally protruding from helicopters.  It’s possible, but it does seem unlikely that we wouldn’t have seen any of those things and the perfect oval shape of both objects didn’t fit the shape of helicopters I have seen.  It is possible that they were military drones flying in perfect formation and with no visible or audible form of propulsion.  I don’t know if military drones comes in a perfectly oval shape.  It was certainly an odd sight. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter  I am sorry, it was approximately 9am.

On November 15, 2015, at approximately 13:00 hours, I observed what appeared to be a point of fairly bright light in the southern sky.  This point of light was several degrees south of zenith, and slightly east.  Weather conditions at the time were clear, sunny, and fairly warm.  The light was similar in brightness to Saturn.  I observed the light with the naked eye for approximately three minutes.  The light did not move, flicker, dim, or increase in brightness.  I went indoors and obtained a pair of binoculars. Upon returning outside, I used my binoculars to look at the object.  It resolved in the field of view of my binoculars as a disc shaped object.  The object was not moving, nor were there any lights or other activity around the object.  It appeared to be chrome or light grey in color and at a fairly high altitude.  The material was very reflective.  I observed the object for about five minutes.  Unable to determine what the object was, I then went back indoors and brought out my Orion 4.5’ Equatorial Reflector Telescope with a 25mm optic. I found the object in my telescope and was able to notice greater detail about the object.  It was circular, and appeared to have thick, ribbed sides, similar to a Jello mold in appearance.  In the center of the object was a small nodule, also circular, that could best be described as the top of a bell.  There did not appear to be any tethering equipment attached to this object, nor any lights, windows, doors, or instrumentation attached, nor any motion from the object.  It remained stationary the entire time I observed it, which was about twenty-five minutes.  The object also appeared to be very stable and did not appear to be moving as a result of any winds that may be at the altitude the object was at. After resuming my outdoor activities, I came back to look for the object just before 15:00 hours.  The object was gone.

At this time, Adak was still under navy control & you were not permitted within 15 miles of the base.  We were fishing for black cod in the trenches by Tanaga & Kanaga. While driving the boat, I noticed lights on the horizon coming in our direction.  I assumed it was a freighter just because they are common going to Dutch Harbor.  It was not showing on the radar & was approaching very quickly.  I once again checked the radar & tried to hail the oncoming vessel on the radio.  I noticed we were on a collision course & then all our electronics were failing.  I put the boat in neutral & went to wake the captain that we were on a collision course with a huge vessel & our ship was having trouble with the generator.  The captain went to the wheelhouse & I went to the engine room to check for problems.  The engine was still running but no electrical output.  I then went back to the wheel house to inform the captain of the situation. As I climbed the steep stairs into the wheel house & noticed another crewmember had joined the captain. I thought it was weird that the captain was not at the helm.  He was on the port side with the other crewmember staring out the window. It was then I noticed that a gigantic Vessel was on our port side about 500 yards away.  My first thought was what kind of freighter was it.  I asked the captain what action should be taken & was silent looking at the other ship.  I went to the helm & sat in the chair & looked at the radar & set it to its lowest setting.  It was not working & neither of any other electronics. I then looked out at the other ship & was shocked to notice how small our boat was compared to the other vessel.  I then noticed the rotating lights were reflecting off the surface of the ocean.  I was astonished to then realize this Vessel we were looking at was in the air.  I asked the captain if it was the navy or military.  He said ""aliens.""  For some reason, I wasn't scared but more in awe of what we were witnessing.  It had a green haze emanating around it, with different lights flashing around it.  I couldn't exactly define the shape of the Vessel other than it was enormous. It then slowly began to rise & turn away from us.  After a few seconds it sped away at incredible speed & vanished. After it left all our electronics came back online.  The captain put the boat in forward gear & headed towards the next fishing grounds.  The next day the other crewmember would not talk about what he seen last night.  The captain admitted to the rest of the crew what had happened. I spoke with other fishermen in Dutch Harbor about fishing out near Adak island.  If they encountered or seen mysterious lights.  I was told those craft have been seen out there for as long as anyone can remember. I still remember that encounter like it just happened.  After that day I knew man was not alone on earth.

On the evening of August 15th, 2015, a partner and I were in my back yard stargazing using a 124x pair of astronomy binoculars and a a pair of 12x24 zoom binoculars.  We both noticed a very bright white light to the ENE low to the horizon moving toward us.  I was able to focus on the light/object with the 12x24 binoculars expecting to see an approaching aircraft. The light/object passed just north of us a mile or less away and at approximately 2,000 feet in altitude.  These distances are estimates but I believe them to be reasonably accurate.  I began relaying my observations, made while viewing through high quality binoculars, verbally to my partner.  They were observing with out the aid of any optics and only with their naked eye.  As the light/object approached I could see no strobes, red or green position lights, sound (the object/light made not a sound it was dead silent) and the light, assumed to be a landing light on an aircraft, never changed in brightness or appearance as one would expect an aircraft landing light to behave as it passed.  No structure was visible just a very bright white light.  I can safely say when the light/object was closest to us if it had been any more intense in brightness it would have been difficult to view through the optics I was using.  Nothing all that unusual so far as any ac approaching at any altitu! de in this location would, as proper procedure, turned its landing lights on.  The flight path took it over the local airport and well below the approach pattern to MSP International airport. This is when the light/objects behavior became perplexing. It passed in front of our location at about a 50 degree azimuth due North and continued to the East briefly passing through the branches of a nearby tree.  As it got to the ENE it stopped, grew in intensity, turned into a rusty red dot, vertically descended, stopped, turned back to a white light, grew again in intensity, turned again into a small rusty red dot, repeated this pattern of behavior one more time and simply disappeared.  This left both myself and my partner wondering what we had just witnessed.  It is noteworthy that these events occurred in relatively close proximity to our location and not way off in the distance.  As it turned out the events of the night were not quite over. We noticed another bright white light approaching from the same location and direction.  It had a different appearance and when viewed with binoculars was clearly an twin turboprop aircraft with a distinctive landing light pattern of two bright double outboard lights and a single less bright center light.  The sound of twin turbo props was clearly audible along with red/green position lights, white tail light and a strobe light. The aircraft structure was easily visible and as the ac passed it behaved as expected, sound, lights changing as it flew away from our position. It appeared to be at the same altitude as the light/object and passed through the tree branches extremely close to the same position. The aircraft flew to the location where the first object had stopped, made one and a quarter orbits and flew off to the north. The landing light pattern only fit one aircraft type and I can state with a high degree or certainty that it was a Dehaviland dash 8.  A very distinctive and unique landing light pattern. These are operated near here by Air Canada, Porter Airlines and possibly the USAF and Department of Homeland Security.  The latter two entities using them as a surveillance platform.  Either by purpose or by coincidence this aircraft was in trail of the first object/light that had passed. Sent from my iPad",2016-01-08T00:00:00,44.3278,-93.2776

I can only guess that they were probably 15 miles away and seemingly low,  just a couple thousand feet up in the sky.  The sun was still below the horizon, but was brightly coming up generally in the eastern direction of these objects and the golden color was as if the objects were metalic and reflecting the sunrise light, being vivid and bright.  Right away it struck me that this looked odd.  There were high thin obvious clouds to the east that stretched quite aways north to south, but they weren't thick enough to obscure some very distant jet traffic that could be seen a few times that would be consistent with jets leaving from the Phoenix airport.  Those jets were very far off, barely discernible other than their contrail, but you could note they were going up from groun! d level and angling up to the north at typical angles and speeds for commercial jets to take off on.  I didn't figure that the commercial jets were anywhere near these three objects, but much further away, and likely would not have seen them. While the far off jet traffic was playing out in the background, it emphasized the stationary manner and proximity of the three low and bright golden objects.  The object that appeared to be closest to me, but not far from the other two objects that were slightly above and behind from my vantage point, appeared to be a long, thin rectangle of golden light with the long flat side being parallel to the ground as if level to it. The rectangle wasn't very tall relative to it's length and would be like this symbol --- proportionally.  The other two objects were in a somewhat tight grouping with the rectagle, but were further away and I could not see any shape in that they were just bright golden circles, difficult to focus on for any detail. I was on vacation and carrying a camera in my car and knew that I should get a photo of these.  There wasn't a very good place to pull over at first, but I knew there was gonna be a stop in a mile or so where State Highway 72 meets Highway 95 and I intended to stop there and do a photograph, but I was also anticipating that when I got on Hwy 72 I would be heading directly towards these objects and that if they remained in place for another 10 minutes of driving time I'd probably be getting pretty close under them for a closer view. When I came around the bend of the road where the highways meet and I'd intended to take a photograph, I was surprised to see an Az. State Trooper pulled across my lane, blocking it with a few orange cones out at the Highway 72 intersection.  It could have been because of an accident down the road, and in retrospect I probably should have asked him, but as I drove up to ask him if indeed that road was closed he was seemingly perturbed because I had driven up to his vehicle and not just turning down the alternative highway. (95 toward Quartzsite).  I didn't ask him about the lights that I'm sure he could have seen from his vantage point.  I had to do a kinda funny maneuver then to get on to 95 southbound then and hoped he wouldn't give me a ticket, but he probably couldn't leave his post.  As soon as I was on that other road a ridge started rising up and within a minute cut off my view of those objects so I never got a photo.  Had I been able to get on that Hwy 72 the next town in about 10 miles is called Bouse, and I think that those objects were just a bit north of the highway and not far from Bouse. I observed these stationary objects for about 10 minutes and I never saw any movement.  I looked at your site to see if there were any other collaborative report and see that someone saw something moving on the ground in the same general area at about the same time, so I decided to also report what I saw.",2015-12-21T00:00:00,33.9902,-114.2391

Two sets were side by side and one pair hovered over Holston mountain, one above the other and kind of swayed side to side.   Another craft flew overhead and made a faint jet-like noise.  It had a lot of lights, but no visible structure, just the lights.  Made no sense. A white helicopter with its searchlight on was chasing the craft.   Lastly another craft flew by with two white triangles on each side and a red box in the center.   We were driving but pulled over to watch.

Either it was military or something local/something to do with Christmas...? Idk (I doubt).  It was flying in the northwest direction. This object made no noise whatsoever.  If you wasn't looking up at exactly the right time, you most likely wouldn't have seen it. I was just wondering if anyone in middle Tennessee area had seen the same thing?

For reference in size it appeared to be a few inches in length while I viewed it in my windsheild, and 1/3 of this was what appeared to be solid grey matter.  The grey matter looked far larger than any aircraft that I would expect to see.  The object and trail moved from directly ahead of me over 7th street very far in the distance when I crossed highway 249, to out my passenger window far off in the distance by the time I reached Rangeline road in Joplin Mo. This really seemed very fast.  Also noted there was a man made aircraft south of this object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I told the dispatch lady an officer doesn't need to come where I'm at just tell him to go out of the building and he'll see it.   When I got back into town I called the police station.  They said that the night shift, whom I talked with DID NOT leave any messages about a strange light.  I thought, ""that's crazy""!  I then called the radio station and they gave me the same message.  I thought if any one was outside! this morning, they would have seen this thing.  As I watched it, I had the unusual feeling that it wanted to contact me.

The objects were loosely formed (spacing between orbs were equal to 4-5 times width of sphere) moving somewhat irregularly, low on the horizon, west to east.    When I went out onto the deck to get a better view, I looked east over the trees and roof tops and see five more spheres/orbs still moving irregularly west to east.  These eight orb devices did not move in a standard formation.  They were never traveling in a straight line.  They’d gradually descend a bit and other times ascend as they traveled west to east.  They did not change altitudes simultaneously.  The trailing, pulsating orb appeared to be moving closer to us but moving more vertical; stopping about 2-3 times higher than the other orbs that were still moving away from us, but the pulsating never ended.   A small plane flew by with its position and strobe lights on.  I have worked on or around aircraft for nearly 20 years and these spheres/orbs looked and moved NOTHING like any plane, helicopter or Chinese lantern I have ever seen.   Over a period of maybe 5 minutes, all the orbs eventually traveled beyond a point where house roofs obstructed my vision.

This event occurred at about 1:10 AM on March 14, 1997, about 18 miles southwest of Tucson, Arzona.  At that time, I was a 42 year old electronic engineer. who operated a small home business, doing contract jobs for various clients.  I had lived in Tucson for some time, and felt that the city was too noisy for me to concentrate on my work.  I wanted to live in a quiet rural area where I would not be disturbed, and in 1996 I purchased a house in a sparsely populated area southwest of town. I had a neighbor across the road from me, and there was an unoccupied house furthur to the north.  My property extended about 100 feet from the front of the house, and then there was a barbed wire fence.  It had 5 wires, the top one being about 4 feet high.  It was usually quite dark at night out there, however I had installed some floodlights on the front of the house, which I could turn on if needed. I went to bed around 10 PM, March 13, and was sleeping soundly when the event began. I was awakened around 1:10 AM, March 14, by the sound of someone attempting to open the bedroom window, about 6 feet away from me.  The sound was like nails on a blackboard.  The window was on the front of the house, and consisted of double-pane glass with track-locks on it, and a set of blinds which were closed.  Although I could not see who was trying to get in, I had a profound feeling of being in danger... as if whoever was outside specifically intended to do something bad to me.  I've always had a good sensitivity to the feelings of people and animals, and I was confident that what I felt was genuine. As quickly as I could, I rolled out of bed, away from the direction of the window, and grabbed a 12 gauge shotgun from the closet.  At this time my emotions changed from fear to intense anger and a strong determination to kill the attempted intruder, if he got in.  I pumped a shell into the chamber, which made an audible noise, then ran to the living room window, which was only about 10 feet from the bedroom window, also on the front of the house.  That was where the switch for the floodlights was located. I hit the switch, and was totally shocked when I saw a creature, which was now moving away from the house towards the fence.  I got a pretty good look at the back of it, for about 5 seconds.  It was definitely not human.  It was about 6-7 feet tall and had a large head, similar in shape to a football helmet.  It was very thin and the arms were quite long.  It wasn't exactly running, but it was moving smoothly and very quickly. It reached the fence in just a few seconds, and then, without slowing down, it jumped right over it, like a hurdle jumper in the Olympics, and kept on going.  It continued down to the wooded area where the unoccupied house was, and within about 30 seconds I saw a disk shaped object rise up from there, and move off towards the south. It was about 30-40 feet in diameter and passed by the front of my house at a distance of about 130 feet, about 60-80 feet above the ground.  It had steady yellow-redish lights on the bottom of it and made no sound that I could hear. I mentally collapsed into a state of total shock and an overwhelming feeling of fear.  All I could think of was what might happen if it came back.  I spent the rest of the night hiding behind a couch in the living room, clutching the shotgun. When the sun began to come up, I started to come to my senses. I carefully went outside and looked around.  Everything seemed normal, except that by my bedroom window I found some footprints.  There hadn't been much rain and the ground was rather hard, but a few of the impressions were fairly clear.  The prints were about 10-11 inches in length, very thin, and with 3 large toes. I decided to go to a hardware store and get some bolt locks to secure the doors.  This I did, and on the way back I stopped at a small cafe a few miles from my house, to pick up some coffee and breakfast.  I entered the cafe, ordered some food, and then noticed that a casual friend of mine was there.  He lived in a trailer a few miles to the south of me.  When I saw him I simply said ""Man, something really weird happened last night,"" and he replied, ""You're not kidding... a UFO came up the canyon"". I was startled to hear that, and asked him, ""What time?"" and he replied, ""about a quarter past 1.""  When he said that, I panicked and left the cafe without even taking my coffee or food.  (Several months later I actually tried to find him, to ask him for more details, but I was told he had left the area back in March...immediately after the event had occurred.)   Anyway, I returned to the house, and installed the locks on the doors.  The following day I went into town and purchased a bunch of heavy plywood, and boarded up every window in the house. I considered reporting the incident, but I was doing some electronic design work for the military, and I was afraid that I might be typed as a lunatic or a security risk and lose my clearance... and in addition, I simply had no desire to talk about it.",2015-11-12T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

As soon as I entered the room, through the window I saw a large and extremely shiny silent triangle hovering over the ground in front of a tree in our outdoor garden.  It was facing my window.   I stopped in my tracks and observed the object, wondering if it was some kind of climate phenomenon or unusual lighting, but quickly understood this was most likely not the case. The triangle was flat, with clear borders, and its inside looked like a very shiny, almost fiery, orange hologram (I could see the tree located behind through it).   It was a bit taller than a small van.  The center was pinkish, as well as its corners.   Whereas usually at this time of day there are many birds flying around, there were eerily none to be seen near the area at that time. I wanted to make sure I was truly witnessing what I was seeing so I approached the window and started screaming and calling to other family members to come and see. My husband and children rushed in and by then the triangle had started to slowly move diagonally towards the sky and to become smaller. We all kept oohing and aahing at it until the triangle became very small, changed its position to lay flat in the sky and gave off a set of very brief and beautiful bright red lights, suddenly disappearing into thin air. Immediately after this happened, we received a call from our alarm providers.  My mother in law has a medical alarm that consists of a button she presses if she needs medical help. The alarm necklace was hanging high from a lamp in my room at the time and our providers stated they were calling because the medical alarm was set off, and they wanted to know if everything was all right.  Obviously, no one had touched the alarm button at all while we were in the room watching the unidentified flying object.",2015-11-12T00:00:00,,

The property remained subject during the period in which realized its presence, I noticed that would have a rotational movement (clockwise) on its main axis, for when the sun's rays focussed on the underside of the object noticed a slight moving aura ... The UFO found himself next to a cloud ending slightly beak, which came not to be covered by it.  Suddenly the object began a movement hyper fast in the northwest direction.  During the observation and face started to move, expect to see have seen ojecto enter the cloud, and then out of the other side quickly, but this did not happen ... he disappeared completely within the cloud.  The object was metallic appearance, gray in color, has never issued any sound or stationary, nor when you started the movement. Note:  I served the Portuguese Air Force for 36 years, I have the exact notion of what are fixed-wing aircraft or mobile, I know their noise, the ascending or descending movements, speeds, the usual or unexpected behavior ...

We left Albuquerque at 4.35 Mountain time, arriving in Seattle at 6.45 Pacific time. Somewhere north of Salt Lake City, looking at the flight path it could have been northern Utah, Idaho or Oregon – I really am not that familiar with the area, I looked out of the window on the left side of the plane, looking to the west.  We were flying, I think, at 36,000 feet.  The mountains were some way below us.  It was dark by that time, but I could see towns and communities lit up and I think there was some light from the moon.  Generally the sky was clear. I suddenly noticed a large, orange ball approaching from the north or north-west, below the plane, travelling very fast to the south or south-east.  It was very steady – glowing with light – lit from within – a bit like a huge ball of fuzzy orange felt!  It soon went behind the engine of the plane – I was sitting near the front.  I can’t begin to assess how big it was – it was far below our plane – I had the impression it was very big.  Many of the pictures I have seen on the Internet show the exact colour – a true orange – and shape and look. I remember there were some mountains overshadowing a small town.  The object was travelling below the tip of the mountains, around the tree line.  The trajectory was unwavering – no other lights to indicate it was a plane or helicopter.  It seemed to me to be travelling way too fast to be a plane. I don’t think I have any more to add.  I didn’t have anyone beside me to verify and it all happened so quickly.  I wonder if you have any more reports from passengers on the plane.   Being my first trip to and from Albuquerque to visit my daughter, I was very interested in looking out of the window all the way.",2015-11-26T00:00:00,40.704464857813726,-111.88213884685625

I immediately noticed two very strange bright red lights that were far in the distance and very high up, the kind of altitude you would expect to see a high flying jet, or even higher.  It just seemed high up and distant. They were roundish and brilliant red, no other colors.  It did not look like airplane lights since no other colors appeared, just extremely pure brilliant red. One seemed to be heading upward and getting closer and the other appeared to be heading downward and getting closer, coming toward my direction in other words and they had a roundish appearance to them. I did not think to take out my cell phone and try taking photos, they might not come out since it's not really a good camera for in the dark anyhow. As I watched, soon the lights came near to one another, maybe touched, but I could not know for sure.  Then one shot outwards to the left and going higher and disappeared out of sight, in the matter of a few seconds. Then the other shot up and outward, at an angle heading exactly back in the opposite direction while going up - and it seemed to accelerate as it got smaller and smaller, then disappeared in a few seconds also, like it had traveled out of sight in a very short time. There was no noises from these lights, but I doubted there would be given how far away and high they appeared.  The only noises were sounds in the parking lot and long the main road of cars driving by or peoples' voices in the background going in and out of the stores.

We pulled over and got out of the car.  They were moving together across the sky heading northwest.  They were a bright, solid, steady reddish light, not blinking as aircrafts do.  There were about 8 of them.  Maybe 10,000 to 18,000 feet in elevation.

It then changed its direction slightly (change of direction was just before it passed me) by moving due east. I watched it until I could no longer see it as it got behind some trees, etc.  I did notice it would change to a reddish tint a few times, but was a very bright orange the majority of time.  It was very illuminated.  I consider it was a solid circle/oval object (fully illuminated circle). I specifically looked for blinking lights or lights that would appear from an airplane, but none were there.  I was quite surprised by the solid brightness of the object throughout the duration.  As I focused while it passed me; the light appeared as a star image.  The object made noise as if it was an airplane, but it certainly w! as not an airplane using normal lighting sequences.  I’ve watched plenty of airplanes and the way it was moving just didn’t seem to match the way an airplane moves (I’d be shocked if it were an airplane).  The altitude was approximately around or below 8,000 feet (this could be a very inaccurate judgment).  However, I just recall it seeming to be very close/low in the sky.  I'm always looking up at the sky when I have a chance, and this isn't the first time I've seen something. It was not a lantern because the altitude did not change while it moved by me.  This light was extremely big in comparison to a star.  I'll have to include more information in another report about another recent strange sighting.

I wondered if they could be stars but I could see no other stars out and they seemed too bright to be stars especially while the sun was still partly out.   About 10 minutes go by and we noticed the two bright circles in the sky began to change shape from circles to diamonds and they slowly started moving to the left at the same time. Than they stopped and started to change to a dark reddish color.   About 10 minutes go I after that and I start to notice the two lights that were super bright this whole time are starting to slowly dim down.  This lasted about 5 minutes untill they just vanished away out of thin air.right after the objects vanished we watched a couple jets head towards where the objects were. it was one of the craziest things I ever saw and im glad I had two other people witness it with me.,2015-11-19T00:00:00,42.109787704918034,-72.55383770491802

When reaching the intersection of Hamilton Drive and Crystal Lake Drive we spotted a large, bright red light against the mountain.  My first thought was it was a car's tail lights visible on a mountain road, but then realized there were no mountain roads in that area. The light moved up the mountain side seemingly following the slope and then back down to approximately its original elevation and began blinking a small green light from the lower side of the red light.  It began to move left, right, back left and then rapidly ascended to an altitude approximately the height of the mountain, estimate 500 feet in about 5 seconds.  Then it rapidly descended back to its original altitude. The light slowly descended from that point behind a tree line as if landing and was not seen again. No craft shape could be seen as the red light dominated. The event lasted approximately 20 minutes.",2015-11-19T00:00:00,34.41464285714286,-85.71918571428571

Hovered brightly in one spot and then vanished. Approx 10:00pm in Concord, CA, my daughter and I were arriving home and facing north, when I noticed two circle objects that were a reddish orange.  They were different enough that I stopped the car and pointed them out to my daughter as possibly planets.  She loves hearing about the stuff that goes on up there and at 5 loves the telescope.  There were two when I first saw them and initially thought they were planets.  With so many planets in sight soon, it was my initial thought because they weren't stars, shooting stars or airplanes. Clearly.   Then as I looked closer, I noticed they were the same exact shape and looked to be the same distance from myself, so being planets seemed impossible and the size was a little too large for a planet.  One was a bit higher than the other one but directly on top of it.  It was an odd site at first.  They were bigger than an airplane and it never blinked green or any other color.  They both looked to burning brightly the more I looked at them, and luckily, there were planes in the sky that were somewhat nearby and those gave a quick way to compare and notice the obvious difference between the two. I then quickly parked my truck and took my daughter to walk back to where we could see them.  When we got back over there, it was maybe 1-2 minutes later, the highest one was gone and the lower one looked to be a little closer but pretty similar to its last position.   When looking at it, I felt like it was moving although its position in the sky wasn't really changing much.  It's hard to explain.   As I watched for another couple minutes, telling my daughter to watch it and pay attention, it didn't seem to brighten or dull much other than the thin, low flying clouds coming in between us at times, but never lost visiblility of it.  It sat there as bright as it had been and then quickly vanished.  I couldn't explain it and thought, maybe clouds, but quickly saw another airplane fly in the same direction and it affirmed to me that it wasn't clouds and the quickness in which it disappeared affirmed to me that it wasn't the clouds that made it disappear from site.  It wasn't an obstructed view, it disappeared from the sky.  Like it just turned off. Although it wasn't doing much, it didn't seem like anything I'd ever seen.  The bright glow compared to an airplane and the way it moved or even the way it didn't move was just odd and I'm a sky watcher so this is coming from someone who watches a lot and this was the first time I believed I'd seen something out of my realm of understanding.",2016-01-23T00:00:00,37.8849,-121.8443

The object size was about the same size as the military jet and appeared to be either circular or triangular...can't say for sure, it was dark.  Two red lights in the back and one light green or orange light going forward.   I was surprised at how closely the military jet shadowed the object.  I'm estimating the elevation of the two aircraft at +- 1000 to 1500 ft. above surface level. ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain as to whether this is a servious report.

On 11/4/2015, around 3:00 AM I was awakened by an odd feeling and drawn to look outside my bedroom window.  Once I looked out my window, what was seen has left me convinced, confused and wanting to know more about what it is exactly, that I saw.  I live out on a cattle farm, and on that particular night the cattle were in the field from which I saw the UFO.  It appeared to me as a very large, round light about the size of a softball, that was swirling with many different colors; purple, pink, red, green, orange that could have resembled a head lamp in its movements.   The light floated in mid air for about 30 seconds as I watched it, then suddenly vanished moving to the east and appeared to enter the shadow/body of a single cow.  This sounds highly unlikely and crazy at that, but I know what I have seen and no one can tell me that it was a drone or anything human.   About two or three days after the sighting, while walking through the field, I came across the remains of a cow, missing its entire skull, clean cut- this could have been due to coyotes/birds of prey, etc., but for whatever the reason those two events to me seem as if they may be related in some strange way.",2016-01-08T00:00:00,,

The object was hovering over the far right side of the new Santander bank, while high up, it was considerably low, its worth mentioning that if you are formulaic with this area of Cranston/Warwick you would know that this area is VERY heavy with air traffic, I see dozens of planes of all types and sizes every week night and day, it was very obvious and clear that this was no satellite or aircraft.

This thing was so bright and eerie that I desperately looked around to see if anyone else was seeing what I was seeing, I was hoping at least someone would be out walking their dog because if any one was out at this time especially on Grand ave the object would have been a very obvious sight, but no one was around. I try to keep pace with the object as it starts to enter another large dense, dark, natural cloud...  I've never seen anything like this as it literally made my heart beat go crazy and I got a slight adrenalin rush, the whole time while observing the object I kept telling myself that it was real and I was seeing it, like I described before, the object started out as a very bright, streetlight colored star that was very low and very obviously out of place, when I seen it the second time it was drastically lower, I could make out the shape to be sort of like a football, the color remained that solid old streetlight, orange with a very bright glow around it, I've described the thing to people as a flying streetlight with out the pole.

There were planes all in the sky and you could clearly identify them just by looking and listening, but this orb like ball was different.

It just traveled across the sky until completely out of sight.   My kids were excited and wanted to know what we had just seen..  All I could tell them was that (because of their ages) it was Santa and Rudolph going back home to the North Pole after visiting the children in the US.

I initially intended to check the outside temp on a thermometer attatched to my window screen.  It was 22° and very clear.  My attention was quickly diverted to the skyline above Greencastle pike.  Just above the tree line behind my house I noticed a very low flying object which basically looked liked a very bright ball of white light.  I couldn't make out any shape of the craft as the light was too bright.  It continued to fly very slowly in a southern direction towards Hagerstown's west end.  I just assumed it was a Cessna type plane flying low on a landing approach to the Hagerstown airport and I continued admiring the clear morning sky. As I'm scanning the sky and looking at what stars, I could see, I noticed two other passenger planes flying at different directions at a much higher altitude than the flying ball of bright light I first noticed.  Both of those planes displayed the blinking red lights that I'm familiar seeing. The sight of those higher flying planes made me realize that the plane that I thought was a Cessna wasn't displaying any red or blinking lights at all, just one massive light covering the entire craft.  I also realized that the ball of white light was actually flying towards the center of town, not to the airport as I originally thought because of it's low altitude and speed.  It was literally just ten or fifteen feet above the tree line that runs perpendicular to Greencastle pike and connects to the adjacent neighbourhood. When I gathered all my thoughts together and began to think that this thing may not be a private plane at all, I grabbed for my phone which was charging on the nightstand next to my bed with the intention to shoot some video.  As I raised the phone and fumbled with video mode and focus, the light disappeared as if someone turned off a light switch.  I didn't see a light trail that I would expect to see if the object had accelerated away at high speed, nor could I see a dark outline of an unlit object against the morning sky.  It's as if it were erassed with no trace of it ever being there in the first place. At this point I just froze in place. I didn't know how to feel or what to think. I was just numb trying to understand what in the world it was that I just witnessed.  Never in my 48 years have I seen anything in the sky that I couldn't explain. For the past few days in my spare time I've been driving around the area directly under where I observed the light trying to explain this off as something normal.  There are no high mountain roads for it to have been car headlights, and I believe the object behind the light was too big to be a civilian (toy) drone. This object was in my view for exactly 5 minutes.  It made no sound at all, never changed speed or color, and never diverted from its flight path before I lost sight of it.  As far as size is concerned, I'm guessing that it was equivalent to the size of a private Cessna style plane, but possible a little bigger.  The trees that I observed the object flying over are approximately 50-60 feet high, putting the height of the object in flight at about 75-100 feet. Lastly, I scanned the sky that Sunday morning in all directions until 7:20am, trying to relocate whatever it was that I witnessed.  I've also checked the same area of sky from 5:30am until 7am the following Monday and Tuesday mornings only to find nothing out of the ordinary.",2016-01-08T00:00:00,39.63588759398496,-77.69398796992482

The first sighting occurred at approximately 10:35 pm on Monday, 12/14/2015.  I was driving my car, turning right onto Cropley Ave. from Conifer Ln. in San Jose, CA.  As I looked left to make sure there was no oncoming traffic, I noticed quite a bright ""star"" streaking toward the easterly direction.  It lasted less than two seconds, tracing across perhaps a fifth of the sky. My first reaction was that I had seen a meteor.  But the object wasdefinitely a small round disc (like a golf ball seen at about 30 feet away).  The luminosity was similar to that of an LED light and, although moving rather fast, it did not exhibit a ""tail"" as the natural light from a meteor would do.  As I made the turn and continued to drive, I really didn't think anything more about it. My drive proceeded southwesterly along Cropley to Morrill Ave., turning right on Morrill to get to Landess Ave., where I then turned left.  Landess heads roughly westward and turns into Montague Expressway after the Highway 680 overcrossing.  I proceded southwestward down Montague, crossing over Highway 880, until I stopped at a red light at either Zanker Rd. or N. 1st St. (I'm not sure which one.)  The time was approximately 10:45 pm and it was here that I saw the golf-ball object again while looking up to the left through the windshield at about a 40 to 45 degree angle.  Instead of streaking as it did before, it made a sort of randomly ""hilly"" curve in the sky that lasted about as long as the first sighting. I was rather surprised, however, to see that (in the background sky of the golf-ball object) there were (I believe) eight lights of much lesser intensity than the golf-ball.  Each light was (as best I can describe it) shaped kind of like a flattened diamond. The most noticeable feature of these lights, to me, was that they were divided into two rows of four lights each, one row below the other by perhaps 5 to 10 degrees, from my vantage point.  Each row's lights were evenly spaced, and the bottom row's lights were aligned directly below the top row's.  The lights alternately dimmed and intensified, in unison, with a period of perhaps two to three seconds. As I stared at the configuration, I thought it might be due to an optical artifact of the area's street lights reflecting on my windshield.  But I rolled down my window and stuck my head outside to look; they were still there. It also occurred to me that there could be Christmas lights on the top edge of a nearby building.  I wouldn't be able to see the building because it was night and the brighter street lights would interfere with any ambient backlighting behind the dark building.  However, at the angle and direction I was looking (~ 45 degrees up, southward), no buildings are that tall when one takes into account the distance between my stopped car at the intersection, and any building to the south. Finally, the lights could not lie on a possible power line because both rows were arranged absolutely ruler straight, whereas there would likely be a slight bow in the arrangement if attached to a power line (due to line sag). The whole sighting at the stopped light on Montague probably lasted about 15 to 20 seconds.  Just before my traffic light turned green, there were (I believe) three other cars at the intersection: one next to me on the right, one in the opposite direction that was beginning a turn northward onto the cross street, and one waiting on my left on the cross street, at his red light.  I looked to see if I could detect any awareness of the unidentified lights by the person on my right, but it was difficult to see the driver inside the car.  It seemed as if no one else noticed. The sighting was over when each row of lights split in half, two lights accelerating to the right, two accelerating to the left.  The intensity of the lights quickly dimmed to zero as their speed increased, and they never deviated from their ruler straight horizontal paths.

They looked like they were hovering over Home Depot, it put chills all over me!   We sat there a few more minutes (7:15 PM) and decided to leave and go out of the city where there would be no light pollution to watch them.  We drove about a mile and lost them, after getting to an area that was dark and a clear shot of the sky we parked and looked for another 5 or so minutes without seeing anything, I then left heading west after a couple of miles I turned back east and drove to a top of a hill where we saw them again (7:35 PM), they were much further away to the west and not as close together but were stationary and changing from red, green to white.  There were several planes in the sky so you could defiantly tell they were not planes. After another 5 or so minute’s they shot off to the West.  I decided to report this sighting after my father called me to tell me someone from the Madison Airport reported seeing several UFO’s last night.

Other times it looked like the moon with blurred craters but it was much too small to be the moon.  Could not tell if it was 1000's of feet up or many miles up. There was no ground wind.  It was tough to hold the monocular still.  Had bluish top left edge & reddish bottom right edge.  Was not 'smoothly' round.  Had a barely visible heat distortion or exhaust on left & right sides (shown above). The object later became a faded orange before disappearing in the dark sky.  It moved a total of about 30 deg south east before it was gone at twilight when outdoor lights were on. 4 other adults & 2 children also saw it. 2 of the adults were passers-by and 2 adults I knew and then asked them to come outdoors to look.  Of those, only me and a child saw it with a viewing aid – a monocular. Via the monocular, my school-age child said it looked like a white doughnut with the hole more to the right.  They said it had slight 'exhaust' coming out of the sides but they saw no blue & red colors like I saw.  As like all clear days, jets at varying altitudes and a small prop plane were also visible flying by when looking at the object.",2015-12-10T00:00:00,39.3433,-77.5739

This was observed for about 20 seconds.  It was an extremely bright light, unlike anything else they had ever observed in the night sky before. There were other aircraft visible in the night sky and they were more distant, so the orange light appeared to be much lower down.  As the light passed overhead, it changed to a more northerly direction and seemed to climb to a higher altitude.  At one point, the light seemed to become stationary, gained altitude, then grew dimmer and eventually vanished. Approximately ten minutes later, while the family was still gazing out, a second slightly more intense light appeared. It seemed to be lower on the horizon, and traveled overhead in a more direct east to west trajectory.  The couple opened their window to see if they could detect any sound, but it was silent.  The second sighting seemed to last about 20 seconds before the light vanished into a cloud bank. The intensity of both lights was much brighter than the brightest star in the night sky.

Albuquerque NM I-25 Southbound 7:00pm (Sharp) Mountain Time 1/13/16.	   Heading south on the freeway I saw two adjacent lights flying west directly ahead in my line of sight while driving.  The lights did not blink and seemed to be part of the same craft though no actual body of the craft was visible only two round lights travelling together at the same speed no sound.  Within a matter of seconds the lights dimmed out of sight and for the remainder of my 15-minute drive along the freeway where I have a open view of the sky, the lights did not reappear. Approximately two years ago I had an encounter with a UFO while driving with two friends maybe around 8:00pm.  Two adjacent lights dim yellow-orange, hovering somewhat close to the ground in an area with absolutely no tall buildings.  They were solid in color and did not blink such as a plane does. As we turned the car back to get a better look they had vanished.

Which I assume violates FAA regulations •	Several blinking aircraft in the vicinity •	Space between lights must have been massive, larger than a blimp  As the lights dimmed out of sight I would compare it to a falling star as it dies smoothly fading out of sight. The lights must have been attached to the same craft that was not visible or hidden by the night. The space between the lights could’ve held a blimp between them but traveled too fast. Distance from UFO was not clear since no actual body was visible. Either way the space between the lights is unexplainable, much too large for any aircraft of my knowledge.

As the road turned south east to cross Palarm Creek, the UFO appeared to be hovering directly above the highway ahead of us, yet we could not year any loud engines or unusual noises.  This is where I got the clearest viewing of the aircraft.  The lights were very bright compared to the stars in the clear sky, and formed a flat line like a -dash-.   As we approached them, they began to rotate in formation to the south, like a plane's roll, becoming vertically aligned before turning upside-down and disappearing behind the tree line. My girlfriend noticed it again to our south a minute later as we rode home.",2016-01-14T00:00:00,35.05733591160221,-92.46246298342541

We were not supposed to see this... My boyfriend and I spend our weekends in a very rural part of Virginia working on his 15 acre undeveloped property he bought last year.  At 3am I stepped outside for a cigarette and walked towards the end of the driveway.  I was drawn because I noticed that there were an unusual number and arrangement of stars in the sky.  There were too many of them to begin with, they were bright and they FILLED the northern sky.  As I stood there I saw that many were not stationary.  In college I took physics of the universe and realize that stars can have a slight wobble; however, these objects were clearly moving closer…  I stood there transfixed until finally I went to get my boyfriend.  He was not too thrilled to be urged out into the freezing cold at 3am, but obliged. We stood at the end of the driveway and tried to take a video, but because there is not a street light nor neighbor within close proximity we were only able to capture our commentary.  The  objects were spinning, moving erratically, stopping and darting and changing colors.   We noticed one extremely low in altitude to our left.  We hopped in the car and dialed 911 as the sight we felt should be seen by someone in law enforcement, if only to give more credit to what we were seeing.  The operator sounded completely annoyed as I tried to convey the magnitude of what we were witnessing.  When we found a field, we pulled over and parked.  We were encircled by flying objects in the sky.  One with red X's and white lights circling its perimeter flew across the sky at a faster rate than others.  The smaller ones formed spiral/circular patterns overhead. I used a flashlight to 'communicate.' I wasn't sure what I would accomplish, but I didn't feel scared or threatened.  I think it coaxed the objects to come even closer. We had one overhead that had a green light on the underbelly.  There was an SUV that I think must have seen everything as the driver stopped on the road by the field and then sped off.  This is why I listed the witnesses as 3.  What we saw was undeniably the most surreal and bewildering experiences I have ever had. We drove to a 24 hour gas station and then onto another field where we witnessed more of the same and a larger, triangular shaped object with white lights on the corner which tilted and flashed in the middle where two smaller objects circled each other.  We watched these objects overhead until the sun rose.  It was absolutely the most incredible thing I have ever seen.  I have no other explanation other than alien craft.  What I saw could not have been driven by or made by human hands.",2016-01-20T00:00:00,36.9098,-76.8616

It has five lights on it and it is hovering.  It had five lights in a row with the middle light being the largest  the lights changed colors from yellow green to red blue.  It looked really large way larger than a small airplane.   It hovered at a lower altitude until daybreak then it ascended higher into the sky.  It clearly looked like a star with the naked eye as it got higher in the sky.  It appeared that  the daybreak was what drove it higher in the sky.  We saw it make movements directly up - then quickly shifting side to side them down - it was really high in the sky still at 9:00 am but then cloud cover came and could not view it under the clouds anymore.

I had just exited the rear door of my house (faces north) and was heading toward my camper (which I keep parked in my backyard.)  I was walking across my backyard headed in a north-easterly direction.  I looked up in the sky, towards my right, at the constellation Orion. It was a clear night.  No clouds in the sky at all.  I had just located the three stars in his “belt” when I noticed a streak of light in the sky to my right. I turned just in time to see the light, which was heading downward towards the ground, disappear behind the roof of my house.  It began approximately 60 degrees above the horizon in the southern sky.  It traced a straight path downward and angled slightly to the west.  The whole event lasted only a second or two. I have seen meteors and fireworks and such.  I also have my private pilot's license and work in an aviation-based industry so I am familiar with aircraft lighting.  This was definitely not an aircraft and it didn't appear to be a meteor either. What was peculiar was the coloration. It could be described as a streak of light. The upper portion was white, then there was a band of yellow, and, finally, the portion closest to the ground was red. From my vantage point, the streak was only a few millimeters thick, but was 10 centimeters or so in length. This gave me the impression it was dozens of kilometers away.  It disappeared behind the roof of my house. I paused for a moment to see if it would return and I walked around the side of the house to a less obstructed view to see if, perhaps, it had “crashed” and created a fireball. The object did not make any noise, but that didn't surprise me as I stated earlier it appeared to be at a good distance away from me.  I saw nothing further that night. I know the time to be 10:17pm as I looked at the clock when I entered my camper.  Today, I have searched the internet and local news outlets to see if, perhaps, someone else had reported the event and it could be easily explained as a meteor or some space “junk”, but as yet I have not come across any other sightings.

At one point they were facing in my direction and i thought the object was coming my way.  I called my sister in law outside to take a look with me. She confirmed my suspicion that it was not a plane or a star.  It was too close to us to be a star, and a star wouldn't have two bright lights facing us.   It faded out again towards the west, like going straight backwards almost, until it was completely out of sight.  It then came back into view and stayed for maybe another ten minutes and the lights once again became really bright,almost like they were coming to us and fading in and out.  The lights were white,  I did not see colors, or was too far away to see any colors.  I never did come back so i went inside.  This was all in a pitch black sky, we are out in the country with only one street light. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr Davenport, We ourselves asked the same question. The airport in the area is not to the west.I never saw a plane this low...two lights bigger than car headlamps facing us but 50-60 yards up.  Maybe a little more.

This was a little after sundown but still there was enough light for me to see my dog about 75 yards away.  I couldn't tell the shape because of the bright lights that were situated on the top and the bottom of the craft.  I watched it hover for the period of time stated and then entered my home to call for someone else to observe.  When I again exited my home the object was gone.  The appearance of the object, as far as I could see, was as though there was a straight line with three lights on top and three lights on bottom.  As I said, the lights were very bright and prevented me seeing any detail other than what has been stated.  From my position, I was looking approximately at a 30 degree angle and the object was about ¾  of a mile away.  After it was no longer in my view, about 7 to 10 minutes later,  a jet came from the north, heading in a southern direction.  To our NNE, about 50 miles away is Columbus Air Force Base.

I noticed a lot of lights in the sky to the south over what I would say would be south Meridian or South of Boise, Idaho.  There were several lights that looked to be following each other in line, maybe 8-10 in the first group.  They were flying north and then several stopped, or hovered, above West Boise, while others continued in different directions.  There was NO noise.   I'm prior military and I've been around aircraft all my life and I know the different sounds from rotor-craft to fixed wing.  I stepped into a frozen yogurt place for a second and then came back out and saw another formation coming from the south.  This was the best picture I got as they left single file and began to make some odd formations.  The second group had 8-10 craft as well. I called Ada County Dispatch to see if they'd received any other reports of odd lights and they had not. They contacted Boise Airport and they did not have anything abnormal reported, nor did they have any radar information of 15-20 craft in the area. I contacted Boise Tower myself the next day and they confirmed that with me. Dispatch also talked with Gowen field and they did not have any night operations going. We have Apaches, A-10's. and F-15's flying constantly in the area, but none of those were in training that night.  I should also point out, there were no flashing lights on these craft, just the slightly yellowish steady light you see here. The weather was cold and at the moment, it was slightly overcast in that general direction. The lights were moving at a speed that would be typical for final approach to Boise except when they hovered.",2015-12-10T00:00:00,43.60516381909548,-116.40865226130653

It kept moving on it’s new path, then took another 90 degree turn and suddenly sped up towards the horizon and disappeared over the roof of the house we were next to.

I was looking out my window around 10:30 am on December 05, 2015, west of Green Bay Wi at the weird clouds that formed after contrails had dissipated I thought I would get the camera out to take pictures of the sky filled with these long wispy clouds. I snap some pics of the wispy clouds and look to the west and a jet is flying east laying down a contrail so I snapped a couple of more pics. I than looked to the south over my roof line and saw another jet laying down a contrail going north. I take pics of this one also.  Then, I see way above those wispy contrail clouds another trail forming but no jet until it comes out from above those wispy contrails.  I see it's a jet going north also but this jet was moving way faster than the other two so I snapped a couple of pics of that one. It was heading north fast so I barely got a couple of shots when I lowered the camera I looked over the woods to the north in the same direction as the fast flying contrail jet and there I see a formation of metalic flashing and glittering round objects flying south in a line formation as if a V had one side cut off looking like this \. I was excited and tried to guess there were at least 8 to 10 round flashing objects in a line like this \ moving south quickly.  I raised the camera, tried to get them focused on the view screen but couldn't find anything so began to snap pics wildly as they flew over head and to the south. These round objects were roughly about 2 thousand feet above the woods, totally silent and over head as they flew south.  I kept snapping pics and hoped I got something.  It lasted maybe 5 seconds but I can be more accurate by looking at the first time stamp shot to the last time stamp shot as they were just even with my southern roof line. I think I got 6 or 7 shots and 3 have the objects.  One shot was the first facing north as they came south, then one over head and the last over my roof line facing south.  I went in the house and checked the time which was 11:03 so it was around 10:56 am when all this began. Although I could see round objects glittering and flashing as if metalic flying south into the sun,  The camera shots came out as round gray objects with bright spots on the objects.

The lights on the right were shinier (probably because it was facing the sun). It seemed to be very far away and through the viewscope it was about 1"" big. As we were looking at it neighbors who were driving by stopped and looked through the telescope too.  I then called my brother in law who lives about 1 mile away and he confirmed seeing the white dot in the sky too.

The object had no lights and was making no sound.  It at first appeared to be stationary but watching it closely it was ""floating"" across the sky as if it were in geosynchronous orbit.  We used the telescope to try for a detailed look but nothing could be gained further from that magnification.  It ""floated"" in view there for just a couple of minutes before it accelerated in a direction that appeared to be straight up from our viewpoint.  When it shot off it again made no sound.  It still had no lights and the physical acceleration was so much that no human would have been able to survive the g-force.  From the time the! acceleration was noticed to the time it was out if sight was approximately 1/2 to 1 second.  The craft was triangle in shape and black in color.  The black stood out against what clouds were out which made the black craft appear darker than some of the sky around it..if explaining it like that makes sense.
