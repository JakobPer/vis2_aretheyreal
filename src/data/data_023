Last night at about 10:40pm I was out at the Buckingham fountain laying down and looking at the stars trying to search for sattellites.  Then, all of a sudden, two bright lights came out of the west moving very rapidly towards the east. They were about three or four times the diameter of a bright star and it looked like they were made up of four lights: three orange lights surrounding a yellow one in the center.  From my relative perspective, the two objects were flying about three inches from each other, though the actual distance between them is unknown since I don't know the altitude these things were at.  They were flying so perfectly in formation that at first I thought it was one object.  I excitedly yelled to my girlfriend who was with me at the time to look up and see the objects.  She quickly noticed the objects too and watched with me as they flew quickly to the east horizon. As they apporached the horizon they started doing some weird, non-ballistic maneuvers that told me it was two seperate objects.  moving quickly back and forth closer to eachother and then farther apart.  We watched them until they disappeared out of sight. The entire sighting lasted about 5 to 7 seconds because the objects moved so quickly.  They also did not make a sound. The primary observer is a 25 year old student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  The secondary observer is a 20 year old student at the same school.",2002-09-19T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

Each individual object was of an illuminated white colour, and seemed to resemble the shape of a bird. The formation was completely silent, and flew smoothly past several clearly identifiable commercial and private aircraft at a speed >250 mph.  After the formation had disappeared in the NW sky, I observed two objects flying independently.  Whether these had come from the formation I had observed is unclear.  The first object was of the shape previously described. It flew at roughly the same altitude and speed as the formation, yet seemed to circle and hover in the WSW sky. Barring it's speed and luminescence, it's trajectory did fit with that expected from a hawk or other predatory bird.  I can only describe the shape of the second object as a point of light.  This object flew at a higher altitude than that already described (>10k feet), and reached incredible speeds.  What was most impressive was the flightpath that it followed; my best description of this object's trajectory would be ""extremely ERRATIC"".  At such a high rate of speed, this object seemed to turn and bank with almost no leeway, in the same manner one might observe a firefly or other small insect to do as it is blown in the wind. I also described the pattern this object made in the night sky to a colleague as that which might be expected to result from someone moving a laser pointer around the ceiling of an auditorium.  The possibility that a ground-based device created this image, however, can be ruled out by the fact that the observed object would come into and out of view as it passed behind sparse cloud cover.",2002-09-19T00:00:00,,

The object, consisting of four or five rectangles connected with what might be described as a rigid filament (the filament extended out past the line of rectangles on both ends, as well) drifted across the field of view rather slowly, moving roughly toward the zenith.  It was approximatly one degree in apparent length and did not appear to be outside the atmosphere.  Detail of some kind was clearly visible on all the rectangles, but I have no opinion as to what it was.  The object moved at about the rate an aircraft cossing the field of view would have moved, rather than a satellite, so I ruled out space debris.  There was no weather ballon at either end of the series of rectangles visible, and, although my first impression on spotting it was that it was some sort of space station, the size of the object and its slow speed would, of course, rule that out as a possibility.  The sunset was recent enough to have provided illumination to the object, so I cannot conclude it had any illunation of its own.  I would be interested to find out if there is a well-known object that fits the description of what I observed. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) Thanks very much for your prompt response.  I, like you, am totally puzzled by the object, and despite my request for anonymity, please feel free to give my email address or phone number to anyone with professional credentials who might like to talk about it.  One technical point about the equipment that  might not be immediately obvious (the Stellacam EX is relatively new) is that the setting of the camera at the time (sense up to 128, which means that 128 1/60 second exposures are cumulated on board the camera and output to the monitor every two seconds as one image) means that the object had to be quite dim.  At 128 a planet or aircraft would bleed badly into adjacent pixels, but this object did not bleed at all.  (128, for example, is so sensitive that stars within a globular cluster bleed into each other and the cluster appears to be one star.)  Since the object did not appear burned out in any way, it  might actually have been too dim for, say, an 8"" SCT to observe at all and I don't see any way that binoculars could have picked it up.  But I still remain astonished at its apparent large size and slow speed.  I suppose the most obvious explanation is that it was some sort of attachment to a weather  device or other man-made device of which the general public is not aware, and had I seen a balloon attached to it, I'd have little doubt about that supposition.  But I didn't and, I cannot really account for its apparent direction of movement. ((END COMMENT))",2002-09-28T00:00:00,,

I took me a second to look up because i thought it was the street light, but when i did i saw a massive disk/saucer shape hovering about 100 or so feet in the air. It was maybe the size of a large house, but it was almost invisible due to it having no lights on it save for the one beam down to the road. I was stunned and ran around the house screaming to my friends to come see it. We all ran back around and we ALL saw it. As soon as i moved a bit closer and came out of the shadow of my house, the beam swung right on to me and locked on to me. I couldnt see anything because of the light but my friends said the ship suddenly had lights come up on the bottom and start pulsing red. Then the beam disappeared and the ship launched straight up in the air. That was the end. My hands are still shaking. I am writing this about half an hour or so after.

I have been trying to find info on if there are a set of satellites out there like that or if I have really seen something out of the ordinary. Can anyone help me out here?

The light was very bright, fairly large (much bigger than a star or shooting star), white, and perfectly round.  At first we thought it was a headlight to a plane that was low but realized there was no sign of a plane (i.e., noise, blinking lights, etc.)  The light seemed to look like a headlight on some aircraft that was flying fairly low. When we were both looking at it, it seemed to peak in brightness - as if the light were shinging very close to us - like a spotlight.  It then dimmed from very bright to nothing in the next 2-3 seconds.  I think the dimming was the light source turning to the right and then away.  When it was turning to the right, we were able to still track the dimming light for about 10 degrees to the right then the light completely disappeared.  We continued to look in that direction for the next 20-30 minutes and never saw anything else other than the usual stars and planes. There was never any noise, any other lights attached to it, and never saw any shape of the object other than the light itself.  The weather was clear and calm.  It was too far away to have been an aircraft to have had had bright of a light shining from it. While we continued to look for any other lights, we discussed what we saw.  We both described the same thing and hopefully my description explains what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the flare from an Iridium satellite may have been the cause of the sighting.

It was disk-shaped brightely lightened object flying in the sky. It came out from behind of the tree and crossed the part of the sky visible from our window and disappeared behind the building.

Once I saw it I called my wife which was just in the next room. She also saw the same object but for less time. We are absolutely sure the object was real. Both of us saw exactly same picture. I don't know whether this information has any value, but we were so amazed. I just want to share this information with someone who could find it interesting. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Dear Peter, Thank you for your response. Yes, both my wife and I are Russians.  Here, in USA, we are in ((graduate)) training.  Both of us are ((subject deleted--biological science, generally)) and ((credentials deleted)). So, probably you can assume we are serious people and scientists. I would like to assure you there is no joke or kidding in my report. We are absolutely positive in our UFO sighting experience. It was a really solid, material object of distinct disc-like shape, brightly lighted or fluorescent.  It was not light spot, cloud,aircraft or something else. I can be mistaken only about object's size and distance of it. Of course I was trying to figure out some more realistic explanations of my sighting. My only guess it could be balloon (dirigible) which I saw once (about 3-4 months ago) in Newark vicinity. That time it was white balloon with blue HORIZON inscription on it.  I believe it was advertising balloon. But, on August 31, the object was 11.30 PM and a balloon's pilot would be crazy to fly such vehicle at night.  And, theobject which we saw was glaring very brightly and moving much faster than a balloon (but I assume slower than aircraft).  About your supposition about Teterboro Airport, I would say that there is Newark International Airport much closer to our location.  Aircraft frequently cross above our home and especially to east from it preparing for landing.  So I am rather familiar with this stuff. But the object which we saw was flying absolutely quietly and didn't look like aircraft at all. Regarding your question on object's location, I can say it was moving to west from us (Ibelieve parallel 280 highway, away from NYC, heading Newark orBloomfield). I think it was crossing Passaic river so it was on open territory for some time thus probably it could be seen very well by many people. At the conclusion I can say that it was one of the weirdest things which I've ever seen. This is the only reason why I wanted to report this phenomenon.

As the object traveled through the sky, it seemed to rotate as it moved, kinda like how the planets rotate in the sky as they orbit the sun.  It was rotating one way and moving another.  There are very tall trees next door. The flying object was blocked from my veiw by the trees.  I could see it through the branches a bit.  I went to my other window hoping it would countinue going straight and appear to me once more, but no such luck.

The jet was a fighter with an over all triangular shape but definitely man made like the ones that patrolled New York after 911.

I continued watching hoping to catch another glimce.  I could hear the aircraft with the appropriate delay the whole time. While still looking I noticed another craft of a very different shape apparently following the jet.  Its relationship to the jet was such that it could very easily have been in the jet's blind spot. It seemed to be lower in the sky and traveling as if to remain in the jet's blind spot as the jet turned north. It was silent.  I remember listening carefully for the delayed sound.  It was roughly oblong and changed shape to nearly circular and back to oblong.  I presumed this was due to a changing attitude from my point of view.  It had the same dark metallic coloring of the jet. It's movements were more exaggerated as if cutting a wider arc to maintain in the same relative position to the jet.

I'm not convinced it was a craft but for the fact that the light couldn't have been traveling through the cloud from the ground, I would have seen the light path as it passed through.  Secondly the circular clound surrounding the event and the chill as well as the silence and then the sudden disappearance (though I didn't witness it leave) convince me that this was more than just an average light or cloud.  If not a UFO what else could it have been?  I was being facetious about the alien contact comment.  It was late and I was rather ashamed of myself for getting so scared.  I've looked through numerous entries on you site and others and haven't found anything quite like it.  And though I distinctly remember reading something about UFO's hiding in circular clouds I cannot find anything confirming this.  There are numerous UFO sightings in the Tacoma/Lakewood area.  One night several years ago my daughter, a ffriend and I saw lights streaking across the sky betweem Tacoma and Puyallup, then they hovered and took off again, we all agreed it could not have been a plane and that was confirmed when we listened to the rradio, numerous people called the station and saw what we saw.  Interestingly even though we are near an airforce and army base there were no aircraft in pursuit.  We see planes all the time in this area, of all types.  This did not appear to be a plane.

There was not much traffic on the road and we were late so I was ttravelling at 70+ mph.  We had passed Moss Hill and were traveling toward Cleveland.  I noticed a white 'strobe' light through the tops of the trees North of the Hwy.  I just thought it was a radio tower strobe, and didn't pay much attention to it.  Then I noticed that with one of the 'strobe' flashes there were about 6-8 bright lights 'attached' to the main 'strobe' part extending in an arched pattern (like 1/2 of a parabola: from 0,0 to 3,6).  I thought it was strange, but continued to think it was a radio tower.  I didn't even wake my daughter up.  The next time the 'strobe' lit, I didn't see the 'tentacle' lights.  Then on the 3rd or 4th strobe, the tentacle lights were there again, but this time they were vertical to the main 'strobe' light.  I thought this was odd, so I kept watching it.  Also, the 'strobe' was directly in front of the road, not behind the trees.  I could see it without any interference from the trees.  I still thought it was a tower.  A few more 'strobes' and then the 'tentacle' lights were visible again- this time arched to the left of the main 'strobe'(again, 1/2 of a parabola: -3,6 to 0,0).  The main strobe was now located to the left (SW) of the Hwy.  I began to think this was odd because (1) I was driving at 70 + mph and the tower lights stasyed in front of me and (2)it was a fairly straight road and now the 'strobe' was on the other side of the road from where I had first noticed it.  I slowed down, woke my daughter and told her to look at this.  By this time I had reduced my speed to about 40 mph.  The 'strobe' could be seen through the very left of the drivers windshield and the drivers window.  My daughter saw the 'strobe' too.  Although we didn't stop, we seemed to have 'passed it up' because we quit seeing the 'strobe.'  It was strange but we decided that it must have been a tower.  We were running late and t! here was still not much traffic, so I increased my speed back up to 70 mph.  A few minutes later, we saw the 'strobe' light again.  It was still on the left side (SW) of the Hwy but just out in front of the vehicle.  It continued to 'strobe' with the tentacle lights showing up about every 3rd strobe ( it may have been every 4th or 5th strobe - I didn't think to count, but it seemed to be at regular intervals).  In the main part of the 'strobe' the light was not all the same intensity.  It was bright when it 'strobed' but there were duller sppots in it.  Unlike the main 'strobe' part, the tentacle lights were all the same intensity - very bright.  We continued to watch it as we drove until we 'passed' it up again.  We wondered if the other drivers saw what we were seeing?!  We kept driving on 105W and began to look for the 'strobe.'  We didn't see it for a few more minutes.  Then we picked it up - this time to the right (NW)side of the Hwy.  It seemed to be closer than before.  My daughter said that the bottom of the main 'strobe' had small yellow 'lights' around it.  Actually, she had a better view because it was outside her window and I had to devote some time to driving.  She was beginning to get frightened, because it continued to 'strobe' along side the car and we were traveling pretty fast.  We were approaching Cleveland,it was getting to be daylight, and traffic was increasing (we were meeting 4 or 5 cars at a time instead of 1 or 2).  Then the 'strobe' light went out and we never saw it again.  We had the radio on (not loud) and never heard any static.  Also, we did not hear any noise, even when my daughter rolled down her window.  Because there was traffic at the time (albeit light traffic), I was hoping that someone else saw this 'strobe' light and can give us an explanation.

It was almost in the trees and the road travelled in a way that we could not see it when we passed it.

We were getting closer now and we finally realized it was moving. There were no marker lights, no spotlight and we were in a bit of a thunder and lightning storm so I really do not think it was any kind of legitimate aircraft. This second light stayed with us for a minute or so travelling at our speed just above the trees about 50 feet to our left. It stopped ""following"" us just before the next small town. When we reached Fairmont, we stopped and I could still see it flashing in the distance. We continued on, quite scared now. We crossed a small bridge and I saw another one on my right but it was stationary. Then as we travelled alongside Columbia Lake we saw another one. This one was on the other side of the lake, but it stayed with us for a few minutes. When we reached Canal Flats, it stopped, and when we looked back there were two hovering over the town.

He said he purposely said ""music"" so as not to influence what I said I heard.

Sometimes it would get faster but always the same notes in the pattern. We went back to the bedroom and had the window cracked alittle because it was raining so hard when there was a boom which was similar to a sonic boom, it was that intense of a crack and the entire sky went completely white. This was no thunderbolt. The entire sky was completely white for about 2 or 3 seconds. After that we continued to hear the notes but they were much fainter and sounded much farther away.This was so completely weird and its freaking us out.

Note:  Please post this submission instead of the one I just submitted moments ago.  For anyone who might live in Lehi and know where I was talking about, I made a right hand turn after crossing the tracks, not a left.  Here is my description again... As I was traveling west on a county road in SW Lehi, Utah, I had just crossed over some railroad tracks and turned right when I noticed this rather large, illuminated object that seemed to be hovering just over the rooftops and it was covered with lights with no true shape to it.  If I had to guestimate how many lights there were, I would say approximately 15-20.  And mixed in with the white lights were about 2-3 red ones, which were around the perimeter of the craft.  I was about 1/4 mile away from it and I would say it was traveling at a rate of about 25-30 mph because I pursued it, but it was staying the same distance from my car.  As it moved through the air, it left a rather thick, white trail which looked like either smoke, exhaust or steam.  It also seemed to rotate as it moved and the lights kept changing in brightness and position.  It made no noise either.  As a matter of fact, there were many other cars in pursuit of this thing as it made its way west.  Some cars had stopped where people had gotten out to watch it, while others stayed in their cars and pursued it (like me) for about 1-2 miles.  However, after about 10 minutes, it dipped behind a large home and suddenly just vanished without a trace.  It was truly one of the most amazing things I had ever witnessed.  I had no explanation for what I saw.  It was my second UFO experience actually because I had seen this same aircraft before a few weeks earlier, only it was a very brief sighting (maybe 10-20 seconds).  I should have called the local police to report an unidentified flying object, but didn't.  I was also amazed when no one else reported it, considering the number of people on the backroad who either got out of their cars to gaze at this thing or follow it.  Both times, I saw this thing coming home from work around 7:00 PM, and so it was dusk and rather difficult to make out its shape since it was getting dark.",2002-09-29T00:00:00,40.3245,-111.9618

The same information was brought to our attention by Mr. Ryan Layton, MUFON SSD for Utah.   We note that many of the facts cited in the initial sighting report, do not seem consistent, and we have called that to the attention of the investigators.  For example, if an object passed within a few hundred feet of the observer while traveling at ""2,000-3,000 mph,"" the resultant sonic boom would have blown the witnesses off their feet.  Instead, the witness reports no sonic boom, and in fact reports that the sound heard was quite mild.  However, please see the follow up communications below, which may clarify some of those apparent discrepancies..  PD))    Orange UFOs in Huge V Formation over Taylorsville Utah Dear Peter, We are sending you this report we just received via our Online reporting form. Orange UFOs in Huge V Formation Occurred : 9/26/02  - 9:15 p.m. Reported : 9/27/2002 3:27 PM Location of sighting: Heading north on 3600 W, following lights towards magna and more west. Location : Taylorsville, UT Shape : Light Description of object /s : The objects were big and bright orange in a v formation, they hovered and one appeared to be triangular shape when it flew over head at an extremely fast speed.- When the light changed to a triangle shape over our heads, it wasn't loud like a jet or airplane. It was low and kind of hummed, it didn't make too much noise. Sighting Event Details:Description of object /s :  We were traveling home last night when we saw several objects in the sky, much too large to be a jet, plane, or helicopter. They were in a V formation and slowly moving and hovering into straight lines and then back again. Couldn't tell exactly what shape the actual object was. I am not one to believe in UFO's or anything, but now I can't deny what I saw. It was not of this world, or maybe it was the government testing something, either way it was strange and there wasn't a logical explanation of what I saw.  Suddenly, one shot straight up into the air and looked like something going into space. but it didn't, it flew right over our heads and appeared to look like a triangle. It immediately changed directions, nothing that I know of can go at that speed and change from right to left so quickly. The other lights were still there, they had an orange glow to them.  We stayed for an hour and watched these strange objects. I know someone else had to have seen what was going on, I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't making it up.  Now there is no doubt in my mind that we are not alone. I do feel suspicious about the whole thing, i thought we were completely alone in this universe, but now i have a strong conviction we are not. Phenomenon visible for how long?: we stayed to watch it for an hour, but went home, it could've gone on longer than that. Direction of Object: It was going west then east then north. it changed directions rather quickly. Height / Altitude of Object: maybe a few hundred feet, but pretty close to the ground Distance of Object:  Object came within 500 feet - 3 hundred feet or maybe a bit more, it seemed really really close to us. Estimated Size of Object: Unknown - can't be too sure Speed of object:          1000 - 3000 mph Object solid ?          YES Hear Sound?  Yes -Heard Sound Noticed Object:          Hover Object was seen in vicinity of:          Military Airfield    Moving in front or behind          Clouds Seen in Veihicle?

I didnt hear any sounds. This lasted a very short period of time, ten seconds at the most, I'm guessing. Noone was there afterward with a flashlight as I suspected, we were probably the only people still awake.

At about 11:40 PDT tonight I was in the bathroom, just had a little night light on, and I happened to look over the top of the curtains at the night sky. To my surprise I saw some odd looking lights moving from more or less Northwest to Southeast. I opened the window to get a better look and was astounded! It's confusing to me because I'm still not exactly sure if I was looking at a single craft of multiple craft. What I saw was several blue white lights evenly spaced in a crescent shape, and an odd fuzzy looking larger light or multiple lights. That was odd as well. I was facing West at the time and the larger light may have been some kind of light in the center of a circular craft. It was a different color than the other lights, and was a little farther to the West, and may have been at the center of a craft. At first I thought I was looking at about 20 craft, but now I think it may have been one very large craft. I grabbed my binocs and ran out to the front yard to try to get a better look, but was having trouble getting the binoculars focused, and there is a kind of haze in the sky tonight, so I didn't get to view it long. I could see it south of here, but it faded into the night sky rather quickly. This thing was making no sound at all. I can hear jets and smaller craft very well when they are headed into the airport at PDX, which is only about a mile or so from here ""as the crow flies"". I think the lights in the crescent may have been on the edge of one single craft.

I am not a freak, but if I hadn't of seen this last night I would think that it was a freak that wrote this. My husband (a well educated person) and I (an accountant) were traveling on highway 27 between Harrison and Mount Pleasant Michigan. We just left his brothers house near Crystal Lake going home to Livonia. We were discussing a quiz from my accounting class about ethics. The radio was off, and all I had on was my little flashlight (one of those small ones that help you find your lock on your door at night). I was reading an article to him from the New York Times, when we both looked out my window (looking West), and noticed two strobe lights on what looked like a long wing about four bus lengths apart from each other flashing three times each but at different times with no hesitation between the flashes from one side to the next. My husband said he noticed the lights reflecting on the car and I noticed the flashes from my peripheral vision. The first thing I thought of was the stealth, except it was longer and not what I would imagine the stealth to look like (granted I have never seen a stealth). The object was silent, but our windows were up, but we didn't hear anything! It was about 150feet high, no higher then 200feet up. It went right over our car from a bit south but more West to East South, and it was going around (best guess) 120-150 miles an hour. My husband asked as it went over to watch it, which I did, and noticed that its left strobe light turned off, it made a decent and disappeared for about 15sec maybe 20. I told my husband that it appeared to have landed in a thicket of trees but I couldn't be sure. When it suddenly showed up again and flying very fast from where I last saw it going now straight south but then we noticed it had red and blue lights flashing along with the outer white lights and again in a strobe light manner, they were in perfect sequence with each other. The craft went at least three miles in about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes tops. It appeared to land again, when we saw i! t cross the highway going south west again, it was closer then and we couldn&#8217;t explain that (about 1 mile if that away from our car at that point) as we got closer its lights went back to just the white strobe lights on the out side of the wings again, and at this time it was crossing east again in front of us still around a mile ahead of us away. It turned so fast North that it was next to our car again, (drive's side window) we watched it as it was now behind us around a 1/2 mile back again when we turned off the freeway (m20, Mount Pleasant exit) and stopped our car at the side of the exit ramp, we jumped out of the car and looked up. This thing should have flown over us, there is no doubt in my mind, when it turned from South to West again, it did it in a quick (and I mean quick) U turn and only two BRIGHT lights like car lights steady not blinking now, were coming over a trailer park that was right next to where we were parked now. It had to have been flying around 70 miles per hour (I would estimate) and it should have flown over us, I was standing on the car outside my door (you know that section of the car where the door meets next to your seat?) so I could see it as it went over better and closer. It never went over us, and I SWEAR it should have. My husband and I just looked at each other and asked, ""Where did it go!"" But we never saw it after that, we stopped at this gas station just about 1 block west from our exit ramp and I got out of the car and looked up while he pumped gas. I must have looked like a freak, but honestly nothing like that has ever happened to either one of us before. I never believed the stories of UFO's before, my husband has never dismissed the possibility of them, but now I don&#8217;t know what to believe. NOTHING COULD FLY OR TURN THAT FAST!",2002-05-14T00:00:00,,

I get the two mixed up of which is brighter. Suddenly three light came out of nowewhere while I was looking to the West. The three lights were moving at a high rate of speed in a West to East direction. The lights made up a triangular formation. My hous is a large house and my visual range is very good from my second and third floor decks. I saw the lights probably 1-2 miles away. The lights which were in a very distictive triangle mad no sound and was traveling at least 400 mph. I know this because I can see the jets entering for final for North bound land trafic from my house. As the lights passed over I noticed very distinctive crosses for each light. Each ligh looked like it was one of the sun flare crosses if you took a picture fith a cross hair lense on a camera. The lights seemed to apear a bluish color with a golden yellow center where the lines crossed. Each light was an individual cross and sepereated equally in a very clear triangular form if one was to conect the lights together. As the lights passed over there was no sound, you could not see a ship of any type, though the space between the lights did not look like normal night sky. The altitude appeared to be about 6000 feet to 4000 feet. I watched the lights travel to the East for aproxamatly 6 seconds looking for some kind of tail section or visual rear of a craft. The lights just simply disapeared. The craft simply vanished as if it were extremly thin or moved so quickly I could not see it any more. Incredible speed in comparison of a jet. Within 10 seconds I visually was watching come into view in the area a large size jet bound for Seatac Airport on final. The lights of the jet were moving much slower than the craft which I was watching. Knowing Seatac landing patterns and altitudes for this kind of jet aircraft what I was watching was not a regualr aircraft. I understand night flying, I have been a pilot for 18 years and flying since I was 7.I am 41 now. I have loged over 450 hours of day and night flying. I have never ever seen any thing like this before. I am a science teacher here in Tacoma and I teach about planets and the night sky. I understand and know what is normal. This was not normal. The weather tonight was totally clear, with a temperature around 50 degrees and no visual fog or moisture in the air. On a clear day I can see Mt Rainier, and the cascade range. The craft would have been over the cascades in seconds at the rate it was moving. I consistantly watch aircraft traveling and turning into SeaTac for landings. This craft should have been visible to the aircraft that was heading north and a second aircraft which apeared shortly after the first. The three light should have been in Radar space of both McHord Airforce base and SeaTacs Air space and should have been picked up on radar. The craft clearly was cuting accross in front of the large jet heading Northeast.

The boomerang-shaped object had no visible lights but was clearly distinguishable from the night sky, as if it was metallic/reflective/or light-colored.  It silently sailed in a straight line in a SSE (south south easterly) direction for no more than what could have been 5 seconds.  If my attention had not been drawn to the object I would had never noticed it!  The sky was mostly clear, but there were a few clouds.  The object disappeared from view into a cloud, so I'm going under the assumption the object had to have been up several thousand feet.  The relative size of the object I believe was large (i.e. larger than your commercial jet plane), relative to the size or a quarter or a tad bit smaller in perspective and appeared to have been traveling at a constant, high rate of speed (15-degrees of the sky in a manner of those fleeting seconds.)  Also, it is important to note that the ""V"" of the boomerang was the front of the craft as it was moving.  The wing tips were rounded and it really did have an overall pronounced boomerang shape, not as sharp as a 90-degree angle, I would have to say it had a 120-degree angle to it. I do not believe this was a stealth bomber; I have seen pictures of the stealth and this did not have the wider midsection of a stealth bomber with the notches.  The craft my roomates and I saw almost had the appearance of a glider, it had no larger/wider area where a cockpit would be in the ""V"".  By all recollections the craft had no distinguishing marks on it, except for one of my roommates, she professes that she could make out a thin, black band that laterally ran across it (the band running along the front side of the craft, the side of the boomerang moving forward).",2002-05-14T00:00:00,47.7543,-122.1635

We used 14 channel hand-held radios, available at Radio Shack, for comm between vehicles. On both the trip North and on the return trip South we noticed very strong broadband radio interference with both our radios for a period of tens of minutes (while travelling about 75 MPH) in the vicinity of Mercury, NV, which is about 30 miles east of Area 51. I have tested these radios and they break the preset squelch at a distance of about 2 miles, broadcasting an estimated 500 mW at roughly 440 MHz. The interference we observed broke the squelch many times on the radios as we travelled. IF the distance between us and the transmitting antenna was 30 miles when this happened, the transmitter, apparently located in Area 51 would have been transmitting at least 5 KW in a narrow band of one channel. I observed that the interference occured in all 14 bands of our radios, so this would indicated a broadband transmission of at least 70 KW to achieve this phenomenon. The total power from the transmitter could be much higher, depending on the actual bandwidth in use and location of the transmitting antenna. It is well known that typical military broadband radios transmit only a few watts or less. The only use I know of for very high power broadband radio transmissions is to transmit over extreme distances. I once calculated that I could transmit a receivable signal over 2 million miles (the distance to Mars at close approach) with only a few hundred milliwatts of output power if I used a broad bandwidth of 10 MHz. I cannot guess what would require the kind of broadband power that I observed near Area 51.

Two of us where watching a large cumulus clowd to the south of Wichita, Kansas at approximately 9PM CST when a dark ufo like object appeared.  It flew straight north at a high rate of speed, probably 100-200 mph.  It was gone in approximately one minute.  It was probably 3 feet in diameter on the top and maybe 5 feet in diameter at the bottom, this could only be seen from the side, when it was directly south of us.  When it flew over it was circular from the bottom.  It had to fly right over the Wichita airport, because we live 4 miles directly north of the airport.

I live in a master planned comm. in the mountains of scottsdale and have a view of most of phoenix. I was driving home at 9:45 and noticed three very large orange lights (10x the brighteness and size a commercial plane puts out)above some cell phone towers.  I thought that a mountain was on fire.  When I got home I told my girlfriend about the fire and we went and looked and the fire was gone.  A minute later 2 ""fires"" started back up followed by a 3rd.  They were on for a couple of minutes and then quickly flickered out (they same quick flicker from a rotating movement, which we would later figure out.)  Another minute later the 3 lights (obviously not a fire anymore) appeared much higher.  We got binoculars out and verified that in fact there was no mountain where these lights were.  We observed this flickering and moving for another 15-20 minutes.  During this time they moved behind a notable landmark, Camelback Mountain and hovered there for at least five minutes. In looking through binoculuars, it looked like we could see a shadow, approx 10-15x the size of a 747 behind each light.  When the lights ""flickered"" out, we could somewhat make out that the shadow was rotating. We decided to get in the car and drive to a higher vantage point within the community.  We were there for approx 25-30 minutes. During this time, we observed that air traffic over phx had come to a standstill. Sky Harbor Int'l Airport is one of the busiest in the country and at that time of night multiple planes can be seen in approach pattern.  For 10-15 minutes while were at this location, we observed no planes and no bright lights.  For Phoenix, this is totally improbable.  Then all of the sudden the sky filled with planes. These planes had weird lights, a triangle shape, and moved extremely fast w/o making any noise.  they appeared to be patrolling the skys and playing cat and mouse with bright lights that appeared and disappeared. A bright light appeared directly overhead and then disappeared as a triangle object that resembled a stealth fighter appeared behind it. We left the area and went home because we were frightened.  Once arriving at home (2 minute drive) we went back outside and the sky looked normal (planes in the air and landing). We did not call any of the local news because we felt for sure there would be many witnesses and footage.  As of 12:00 PM Phoenix time 6/28 there has been no mention of this.

We never saw anything, remotely, like it, before, except in pictures of a developing eclispe. The, we noticed evidence of a forth object, overhead and stretching, due east. my wife grabbed her 35 mm camera and started shooting. the images that she captured are unexplainable.  The pictures show, what appear to be the images of two, maybe four, arrowhead shaped objects casting shadows, againt the southren sky and directly overhead. for two years, the photos were in a drawer - they were odd light formations but there are a million of them, everyday. then, i happened to show one of them to a man who makes his livlihood measuring things and recoding things accurately, he is a professional  ""expert"" witness, and archetectural details and pinpoint accurracy, are his bread and butter.  when we casualy showed him one of the photos, he physically, flinched and sat straight up.  It, certainly, got his attention. that is when, i started to examine, just what it was, that was making the images. after much thought, i realized, that in the case of the most well defined image of an an inverted arrowhead, i was looking at a shadow being cast by a v shaped object, suspended point side down, flat side facing the sun.  the object appeared to be hovering in a fixed position, at a point that would place it between the sun that had set -the light source - and the pink sky and dark shadowed atmosphere in the southren skies- in effect, the movie screen. the image in the sky was an artifact of the atmosphere, as it bent the light and focused the dark image of the v shaped object onto the movie-screen like background. we snapped 10 pictures that day and they indicated that the above mentioned v shape object had changed its allinment to the sun.  the pictures contain a wealth of scientific information and rasie a whole lot of questions.

My friend noticed the movement first. We proceeded to call my friend's sibling. She came over and got in the car and we showed her where it would be, she looked and it did it again, it illuminated again, then went out abruptly. We got four of our other friends to come outside and see the phenomenon. They arrived and could see the object we were looking at (you could still see a slight outline of a ship with other dim lights attached to it). They thought we were crazy until they saw it light up too. Then out of nowhere a second light appears to the left of the first one. At first they took turns lighting up, then they both remained lit for about a minute solid. They would periodically turn off and turn on again and adjust positions. We could tell they weren't stars because they were hovering in front of a mountain, they weren't planes either...they were flying to low. There was another craft higher up above the two ""lights"" that had reddish lights that got brighter...it remained in one position throughout the ordeal...only strafing from left to right every so often. The three ""lights"" formed a trangular shape. The other two ships were still moving though...they were getting closer to the ground.

"Sighting of a possible beam or tether directly connected from the ground to an aircraft at an altitude of 2,500 ft.",Portland,OR,2002-09-17T23:30:00,unknown,10 minutes,"Occurred : 9/17/2002 23:30  (Entered as : 09/17/02 23:30) Reported: 9/18/2002 3:33:44 PM 15:33 Posted: 9/19/2002 Location: Portland, OR Shape: Unknown Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25126.html,"Sighting of a possible beam or tether directly connected from the ground to an aircraft at an altitude of 2,500 ft. Looking to the South from my 2nd story kitchen window, what I first observed was what appeared to be a blue/purple beam, which was wavy in shape, but completely linear in direction. This beam had the appearance of a thin streak of lightning, yet was relatively dim. It appeared to be fluorescent in nature, as opposed to lighted from any external light source. The beam was very clearly connected to the ground, approximately 1/4-mile south from my location. Upon first sighting the beam, it was angled away from me at approximately 60 degrees from the horizon, facing Southeast. Following the beam upwards, it grew dimmer with distance, becoming invisible to the eye at approximately 200-300 meters. Upon following the beams upward trajectory, I spotted an aircraft flying at approximately 2,500 ft. in a North to South trajectory, with seemingly normal exterior lights: 2 white strobe lights, with 1 steady dim red light between the 2 white strobes. The strobes were blinking together, at an interval of 2 quick strobes in rapid succession separated by 3/4 (.75) second between bursts. The strange beam appeared to be literally connected to this aircraft, although at that distance I could not confirm this due to the beam becoming too dim at that altitude. The reason I say that the beam appeared connected to the craft is this; as the aircraft passed overhead from South to North, the angle of the beam changed precisely with this movement as though it were tracking the aircraft or being emitted from the aircraft to a fixed ground location. I lost sight of the aircraft several times, but needed only to follow the path of this beam upwards to relocate the aircraft's position. The angle of the beam changed from and angle of 60 degrees facing South East, to 90 degrees straight up, to an angle of 45 degrees facing North, precisely in unison with the aircraft as though it were a tether of some sort, attached to the aircraft and fixed to the ground. The aircraft proceeded to fly in its linear trajectory to the north, until at s! uch a di stance as to be no longer visible. The beam remained pointing to the north in the direction of the aircraft's last visible position, for several minutes preceding the aircraft's departure. I observed the beam as well as the aircraft through my binoculars. At this higher magnification, the beam appeared unsolid and quite wide. The structure of the beam was wavy, similar to the structure of lightening, although its path was ultimately perfectly linear. The beam maintained a constant luminosity, and did not appear to be changing shape, despite its wavy, electricity-like appearance. The width of the beam was comparable to a toothpick held at arm's length, and was blue/purple in hue. The closest comparison I can think of to describe this beam would be a semi-transparent fluorescent tube. It was also comparable to a thin, focused beam shining through haze, although it was a clear night. I have ruled out the possibility of some sort of physical tether, i.e. kite string, for the following reasons: 1) The apparent size was far too thick - a tether seen from even as close as 1/4 mile away would be nearly invisibly thin, were it any less than 6 inches in thickness. 2) The linearity of the line was absolutely perfect - it was not sagging earthward as would be expected with any sort of tether, even under extreme tension. Yet it truly appeared to be anchored to the aircraft above, as well as the ground below. After observing the beam and aircraft for 1 minute and it became apparent that their motions were somehow unified, I awoke my wife from bed so that she could verify what I was seeing. She was easily able to see the beam, which she said appeared to her like a high-flying jet plane's vapor trail, but aiming directly into the ground at a very close distance. After the aircraft had left, and the beam had ceased movement but was still visible, I decided to leave my home to try and locate the point where it contacted the ground. As soon as I was on ground level, my vertical line of sight was too narrow and the su! rroundin g lights were too bright so that I could no longer see the beam. I quickly returned to my second floor window to verify it was still visible. It was, so I again left my home and drove in my car to approximately directly below and a bit closer to where I suspected the beam to be. The drive was approximately 1 minute. I searched the sky for an additional minute, and then returned home. I was away from home for no longer than 4 minutes. Upon returning home, the beam was no longer visible. In hindsight, I should have remained at home and kept the beam in sight. But my curiosity was too great, and the beam disappeared sometime during my 4-minute search away from home. The total duration of this sighting was approximately 8 minutes, from the moment I first observed the beam, to the moment I left my home to search for its source. At no point was any sound audible. I am an amateur astronomer and aviation enthusiast, so I am constantly observing the sky and local aircraft with a telescope and binoculars, but have never witnessed anything abnormal until now. My father is an international pilot, and we have discussed the many highly strange natural phenomena that he observes regularly during his flight paths over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Arctic. My understanding is that this phenomenon is completely unique, so I am extremely curious to learn if any other similar observances have occurred elsewhere.",2002-09-19T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

I'm a student at the local community college, and during my drive home one afternoon, two things struck me as odd, one being a black helicopter that flew over my campus at or near 14:00pm, and the other being the fact that either a second, or the same helicopter was hovering approximate 100 to 200 feet above tree level between 5 and 10 miles away from the campus 10 minutes down Route 6.  I spotted the helicopter before I reached exits 9A and 9B, and found it to be hovering between exits 9A and 10.  I believe the town would have been Dennis, or extreme western Brewster near Underpass road.  For at least 5 minutes I could make out the helicopter hovering perfectly still in this same spot at this same altitude, and this seemed strange to me in broad daylight with little apparent reason for its presence.  However, not far down the road, perhaps just before Exit 10, on the horizon, (I was headed East on Route 6 during this whole event) I saw an oddly shaped craft that I first assumed was a fighter jet.  This wouldn't be out of the question given that one of the largest Air Force bases in the Northeast is on Cape Cod.  However, the lack of any sound, the velocity, and size of the craft did not match up for what would be a fighter plane, and since there was no airport in the immediate vicinity, its altitude seemingly ruled out the possibility that it was a plane at all.  I immediately thought back to the helicopter, and wondered if perhaps it had been observing the same thing I did because it seemed to be in an awful hurry when I first saw it in Barnstable (the town, not the county) and it was headed in the exact direct (or very near to) the spot where I saw it.  This lead me to believe that it wasn't a plane at all, and that, even if I sounded completely crazy, I should tell someone what I saw in hopes of finding some simple explaination.  I've not contacted any authorities on the subject because I feel as though security may be so tight that no information may be had on the matter at all given the proximity! to the anniversary of 9/11.  The object I saw was moving south slowly at what must not have been much more than 300 to 500 feet above the ground, perhaps even less. It appeared to be metallic, but did not shine, which as I think about it, is rather odd given the lighting conditions (the sun was behind me shining directly on the object I witnessed)  It was a matte gray color, much like the paint job on a fighter jet (hence my original confusion) and did not have a memorable shape or profile other than being long and giving the impression that it had facets, or was possibly even a delta wing of some sort like the F-117, however this aircraft is not gray, so I knew it could not have been what I saw.  It also was not a blimp, because it was too small and moved to fast, besides being the entirely incorrect shape, and was not single-engine plane of any sort, as it was too large, and did not have any of the recognizable features that a plane of this type would possess.  Any information on this would settle my mind a great deal.",2002-09-13T00:00:00,41.7322,-70.1977

It was probably only about six seconds from the time they came into view from over the roof of my  North-side neighbour's garage until they passed out of view behind the roof of my South-side neighbours house.

There was another group there 150 yards to our west, The Greer Group (Disclosure Project).  Just before our sighting many of them were yelling excitedly.  My wife Ferne and I searched the sky to see what the excitement was about.  Ferne saw it first right overhead and it was three lights moving in an elongated triangle formation.  One of the trailing lights was a little ahead of the other.  Was moving slowly from north to south.  After a few seconds it made a banking 180 degree turn returning to the direction it came from and the lights kept in formation.  About 3 seconds after the turn all three lights gradually faded. There was no noise and a clear moonless night. The formation was directly overhead of us. Saw another triangular formation last year about this time but it did not turn as this one did. We did not see an object enclosed within the light formation. I tried to video this event but it did not record. I was trying to video record the lights and as soon as my wife said its a triangle the camera stopped recording and the tape was blank upon review. I did not get any video of it. I had the formation in view all the time as I thought I was recording. In one year of skywatching this is best sighting I have experienced. The lights did not strobe or look like lights on a plane. The lights were white but rather dim. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Dear Mr. ((name deleted)), Thank you very much for the interesting report! I have a few questions about your sighting.  First, what was the apparent size of the formation of three lights, relative to the size of the disc of a full Moon, please?  Also, did the entire formation ""bank,"" or the individual lights?  What direction did the object turn, please?  Did it end up going to the east, or to the west? Did you look for the object on the following night, by any chance, or on any subsequent night? Also, when the lights faded, did they all fade together, or did they fade at different times?  If the latter, which one faded first, they subsequently? You state that ""one of the trailing lights was a little ahead of the other.""  Do you mean that there were two behind, and one of them was a bit ahead of the other? Thank you very much for your report.  We will post it in the near future.  I do not know what it was you saw, but we would like to know more. Cordially, Peter Davenport Peter:  The size was about was a little larger than a full moon.  The entire formation made a banking right turn (east) and the lights stayed in the same relative position turning east and continuing to turn untill a 180 degree turn had been made to go back north. So after the turn it was going north.  The next night we decided to go home since I had to work the next day and clouds were building up.   All three lights faded out together.   ((NUFORC Note:  Triangular formation of X's deleted here.  They will not survive the transfer to the website.  PD))         The formation look somewhat like this, the top being the leading light.   We are going back to Mt adams Friday for two nights of skywatching since we were quite excited to see this.  The Greer group is supposed to be there untill sunday.  We are not part of the group, and the leader of the group has requested privacy from the rest of the guests while they are there.  We have been helping James with maintenance of one of the buildings and helping out in general.  We go there quite frequently when the weather is good to skywatch.  I have seen many moving lights while there over the past year, but this one is the most unusual I have ever seen anywhere and needed to be reported.  As far as I know satellites cannot do this and it definatly was not an airplane.   The one we saw last year looked like this:   ((NUFORC Note:  Triangular formation of X's deleted here.  PD))     It did not turn, was about  the same brightness, and when it faded out the lead light went out first and when the two trailing lights reached the same place they went out together.  The size was slighty larger than the one we have just seen.       If you have any more questions feel free to send an email..

This was a continuous manuveur for about 2 hours. As it got closer, I could distinguish the red light on the top of the larger ship and make out seperate individual ships travelling with the red light. I saw approximately 20-25 smaller ships around the red light. The light seemed to change colors as it got closer.They were located in the NE section of the sky and moved to the Western area of the sky. A second grouping was also located in the Eastern section of the sky and I saw a flash of bright light relesed from the first grouping to the second grouping. The first group was in a holding pattern and sent the flash of light to the second group and then the second group formed into a V shape and they held their position as the first group got closer.The first group travelled directly over my house heading West.

The number 724-((deleted)) belongs to an ((deleted))  agency by the name of ((deleted)) in Sharon, Pa. This place seemed to never be open after trying to call every  day for several weeks.  I would leave messages for Dr. ((deleted)) to call me.   The calls were never returned.  At one point I finally reached a receptionist.  When asked for a Dr. ((deleted)), she replied there is a ((deleted)) who works here but he is not a doctor.  I asked to speak to him and was told he was not there much and to leave a message. I left my name and number again.  The call was never returned.  In the mean time I was discussing this with Kenny Young.  He tried to call many times also.  He also got the run around by the same receptionist who, by the way, said they were open every day.  That was not true. Finally he was able to reach Mr. ((deleted)) after a 2 month battle with unreturned calls and no one in the office.  Mr. ((deleted)) informed Kenny that he had filed the report for someone else.  He would not disclose who it was.  He told Kenny that he would pass along Kenny's name and number to the claimant.  Of course Kenny nor I have heard anything from the claimant. I have concluded that this case was a hoax.  The reasons why I believe this to be so are the following: 1. I believe that Mr. ((deleted)) knew we were trying to contact him and he refused to acknowledge our effects.   2. He was evasive in comments made to Kenny when he was finally reached 3. When reporting the incident to NUFORC, we were led to believe that this happened to him personally. 4. He presented himself as a doctor in the NUFORC contact information and said he was leaving a medical building when this occurred.  He was a medical doctor.  He was not a doctor. 5. I believe that if he had been reporting this for someone else he would have stated that in the contact info instead of leading us to believe it was him this happened to. The above reasons are why I had not gotten back to you on this case sooner.

The light was aimed towards the city as I think the object might have been at an altitude that normal aircraft fly, although it was hard to say.  The light was very bright, seeming like the object was just 5-10 thousand feet in the air (like a hot air balloon), then, as the light began to weaken, the object seemed to travel farther away (the trajectory path was not altered).

One of the tests as to whether the object might have been a satellite is the amount of the sky the object traversed in the time you were looking at it.  Can you estimate the angle it covered, measured in degrees, it covered during the 20 seconds you watched it? Thank you again for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially,  Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE)) Yes, I would estimate the light travelled approx 55 degrees.  I base this estimate by using my arms as a reference; by facing due east and stretching out my arms to point due north and south, the distance  between my outstretched arms would be equal to approx 180 degrees.  I first viewed the object about 20 degrees to the right of my head and then tracked it to a point about 35 degrees to the left of my head when the light vanished.

I was recently on holidays in the Kitimat, B.C. area. We popped in from Terrace just for a short visit, and when we were leaving, we pulled up at the view point by the fire hall. I said to the kids, I wanted a picture of them (Kitimat 1). I took the picture, but they were goofing off, so I said I wanted to take one more. I took it (Kitimat 2), and as soon as I took it, they ran off to play. I walked up to the red flower, and zoomed in a little to get a shot of the scenery (Kitimat 3). I snapped the picture, but did not notice anything unusual in the shot. When I downloaded the camera that night in Burns Lake, I saw the disk shaped object in the middle. The next day after looking closer I saw the second object to the left of it. And after allot of further review, you can see two other spots, but they are very faint. All these photo's are only about 20 to 30 seconds apart. The thing that amazes me is that nothing is there in the second photo, but there they are in the third. They had to have been travelling at a great speed to get there. I don't think I noticed anything in the camera because of the speed in which they are travelling. I phoned the Terrace airport the next day (Monday), and the only traffic they had around 2:00 pm was a Hawker (Lear Jet type), and a Dash Eight. Other that that a couple of small planes. No one had reported anything unusual as well. I did phone again on Thursday to see if anyone had reported anything, and still nothing. The photo's were taken with a pretty good camera (Olympus D-40), 4 mega pixel digital camera. But I have since found out that jpegs are not very good for blowing up images. The more you save an image, the more it gets distorted. I have had the photo's copyrighted, because originally I thought there maybe some equipment that would be able to blow it up better than I can. With my computer I can make out , what looks to be windows, and another some type of port on the lower left side. It is definitely disk shaped, but with all the light reflecting on it, it looks like a bunch of knuckles around it. I am sending you the copyrighted version, and I am also sending you the original version. I don't know how clear the original version will be for you, I know when I blow it up with a different program, it is more blurry than blowing it up with my camera software. The problem is I can't print the blown up image with my camera software, I have to open it in a different program that lets me print the blown up image, resulting in a more distorted view. I do have an email to Olympus, hoping they can help me. If this thing can be blown up with very good results, it will be the best picture caught on camera, because of al the detail the picture can offer. I have since seen allot of other photo's, and most of them look so plain (like putting two saucers together) they are just all metal, no details at all. The way the light hits it at the of the craft, you can tell the top half is curved up and the bottom half curves down, forming a saucer. the light reflecting on the craft shows allot of detail. I just have to have a clearer image. Anyways, it is just total fluke that I got this thing on camera. I think that these things are travelling so fast, nobody gets a chance to see these, unless they stop, or if it's at night (if they have lights). ((NUFORC Note:  We have examined the photos sent by the witness.  They are high quality photos, but the image of an anomalous object appears to us to be ambiguous.

Looking above stargazing/finishing a can of sprite i noticed 4 stars moving in formation. After a closer look I noticed the outline of a triagle shaped craft. It had 3 brighter lights on the points of the triangle and one dull blue light in the centre. I did believe this to be an airplane or I was just plain going nuts. It lasted for nearly half an hour until i saw the lights spin in an almost 180 degree turn. I nearly had a heart attack and got up about to run while looking at the object. But as soon as I got up there was a quick blur and there wasn't anythinge left to see. And last but not least my cell phone no longer works after that night.,2002-07-30T00:00:00,49.26892572695909,-123.11223982257269

Having filed my report, two things happened which casue me to add this addendum: 1) Today 29 July, you updated your files of reports from last week, and I have noticed that there were many other reports identical to my sighting, all at the samr time on the same day,all dscribing a large formation of lights travelling slowly north to south, with the first report from Tehachapi, and the last from Santa Monica.  All these reports (including those between these two extremes) were indicating a straight north-south passage.  This is significant (i.e.I'm not apparently crazy!) 2) On answering your questions and on reflection with other witnesses in my family, we DID see two fast military planes travelling the same path about 15 minutes behind (single-engine jet noise from high altitude, clear view of wings and nav light in bimoculars, my guess F-16's.

UFO REPORT: State Section Director--MUFON, Los Angeles--Only a few minutes prior to my neighbor's call, I'd gone to bed in the forward v-berth of my 30' Catalina sailboat on which I live aboard. When ((name deleted)) called me by phone with alarm in his voice, I was surprised to find him reporting a UFO to me (I voiced my doubt as to his sincerity because ((name deleted)) is a comedian who constantly uses my interest in UFO's as material for routine comedic ""assassinations"" of my character).  He reiterated that he was not kidding and that I should come topside immediately for a look. I popped the hatch over my head and moved upward on deck to see something which made absolutely no sense whatsoever: Above me nearly 90 degrees but slightly north and heading directly overhead to the south-southwest was a brightly lit array of lights which looked like they were configured to an '""invisible"" structure which all connected to what appeared to be a central jet aircraft. Flying at about 15 to 18 thousand feet, the atmospheric bounce seemed to illuminate the bottom of what looked like a typical jet, but that is where typical ended. There is always jet noise from being very close to LAX.. this was the case as this object went over.  There were other jets in the area. What sound I might have attributed to this object would not be accurate based on our proximity to Los Angeles airport. To the right and left side of this central craft was a ""formation"" of what looked like rotating red navigational beacons.  To the right were a series of three outboard beacons, the first one being the only one that was not rotating, constant, and red. Each beacon was equally spaced on either side of this craft. The distance from each beacon to one another was at least three full wingspans of the ""central"" craft?s main wingspan. That wingspan was approximately my thumbnail width at arm's length. Relative to the central craft, none of these rotating red lights moved independently of one another as if to be fixed to some ""superstructure"" and connected somehow to the central craft. To the left of this craft and starting outboard at the same distance as the right side were approximately six of these beacons making the left ""wing"" appear much longer.  At the farthest outboard ""end"" of the left side formation was a smaller white light trailing behind its respective leader as if it were being dragged by this leading edge beacon.  This gave the impression that this ""wing"" was squared off at the left end.  The distance from these two lights which formed this termination was about four fuselage lengths of the central craft.  There did not appear to be any visible structure to the larger wing formed by these outer beacons, though, there was absolutely no variation in spacing visible which might have been caused by independent buffeting from wind turbulence or speed differences. These beacons and lights seemed ""fixed"" to a rigid but invisible framework. Each red rotating beacon seemed larger than what it should have appeared to have been for its distance and did not seem to be ""attached"" to the bottom of anything like individual fighter aircraft or the like.  They looked like they were just oversized flying red beacons, clear and bright.  I don't remember anything significant about what should have been ""normal"" sized navigational lighting on the central craft. If there was a ""superstructure"" to this formation, the sweep angle of the main wing from the central craft's leading edge was the source for any ""attachment.""  This formation's angle might have been pitched slightly forward of the angle of the central craft wing's leading edge. The reasoning for such a configuration made no sense.  Any superstructure necessary to keep such a formation fully fixed in place as it appeared, would have been ripped apart by air turbulence from the speed this craft traveled at.  On the other hand, if there was a much larger main craft partially ""cloaked,"" then this would explain such an odd sighting.  This was my first unexplainable sighting so it is significant for me The duration of our sighting was approximately 2 minutes until this ""configuration"" of lights and craft moved out of sight to our south southwest.  That path would have taken it directly across the western end of the LAX active runways. We watched these lights from our different positions in the marina about 30 yards from each other. Scotto was watching through binoculars with another attending witness, and mutual friend Larry. Since that night MUFONLA has received at least two additional reports from different cities within LA County. These are Hawthorne and Silverlake. The witness in Silverlake took several seconds of Videotape. Our Director of Investigations will assign an independent investigator to these reports and I'm an artist so I will also illustrate what I witnessed as well.

The entire formation was several times larger than the moon (which was full or close to full) and it was moving very slowly across the sky.  The lights did not flash.  As the formation got about halfway across the sky, a very, very low, quiet engine sound became audible.  It was like a very very far away jet, but the sound was flat.  It really freaked me out.

I thought perhaps it was a binary star, since it looked like a double star as bright or brighter than Venus with my naked eye,  and went back and consulted the Heavens-Above website, which I look at on a regular basis since I work at night a lot and like to observe different satellites, shuttle, space station, etc. flying overhead. The sky chart for 2 a.m. showed no bright stars at that time in that location.  I know that I had never seen a satellite after approximately 10:00 p.m. local time and sure enough there were none on the list.  Also, this object did not move.  I got my binoculars out and then I observed the object having 3 distinct lights, green, white and red, which makes me think it was probably some unnamed stationary satellite.  It was in the same area for 2 hours.  At approximately 4 a.m. it was no longer visible.  I WAS a skeptic about UFOs until then.

It looked very much like all the other satellites I have seen over the years, a faint but definite, tiny orb of soft white light, with just a hint of orange. Just as this object hit it's zenith, it flared, quite brilliantly, and faded back to what I would describe as ""Normal"" for a satellite. The flare lasted approximately 3 seconds. At 21:38 Hours I saw a re-play of the first event. The second events flare seemed quite a bit brighter, and possibly as a consequence, I could not track the second object after the flare. I very firmly believe these objects were ""Man made"", and not some sort of ""Alien Spacecraft"". What troubles me is that they do not seem to conform to Iridium orbits. Am I wrong?

My husband and I were going under the Island freeway in our fishing boat.  As he was driving the boat I looked to the right side(heading south) I saw what looked like alot of birds. (White birds in the sky)  The longer I looked at the swarm of birds flying all over some distance away.  There were 2 white disc shaped white objects futher back from these birds.  They stayed in perfect distance side by side for the longest time and they seemed to be barely moving or at a fairly slow speed.  This Sunday was an exceptionally clear day and the sky was very blue with white clouds in the back ground.  The 2 things never drifted up or down just side by side.  What was so weird about these 2 objects was that as they approached this cloud, instead of going through the cloud they took a 45 degree turn, both side by side.  Then I saw one of the Unidentified things through the middle of the cloud for a second.(This would be the side of it.  It just stayed there for a second, then slowly went behind the cloud again.(Slow motion).  It came out of the other side of the cloud and once again they were side by side, in perfect order.  At one time I thought that they could be a set of planes flying perfectly together like the blue angels, because they flew close together, same height and same distance apart from each other and when they got near the cloud they both turned and I mean turned exactly to the right at such a sharp angle at the same time.  I  had to keep looking because I couldn't believe what I had just seen.  Even when I first saw these 2 white objects, their were alot of birds flying in front of them that I thought they were also birds. Then I noticed that the front of these things were really birds.  The birds started flying up and down, and you could see their wings go up and down, but the 2 behind the 15 or so birds never went up or down just straight towards this little cloud.(Or so the cloud looked to me from where I was at).  I kept trying to show my husband what I was seeing and he also saw these objects and the birds but he was driving the boat and since we were in the intracoastal canal he had to pay close attention to his driving.  I don't think he really knows what he or I saw except they were white and moving away from us.  After they came out the other side of the cloud they just continued going away from us until they were out of sight.  There was no sound and no smoke like jets or very fast planes would leave.  I did notice that when I saw them in the middle of the cloud, kind of peaking through the cloud, he seemed to have stopped for the moment.  I think all this took approximately 10 minutes or so and then they were gone. I remember seeing these 2 white disc like things so well, for I always wear polarized sunglasses when I go fishing or wade fishing and the sun was behind me, not to the right of me, and therefore was not in my eyes.  Who knows, but I do know that if I wasn't planes then what was it, too perfect flying order, just a little strange for me, especially the way they turned, the way they seemed to just stay in that spot for a little while, then just go one about there way.  Then Gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not specify the time of day of the sighting.  We will attempt to obtain that information.

The strange thing about these lights was that whatever direction we turned, the lights appeared to be directly behind us. This continued until we arriived home. When i arrived home the lights were still present over one of the fields. I fetched my Sony Digital Camera and on two occasions took a selection of photos and some small video footage (max 60 secs). The motion of the lights was again unusual with very rapid movement at very low height. No engine noise was noticable when i took the photos. On the second occasion of taking photos i stopped when the objects started to become nearer. When viewing some of the photos, some very strange images are apparent.

I happened to look up, as I often do to check for UFO's, and noticed a small dot of light about the size of the surrounding stars (a pinhead at arm's length)moving from West to East.  It covered the length of a ruler at arm's length in about 8 seconds.  I told my wife, ""Wow, what the heck is that?"".  She said, ""It's probably an airplane"".  However, there were no blinking lights on it and, from it's very small size, near to the size of the planet Mars, I was more than certain it was very high up.  As we watched it I suddenly said, ""Look!  It just got brighter!""  As it moved along in a straight path its diameter increased, it glowed more brightly, from a pinhead size to almost the size of a pea at arm's length.  This lasted for about 2 to 3 seconds. (At this point, I had very quickly run into the house and grabbed my binoculars.  When I saw it through my binoculars it had a fuzzy appearance to it and it seemed to have white dots around its perimeter.  I was using a Bushnell 10X50 to view the object).  I then wondered if it had been reflecting light from the sun or if it had actually glowed internally.  Then something amazing happened.  It dimmed to almost nothing. It was now barely visible, and there were no clouds along the entire flight path of this object.  Finally, this is the amazing part, it made a 30 degree (from the horizon) turn to the right and then disappeared, the whole time travelling at the same rate of speed.  It's color had first been a pale white and had glowed to a very intense white when it's diameter increased and then had returned to a very dim pale white before it made its turn and disappeared.  It's travel path, again, was from West to East and travelling down toward the horizon at almost a 45 degree angle.  By the way, my wife also viewed it through the binoculars and said it had a jumpy movement right before it disappeared, AFTER its 30 degree angle turn.  I asked her if the ! jumpy mo vement had been from her hands shaking the binoculars, but she said that it had not, as she had both the object and a stationary star in her field of view at the same time.  I just couldn't believe what we had seen!!  It was my very first UFO sighting in Hawaii!!  I was very certain it wasn't a satellite, as satellites don't make turns.  It was not a meteor; they don't turn either and it was definitely not a CONVENTIONAL aircraft.

We were traveling on the Atlantic City Expressway headed towards Atlantic City.  We started out about 10pm at the Walt Whitman Bridge, and around 10:25pm or so, we had just passed the Williamstown exit.  The road conditions were excellent, dry. The sky was illuminated with a full moon and a slight haze of clouds behind us in the west, but clear skies north/south and east.  There was no fog, fires or anything else in the sky to obstruct our view.  As we are chatting I notice straight ahead about 2 miles and about 15 degrees off to the right of the highway, a very large object which looked more like a stick since the distance made it impossible to distinguish anything from it in the sky, appears to be 2 football fields wide, no more than 3/4 to a mile up with only three lights apparent, and not bright lights either, a dull yellow/gray.  One on each end and one in the center.  As we were looking at this for about a minute, it starts to bank hard to its' left which is south- the banking of the lights was greater than 90 degrees and it was heading lower as well.  We lost it very quickly in the treeline which lines most of the highway so I reduced my speed from about 65mph to about 40 and headed to the right lane.  As we are waiting for the tree line to break a bit so we can look further south, a full minute goes by and then the trees start to break up.  Within a few seconds, the tree line breaks up for a solid mile and as we look to the south, we see more objects.  This time there are at least two, possible three objects with slightly brighter lights of the yellow gray color, but again only 3 lights per object but we can only clearly see 8 lights.  They are hovering about a mile from the highway in a field, one had a downlight beam of gray/white, the other one or two didn't.  We still at this point could not make out any shapes, but they were definitely closer, definitely lower to the ground, maybe only 500 feet from the earth.  They seemed to be abou! t half t he size each of the large first object we saw.  There was no noise from the area.  There was no sign of the large object we had seen.  I am slowing the car at this point and am half in the shoulder, only traveling about 20mph now, getting ready to stop the car.  The treeline starts cutting in and out again at this point.  We are still trying to gain more of a glimpse of these objects when we both notice something flying towards us, it was the lights we noticed again first, this time a dark grayish color, about 500-1000 feet up and about 1/4 mile away.  Within a second it is flying over the treeline and looking up as it is about to go over the car and highway we can clearly see what it is.  They are two triangular shaped crafts, with a light on each point.  They are dark gray in color, but clearly visible in a full moon medium blue sky.  They are perfect equilateral triangles and there are two.  They are both flying point first, appear to be only about 1000 feet above us, no noise, the dull lights on, flying neck and neck and appear to be about the size of a Lear jet.  We watch as they cross over the car, and the highway.  They were flying due north towards us, but as they approaced the car seemed to have shifted course every so slightly as if they were flying to Seaside Heights area versus Central New Jersey. They are not flying all that quickly at this point, no faster than a jet in landing mode.  But as they get about 1000 feet away from the highway, they just zip away, leaving no trails, but the three lights virtually disappear in an instant.  This is the biggest thrill of my life.  I am going to head back that way tomorrow since it is only about 45 minutes from my house with a camera to see what happens.  I will keep you posted either way. I did contact two local news stations, neither seemed too interested.  I had to wait to come back home to post this since no puter at the shorehouse.

I do know that planes as I have seen plenty when banking toward you will look like bright headlights except when they turn they always show red and white lights.The things I described were different because no sound and no light plus all the air traffic seems lower on the horizon .

I had just turned off my reading light to try and force myself to go to sleep because I knew I needed to get up relatively early in the morning even though I wasn't particularly tired. I lay there in bed and happened to look out my second story window and saw a small gray object outside my window. I wasn't sure what it was so I sat up and took a closer look. As it turned out it was nothing but some piece of electrical equipment attached to an electrical wire coming from the pole. I had a good laugh at myself and was about to lay back down when a quick flash of light caught my eye. My window looks directly east.  ((NUFORC NOTE:  Should read ""west.""  Please see note below.)) In my field of vision was a two story apartment building with parking lights pointing in my direction. Directly behind that is a 4 story hospital. Well about 1 1/2 hands high above the hospital is where I saw the light. It was a smallish light - mostly white but every once in a while I would see red glimpses. The reason it caught my eye is that it was moving at incredible speeds. So I sat there and watched it for a moment. At first I thought thought there were 2 or three lights in the sky -because it seemed like they were chasing each other. They were doing impossible loops, switchbacks and S curves. I got excited and ran downstairs to get my housemate who was still up watching TV to make sure I get someone else to see this so nobody could say I was crazy. He came up and and saw the light too. He saw them doing the loops, etc. but he is the kind of person that quickly dismisses anything outside his purview. He said: It's just a light - probably a spotlight - and left to go back downstairs. I continued to watch it. The light(s) were appearing on just past the edge of a line of clouds from a front that was passing by. The front contained the kind of clouds that look like thick fish scales - I forget their name - like a tight pattern of small cumulus clouds but not very thick. Just past the front where I was seeing the light ! there we re some high cirrus clouds that were thinning to the point that I could see a star. When I first noticed the spectacle I thought that there were 2 or maybe 3 lights up there dancing around, but the more I watched I realized that I was just watching one light - the other must have left or it was always just the one. Anyway, the light was smallish in size - about as bright as say Venus or Sirrus and about as big in size. I got the impression that the light was quite a distance away because as it was doing its loops and spirals it was reflecting its light in the thin clouds around it. With my roommates thought of a spotlight in mind I tried to discern whether this was really the case as it was staying in the general vacinity of where I was looking - namely just above the hosiptal. I quickly dismissed this idea becuase it wasn't showing any kind of pattern that I could see. At times the light was moving slowly and then it would suddenly move as fast as a shooting star. It seemed to be roughly circling something but it was just going around in cirlcles. It was doubling back on itself in extremely tight turns at very high speeds. Because there were some electrical lines in my way of sight I decided to go downstairs to see if I could get a better view. I ended up standing on the bed of my roomates truck and ended up watching the light for a total duration of about 1/2 hour - 45 min. Even though there were lights illuminating the parking lot across the street the light could still be easily seen darting in and out of clouds and doing its dance. The light was not constant in that I could always see it. For brief moments it would disappear behind the clouds or moved so fast that my eyes had to catch up with it. It watched it until another line of thick clouds obscured the light and I thought it was over so I went back to bed. Once upsatairs and in bed I took one last look outside and saw the light one last time - this time it shot straight up and that was it.  I never thought I'd be reporting a UFO though I've alw! ays want ed to see one. I'm currently an umemployed fine artist and I had just moved here less than a week ago. I like to think that I have an excellent eye for detail and have enough control over my emotions not to latch on to any one idea, having a very open mind. I was a Benedictine monk for 2 years and had just recently finished a 6 month stint infiltrating and gathering information on a racist organization. (if you could leave that part out it would be greatly appreciated). I am telling you this to let you know that although I may be eccentric and in some folks eyes considered weird - I have my head firmly planted on my shoulders. Also I was completely sober throughout the whole experience. I would like to know if anyone else in this area had seen this light. The next day I looked at a map to see what falls directly east of where I live. The Ohio river is directly east of me along with a neighborhood and right on the river I saw the Louisville/Jefferson county Riverport Authority which according to my map which was dated 1995 was still under construction. I hope any of this can be of help. I knew of you people from looking at rense.com. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) dancing light(s) Hello - i filed a report earlier today about a dancing light i saw friday night here in Louisville, KY.

I was on my deck and on my back stretching before dark tonight.  I observed a bright, and what seemed to be very high-altitude object overhead.  The sky was still too light for stars or planets, but it was similar to the size and intensity of Venus. I knew it wasn't Venus since it was directly overhead.  I ran into my house to grab my 8x25 power binoculars.  When I returned, the object had drifted slightly but was roughly in the same place.  I got on my back and observed the object through the binoculars.  I have very good eyesight and focused on the shiny object that seemed to be ovoid.  I then observed a small point of light revolving around the ovoid at a 7:00 to 1:00 attitude/orbit in a clock-wise direction with a frequency of about three seconds.  I ran back in the house to grab my cell phone and call a friend to describe what I was seeing.  When I returned, the object had drifted slightly to the southwest.  As I was describing my observations to my friend on the phone, the object suddenly and almost instantly separated into a group of approximately 20 to 30 small points.  There were no flames, colors or smoke to indicate any explosion.  It just seemed to separate.  Approximately three of the smaller objects were brighter and easier to see than the others, but it was now a distinguishable group of drifting objects.  I observed that the one piece that had been revolving around the ovoid was still in somewhat the same motion, but no longer around any object.  At first I thought it was falling, but then realized it was just drifting.  A few moments later, an object entered my field of vision approaching the group from the west and stopped.  It was about the same brightness as the original object but seemed to be triangular.  I thought it was a fighter jet, but it stopped.  Immediately, another triangular object of the same size and brightness approached the group from the north and stopped opposite the other object so as to surround the group from the east and west.  Just then, the group of objects d! isappear ed, and then the western triangular object disappeared.  The sky became hazy, and completely obscured the one remaining eastern triangular object.  The clouds remained for approximately 20 minutes and then dissipated. By that time the stars had begun to appear, and there was no sign of the objects.

I live near a small airport and frequently see small aircraft like Cessna's and corporate jets. The weather was clear with a few very high scattered clouds. After several minutes of looking up I observed to the south of me a triangular shaped craft flying from south to north. I estimate it's altitude at about one half mile and the distance from me of less than one mile. I could see it clearly. The craft itself was triangular with rounded corners, dark in color, didn't reflect any sunlight and made no noise that I could hear. I would guage the size of it to be similar to a large commercial aircraft. The surface that I saw appeared to be smooth without any lights on it. When first seen I thought it was a kite drifting on the wind but it flew smoothly in a straight line, not erratically like one expects a kite to do. It flew slowly enough that it was in sight for at least two minutes. During this time it maintained a steady flight path and did not change it's altitude or distance from me. I finally lost sight of it to the north due to the edge of the building I was in. While I was watching this craft a small Cessna took off from the airport and reached an altitude of about 1500 feet going south/southwest. The engine on this plane was easily heard. It appeared to be about midway between the ground and the triangular craft but closer. I should note that there are several military bases to the southeast of Kansas City. Perhaps what I saw was an aircraft from one of them. I've seen the B1/Stealth aircraft in flight at distances of a 1000 feet and the craft I saw yesterday evening was a little different. What impressed me the most was the rounded corners, total lack of noise, it's shape and that it didn't reflect any sunlight at all even though it was in the light of the setting sun.

That it was REALLY tall. I am aware of these becuase I am in the business. As we got back on the road, the two platform lights seperated and travelled with the car. Then they travelled over the treeline together at superfast speeds. When we became alarmed, we stopped. They did, too. I started back on the highway going 90 and they kept up. I was shocked, so I pulled over again, and again they stopped. We then watched 7 colored, hovering, noiseless balls perform for us in sequence, then four more. They did come closer to the car, but still too distant to perceive completely. They were oranginsh, with a swirling center, and what appeared to be smoke trails or burning coming from the top.

I was at the statesville airport with my young daughter. It was a clear day with a few clouds in the sky. I was parked north of the runway on Aviation Drive. I was listening to my radio shack 200 channel scanner model#20-312, which Icarry in my personal vehicle to listen to air traffic communications. The frequency for the Statesville airport is 123.05. I observed a Beachcraft KingAir 200 airplane takeoff on runway 28and head in a westerly direction. I viewed the take off through my binoculars a pair of bushnells model#13-7016. I had used the zoom lens to zoom in on the airplanes takeoffs (7-15/35 zoom). Using my scanner, I listened to student pilots getting clearances fo their takeoffs and landings. ACessna 172 skyhawk was holding on runway 28 to let a Robinson R22 Beta helicopter land. Shortly after landing, the helicopter took off again and headed south and turned east past the airport. It then turned north and then west for final approach to runway 28. It then hovered while the Cessna followed the same pattern. At the same time, another Cessna 182 skyhawk recieved clearance and tookoff.I was still watching the helicopter and the first cessna in my binoculars, when the second Cessna took off. I followed it up about 20-25feet off the runway. At this point, I saw a black sphere about the size of a BB bullet off in the distance behind the airplane. The object hovered for about a second and then accelerated quickly from the southeast to the north. It was just a little norteast of my position when it disappeared behind the trees. The object was 15-20 degrees above the horizon and from the first time I saw it to it disappeared was 10-15 seconds. Even with using the binoculars, I was unable to find a rudder, a contrail or after burner exhaust. I feel certain that it was not a B-2 Spirit, which I had seen at a Concord airport airshow back in May 2000. The B-2 started out looking like a black line in the sky until it got closer to you. The craft I observed had no lights or reflection from the sun which was at 45-50 degrees in the south/southeast sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provided a follow-up map of the area and events.

By 7:20pm the sun had almost vanished and there was only a hint of light on a partly cloudy evening. Two males and one female were traveling north on Cordon Road just on the East side of Salem where the city ends and farm land begins. They first noticed what appeared to be two bright car headlights just above some trees ahead about a quarter mile and above the tree line on the left of the road. As they began to approach the intersection of Cordon and Sunnyview, the view to the left and above became quite clear as the trees on their left gave way to the scene ahead of them...a craft slightly larger than the house it hovered above between 50 to 100 feet quietly sat as they and a few other drivers on the road passed in both directions. The house this craft was situated over was sitting by itself in an open farm field. At this point in the sighting, as they drove below and to the right of it, they report seeing what was described as a craft in the shape of a triangle, only the front end of the craft was not pointed, but instead having a straight edge. At the corners were two bright white lights which were bright enough to illuminate the crop in the field below in front of the home. As they came along side the craft, they stretched their necks to look up and out the car window. The middle section on each side began to rapidly flash red lights in a strobe like manner. They also report a dome like structure centered in the middle of the craft. One of the witnesses recalled wondering how the craft would land as the dome underneath would make the craft wobble upon landing. Passing the craft, they report seeing two bright white lights on the back corners as well. The witnesses continued down Cordon road a short distance and turned left on Walker road while viewing the back of the craft. They then turned again left as Walker road curves left in an attempt to come up on the other side of the craft. It was at this point that the craft departed the area at a high rate of speed. It was noted that there was no sign of ""slow to fast"" acceleration, that the craft simply ""took off"" from a point of motionless hover to speeding away at the blink of an eye. Several other motorists appeared to have seen this craft as well, according to the witnesses, but none have come forward as yet. The Salem Police Department was notified by the witnesses as they didn't know who else to contact. The Police put the witnesses in contact with Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, who in turn contacted Oregon UFO Research Director Skip Schultz. The next day, Saturday the 30th at 11am, Director Schultz and Assistant Director Eric Byler met with the two male witnesses at the intersection of Cordon and Sunnyview and were told of what had happened. Schultz and Byler were also given drawings of the craft in question. Both investigators were in agreement that both witnesses were sincere with their story and were of a very credible nature. A better idea of the altitude of the craft was given at that time and it was decided the craft was around 75 feet above the field rather than 100 feet. The female witness was working that morning and later sent a report to the Review via e-mail. Byler returned later that day and spoke with the home owners that lined the opposite side of the field in question in hopes of finding other witnesses. While no other witnesses were found in these homes, it was discovered that while some of the neighbors had not been home during the sighting, the rest conveyed that they were either in watching TV or eating dinner. None of them reported being either outside or in a position to see the silent hovering craft above their homes. If anyone was driving either North or South on Cordon road near Sunnyview at 7:20pm on Friday the 29th of March, 2002 and witnessed this event, please contact either Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle at 206-722-3000, the Oregon UFO Research Hotline at 503-463-1467, or the Salem Police Department. OUFOR would like to thank the Salem Police Department as well as Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle for passing on this sighting to us for investigation and for his continued cooperation in helping get to the bottom of UFO sightings Nationwide.

The sighting took place at almost exactly 2124, according to my cable box before I went outside (I was watching Junkyard Wars; got an addiction to it).  The angle of view that I have from the backyard is small.  I was facing due East, and looking up to see Cassiopea (just to be sure I could still locate it, I was an amateur astronomer in my teens).  I noticed a very bright light, travelling at about the same speed as a satellite.  It travelled from north out of Cassiopea to the south in almost direct North to South direction.  Once it left the constellation of Cassiopea, it headed towards a large fir tree that I was standing almost under.  It slowly began to fade out, to a dot, then to nothing.  The trees that caused the narrowness of my observation are in a line on the property line between our neighbors and our house.  I stepped back and went around under the tree to see if the light would brighten again and reappear (again, too much high end cable; I thought of the solar panels discarded by the astronauts from the space shuttle, that never really re-entered..).  Needless to say, it didn't.  I returned to my original position, and looked back up to make a sighting of the area that I saw this interesting phenomenon, and saw it happen again!  Exactly in the same manner!  Again I retreated under the tree, and looked to see if it reappeared.  It didn't.  During the first observation, I noticed a standard jet liner (Paine Field and SeaTac both have planes visible in holding/landing patterns in this area) flying under the object...  Very obviously under the object, with sound and all the attendant lights.  After observing this, I realized that total darkness had happened somewhere around 2050 to 2110 pm.  Whatever it was I saw, I firmly believe was of terrestrial origin.  Both of these objects had an interval of about 1 minute between sightings, and followed the exact same trajectory, and brig! htness t o disappearance ratio during the time of visibility.  I think that whatever it was was either, a) a set of high flying aircraft, that had no paint (i.e. aluminum skin or some other reflective surface), or b) a set LEO (low earth orbit) satellites that caught the suns' rays at just the right place and just the right time, before travelling out of the sun's light and into shadow.  There were absolutely no trails from the objects, and both were exactly the same in appearance and disappearance.  I wish I knew what they really were!  I'd like to note, after making a selection below this text box, that there were aircraft in the sky, but they were NOT chasing the objects I viewed, they just made the idea that they were LEO much more attractive. For the investigators: If an investigator would like to contact me I work odd hours, please leave a message on my voice mail system if you don't reach me immediately.  I would be glad to call you back and further discuss/investigate this interesting phenomenon.

The event took place almost an hour ago, moments after midnight on Wednesday September 4th. While walking from South to North direction in Agria - Volos - GREECE, we saw three lights moving in parallel from east to west. The middle light was bouncing between the other two lights, moving like a pendulum. Soon after that the formation changed into a triangle that was continuously changing shape and dimension. Just as they were reaching Kassiopeia they aligned again and performed a very tight and fast 180 degrees turn without any reduction in speed. Right after the turn, the formation started changing again. For a moment the lights gathered close forming a bright single light but almost immediately it broke again in to the three lights, until it dissapeared in the light cloud generated by the nearby city of Volos (east). The Sky was clear with no clouds. The lights were as bright as a not-so-bright star, but there were fairly easy to spot, mainly because of their highspeed.",2002-09-06T00:00:00,,

Then the object returned the other direction towards the Northeast and then back to the North until it faded out of view.

It is almost 8 pm and the sun was setting and the Sears building at the Sea-Tac Mall was a bright orange color. I said ""silly, it is a building"". She moved her finger to aim higher saying ""no that, what are those"" she asked adamantly! I was holding her up in my arms and could not answer her as I continued to try and figure it out for myself.

I mention them because when I was watching them at the races sometimes they would go into different pattern and would get so high in the sky that they would almost look like little dots in the sky.

They were all the same size... like bally black ovals, but not balloons! Three of these objects danced around, but not in front of one that seemed to have more of a focus. They were higher than the airplanes that where flying by, but for example they seemed like three playful cubs, staying close to their mother as they went for a walk. 3)Birds... well there was something in the clear blue sky, but I will difinitely protest to chalk it up to a flock of birds flying south for the winter, especially since it is still summer. 4)Something I can't identify with.... it was the way that these objects moved that intrigued me! Moving slowly at a SW angle, yet almost hopping up and around another. I saw them moving from four high, diamond, almost v-ish to three high and one in front.

(2)  It was obviously MOVING at a slow but deliberate pace (again, I could best compare the speed to that seen with airplanes on their landing approach.  Next, I pulled my car over to the shoulder of the highway for a better look (as it seemed unusual to see aircraft in this vacinity (as it is very close to Vandenberg AFB and their no-fly zone).  There were only a few cars on the highway and this was a very clear night (no fog or clouds).  -Star visibility was good.  I watched the craft/light move southwest (towards the coast) when it appeared that the light did a gradual fade to light green...then solid/deep green (as if someone were controlling it with a dimmer switch to control its intensity of color and brightness).  I continued to watch the light for about a minute more and again, it faded; but this time it gradually dimmed completely out and I could not locate it within the clear night sky.  I am familiar with satellites, but must stress to you that this light was very low in the night sky (at low-flying airplane altitude.  I also am familiar with iridium satellites and their tell-tale green flashes.  This light did not flash at all and was much brighter than any satellite I have seen.  Even though the craft was low in the sky, I could not make out a shape. ((NUFORC Note:  This witness is well known to NUFORC, and we consider her to be exceptionally reliable.  We have spoken with her about the sighting, and we have no explanation for what it was she witnessed.  The object was moving to the southwest, which rules out most satellites.  Also, as she watched the object fly from her right to left, she witnessed a green light, which rules out any kind of conventional aircraft.  PD))",2002-08-16T00:00:00,,

It's up to you to follow up! washingtonpost.com  ""F-16s Pursue Unknown Craft Over Region By Steve Vogel Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday, July 27, 2002; Page B02 For Renny Rogers, it was strange enough that military jets were flying low over his home in Waldorf in the middle of the night. It was what he thinks he saw when he headed outside to look early yesterday that floored him. ""It was this object, this light-blue object, traveling at a phenomenal rate of speed,"" Rogers said. ""This Air Force jet was right behind it, chasing it, but the object was just leaving him in the dust. I told my neighbor, 'I think those jets are chasing a UFO.' "" Military officials confirm that two F-16 jets from Andrews Air Force Base were scrambled early yesterday after radar detected an unknown aircraft in area airspace. But they scoff at the idea that the jets were chasing a strange and speedy, blue unidentified flying object. ""We had a track of interest, so we sent up some aircraft,"" said Maj. Douglas Martin, a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado, which has responsibility for defending U.S. airspace. ""Everything was fine in the sky, so they returned home."" At the same time, military officials say they do not know just what the jets were chasing, because whatever it was disappeared. ""There are any number of scenarios, but we don't know what it was,"" said Maj. Barry Venable, another spokesman for NORAD. Radar detected a low, slow-flying aircraft about 1 a.m. yesterday, according to a military official. Controllers were unable to establish radio communication with the unidentified aircraft, and NORAD was notified. When the F-16s carrying air-to-air missiles were launched from Andrews, the unidentified aircraft's track faded from the radar, the military official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Pilots with the D.C. Air National Guard's 113th Air Wing, which flew the F-16s from Andrews, reported nothing out of the ordinary, NORAD officials said. ""It was a routine launch,"" said Lt. Col. ********, a senior officer with the wing, which keeps pilots and armed jets on 24-hour alert at Andrews to respond to incidents as part of an air defense system protecting Washington after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. R***** remains convinced that what he saw was not routine. ""It looked like a shooting star with no trailing mist,"" he said.

They continued to move for about a minute and one of them broke away from the others and flew into another sorounding star. It looked like they were flying in a triangle pattern.

I saw what was either a triangular shapped craft or three crafts flying in a triangular formation. I don't know whether it was just one or multiples because I was unable to make out any part of the structure only three red lights. I am not an aviation expert at all but I am fairly certain that it was not a airplain as the object(s) was alot closer than planes usually fly and it was one of the fastest moving objects I have ever seen in my life. I am extremly skeptical about these types of things and would appreciate if someone would be able to clear this up for me. I have been searching the net since I saw the object(s) and the closest picture I could find was this one http://www.totalufo.net/ufos/pics/belgufo.htm but there was no middle light and I was unable to make out and defined shape like the one in this picture which is why it could have been three seperate objects.

The weather changed today from unseasonably hot to cool, so as the front moved in and storm clouds appeared, it became windy.  I noticed a black, circular shape in the sky that remained stationary for 20 or more seconds, so it caught my eye.  My first impression was that the object might be a rather large balloon within a half mile of my position, but oddly it remained stationary in the wind.  I put my caller on hold and looked more closely.  After remaining stationary for about 30 seconds, it began to move slighly, in almost a fluttering way or jagged way, suddenly dipping to the left and downward, and changing shape from circular to more flat.  Then it went up again and a little to the right, again becoming more circular, but also changing shape so that it was periodically circular and then more ovoid.  It headed back to the left and would remain somewhat stationary and then dip further down.  At this point, as it got lower, I could see that there was a lighter colour on top, almost like the reflection of a dome (there was very little sunlight ""behind"" my position, peeking through stormy clouds).  With that extra shading, the object looked more saucer-shaped.  There is a shopping mall next to my office and as I watched the object, it dipped down until it disappeared just on the other side of the mall.  If that were the case, the object must have been within a half-mile to a mile of me, and smaller than a helicopter, but much larger than a bird.  It definitely appeared to be under intelligent control under windy conditions, and the changing shape was also quite dramatic.",2002-06-12T00:00:00,39.56792218259629,-105.0102302425107

At this moment a passenger plane was climbing from my backward uper left hand and flew past that object. and I thought at that moment the people in the plane must also have seen the strange object. Meanwhile I made some comparisons between these two: I could see clearly the wings, tail, the marks and even the potholes on the plane; and i knew it was climbing because it was flying at an upward angle and there was airport nearby. But with the object, I couldn't see much of it except that it was about the same size with the plane because they were at about the same attitute from my position and it had no wings, no tails and no specific characteristics to tell me that this was something I have seen before. I didn't take it very seriously at first. I thought that if it was ufo or something, the people in the passenger plane must have seen it and perhaps many other people have seen it too, cause that day was a briliant cloudless day and besides that the people working in the nearby airport with radar and everything must have seen it too.

She said, ""Mommy, there is something in the sky, look.""  We went to the glass door and watched what appeared to be a very bright, white disk-shaped object traversing the sky about 500-700 feet up going precisely south to north at a fairly fast pace.  I have watched many, many planes fly over my house and this did not appear to be a plane.  It had a definite disk shape to it.  We grabbed the binoculars and ran outside to the back yard following it across the sky.  I kept saying it must be a balloon but it didn't seem to behave like a balloon.  (I video tape and photograph known flying objects in the sky for my IFO web site - this did not fit anything I have in my IFO database.) I watched it fly to the south through the binoculars then noticed it seemed to rotate or something happened because it began to change from a disk shape to some other shape (this is when I knew it was not a plane for sure).  It was descending to the ground behind some houses at about a 25-30 degree angle.  This is when I had serious doubts that it was a balloon.  My daughter also said she saw it maneuver in the sky while I was getting the binoculars and she said balloons cannot do what it did.  No sound was detected. I have a B.A. and M.Ed. in counseling psychology and research UFO's, phenomena and military technology.  I hesitated filing this report because I believe most UFO sightings tend to be misidenifications of conventional aircraft and/or other common objects seen in the sky.  I have to admit it was clearly disk shaped and seemed to be flying under some type of control and it went down to the ground as if landing.  It could have been a balloon or it could have been a UAV.  I don't know.  I've seen other unusual objects in this area now and then.  (It was partly cloudy but mostly sunny today, winds out of the south at 5-10 mph.)",2002-08-28T00:00:00,33.0735,-96.9032

So, we figured it was  a plane heading right towards us and I listened expectantly for the sound of the roar of a plane, but it didn't come. As we continued to discuss the orange bright pulsing light . . . suddenly, it just was gone. Just like that. Nothing. No clouds for it to behind, just absolutely vanished.  There were no flashing tail-lights or any identifying light patterns that signalled any aircraft we were familiar with, so this was rather a mystery.  If it was indeed a plane that made a suddenly turn, it's puzzling why no other lights were then visible. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) Orange Bright Object Suddenly Vanishes: part 2, seen in Sacramento, CA This is to update the earlier report. I spoke with my mother and she described the intensity of the light as ""brighter than any object in the sky"" (including the moon) and that it looked to her as though it were actually out in space, ""not in our atmosphere.""  My earlier description was more of an estimate of size, since I was tired and not thinking terribly clearly.  Yes, it was brighter than the moon, though of course much smaller.  It was as bright as a firework, but again small, meaning you could imagine it being a planet, though in comparison with Jupiter/Venus etc. it's bigger, as it appeared on the ground.  She also was skeptical about the light being a plane landing light, since the light did not diminish before vanishing; wouldn't a plane landing light fade somewhat as the projection of that light began to make its turn? And why no flashing tail lights? Was this a distant stellar phenomenon perhaps?  There must be some other reports of this somewhere.",2002-08-28T00:00:00,38.57580181028241,-121.45009956553221

My wife recieved a phone call at 11:45 from my brother. She then told me that the meteor I was waiting for can be seen in the sky. I told her it was last saturday. I then saw the object she was talking about west. I told her it was an airplane characteristic of the blue and red flashing lights. She then told me my brother also saw it 18 KM away. I said that was impossible. I decided this requires more research. I hauled out my telescope. Spotted the object at 50 power and noticed it was no airplane. Went to 200 power. I then had a clear picture. It was close to the characteristic flying saucer shape. It glowed very intensely. Had a weird rotating sensor beam on the top part of the saucer. It flashed aqua color first and then orange-red second. Much like a rotating spot beam at a 0.5 second rotation. Obviously one beam that could scan orange-red and then aqua. I then took relative size calculations. Today I took bearing calculations at my place and my at my brothers to figure out the distance to the object. I also took an object that looked the same size in the telescope at a distance that i measured to figure out the size. I went over to my brothers who pointed to where he saw it. I used my GPS to get the bearing at his place. Using math I calculated the object was 30 meter diameter at a distace of 200 KM. That puts it over Vancouver Island. The object also moved much like a star in the sky. This indicates that it could not be an object in close orbit. The object must of been under power. My brother watched it for over an hour and me for 45 minutes before it went behind some trees. I can say this was not weather ballon or object burning up in the atmosphere.

I live three miles East of Reed-Hilview Airport in San Jose, CA.  I was observing a South bound single engine aircraft climbing in altitude following takeoff and the normal 90 degree turn normally performed to avoid entering the traffic path of aircraft departing from SJC.  I noticed an unusual reflection which at first appeared to me to be a very light colored balloon reflecting what I believed to be the amber color of the city lights below.  The object appeared straight West of me at about 70 degrees, well above the aircraft I was observing.  At first I beleived the object was only two hundred or so meters from my location. As the object continued on what appeared to be a South East direction, I watched it and noticed that the shape was more of a wedge shape.  I became aware that the winds were calm and that the object was moving at a rate of speed far beyond wind velocity.  There were no distinct lights or sound produced by the object and because of this, the altitude is difficult to estimate beyond my belief of at least 1 mile or better above the ground.  I reside in the Eastern Foothills of the city at around 300 Feet above sea level in comparison to the valley floor at 80 feet above sea level.  The object's altitude appeared to remain consistent and I was hoping to get a better view of the object as it's direction of travel was bringing it towards the full moon.  Unfortunately, the object, slightly larger than half the size of the moon, did not pass into the moonlight but the moon did briefly display a companion object to the right and slightly behind the object that was not previously visable. The object continued a consistent direction of travel, disappearing around a minute after the initial observation.  What seemed unusual about this is the object speed, the shape and that as it passed into an area where city lights would have dissapated the reflection but the consistent coloration and shape did not reflect that. I have seen weather ballons lanched from near the San Jose international airport during the day and I'm sure that San Jose State University also launches them at night.  The prevaling winds are such that when they are launched, they do pass over the area were I live.  I've seen these ballons before during the day and they are usually visable only when winds are fast enough to carry them over before they are too high to see.  Those types of winds were not present tonight.  I would readily dismiss any observation day or night as one of these balloons.  If for some reason it was a weather ballon, it was huge and it was moving a lot faster than I have observed before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was 2.00am last night a storm had rolled through Mississauga and then on over Toronto. My sons called me to their bedroom to see what they said were weird lights in the sky over the lake. What I witnessed at first was a series of lights on the clouds which at first I took to be spot lights from the ground illuminating the clouds a not uncommon experience. My opinion of this changed when one of the twisting rotating lights in the clouds suddenly got to the edge of the cloud, when it did it was brighter than the sun to look at. This went on for over an hour with the lights wiggling and constantly appearing at the edge of the cloud as these immensely bright spots of light. A second storm was rolling in from the west behind us, there were some huge flashes of lightning inside the clouds which of course illuminated the entire sky as these took place it was obvious that there was a very large triangular object in the clouds, the repeated flashes and the blocking of light (shadow) that this thing caused made it obvious that it was indeed solid. From one flash to the next it had moved horizontally and had got smaller indicating that it was higher. After about 6 or 7 lightning flashes it was no longer visible. I went back to looking at the lights spinning through the sky above the lake. They started to slow down and remain in one place but always glowing, there was a sort of illuminated grid pattern (hard to explain) but like a rectangle with square dull lights in a grid pattern like a an old fashioned multipaned window is as best as I can describe it. This was evident for only a matter of seconds, when it disappeared the lights started squiggling in a sinuous manner, this they would do as they darted across the top of the clouds, constantly they would appear at the edge of the cloud and sparkle from blue white to an intense amber colour. I left to answer the call of nature, when I came back only one light remained, constantly lit and very bri! ght. The others had (this according to my two adult sons) moved in a wobbling and sinusoidal way out of sight to the south west. The last light remained in place very bright for over ten minutes, it then moved up into the clouds getting fainter until it completely disappeared. I am aware that alot of folks will think that we observed a simple thunderstorm, what we saw has nothing to do with any storm. It was remote from it, intelligent and from what we saw obviously solid in nature. I have seen some of these things many times now, and I am becoming convinced that there is some form of intelligent control of this phenomena.

I noticed something moving in the sky above.  It was moving in a straight line from approx. WNW to ESE.  It was viewed from about 60 degrees to about 90 degrees vertically(directly overhead), until it was obscurred by the roof of my car.  Without any reference points to determine size/height, I would guestimate that it was somewhere between 300 to 600 feet in altitude.  It's diameter I can only describe by how much sky it blocked...I liken it to holding up a penny at arms length(I know...not very professional).  It was either relatively close and small, or relatively high and large.  I could not discern which, although I am leaning toward the former.  It's speed, if the former is in fact correct, I would guestimate at about 110 to 120 Knots(about the speed of a Cessna 172). I could not tell its overall shape (whether it was a disk or saucer) due to my looking up from almost directly below it.  From below, it was circular in outline.  It did not appear to be solid, but more like a ring. It was the exact color of the very clear, blue sky.  At the risk of sounding crazy, I would have to say that it was invisible/transparent, with a slight darkness around the edges.  What I did see was a wake of whitish blurring sky moving along with it, following it's trajectory, as well as a larger blurry wake(?) being pushed(?) in front. There was also a somewhat darker white blurring towards the sides. I can only liken it to when a ship is cutting through the ocean, as it's bow pushes through the water, it creates a white foam in front of the ship as the bow parts the water.  The foam travels around both sides of the ship, and then rejoins at the stern, and then leaves more foam behind.    Other than these ""wakes"", the object was not visible.

Tonight at just after 6pm on Saturday 4th of May, 2002...my husband and I were driving down our street about to turn into our main street and just before the intersection I looked out the front windscreen and saw a large orange light that looked like what I thought was the planet Mars.  (I have never seen Mars before in the night sky and thought that this was one of the planets in the planet alignment that is going on at the moment.) I said to my husband ""Look...that must be Mars...thats right the planet alignment is still happening now"".  We have been looking every time we remember to see if we can see the planets align with our naked eyes every time we leave or enter our house.  We have been seeing big bright stars that we are gathering to be the planets that are aligning...but this one was different in the fact that it was a BRIGHT ORANGE!  THat is why we assumed it must have been Mars. My husband said ""WOW."" thinking it was Mars. There was a small but bright white star just above this bright Mars-like planet and it was very close above the star like maybe a centremetre at the most directly above the orange planet. This was all very interesting but not unusual in the idea that we were looking at what we thought was Mars. Then as we were almost at the intersection I said ""Look-its moving!""...my husband looked up from the road and said ""What...Mars?"" with a tone of disbelief in his voice, as I would have also if I were him. I said ""No...the little white star above it!"". He looked and yep it was moving alright.  He didnt believe it until it actually OVERLAPPED THE MARS LIKE PLANET!  then it kept on falling/moving down vertically.  It was descending at a slow steady pace.  We followed it to a darker part of the same road and when we got to the cemetary we stopped but about halfway up the road before the cemetary the white star faded out kinda instantly. I said stop the car when we got to the cemetary a few hundred metres later as I still wanted to stare at the sky (as my eyes had been glued 100% at this white descending star) and I wanted to get out of the car and look in the darkest part of the road where we were now at.  My husband wouldnt let me get out of the car as he feared we might get mugged and rightly so lol.  I also didnt know we were next to the cemetary or I might not have been so keen lol. I looked up again from where the white star had vanished about a quarter up from the bottom of our windscreen (we drive a small car) to look at the Mars like planet again and my husband said that it had gone...I said ""it has not"" and I looked at where the Mars like planet WAS and it WASNT THERE ANYMORE...I said ""What happened to the Mars thing?"" and he said with disbelief and incredulity in his voice ""DIDN'T YOU SEE IT? It disappeared exactly like the little white one did!""...I said with disbelief in my voice ""NO!""  and he said ""Yes...I saw it...didnt you see it?""  I said ""No...I was too busy watching to see if the little white one would come back""...he said ""Well it did exactly the same thing as the little white one did-where is it then...look its not there..I'm telling you it did the exact same thing as the white one did!""  I said...""What it descended vertically and then faded above the horizon in the same place the little white one did?"" and he said ""Yes!"" ON a side note...there was an article in our local paper about LOTS of ppl ringing in to report large orange lights in the skies a few weeks ago...I thought nothing of it as we didnt see them...and secretly I thought that they were silly and were mistaking the planets in the planetary alignment for UFO's...now I know better!  If we didnt see this ourselves than we would have thought that all those ppl that reported those lights weeks ago were idiots...but now we know that they are not! I read about the other reports from Wodonga and Adelaide on this sight with great amazement!  I didnt know that Adelaide saw those lights a few weeks ago also? But what about tonight?  Did anyone see anything tonight around 6pm? We also saw what we thought were stars too small and too fast and too horizontally moving to be be stars or meteorites on the night of those meteor showers a month or so ago but that was NOTHING compared to this sighting and whereas I could be fairly easily convinced that those were airplanes...I KNOW THAT THIS SIGHTING TONIGHT OF THE ORANGE MARS LIKE PLANET AND THIS SMALL WHITE STAR WAS NOT A STAR OR PLANET-BUT SOME SORT OF UFO. As for airports and military bases...well there is an airport in the opposite direction to where we saw these objects tonight...and there is a military base at Bandiana past Wodonga. What are these spacecraft/lights? And why so many sightings now?  Is it because of the theory that UFO's like to try and hide in the sky when there are meteor showers and alignments so you'll confuse them and think that they are normal occurances?  By the way I dont think that there was a moon tonight...we didnt see one. I'm not sure if there was a moon the night of the meteor showers but it was also a dark night. I think I'll go write a letter to our local paper now...my first letter ever to a paper as I am motivated by the thought that there are other local ppl that might have see this tonight. Thanks for listening. By the way...the mars like planet and star were high in relation to our car windscreen..in other words it was about 3 quarters up the windscreen at least. Also there were no noises that we could hear and no other effects  these were purely light objects...in other words no 'craft or metal etc' could be seen.",2002-05-14T00:00:00,,

I live in N.W. Oklahoma in a small town/city and there is not much to do so I spend a lot of time being bored.  Tonight (04 May '02 around 10:15 p.m.) I was sitting outside since there was nothing overly interesting on TV.  I was watching one of the many of what I assume to be satellites go thru the night sky.  One in particular caught my attention because it seemed much brighter than the rest.  I watched it for maybe 15 seconds or so pass almost directly overhead going south to north. My attention was distracted from it for a couple of seconds by a loud pickup leaving the intersection just to my east going east.  I reached over to the small concrete step for my pack of cigarettes.  I found them quickly because of the moonlight and then it hit me that I couldn't even see the moon from where I was sitting.  I looked up and there was a really bright light almost directly overhead.  Kind of like the light coming from a full moon.  The only sound I remember hearing was the normal non stop barking of the neighbors dog and myself saying ""OH SH**!"".  All at once the light just went out and I was staring at the stars trying to get my eyes to focus.   I'm kind of freaked out from it all and I loaded every gun in the house but there is a about an hour or so I don't have a clue what went on.  I'm thinking that it took me an hour to load 3 guns but even if I had to drive to Wal-Mart to get shells I'd be back home in 20 minutes tops because its less than a mile away but I have lots of shells on hand and the guns are normally loaded except for a round in the chamber.  Two friends and myself were coyote hunting back in the early 80's and seen something similar but it was just before daylight.  What is it that I'm seeing?

So I kept looking but then in less than 3 seconds it turned and began to move very quickly. It was zig zaging like a a person shining a pen light on a board and moving it in motions like a composure. That is why I thought it was a meteorite skipping off the atmosphere at first. Then I realized that it was going in and out and underneath and above the clouds. It moved from the first time I saw it from my right to my left and then continued toward the south all in the space of about 10-30 seconds. Nothing to my knowledge could have even endured the Gforces. Also the speed was tremendous. It traveled at about 5 miles within 5 seconds.I had already pointed it to my mother and at first she thought I was joking then she saw it. She said she would never get over it. I too am as amazed.

I would also like to make clear that it looked like a firefly (except no trails of light behind) and that it was not only going above and through clouds it would also be clearly seen from the backdrop of space. There was no light from the ground creating it also.

I am a UFO researcher and have taken a UFO photo over a crop circle in the past. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at several photos, and they are ambiguous, we believe.  The originals may show the anomalous objects more distinctly, but the copies sent to us show slightly dark smudges in the photo.  We are unable to confirm that they are UFO's.  They may be birds or insects, but that is only a guess.  PD))",2002-07-30T00:00:00,,

I first thought it was a plane and then realized that I never seen a plane like that before. I was able to point out three corners of the craft which did indeed look like a triangle. The front had two green lights at two points and what looked like a red flame in between them. It was moving a bit slow for a few seconds and then picked up speed. We stood up and ran to the front of the house because the house next door was in the way of our view. When we made our way there it had disappeared. It wasn't a cloudy night so us not being able to see it anymore was a bit strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain anonymous.  PD)),2002-07-30T00:00:00,,

I was enjoying a late evening soak in the hot tub on my deck outdoors with 4 friends. We recalled that it was getting close to time for the Perseids. We saw a few meteors, and continued to look for others. The observers were an adult couple, their teenaged daughter, and two adult females, ranging in age from 14 - 53. All adults are college educated, but not scientists. No alcohol or any other potentially conscious-altering substances had been consumed by any of us, the entire day. We pointed out to each other several moving points of light, at different times, that appeared to be satellites (we see quite a few of those out here). Then one of us spotted what he thought was another satellite. We all looked, and at first it appeared similar to the previous satellites we had seen, ie. a small point of light moving at a constant rate of speed, similar to that of a satellite. But then it began to move erratically instead of following a smooth, straight orb. It zigzaged and curved back on its path, and seemed to slow down and speed up, following the type of non-pattern you might walk if you were looking for something you had dropped in the grass, if you weren't sure where you had dropped it exactly. We discussed it, trying to think of anything that might produce such movement. After meandering about in this fashion for several minutes, the point of light just winked out. Not a gradual trailing off into the distance, but *poof* it was gone, completely. We all saw it... and none of us have never seen anything like it. I would guess the time to have been sometime between 9:45 - 10:15 pm, on July 28, 2002.

I know the difference between what I'm seeing out here, and a shooting star or meteor.  These lights are clearly objects that are very far away and moving more slowly then shooting stars and they are barely perceptable, where a shooting star is very bright.  the objects move quickly though for the distance that they appear up in space.An aircraft that is only a few miles up from earth travels fast across the sky but airplanes that are higher up would not move as fast as the unidentified objects I have observed.  There is a military base in Pensacola of course but airplanes have flashing lights and this light does not blink.  Also, these objects appear to be much higher up in the sky then any aircraft I've seen.

These may have been seven spotter or escort planes accompanying a much larger craft in a modified, yet very structured V formation.  The five smaller objects, with one red light each, fanned out evenly spaced to the side and behind the larger craft left wing. The larger craft appeared to have only white light(s).  On the right side of the larger craft were only two other objects (also with one red light each) replicated the same pattern and spacial distance as noticed on the other side of the craft.  The five objects on the larger craft's leftside (as well as the other two on the right side), each had one bright red light which flashed once (for approximately one second -- much like an airport runway strobe but slower)) in a sequential fashion from the lead object back to the last and then repeated this same sequence as it continued across the night's sky. It began in the northen sky and seemed to cruise at what would be a normal commercial aircraft speed for that altitude taking appoximately 1min/30sec to cross from the norhern most horizon to the southern most horizon. The sound was a gentle whisper and appeared to defy what might have seemed a normal audible sound for so many aircraft. My friend began watching almost immediately after I spoted this unusual formation.  She did not distinguish 8 separate objects, but felt that it was one composite.  My engineering background and practical mind convinces me it must be eight craft in total, although I could not see eight separate craft.  Is there some practical explanation or answer for this type of formation? ((NUFORC Note:  Time was corrected by witness to 22:10 hrs.; we have amended the time here.

I then asked air traffic control if they were aware of any aircraft in the area, and they said that there was nothing in the area either on radar or know of. We observed them for at least one minute, possibly close to two minute. They appeared as very bright white objects followed by a very long trail. The trail appeared to be about ten times the length of the object. The trail seemed to be illuminated, almost phosphorescent in color. The objects seemed to be brilliant white in color, and I felt I could see one or two individual white lights for a split second on the second object.

Also the light stayed in the same place, every so often jerking to one side or the other or up and down. I looked around and observed an identical light in the western sky with the same movements. We watched for about 1/2 hour and they stayed in the same position. My wife went to bed and I continued to read.

After about another 1/2 hour these two lights suddenly moved at an extremely fast speed toward the western light and when they neared it they disappeared.

I feel very stupid about this, I am not a UFO buff. At around 10:30 last night at my work place which is located as you leaveSuperior going east towards Ashland WI, I was outside in the large field looking at the first clear night of stars in a long time.   I have to admit that I was kind of wondering if I would see something strange in the sky. Almost directly above my head  I saw three dim, but clear lights, (they appeared to be stars, solid white)  moving across the sky in a triangle pattern. They did not move in a totally even pace but constantly normalized themselves in what appeared sort of like a stuttering action so that they kept in a basic triangle formation.  They continued moving in the same direction for approximately one minute and covered about half of the night sky or a little less.  After the minute or so the first one in formation just kind of shrunk and pinched out of sight and the other two did the same once they reached the point in the sky where the other one had pinched out.  The pattern they had been moving in was one of the three leading the other two which took up flanking positions in the rear.  It was like a triangle being led by one of its points. Two things keep me looking at the skies Ever since fourteen or so I have kind of wondered if I would see something in the sky strange because my friend and I had seen a star, solid white, move across half the sky over about two minutes and then just all of a sudden without stopping it just changed directions and went back the other way across the whole sky.  He and I both witnessed this and we talked about the details again recently. I believe it was that same year, 14,  (i am 24 now) when I had a dream that there was one of those aliens that you always see in movies like 'fire in the sky'.  I had been sleeping in the basement while the rest of my family slept on the second story of our house.  The way the dream went was very strange.  I remember kids were playing with a ball of some sort and then a door to my left opened and one of those aliens was behind it.  The strange thing is that the dream faded away and I was in my basement and one of those things was just standing in the dingy doorway to my basement at the foot of the stairs.  I did not believe I was dreaming at this point.  I tried to hold myself up from my bed, and resolved that I was going to fight this thing.  Then it just went black.  I woke up on my bed with my legs hanging off and my blanket on the ground.  I ran up the stairs and I noticed that the side door lock which went directly to the basement was broken and hanging upside down on the door.  I didn't sleep for a couple weeks after that except sparingly in an armchair. ((name deleted))  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness may have observed three satellites, possibly the U. S. Navy N. O. S.

I went outside to sneak upon her.  As I was approaching her I looked up to the North and saw two airplanes, one flying South and banking East to make an approach to Mitchell airfield.  The other was much higher and heading North West leaving behind it a vapor trail.  Immediately upon fixing my eyes on those airplanes I saw a small circle shaped grayish colored object streak across the sky in a Westerly direction.  I tried to get my wife to see it but she looked toward the direction of the airplanes and discounted what I had to say.  With my eyes fixed on this new object I walked around the back of the cars to get a better look.  This object was flying in a straight line, and the only noise I heard was from the first airplane which was on approach.  The UFO was smaller than either airplane and was traveling quite fast.  Also, it was not leaving a vapor trail.  As this object was flying away to a point West of my location it suddenly started to turn, but I didn't notice a banking movement as with the airplane.  It started making complete counter clockwise circles along the same altitude it was flying, and I made a mental note of how small the flight radius was for such a fast speed.  Well, within a few seconds there appeared a second object, and then a third and a forth.  They were all flying in counter clockwise circles stacked over the same airspace separated by altitude.  The objects were going in and out of view as if they were reflecting off of the sun and then not and then reflecting again.  I estimate watching this for about five minutes when my eyes became strained from the sunlight and I desperately wanted to go get the video camera.  So I went inside and got the camera but when I went back outside I could not find the objects anymore.  There were no news reports of any unusual flying objects.

I was driving at about 20 miles per hour in a heavily populated suburb of Utica, N.Y. at about 10:15 pm. My 36 year old husband who is a printer with an associates degree in advertising and a U.S. Army veteran of Operation Just Cause in Panama, and my 8 year old son who is a bear in Cub Scouts and a third grader this year, were with me as we were coming home from a family reunion. It was quite humid and there were lighting strikes which lit up the sky. As I was driving along , I winessed two flashing lights on an object which was hovering above the patch of road ahead of us. I slowed down even more, and asked my husband and my son if they could see what I was witnessing. They immediately saw the object. My husband said that the green flashing light on the left, and the red flashing light on the right appeared to be about 20 feet apart. The object simply hovered, and was absolutely silent. We had our windows down and our Dodge van is in good repair and is very quiet. We could not hear the soar of a plane or the whirring, buzzing sound of a helicopter.We immediately reported this sighting to the Marcy substation of the New York State police. The dispatcher called our house later to report that upon reporting the sighting to the local police, she was told that there were no other sightings. She agreed with me that the object was unlikely to have been a military maneuver since it was operating over a very densely populated area, and had it been a private craft of some sort , it would have been very foolish to be operating a private plane of some sort, given the lightning strikes we were experiencing. Moreover, had a private craft of some sort been simply been remaining still and silent, it would have in a very short period of time, crashed.My son saw a domed shape above the lights that was illuminated by the lightning behind it to the west.The area in question was in an area to the west of Utica New Yo! rk and s outh of the New York State Thruway.

VERY STRANGE I was with my girlfriend, we were walking across the street - it was one of the first days of the warmer weather in the summer so while enjoying the night I looked up at the sky before getting into my car.  I noticed I strange redish-orange light blinking in the sky.  I poked at my girlfriend at pointed at what I was seeing in the sky and she freaked out when I said it could be a UFO.  We turned our heads and browsed the rest of the sky noticing there were two other identical lights flashing in the sky.  They all had the same characteristics - they would move suddenly, then flash the redish-orange color.  No other colors were witnessed.  The two seemed to pair up, and then move in a strange manner across the sky - one that I believe convential aircraft could not make.  I can almost best describe it as a zigzag motion.  The third object continued on it's past in the opposite direction until it too was out of site.  No sound was ever hear from any of these lights.  The first two seemed to be relatively far away, but the third object did not appear to be a great distance from where we were standing.  Strangely, neither one of us heard anything from that object either. The most intersting part of this experience was yet to come.  We drove down the road briefly to go and get some ice cream from the grocery store down the road.  We we came back to my home, we drove down to the end of the road where it is a dead end and you can turn your car around.  On the way back up the road towards my house we were looking in the sky to see if we say anything.  Within just a minute my girlfriend pointed her hand up at the sky and so I pulled the car over.  We both saw what could be best decribed as an object of some sort, what now more clearly appeared to be a red flashing light, with a steady white light.  My girlfriend is insists that the object was triangular shaped with the white light on the top, red light on the bottom.  We drove, pulled over, and watched the object until it was out of sight.  Interestly enough a couple other red lights, with white flashing lights came into site by the end of this - there was an obvious distinction between the two sets of lights.  Small planes are easy to pick out in the night sky, the patterns of red, and flashing white lights on the wings is normal for this area.. but I must say whatever I saw tonight did not appear to be of the norm, althought I cannot be for sure.  All I am now left to do is wonder..",2002-06-12T00:00:00,41.0222,-74.3317

These lights repeated so fast that they appeared to be ""sparkling"". I tried to count the number of lights and made and estimate of 7 or 8.

After about 45 minutes of watching airplanes and stars, it was a very clear night, we noticed a light in the sky above and to the south of a car that was at the other end of the parking area. It was very low in the horizon and apeared odd because it was yellowish in color and had no strobe lights. We watched it for about five minutes and it just remained motionless. I got out my video camera and tried to get it to focus on the object and it began registering. After a minute or two of trying to get it to focus the car at the other end of the parking lots lights came on and I video taped a very good point of view of what looked like and at what altitude it was. After about a minute the cars lights went off and the camera couldn't focus on the image so I walked down to the car. The gentelman that owned the car came walking down from the coastal wall and I asked him if he knew what that was thinking that perhaps they to where also star wathching. He did not know what it was and when I told him I had been watching it for over ten minutes he said that seemed very odd and began whathing the object with me. I once agin tried to get the object to focus in my video camera and succeeded in zooming to around 45x and taping the object for over five minutes. In this time it became very bright, changing colors from a yellowish white to red and shades of green and at one point seems to apear as two lights. It then faded so low that I could no longer tape it so I began looking for it. It now was blinking with small soft white and red lights and almost looked like an airplane. The gentelman that was watching it with me had gone to take pictures and came running back and asked if I noticed that it was now blinking and moving. He also said "" what a good way to desguise your self"". the object then slowly moved towards the shore slowly and then stoped moving and blinking and got very ! bright a gain. I again tried to zoom in on it and got the camera to focus and then hit record. As I whatced it through my viewfinder I now saw two lights and it seemed to be moving away from me, south, now. I then noticed a third light and the object now took the shape of a triangle and seemed to be banking. It then faded out agin. I looked at it and it began blinking again and had changed it's direction and was now traveling north and slowly kept droping, like it was making a stair patern, untill it got so low you could no longer see it. I went back to my car and watched the tape. When I came to the point that I had recorded all three lights on the object something must have malfuntioned on my camera and nothing had recorded from that point. I was pretty bumend out because this was the best part of the video and as we sat wondering what went wrong the object appeard again in the same spot it origonally started at, altough it was now lower int the horizon. I began taping as it slowly moved away from us twoards the south and the ocean. I have video of it once again just hovering in the horizon. It got very dim and then slowly moved strait down twoards the horizon and disapeard. After about thirty seconds it lit up again, still on the horizon, and then began to rise. It once agin hoverd. Then a second and third object apeard. They all hoverd for a moment and twinkled brightly changing color from yellowish-white to red and then all slowly lowered down and disapeared when they hit the horizon again. After trying to get my camera to focus on the light show for a few minutes with little sucess other then a few frames that show the lights hovering in the horizon we decided to drive down the coast to see if we could get a better look. we traveled a couple miles down the coast and could no longer see the objects so we turned around and traveled back. We came to another parking area and pulled in and there was now one single light hovering in the same spot. It once agin droped to the horizon and disapeared and then reapear! ed and r ose once agin untill finally dispearing at around 12:30. We waited a few minutes and finially went back to the room. I will submit portions of the video along with stills to this sight.

The object appeared to be 100 feet above the mountains flying up and across. When I first noticed it it appeared to be in the shape of a box and not very big (about the size that a small private plane might look at that height). As soon as I saw it it tried to show it to my family. As I was pointing where to look (taking my eyes off of it for a moment) it changed shape (from its movement I believe) to a round bottem cup shape without the handle (the round section being at the top). I lost sight of it after looking away the second time to try and point it out to my family. The sighting only lasted about 30 seconds. The craft(?) was not in a hurry really but seemed to be just crusing around. I don't know how it disappeared (fast or vanished) for I lost sight of it after looking away for just a second. I am a Baptist Pastor and do not believe in little alien dudes with buggy eyes and green heads...However I do know that what I saw was not anything I have ever saw or heard of in my 42 years on this planet.

These lights were in a line formation, with 2 closer on the left and the other 4 on the right staggered. I contacted other pilots on the UNICOM frquency, 122.80 MHZ, and it was confirmed.

Now, i am very aware that the area i am describing is known for military firings and that it is the likely answer, but what i do not understand is how these objects were able to hover. Because it was a near full moon, a harvest moon nonetheless, i could clearly tell that they were not boats, and they did not have aircraft lighting. Also, there were no boats in the area that they, if they were some kind of flare,could have been launched from. And they dimmed out in sequence almost perfectly.

""It’s certainly possible to see a meteor during the day if it’s large enough or bright enough,"" said Charles Schweighauser, professor of astronomy and physics at the University of Illinois at Springfield. ""I have seen one during the day, in the evening, years ago. It’s not terribly common, but certainly it’s not impossible."" Reports of the meteors flooded the 911 dispatcher’s office about 4:15 p.m. The calls came primarily from residents of Springfield’s east side and eastern Sangamon County, according to Springfield police Sgt. Kevin Keen. ""At first they thought it was a joke until more and more calls began coming in,"" he said. ""We’re keeping our eye out for anything. None have been confirmed yet."" A spokesman for the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office said there were no reports of damage from the falling space dust. Commonly referred to as shooting stars, meteors are tiny particles that orbit the sun and typically are no larger than a grain of sand. The particles are called meteoroids once they enter the Earth’s atmosphere. They become visible, rarely for more than a few seconds, because friction between the particle and air molecules creates a blue or white glow.

I have habituated myself into driving out in the desert to simply be still and gaze up at the milky way, which is brilliant out here, contemplate and be privileged with frequent 'shooting stars'. Well, on the night on may 10, I got much more than expected! At about 1 AM a meteor streaked across the sky; and as I was looking in its direction I rested my glance on a dark patch of sky into which it disappeared. A few short moments later a light appear in the dark patch. Based on appearances it looked like any other star, but then it began to pulse:bright, less bright; bright less bright, it continued in this rythmn for about 2-3 minutes then began to move from its location WSW sky(from my perspective) to ESE sky. It was VERY high in the sky and had no accompanying noise until a 45 degree angle was formed with me being the crux. In other words, if I stretched out my arms at a 45 degree angle and extended the lines in the sky, that was where the noise was relative to the 'ship'. Perhaps 5 to 10 minutes later another streak painted the sky and disappeared into darkness. I waited and sure enough a light appeared and then began to pulse. What's more is out of my peripheral vision I noticed another pulsing. It appeared as if the two were communicating because when one would pulse the other refrained and vice versa. Again the incidences were in the WSW sky and started to move ESE. Two more occurences happened in the same way witht the correlative streaking prologue to the pulsing. The sixth event happened as before except there was another light which necessitates a brief explanation. Imagine a cloud in the sky with a bright light behind it resulting in a fuzzy light. This fuzzy light looked as if it was lower in the sky than the others but ascended straight up at an incendiary pace then disappeared. The sixth light began to pulse and the seventh light appeared in the NWN sky and these two began the 'conversation'. The sixth started its migration to the ESE sky and the seventh began its travel to the NEN sky. I followed them both until they were out of sight. When these things appeared as lights they were the color of a star-whitish blue, but the pulsing was red. This red light seemed as if it rolled across the width? length? of the object. Perhaps it had wings or was triangular in shape and had alternating red lights on both ends? The actual shape was too difficult to discern as there was a new moon. It is important to include Luke Air Force Base is les than thrity minutes away by car. Perhaps they were taking a few Stealth Bombers out for a night trek? Can the stealth hover?

My immediate reaction was that it had to be an aircraft, but when it suddenly stopped on a dime, and stayed in one place, my changed very quickly about what I was seeing. I wanted to go tell my sister, but was afraid it would go away, and I'd miss what it would do next. I waited then, and it then started moving in a straight line to the east, from it's stationary position I seen it move to. It was then I knew I better get my sister, so at least someone else could see this. My sister came out in time to also watch this dimly lit white object continue to move, more rapidly now in a straight line to the east. This thing was definitely going MUCH faster than any commercial airliner, or Air Force jet ! We watched it getting farther to the east, when suddenly it stopped ! -- and I mean it stopped on a dime, too... about 10 seconds of sitting there, it then started moving back towards us (southwest), but this time it was moving slower....it moved towards us for about 15 seconds, then turned around and started going east again ! It continued at the same slower speed (but still very fast for any flying craft we have - or at least anything to our knowledge that we have).....It kept going this time, moving eastward till we couldnt see it anymore. We waited around 10 mins. for it to come back, but it didnt, and it was a very hot humid night here in Houston, anyway. I went at got the binoculars and will keep them outside from now on. I have a feeling that whoever was contolling this thing, they know they could really go faster than the speed we seen it move..... :) I hope anybody else seen this last night will also come forward.

I am a female, 27 years old, and I am a field installer for telecommunications. I live in Eastern Kentucky about six miles outside of a small town with a population of about 3200.  The place I live at is a rural area with wooded hills surrounding the house I live in with my husband.  At approximately 1:00 a.m. on the morning of Tuesday, April 16, 2002 I walked outside onto my front porch to bring my cat inside.  It was a cool night but not cold and the sky was very clear.  The stars were bright- no clouds.  I glanced up in the sky to the left of my house which would be east and an object flashing in the distance and above the trees on the hill caught my eye.  At first I thought it was an airplane but almost immediately dismissed the idea when I noticed that it was not moving across the sky like an airplane would but rather it was sort of bouncing around a bit and moving erratically.  What also startled me was that it was flashing different colors.  At first it appeared light blue then would change to white and then green and then reddish.  It appeared round in shape and small.  I watched in shock for about two minutes as it hovered and moved around in the same spot in the sky, flashing and appearing different colors.  After I realized that it couldn't possibly be a star or an airplane or helicopter the thought occurred to me that I should call someone and get them to come over and see this.  I thought that if I was the only one to see it no one would believe me when I told them about it.  So I called my friend who lives about one and half miles away and told her what I was seeing and asked her to come over and bring her video camera.  My husband was gone at the time.  She arrived in about six or seven minutes and we stood in the yard and videotaped the object for about twenty eight minutes.  The object would just hover in one spot at times and then move around erratically all the while flashing and seeming to flash different colors.  But it stayed in the same general area to the east and above the sa! me tree line.  It appeared far away so the shape was hard to make out but upon viewing the video footage later in slow motion it appeared to be round.  During the time that we were filming my husband returned home and watched it also.  It never left our sight the entire time but watching it through the camcorder it could only be seen when it flashed white or light blue.  We were all amazed and could not figure out what it was.  When we decided we had enough footage of it my friend and I decided that we needed to get her adapter that allows playback of the videotape in a VCR that she had left at home so we left to get it and when we returned to my house it was gone.  We have watched the video footage of it over and over again and still can't figure out what we have seen.  When it is watched in slow motion the movement of the object is much more visible and unbelieveable.  It also appears to change shape and color as it zig-zags around.  We have never witnessed anything like this before.  I am a very open-minded person and have always believed other stories of sightings but I never thought I would see something like I saw.  I would love an explanation of what I saw that night.  But I know that it can't be dismissed as simply an airplane or helicopter or the like.

It still maintained its pattern of movement; slightly vertical and slightly horizontal, and would periodically flash blue and red. We don't believe it could not have been an airplane, since it was hovering in position; a plane would have visibly moved across the sky, rather than moving slightly in place. I went into the house and got our video recorder, and we taped the object for 10 minutes or so, zooming in as much as 32x. Through the zoom on the recorder, we could see it growing in size and then shrinking suddenly, as if it were ""pulsing"". We taped our house and lights visible from the World Trade Zone for reference. After 10-15 minutes we went back inside. 15 minutes later I went back to look for the object and it was gone.

I would like to report a sighting of two star-like objects heading southeast this evening at 20:20 over Lakewood, CO. My wife confirmed this sighting by cell phone from a separate location and I spoke to a man at a convenience store who also witnessed it as it happened. Would Peterson AFB or Norad be able to confirm this sighting on radar? Here is a complete description of the sighting. As I drove west of Denver on Hwy 6 at about 20:20 Mountain time on 4/17/02, I was looking at the western sky at dusk to see if I could observe an astronomical event of planets aligning (see astronomical bulletins).  As I looked up again I noticed two star-like lights traveling at what appeared to be a very high altitude and very high rate of speed (above 200 mph at least).  They had no blinking lights but were apparently luminescent.  They remained equidistant apart and were traveling in a southeast direction.  I happened to be on my phone with my wife, who was traveling on I-25 North (about 10 minutes from where I was)at the time of my sighting.  I told her about it and then pulled over to get gas and get out of my car to look at it.  I saw the lights continue Southeast so I yelled over to a man getting out of his truck and asked if he could see these objects.  He stated he could.  I asked him if he knew what they were and he stated that he did not know.  He appeared interested and then went into the convenience store.  I started pumping gas and called my wife again and asked if she could see the lights.  She responded that she could and she pulled off the highway to get a better look.  She stated that they continued on their way in a southeastern direction at a constant rate of speed and distance apart until out of sight.  My reaction during the sighting was one of calm surprise and excitement to confirm it's existence with my wife.  I was also excited that my wife would take notice of something like this at the end of the day going home from work.

This road is remarkable for the fact that it is in a neighborhood that was depopulated as the airport grew.The road is closed to thru traffic and blocked, although accessable on foot.It was dark and we carried a flashlight. No one that we knew of was on the road.We were able to see and hear the approach of about three passenger jet planes as we walked. Each plane was clearly visible and fairly well into descent as we saw them. There were distinct intervals of time between each air approach when the windless quiet of the night resumed. In other words the traffic wasnt ""stacked up"". It was during one of these interludes that everyone in the family heard the sound of something up above us.The sound was of something clearly moving thru the air,BUT!!! there were no lights no engine or jet sounds... nothing but this sound. I want to emphasize that there was no natural wind activity in the area. Everyone was perplexed and at a lost for explanation. There were two events of this nature. At the end of this section of road an airport police squad car was parked.We are wondering if anything like this has ever been reported. We are stumped. We know all of the noises and effects associated with planes overhead in this area,as we have walked it before. ((NUFORC RESPONSE TO WITNESS)) Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),  Thank you very much for the report!  Yes, what you report has been reported to us before...I believe you heard the turbulent vortex activity generated by the tip of an airplane wing.   When airliners land, using a relatively high angle of attack on approach, the air on the bottom of the wing ""leaks"" around the tip of the wing.  This continuous process generates a ""tornado"" at the tip of the wing, which persists in the atmosphere for a long period of time.  The twisting air can be heard at ground level, and it is quite prominent in a calm sky.  That is only a theory, but I suspect that if you return to the same location, you can experience the same effect.  Thank you for sharing the information with our Center!

My house faces north across the bay in Bellingham proper. Because of the city light pollution only a few of the brightest stars were out by this time, and quite dim. That is why I saw the object at once, it came over the roof of a house low on the north horizen. It was an extremely bright point of light, yellowish white. As it approached it became brighter. I am not good with the luminosity scale but it was definitly twice as bright as any of the planets or Sirius, and moving across the horizen quite fast. I assumed it was a satallite, although I have never seen one moving so fast, and fenitely never seen one so bright. As the object passed my position and began to move south, I noticed the trailing edge seemed to tail out slightly. The color or appearance did not change--it looked like a very, very bright star, moving very quickly. As soon as it passed over head I ran inside to get my roomate to see what he thought. In the 10 seconds it took me to run inside and get back out with him it was far to the south, still moving quickly. To the south lie mountains, but our view was abscured by rooftops. Before it dissapeared over them the object faded from extremely bright to very dim, and then faded from view. Chris (roomate) said it must have been a satallite, but I am not so sure. It faded from view a fair ways above the horizen. When I noticed it, it was just barely above the horizen to the north across the bay, and was extremely bright. When we saw it fade from view it was not even close to the horizen to the south, of which I am sure; the rooftop of our house is far above it and we were standing out in the front lawn. Perhaps the twilight can explain that behavior. I only make the report because of the extreme brightness and speed, I do not think a satellite could reflect so much light. The Space Station perhaps?

As they got near downtown they began to move in motions of lazy turns, banks and doublebacks like seagulls, at random and not in formation, and not like any planes I've ever seen.  The front of the craft had half a dozen white lights.  There were no other lights and no sound was heard.  I used an 8x eyepiece to get a better view. The rear of the craft was square so the whole thing appeared to be an obtuse triangle with the large angle at the nose.  The craft appeared black.

Their size appeared to be about twice as big as a large commercial plane.  After a few minutes they moved slowly off to the northwest and disappeared in the haze.

After watching it move for about 30 seconds or less, it disappeared from view, either suddenly stopping, or extinguishing lights (if it had lights), or for some other unknown reason. As stars do not move like this, conventional aircraft do not exhibit these characteristics, and asteroids/comets etc. do not suddenly begin movement from being stationary, this - to us at least - was a flying object that we could not identify. ((RESPONSE TO WITNESSES)) Dear((deleted)) Family,  Thank you very much for your report!  I found it particularly interesting, in that I, too, sometimes find myself in the Cascade Mountain passes, gazing at the beautiful night sky.  My first suspicion is that you may have observed a satellite that ""flew"" into the Earth's terminator, a.k.a. the shadow behind the Earth.  When satellites fly into that shadow, they disappear from the sight, given that they are no longer being brightly illuminated by the Sun.  I suggest that you watch the sky again in the near future, to see whether you can observe a similar phenomenon.  If you do, please let us know, since we would like to ""flag"" the report to let the readers know what caused the sighting.  It is only a guess, on my part, but we have handled MANY reports of satellites, and yours is certainly not inconsistent with a satellite sighting.  Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!  Cordially,  Peter Davenport ((END RESPONSE))",2002-05-14T00:00:00,,

Looking at your site, I do not see this account posted so please review - The UFO sighting took place at about 11:30 am in the morning.  It was a clear July day with, zero clouds, and a bright blue sky.  My boy friend and I were playing near the foot hills when we notices a gray object hovering at about 8000 feet above us.  We thought that it was a weather bloon.  It was not moving around and just seemed to stay in one place.  As we watched it, the object, that appeared round from our point view, rotated on its axis, so that we could see that it had the shape of a saucer.  It was gray in color with no flashing lights, noise, or windows that we could see or hear.  We had to use one hand to block the sun from our view.  The saucer shaped object then started to move slowly towards the West.  We ran to some of our neighbor's homes and asked them to come out and look at the object.  The object moved slowly West until it appreared to be over the city of Orem (about 2 to 3 miles from our homes).  The object then accelerated North at a extreme speed, up over Mount Timpanogos and out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

PD)) Mystery shrouds IOP's floating orb ((BEGIN COPIED ARTICLE FROM CHARLESTON, SC, POST AND COURIER)) Thursday, June 13, 2002 BY GLENN SMITH Of The Post and Courier Staff      ISLE OF PALMS-When a giant silver orb washed up in front of her rented beach house Monday night, Marie Segneri wondered for a moment if aliens had landed in the middle of her family reunion.      The smooth, metallic ball was at least 3 feet in diameter and weighed a couple hundred pounds or more. Aside from a series of numbers stamped on its slightly dimpled surface, the sphere offered few clues as to its origin.      ""It looked like it may have been in the sea for awhile, but we just had no idea what it was,"" said Segneri, a vacationer from Tampa, Fla.  Segneri's family wasn't alone. A parade of authorities from local, state and federal agencies examined the odd ball Wednesday. All came away scratching their heads.      ""Strange,"" said Isle of Palms Fire Chief Ann Graham, shaking her head.  ""We're calling it a UFO - an unidentified floating object.""      Two Segneri family members first spotted the sphere Monday afternoon when the sun glinted off its surface as it bobbed in the ocean. Thinking it was giant beach ball or a stray buoy, they swam out to grab it.      ""We tried to push it toward shore, but it was just too heavy, and we had to let it go,"" said Tony Segneri, Marie's nephew.      The ocean eventually coughed up the ball later that day. Someone called authorities about the sphere, and the town sent a firefighter to investigate. A decision was made to leave it there and take another look when the sun was up. But when firefighters returned, it was gone.      That's because Segneri stumbled across the silver sphere while walking along the beach that night with her nieces and nephews. Concerned that it was a hazard to children, her relatives pushed the sphere up a ramp from the beach and deposited it in the dunes in front of their Ocean Boulevard house, where it became something of a curious lawn ornament.      ""We just didn't know what to do with it,"" she said.  Unable to determine what it is was and tired of looking at it, the family called police Wednesday. In no time, the area was roped off with yellow tape and official-looking people were crawling all over the sphere.      The Segneris had planned to spend the day visiting local sights, but instead cracked sodas and pulled up lawn chairs to watch the action from their back porch. In the course of the afternoon, police, firefighters, the Air Force bomb squad, Coast Guard personnel and an inspector from the state Department of Health and Environmental Control came to examine the orb, which was parked on the ground beside a barbecue grill.      Various people poked, rubbed, studied and photographed it. They contacted agencies such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but no one claimed ownership.      The Coast Guard's best guess was that the sphere was some sort of flotation device used in a dredging operation. But the ball had no hooks or clamps where a line might be attached to hold it in place, Graham said.      Finally, at about 4 p.m., crews hauled the sphere to the town's public works department for safe keeping. In the process, the orb cracked in half along a seam. No little green men came out, just some old seawater.      ""There was nothing green, nothing glowing,"" Graham said. ""It will probably just go to the scrap yard.""

I got cold (actually I got bored) and went back into the house.  A few minutes later he stuck his head in the door, and said ""you gotta come see this!"" His eyes were bulging out of his head so I thought maybe I should go.  He pointed to what looked like 2 VERY bright stars.  One higher than the other. They sorta looked like other group of stars to me, so I said ya, what about them?  He said ""MY GOD, THEY ARE MOVING"".  I took a better look and sure enough they were not moving like a plane would, but more like floating and floating very fast. They were both moving at the same pace, one was higher than the other.  They were moving from north west to south east.  It only took say 30 seconds to move from one side of the sky all the way to the other side.  Then all of the sudden the bottom one disapered, right while I was watching! Then within 2 seconds the top one just vanished.  Where they were floating it was perfectly clear skys. There were several airplanes in the area, so we could compare movement and lights.  These were very different.  The light was so intense, especially for as high as they were, Like I said when we first saw them they looked the same size and as far away as the stars.  Only these were brighter. And the way they just seemed to float or, I don't even know how to explain it exactly. It was just so different.  And they were in perfect harmony with each other. It was 2 crafts, not one with two lights. Well, it was quite a site that we will never forget.  To bad neither one of us thought to swing that telescope around and have a better look.

The objects were moving far too quickly to be airplanes. I saw the first object moving by itself very quickly toward my direction and then it veered off in a northerly direction. A few minutes later I spotted two more objects of exactly the same quality and size moving very quickly but always remaining the same distance apart. I called my roommate outside so I'd have at least one other witness. He and I both watched the two objects quite clearly for about 45 seconds. He went back inside when the objects disappeared behind one of the few clouds in an otherwise unusually clear night sky. The strange thing about these two objects was that they never re-appeared on the other side of the cloud as a satellite or airplane would have had to do (at their rate of speed, we figure it should have taken them no more than 10 or 15 seconds to re-appear). I later spoke with one of the local TV weathermen who had mentioned on his weathercast the next night that he had seen these same two flying objects. He told me that he and his son also had seen them disappear behind that single cloud and never emerge on the other side! These were the only two of the total seven objects I eventually saw that did not appear to emit flashing light. Finally, to my amazement, several minutes later I spotted FOUR MORE of the lights (craft?) traveling in a different part of the sky and going in a totally different direction from objects 1 and objects 2 and 3.

I was driving at the time, heading south, and was on a road with very little traffic, so I could speed up and try to get closer to it.

The lights were coming from the back of the craft and there were no lights on the front.  There was a less bright light above the two, creating a triangle of three lights.

Having missed going outside shortly after sunset we were pontificating which of the bright stars could possibly be planets.  There came a bright light coming from the south and moving at a very, very fast pace towards the southwest.  We only observed the light for about two to three long seconds.  It could very well have been a meteorite but we all agree that there was enough evidence to discredit it being a meteorite.  If it were a meteorite there would be so many coincidences, making this one of the most abstract, obscure, and simply rare metorites ever documented.  In fact the only evidence that could sunstantiate it being a meteorite are the facts that it had a very short duration, and moved at a rapid speed. The light came from behind us.  It seemed to come from nowhere the way that is common with meteorites.  I should add here that to the south,not even seconds before we observed the light, we were commenting on the number of aircraft were in the area.  There were anywhere between five and ten aircarft flying around directly south of us, again the same direction the light came from.  At least three of these aircraft seemed to be flying in almost a triangular formation as if looking for something.  It was only seconds after we made the comment about the aircraft that we observed the light. We are all in agreeance to the following characteristics that we feel differentiate this light from a typical meteorite.  Again, this could all be a rare string of coincidences.  I feel at some point you have too many coinidences and have to look in other areas: 1.  The light had no visible tail as is indicative to most meteors.  It seemed to be a simple ball of light. 2.  The light never faded or quivered in its brightness and intensity.  The light remained the same constant brightness. 3.  The light just disspeared.  One moment it was there, the next it was gone.  This is important because most meteors seem dissapate.  They seem to start bright and slowly fizzle out to nothingness, or at least grow dimmer.  This one just plain vanished, there was no dissapation, it gave no indication to going out, it just vanished. 4.  The light seemed to remain parallel to the horizon, it gave no indication to have downward momentum...it was moving horizontally. 5.  The light seemed to be lower than the aircraft.  It was at least in the troposhere or the stratusphere.  To think that this light was in the ionosphere would have to make it incredibly large.  Also at the rapid speed that it was moving would have made it close to, if not breaking the sound barrier. 6.  Again, the local aircraft seemed to be flying in formation as if looking for something.  This is the same direction that the light was travelling from. 7.  Again noting the size of the light.  Although meteors come in all sizes, this one seemed incredibly large.  If you could imagine a ligt about the size of the tip of your thumb moving across the sky, that would be about the size.  Again, this could be another indication as to how low the light was.  The light was larger than the lights of the aircraft, and to be 30 miles high would make this a massive object. ....The general consensus of our group was that this was not a meteorite.

After flashing the primary object with a flashlite, a object from the south west chased me. At about 10 pm I took our dogs outside . I live on 35 wooded acres, and it is very dark, and farily remote. Walking around the rear side of the house I spotted a craft preforming manuvers that are not possible by any known craft of human design. It was really buzzing around back and fourth, up and down round and round. I watched for about 15 minutes when I ran in and got my wife when I was sure it wasnt going to leave. It was at this time I spotted two additional craft,one north and one southof us. The primary craft was west of me,exactly one mile west of M-52 is where I live and then it was west of that. These two other craft were so far from me I could only tell they were moving, thats all. After a few minutes my wife went in, she's not really interested in UFO's. I had a large flashlight with me as I always go out at night and play fetch with the dogs,they can see; I cant. I took the dogs for a long walk down the road on our property, making sure I left the light off. I did not want to attract any attention to myself away from the house, where I would be a sitting duck if this thing moved closer to investigate the light source. I played with the dogs for about two hours by the next door house light, then returned to the house where I felt very secure and brave. I was 100 yards from our house on top of a small inclined dirt driveway when I let loose with the light in a series of three bursts at regular intervals. After about five minutes of no responce I put the light on the craft of unknown distance for a few moments. This was done for about a minute each time. I did this on three seperate occasions only a few seconds apart. From out of nowhere a bright shimmering lumonious object the size of a house came screaming from my south west on an intersept course,just above the tree tops.My God the size and speed of this thing; I was in total shock!!! I have heard of this happening to other people and thank God I was ready to respond. I was very ready to respond,in fact! I couldnt believe this was happenin! g to me, it was like I was watching a movie. I kept thinking, I will die of a heart attack if this thing catches me. I ran as fast  as I could with both dogs in hot pursute; after I screamed run!!! Thank God in heaven I beat both dogs to the house, scrambling to the saftey inside.I dare say, that would be a record 100 yrd dash;bar none! Hours later I went out by the door I went in , and sure enough at least two of these craft were still malingering. I did this until sun up, no way could I sleep. Ive never been so scared in my whole life, and I am 48 yrs old. To make a long story short If you ever see a craft be damn careful if you try to shine a light on it in hope of a responce. You may just get much more than you bargined for. I did try to call the St.Charles police when the objects were first spotted. They didnt answer, we have a very small town. I told my dad about what happened, former Saginaw Chief of Police Wesley F.Alcorn; he said I should have tried the sherifs office. This never crossed my mind until he mentioned it. This is not the first UFO experience I have had out here, I cant count on both hands and toes how many craft Ive seen out here. This is however the most frightning and serious. I have no doubt whatsoever they would have captured me,were they able! Needless to say I wont provoke another UFO responce ever again, this has been enough to last a life time!!! Isn't there a radar around here that should be picking these things up? Why isnt anyone elce seeing these objects? Does anyone elce in this area have any similar experiences? I cant bee the only night owl. I also cant believe I have been the only one too see these craft.I have been seeing similar craft for at least two years now, but none like this one! I have never reporded a sighting to anyone,until now. These guys are real slick, they dont come at you with the craft your signaling, but send out one your not aware of or cant see to try and capture you. Thank God I knew this and was ready, expecting a encounter from my right or left side. ! It came from my left side. I just hope they dont come back and catch me with my pants down again!",2002-04-25T00:00:00,,

I saw the light again! This time my boyfriend and I were driving up his street when I spotted the light to the north. I have been carrying my spotting scope with me ever since the last incident on April 1st. So I got the scope out and viewed the light through it. I am not sure if it was because I could not keep the scope very steady, but it looked like the craft was almost.... well, plasma. It dropped a red ""flare"" thing just like the last time, but then it dropped some other stuff that was really bright. This time the stuff that it was dropping didn't burn out- it was actually dropping to the ground! Now, the next thing that happened REALLY freaked me out! As I was staring at the light, a second light came from the ground!!!  It floated vertically, and when it got as high as the first light, the first light faded to a dot. Then the second light droppped some bright things, too. But it droppped like 5 things  one after another. All of the stuff it dropped looked like it landed on the ground near some houses!!! (In Lake Havasu City, there are lots of hills and most of the streets are on hills, so if you are on top of a street that is on a good hill,  you can see across to other neighborhoods.)  The first light started to float over to the north more, and went behind the mountains. A few seconds later, the second light did the same thing.  We drove over to where it looked the craft had dropped the things, but didn't find anything. Now I am going to make my boyfriend carry his video camera everywhere we go.

I had several people working with me and I also saw many other venders that I know setting up as well. There were alot of people walking around the area, shopping, eating, and just taking in the scenary. I took out my VHS camcorder and began to talk and film people in the area. At some point I looked up into the sky and noticed it was full of stars. I've always enjoyed looking at the stars and have never seen a more spectacular night than this one. I noticed a ""star"" moving slightly back and forth. I was fatigued this evening from the long drive and other things I had to do that night and at first I thought I was just seeing things. After another look I was sure I wasn't seeing things. I made a comment to somebody standing close to me if they had ever seen a UFO and pointed towar ds the object. His response was ""if that's a UFO..what's THAT?"" and pointed the opposite direction. The star he pointed out was making little circular motions. I began to tell other people in the area to look up while I scanned the sky for other stars. I saw at least 50 other stars making subtle movements. I tried to catch this on video but my camera barely works with good lighting. The only thing I caught on tape was our voices and reaction to the sighting. I watching the stars moving for about 10 minutes and then continued to unpack my supplies and later fell asleep in my jeep. When I woke up the events at the Million Man March had already begun and I was late getting started. I sold out everything I had in just a few hours and never looked up even once that day.

Well, I'm the kind of person that could go either way in believing about extraterrestrials visiting earth. I have a wonderfully vivid and creative imagination and this subject is very exciting indeed. One afternoon on my way back into Austin, Texas, with a friend of mine I happened to look in the sky and noticed a black helicopter going by. This is of interest to me because I know this fellow who believes in conspiracies and what not and as a kind of joke I took a photo of the black helicopter, to light the fire underneath my friends ass so to speak. (I used a canon powershot S200 digital camera). Anyway when I got home and downloaded it I noticed a shiny silver metal object way above the black helicopter. It wasn't until I read this article ""Daylight Photos of UfO's"" that I took my very own picture a little more seriously, I really would like to have someone outside of my circle of friends and family to see them and tell me what they think.  I took this picture on the 17 of June this year around 8:00 pm while traveling down the Devil's backbone (hwy 337 I believe) on the SouthWest side of Canyon Lake (in between San Antonio and Austin). It sure does look alot like the ones on the web site. I did take these pictures from a vehicle and the window was rolled up, as far as I can tell there was no object on the window itself to cause this type of reflection and I had no need of a flash so none was used. post the picture if you'd like but I'd like to remain anonymous.

They were about 100ft above my car, barely high enough to miss the trees. But, what got my attention was that there was no sound coming from them. I also had my windows rolled down, and if there was any sound, I would have heard it, because it was really quiet outside. They were traveling at about 200MPH. Also, the two lights were traveling in a series formation at about 150-200ft apart. Since it was dark outside I'm guessing the color of the crafts body was flat-black, all we noticed was the lights, which were about 1-2ft in diameter. My mother was also observing this from the front passenger seat. This is the first encounter of ufo's we have ever witnessed.

I have a hard time discussing the topic with friends and family. I have had numerous sighting and experiences since I was a child. Last year on the same day on July,07/13/02, I went to sleep in my bed room around 12 A.M. I was laying in my bed watching the television for around a half an hour. Nothing much was on the t.v, so I turned it off and started to close my eyes. The lights were off and the room was pitch black. I was still awake. I want to make it very clear that I was awake and not drifting off to sleep. I've had a real problem falling asleap in the past two years, I've seen a doctor about this. On a usual night I will just lay in bed thinking about the day and things going on in my life. This is what I was doing that night. I all of a sudden felt strange and heard a faint sound, almost like that of a pool filter being on. It was a kind of humming, but not loud at all. I felt nervous and looked out of the window by my bed. Above my roof was a blue light. It changed colors and sizes, yet did not seem to be moving. Still in bed, I tried to get up, but found my body frozen. I could not move. Then suddenly I felt my legs being pulled and my body being moved from my bed. I tried to scream, but I could not talk. I became worried that I would stop breathing. I have never been so scared in my life. The strange thing is that this is all I remember. I regained control over my body and got out of bed and looked out of the window. The light was gone. I glanced over at my alarm clock, andit read 2:30 A.M. Over two hours had passed, but the whole experience felt like only minutes; I am positive that I did not dream this, and know that I was awake the entire time of the occurance. This was not the last time this kind of episode has happended. Only a month ago I had two similar things happen. One was scary as all hell! I was laying in bed ready to fall asleap when a small light, almost like a lighting bug flew by my dresser. ! Then I was frozen and could not move, but I could move my eyes. My head was facing my couch and there I saw "" Myself "" sitting on the couch. I was so stricken with fear, it was so real. I was watching myself from a behind the scenes point of view. I then fell asleep. I've had missing time episodes all of my life, and numerous times I've seen strange moving lights in the sky. One time I watched an unidentified object flying in circles and changing color, I saw it from the raod and followed it to scudder Beach on Long Island. I saw a suffolk county police car parked near by and asked if the officer would take a look. The two of us watched in awe this strange light.  Anyway I thought I would write what has happened in my life. Do what you want with it, draw a conclusion. But the fact is these things happened and scare me.",2003-07-16T00:00:00,40.914,-73.3207

The lights were red, green and white split equally at 120 degrees each with a total width of around 6 feet. We were towing a device at the time designed to detect nuclear submarines at long distances.(This device never heard whatever this was). The light moved from just behind us at around 20 yards to the right then the left and then back as if to be surveying the towed cable that was running behind us. At the time my initial response was that I was not believing what I was seeing. After watching this for about 20 minutes I reported it to the bridge. No sooner had I reported it than it disappeared(almost as if it were listening to me). The report to the bridge brought down the Captain, the chief engineer and the operations officer but the light was long gone by the time they got their and they most likely wrote it off as another young sailor smoking dope on the fantail and seeing things. I never said anything about it after that night but it was definetly unidentified. It is interesting to note that this was in the Bermuda Triangle where so many other strange encounters have occured . At that time I was a young seaman age 19.

It surrounded it, stretched in one direction and stopped!? As my friend and I neared the end of our month-long drift down the Colorado River, we noticed a concentrated illumination going from right to left and stretching halfway across, maybe 300 meters downstream. We speculated it was coming from car headlights, but reminded ourselves we were still quite a ways from a driveable road. Guiding ourselves close to the bank using partially submerged stumps and branches to steer us, we came to an inlet and up on the bank which rose at about 30 degrees we observed an incandescent sphere of light hovering about three feet above the ground and perfectly still. It was somewhere between twelve and sixteen feet in diameter and was no more than 30 or 40 feet away from us on the level ground above the bank. We observed it for the longest six minutes or so and noticed that it appeared perfectly symmetrical and hazily transparent except for an irregularly shaped denser bluish-green core, maybe four feet across and two feet high. We could not see through this portion of the sphere. It made no sound and eerily all sounds on the river (muskrats diving in etc.) seemed to have ceased from when we first noticed the (beam) light. Holding our position right by the bank, I considered the prospect of exiting the boat and walking up to the sphere. Before I actually decided on this, the sphere moved both upwards and backwards in the blink of an eye shot into the clear black sky. I kept my eyes fixed at the point where it had seemed to disappear and within seconds observed an emerald green streak shooting from right to left at about 15-20 degrees. The whole thing lasted only a fraction of a second and we let go of the branches anchoring us we resumed drifting downstream. My friend and I and talked about the event(s) facing each other seated in the boat, he at the bow, I at the back facing foward. It was only minutes later that I observed what seemed to be a bright triangular opening in the sky  at 11 or 12 o'clock and this turned into a widening  bright puff and eventually something similar to a smoke ring before disappearing. I have since come to recognize this as a probable VanDeberg launch which would easily enough date the event exactly as I am only guessing now at the date. I was pointing this out to my friend when suddenly the river came alive with the sound of helicopters. We had now positioned our boat close to the center of the river and though it appeared the craft was flying along both banks, we could not tell how many there were. They were apparently painted in a dark color and try as we could, neither of us could make out any markings on the fanthom shapes. If there were any lights, they were minimal and they used no floodlights or other means to illuminate the area. We did not sleep that night and when the next morning we came across the first riverside business in almost a month, we inquired if anything unusual had been reported the night before, and were told ""nothing.""",2003-07-16T00:00:00,,

One of us, and I do not remember who, it could have been me I am not sure, yelled out, What are they? And pointed to the moon. Three small bright dots were flying east in an upside down ""V"" formation. They came from behind the moon and traveled at a slow speed eastward when the one on the bottom right of the upside down V broke formation and flew back and disappeared behind the moon. We watched the other two fly  east and out of sight. I remember saying that we should tell someone, probably our parents, what we saw. But we decided against it because the date was April 1st and we thought and knew that if we told anyone they would think it was just an April fools joke.

To give some perspective of how this looked to us, see the moon about the size of a quarter and the lights about the size of a small pea.

They were listening to an Oceanside Ca, radio station called KUDE AM, when it reported a huge cigar shaped craft motionless above Oceanside.

It was bright orange almost neon, and appeared to have some sort of structure to the bottom.  several spaces along the bottom were black and square like in appearance.  the radio was reporting that some fishing boats and commercial shipping were reporting the craft to be approx. 1 mile off the Oceanside pier.  after 10 minutes of observing  the craft, 10-15 small craft which were described as looking like bright stars, emerged from the bottom and began flying all around the cigar shaped craft.  This went on for about 6 or 7 minutes, then the smaller craft docked with the cigar shaped craft one at a time.  Then after a few more minutes, the cigar shaped craft began to slowly gain altitude and then as if a light had been switched off, it was gone.

I have been very hesitant to ever talk about this incident over the years because this incident was disturbing and the few I have trusted to share this with have thought it to be ammusing.  We also have had the thought that maybe we saw something that we shouldn't have.  On this evening My wife, mother-in-law,myself, and our two sons went out for a drive, not really going anywhere we found ourselves just north of Pawnee Ok.  I noticed some lights coming from the west side of the road and slowed the car to take a closer look at what I thought was spot lights from a low flying helicopter.  Which in its self was a strange sight for us to see, at first there were two spot lights shining on the pasture as if looking for something.  So I stopped to watch for a moment,  then one light shut off, as it came closer the light was shined upon our car and continued until the object was very close.  At this time the light was turned off and we realized we were observing something not known to us.  It was a very moon lit night and this thing was very large, and very slow moving.  As far as description it had no apparent lights once the spot lights were turned off with the exception of what appeared as some very white small high intensity light that would flash from the left side and zip across the front and flash quickly on the left.  It made no noise and was very visible as it hovered above our car at about 40-50 ft.  It appeared somewhat stealth like in shape with some sort lower level on the belly side.  It had the appearance of metalic structure and was much larger than a home.  Never did it do anything or move in any aggresive manor.  I did not have the nerve to get out of the car but we did watch this thing over us for at least a full five minutes,  another car had pulled up behind us and stopped so I know someone else saw this same thing, but I was shaken by what I was seeing and did not try to talk to them. The final thing that made this so disturbing was several helicoptors came in from the same path and about the same low altitude.  As they approached it started to move to the northeast and within seconds was completely out of sight.  There appeared to be several high flying planes following along the same flight path but this thing moved many times faster than the planes.  I don't know why I have decide to share this now as most people will not beleive it anyway, but we are still bothered by this to this day without resolve of what we saw.  We watch everything that comes on television about UFO's in the hope that somewhere someone will have a picture of something similar but so far we have seen nothing that even remotely resembles this thing.  In my mind it is still impossible for something this large and metalic just to float there, a stones throw above my head for so long and then leave with speed I have never witnessed before.  I can't explain it but maybe there are others that have been witness to something like this and like myself feel they cannot tell anyone. I feel deceived as I beleive someone knows what these things are. ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the other witnesses to submit their respective reports, as well, together with illustrations.

A rounded triangular shape that hovered above my home, almost as if it knew that I had seen it. I yelled for my grandmother to come out and see it, though I was paralized with fear. She was washing dishes and thought I was seeing a low flying jet but I knew that jets just didn't hover and were not as huge. I watched the objet move over an island on the lake that we lived on.

In the summer of 1976 I was working the night shift as an air traffic controller at Lea County Control tower Hobbs, New Mexico.  It was a non-radar tower.  The weather was, ceiling unlimited and visibility unlimited.  A very clear clean air night.  I was in the control tower alone.  There was no air traffic in the area.  Around 23:00 I observed a flash of light that lit up everything for miles around.  It was like someone shot off a giant flash strobe from a very high altitude.  The entire landscape lit up like daylight. Around midnight another controller that was off duty came up to the tower with his girlfriend.  I started to tell him about the flash and he couldn't belive they saw the same thing at the same time.  However they were coming home from Cloudcroft and at the time of the flash they were below the caprock.  The caprock is a shelf of land about 30 miles west of the tower.  He had the same description that I had.  We talked about it and thought it could be something the U.S. Air Force was working on. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) I just re-read your note and found that I did not answer all of your questions.  I was facing North in the control tower but the light lit up everything everywhere.  I lost touch with the other couple after the controller strike in 1981.  But they were driving East and would have been facing East.  They also said it lit up everything in every direction.  Hope this helps. ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

I have not talked about this experience much in my life because its sounds like a little boys dream.   A little history about my family.  I am one of 17 children, 8 older and 8 younger.  This happened one summer morning.  My brothers and sisters slept in the upstairs of the house.  There were 2 rooms, a boys room and a girls room.  The bed I was sleeping in that night was up against the east window. This bed had a old rot iron head board that you could see thru.  I was awakened that morning from a voice that kept saying wake up over and overuntil I was awake and sitting up.  The voice then said look out the window, which was open.   As I looked out the window I noticed that there was total silence.  This time of the morning there are usually chickens, birds and other animals making some kind of noise.  The voice then told me to look up in the sky.  It was pre-dawn and just starting to get light.   As I looked up I noticed a bright star or light about 45 degree from the horizon in the middle of the sky.   As I watched the light it moved verticly down to the horizon then all the way up to the top of my vision, about 90 degree from the horizon.   It then went back to the center of the sky and moved horizontal to the left of my vision then all the way to the right of my field of vision and then back to the center of the sky.  The sun came up then and the light disapeared.  I looked around the room and my brothers were still sleeping.   This experince scared me so bad that I ran down stairs and climbed in bed with my Father and Mother.  My mother woke up and ask me why I was shaking so bad.  I said I had saw something and was scared.   I have often thought about this experience and wondered if I was having a dream or nightmare.  To me this was real and not a dream.  I was awake and aware of what was going on around me.   None of my brothers woke up during this experience and I never mentioned it to them for several years.

The perceived size was larger than a full moon but there was no way we could determine how high it was nor the actual size and speed.

I was leaving my job as 6:00 PM News Anchor at the local TV station.  The street leading away (east) from the station dipped into a severe valley, up the other side and then flattened out for the trip into the town itself.  As I approached the downward (eastward direction) side of the valley I noticed, perpherially, a semi-gloss, silver, saucer shaped object with a slight dome on top.  The dome was one-third the thickness of the saucer which I estimated to be 40 to 50 feet in diameter and (including dome)about 15 to 20 feet tall from the bottom to the dome top.  The bottom of the saucer was flat and unremarkable.  The saucer was traveling from my left to right (north to south) and was following the contour of the valley.  It seemed to be traveling at about 30 miles per hour.  It was totally silent. There were muted red and blue lights circling the perimeter of the saucer.  I could not tell if the entire saucer was rotating or just the light rotating around it. As I approached the bottom of the valley, so did the saucer.  I brought my car to a stop and jumped into a ditch as it looked as if we were going to meet at the bottom. The saucer passed approximately 25 to 30 feet above and to the east of me and blotted out a full moon in the process of following the valley southward toward the Tennessee River and The Power System Service Shops of The United States Tennessee Valley Authority in addition to Wilson Dam, a hydro-electric facility built around World War II.

However, several years later (1969-71) so many saucers were seen ""feeding"" off high voltage power eminating from Wilson Dam that it became a popular thing to go north of Florence a few miles and park to watch the saucers. At the time of my sighting I did not even tell my wife, much less put it on the air for fear of being put away since ""saucers"" were for ""kooks"" only, not respectable News Men.

We observed A red glow ahead. About one mile later we were directly opposit the glow. This is steep mountainous terrain and we were at river level and the glow was on the mountain, which was probably 800 feet high. The glow appeare to be along the top of the ridge line and appeared to be 200 to 300 feet wide. It extended down the side of the mountain for approximately 1/3 of the way to the bottom, which would be approximately 300 feet. It didn't illuminate anything but was a vivid soft red glow. At times there were white lights, about the size and brilliance of the brightest stars; and they would move around the edge of the glow. At times we could hear what sounded like human voices buy could not distinguish words; also, we heard what sounded like metal pounding on metal. At one point a powerful spotlight illuminated us briefly and just a small area around us. The beam came from the top which would have been about 1000 feet. My friend wanted to go into Whitesburg, about 2 miles, and get a friend of ours, who was an attorney, to see what we were looking at. By the time we got back the glow was not as vivid and if I remember correctly we did not hear anymore sound. The glow just kept getting dimmer. Many cars came by and inquired as to what we were looking at. The next day my friend and I traveled to the top of the ridge to see if there were any signs of the activity there were none. It was very rough terrain with many huge boulders and heavily wooded. In order to get to the scene we had to travel a short distance north, cross the river on the highway bridge and walk down a railroas track for about 300 yards to go straight up the hill to the area. After getting back to the railroad track we met a young man who live nearby, about 12 to 15 years old, who had a rifle on his shoulder. We told him what we had seen and was trying to figuer out what it was. He said he knew what it was, a flying saucer. I was a ((employment deleted--federal employee)) at the time and my friend was a Whitesburg business man. The young fellow mentioned above is now, and has been for many years, an attorney practicing in Whitesburg, KY. I happen to meet him several years later, after he became an attorney, and mentioned the scene to him. He told me that at the time we met him on the railroad he was very scared becaus he thought we were from the saucer. Within about one month of this occurence we were traveling toward Whitesburg again, at approximately 10:00 p.m. About a mile closer to Whitesburg one of us spotted strange lights high in the sky, about 80 deg. above the horizion. Due to the movement they couldn't be counted but it looked like 12 to 15 objects. They looked like a very bright stars and was dancing around each other, in an area a little larger than a full moon, very rapidly. In a very short time one started to expand and became slightly larger than fell moon. That was scary because when it started expanding I felt it was going to engulf everything. When it got to the maximun size it appeare that molten material, of the same starlight intensity, was dripping from the edge. While this was going on the small lights were dancing around the large object. This sight also disappeared gradually in the same area. I don't know if anyone else saw this or not. We became avid saucer watchers after this. We would travel to the top on some of our mountains where we had an unobstructed in every direction and spent many hours trying to something else. We never did. I can give names, addresses & phone numbers to legimate persons if they are interested. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This happened on a late Friday afternoon as we were off duty and preparing for the weekend. Guys were packing, showering, rushing around, when all of a sudden some guy says ""good Lord look out your windows"".  So everyone pushed their way to windows and to see a huge gunmetal grey craft just hanging low in the sky near the radar. I'm not good at measurements and distance but it was no more than a football field away. There was no sound coming from the craft and around the edge were colored rotating windows/lights. Everyone who was outside the barracks were just standing transfixed with their mouths hanging open as were those inside looking from the windows. I have no idea how many guys were there I'm guessing at least 100. This event lasted 10 minutes at the most and the craft shot away in a flash. What a buzz of chatter afterwards. Someone who worked at the radar station phoned to see what was going on and to explain what we had just seen. They answered that nothing showed up on the radar and to forget what we just saw and not talk about it. I don't remember much talk about it after the weekend. I never did forget. It was a spectacular sight to see a craft so close in bright daylight and not so easily dismissed by me. The odd thing is that every guy there probably had a camera but they were so transfixed and no one got a photo. You can't tell me they don't exist.",,40.4064,-80.1876

I read of the sighting over Williamsburg, Virginia on November 1 with great interest, as I had a similar experience back in November 1966. Heading east on I-64 from Ashland, Ky to Huntington, WV, I took the(I believe) the 5th Street exit (may have been the 16th Street exit). The exit ramp was uphill to the stop sign at the end of the ramp. It was a weekend night, clear, and little/no traffic. At the top of the ramp, I had the need to relieve myself, so I stopped the car and got out. While in the ""process"" I gazed to the sky. My father, a WWII AF vet, had instilled in me a very high interest in aircraft, space and the like. While standing there, I noticed an a triangular shaped object (almost exactly the same as described in the Williamsburg report) going straight over my car. If I had been holding a basketball at arms length, the craft was larger.  I imagine that the shape was triangular, as there were around 7 to 9 red lights arranged in an error shape, point at the front, or at least the direction the craft was headed. I also noted that there was no sound, and the speed of the craft was just over a hover - very slow. I had no fear, just interest. I noted the craft for approximately 40 to 45 seconds, in which time it was still in close proximity to me - again, it was moving very, very slow. Once I finished my ""business"" I sat down in the car, but did not shut the door. I thought to myself that that thing I just saw was just not acting right. I stepped back out of the car and the craft was gone.  I did not sit in the car any more that 3 or 4 seconds.  I had visibility for at least 5 miles in every direction, but the craft was gone.  Returning home, I told my Dad about the incident, and he said, ""you saw something, but who knows what it was"". The more telling part of the sighting happened the next weekend. My Mother and Father were not living together at this time and I took a trip the next weekend to see my Mom in Oak Hill, WV.  Oak Hill is approximately 85 miles NNE of Huntington. While eating dinner, my Mom began telling me a story about seeing an odd aircraft the preceding weekend.  She and some of her friends were driving from Oak Hill to Charleston, WV, which lies between Oak Hill and Huntington.  Traveling down SRt 61, the road, which is very mountainous, opens up to a wide valley when it comes to the Kanawha River. Upon entering the valley, she and her friends noted an object on the north side of the river, moving SSW, at an extremely slow speed. From the distance they were from the craft (a marble held at arms length, about the same size), she could not determine definite shape or lighting, though she did say she thought the object had a faint red glow.  She and her friends observed the object for a good minute, then the object gained a rate of speed, almost too fast to follow, and almost immediately (from almost zero to bullet speed in an instant) and disappeared from sight.  Two points, (1) I had not told her my story yet and (2)this was the same day/evening I observed the craft in Huntington. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There had been several sightings around Indianapolis during the summer of 1965.   My father came running, with just a towel on.  The whole family tried to see the object, but it darted quickly to the west and disappeared.  I was the only person who really saw the object. When we got to the high school, I was still rattled.

It was huge now and hovering over a swamp. At first my uncle didn't know what to make of the object. He stopped his car which was a 1959 Ramble Station Wagon. He got out and studied the craft which was about 800 yards away. It was saucer shaped emitting a very bright pinkish red light. He could see what looked like bars connecting the two saucers together. In between the bars were windows and he could see aliens inside looking back at him. This terrified him and he got back into his car and sped off for home. The craft was about 1/4 mile off to his left and kept up with his speed. Then my uncle had to turn left and the craft went over his car at that point and out over his farmland. As soon as my uncle reached home he called my father and told his story. We went outside and sure enough in the distance off in the southwest just above the horizon was a red object. My father and I watched it for about 10 minutes until it suddenly disappeared. didn't know what to make of the object. He stopped the car he was driving which was a 1959 Rambler station wagon. He got out of the car and studyed the object. It was emitting a very bright pinkish red light. It was shaped like two discs on on top of the other inverted and connected with what looked to him like bars of metal. To his astonishment there was an area in between the bars there was windows and behind the windows he could see aliens looking back at him. This jolted him back into his car and he sped off the last two miles home. The object kept up with his car and stayed probably a 1/4 mile to his left. He had to turn south at the next intersection and at this point the craft went over him out over his farm land. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested additional reports from the uncle and father.

I was awaken by my father screaming to my brother to get down stairs.  my father and my brother unloaded allmost every rifle we had... 44 mag. rifle, 12 gauge shot gun, 45 cal. cap and ball revolver, 222 rifle, 50 cal. flintlock.  how ever many bullets these would hold is what they shot. the final gun my father reloaded the 45 cal. cap and ball and walked up to them point blank and fired directly into one of the eyes or where the body should be... they never moved.  for all the shells we picked up the next day their was not a stray divit in the ground, no sign that any thing took place.  that was the last we saw of the eyes",2003-03-21T00:00:00,41.381240094339624,-76.82344056603773

As we were sitting on the porch, we heard a humming sound. All three of us looked up and saw a saucer shaped craft hovering above a lamp post. It hovered for a few minutes, then it started to move away at a slow pace. My brothers and I proceeded to follow it, going up a side street by our house. We followed it all the way to a school (# 3) by our home. It landed on the roof of the school, then disappeared. My brothers and myself were back in front of the house, without knowing how we got there. To this very day I cannot remember how we got there. One of my brothers has since passed away, the other brother has been diagnosed with epilepsy. I have been diagnosed with lupus. Is this conincidence, or did something unexplainable happen to us that night? I continue to have vivid dreams of UFO's, cornfields, airplanes, and the like all the time. I watch the Sightings regularly, in hopes of finding someone who has experienced something similar to what my brothers and myself did. I have seen people on the program describing their experiences, and it sounds like they are living my life. It is a very eerie feeling.

They were often moving to each other and back and when a car would drive by they would move toward the cars . I remember the children on the  school bus on the way to work had inspired us to see this odd appearance in the sky. It was often a nighty watch of hours of lights outside in the sky. My sister was older than me. My father said we were only watching weather balloons and would go back inside our home after he would check on our excitement of the nightly lights following each other and at times cars. We became so fasinated with the objects that my mother would start to come home after work and join in observing this strange array of moving lights. One evening has haunted my memory the most. We never usually spoke of the scary experiance after it happened. ..I had run upstairs to get a better view of the lights from the 2nd story window of our rented house. Suddenly the cat jumped off my brothers bed..cows started mooing , every animal in the area made noises of alarm... That was the time a huge saucer shaped ufo appeared out of the sky and was so close I feared for my life. It was very odd and the noise it fineally made was more like a whooping sound very slow and paced. I never forgot the feeling in my heart when it made the noise. My mother and sister never usually talk about it. I was around 13 at the time and am now 42 almost 43 years old. When I asked my mother the other day if she remembered the experiance she even was able to recall the noise. It is something when people look at you if you even whisper you know there are strange saucers in the sky...and you know what you saw. So, all I can do is state to this report today that there were 3 of us. ...We saw it as close as you see your neighbors house if you live next to anyone close... It was spooky and years later when I fineally saw a movie called close encounters I could fineally realize someone else has seen something..The saucer in the movie is larger than what we saw , but almost a perfect match. The lights went around the object making it look like it was spinning. I used to be afraid to be alone....I know that people will one day see something in the sky....and I can only hope they don't have the nightmares I have had in my lifetime. The occourance was one I know will never forget ..it is something that stays with you. I remember the tops of the trees swaying when it passed...Then the saucer shaped thing left as it had arrived...It really was beautiful. But it was also very spooky. I am glad we left the country farm home after that..I am so very glad I now live in a town 5 miles down the road within reach of friendly neighbors. But, on nights I look up and name a star..remembering the time a ufo came to Medaryville, Indiana....and I am so happy I don't live in the country anymore. I never will again..Not after that.

I had been riding a motorcycle most of the day, just following a path on my Grandparents small farm. I was tired and went in to lay down for a little bit before supper. I don't know if I fell asleep or not? I don't think I did. I opened my eyes and looked out the window. There hovering above the trees was what I only knew of as a flying saucer. The only way I knew what it was, was from what I had seen on buggs and roadrunner cartoons. By the way we only got 2 tv channels back then. I jumped up and went to the window. Then I went tearing out of the house to see it, while screaming for my Grandmother to come look. I still remember my exact words(Grandma! Grandma! you got to come see this), I ran out from under the trees to get a better look. It was just hovering there at the tree tops not making a sound. Then just as if someone was standing right by my side I heard a voice say to me (you are not supposed to see this). I never felt so much fear in my young life. Then as my Grandma exited the house and was coming toward me it just raised up about 50 feet and shot off like a bullet. I will never forget telling her that I knew she would not beleive me. But to my suprise she said she did, because she had herself several years before that. This has haunted me for years and changed my life forever. I could no longer beleive in the biblical things my Grandmother had always taught me. At age 25 I tried hypno therapy. I went 8 times but could never get pasted what I could remember already. The guy said it was too tramatic for me to remember. But he learned me some relaxation techniques. I later learned I had been abducted many times as a child and lots of things came together for me.

All the motorists on the bridge were out of their cars staring at this large round object hovering over the river between this free bridge and the toll bridge which are approx. 2 blocks apart.The engines of the cars seemed to have stopped running. This object seemed to have been gaining energy from the water, as the longer it hovered there just above the water, the more intense the lights were that seemed to surround it. I do not remember anyone saying anything or talking as we all were staring at this unknown item. I noticed that the traffic had stopped on the toll bridge as well, the motorists had exited their cars and were standing along the railing there trying to absorb what they were seeing. It's as though time had stood still, I am assuming that we were there for at least 15 minutes, when all of a sudden the lights grew very bright and it was gone, poof, raised itself right out from between the bridges and was gone. Afterward, I was like in a trance as I do believe the rest of the witnesses were, I don't remember anyone saying anything, just everyone getting into their cars and leaving as though nothing had happened. The gas jockey asked me what I thought it was, and I told him I was afraid to answer. I was 18 years old at the time and normally would have met friends, however, I drove straight home and told my mother what it was that I saw and how the people around me looked and acted like zombies, myself included, like I said, we were drawn to the rail of the bridge to just watch.

It seemed to be aware of our presence and changed direction, hovering above the bushes and heading towards us. We all ran back to our caravans and told our parents. When we returned it had gone. That same night while we were all asleep I was waken when my aunt and uncle burst into our home shaken and obviously terrifed. Something had shaken their caravan about and pulled off the door, whatever it was was chased away by their dog. the next day we saw the caravan, it was a complete mess smashed to pieces.

I got up in the middle of the night (around 3 AM)to grab a snack. The east-facing window of our house had the curtains open. I looked out the window and saw an orange light. I at first thought this was an airplane, but the light grew in size. (after thinking about this over the years, I believe it was coming closer and gave the appearance of growth) After about 5 sec of growing it stopped growing and the light switched off and the saucer appeared about 150 feet from me at house top level. I believe this was a switching of light sources from the saucer's different travel modes from motion to hovering. It was a classic inverted saucer shape with a dome on top and it had a bluish glow around it. I believe this glow was the result of it's propulsion sytem causing ionization in the surrounding atmosphere. As it hovered, a periscope came out from underneath and it pointed at me or the house and I saw (I think) a yellowish eye in the viewfinder staring at me. Apparently it did not want to be seen because as soon as it saw me it vanished. After thinking about this later, I believe it could of just switched all it's light producing sources off or sped off faster than the eye could see. It's likely the thing just hovered around our rural neighborhood for a few hours at housetop level observing at will after I fled in terror back to my sisters bedroom and jumped in her bed.  I have read other accounts of saucers that looked like the one I saw and one account I read has the saucer using this device underneath it as a landing structure. It appears that this structure performs multiple functions for landing and periscope-like observations. It seems like a rather crude observation device as it seemed like a direct optical device like a telescope (I could see the being's eye through it)as opposed to a sophisticated electronic multi-spectral imaging system.

It was exam time and a few days before Christmas break. The dorm was full, but the halls quiet, because most of us were either studying or trying to catch up on sleep. It was about 8:30 pm in the evening and I had just lay down and turned out the light to catch a nap. Suddenly a brilliant light flashed into my room with a thunderous sound. The whole room shook. Frightened, I ran out of my room. Girls every where in the hall where screaming ""did you hear that, what happened?"" No alarm went off, but about 10 girls at the large window at the end of the hall, yelled for us to come and see what was in the sky. It was a typical winter night sky, I don't remember a moon, but I do remember thousands of beautiful stars. We looked in astonishment as a large star like object hovered distantly in the sky. It danced like a ""Mitch Mitchell"" music ball all over the horizon. Suddenly it lifted itself high above the distant mountain peaks and 5 smaller orbs seperated from the large one and just went crazy in the sky..ziggaging everywhere. Then all six orbs flashed into the sky and disappeared. I don't know if anyone called security or not or reported it. I told my family, but I think the authorities would have just accused us of playing a school prank or hoax. It was no hoax. I really heard that large boom in my room and looked out that window with the other girls and it was no jet plane. It was beautiful dancing orbs, and I am as sane as rain.

A large illuminated cigar shaped object glides over head in front of me - no sound at all.,Bon Air,VA,1975-06-15T00:00:00,cigar,3 sec.,"Occurred : 6/15/1975   (Entered as : Mid 1970's) Reported: 1/31/2003 10:03:36 PM 22:03 Posted: 3/21/2003 Location: Bon Air, VA Shape: Cigar Duration:3 sec.",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27417.html,"A large illuminated cigar shaped object glides over head in front of me - no sound at all. The date and time (mid-1970's) has blurred over the decades but my memory of the event was as clear as a crystal bell. Some of my older friends had an out door party on a dam near a spillway. They left beer cans out which I came back later to clean up.  As I was leaving I looked up to see the beautiful stars - a stillness came over me.  In shock I saw a very large cigar shaped craft glide silently  over head in front of me.  The silence was thunderous if you know what I mean. I could not believe my eyes and my brain was having a hard time trying to process the 1-4 second experience.  The speed was probably 100 miles an hour plus and moving parellel to its length as a plane would. Without good triangulation the exact size and distance of the UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) can only be estimated.  Using my eyes depth of  field I estimate the object to be around the size of a mid to large jet airliner. The shape was an absolutely perfect cylinder with domed ends (cigar). It was  slightly illuminated in the darkness and ~ a third of a mile away (45 degrees angle up). The direction was north-east. I was walking on the dam's path going south. There was no wings or other indications to assume that it was a jet or airplane.  (I had made a hard choice to give up all cigerettes, alcohol or drugs  long before that night  so you can rule out intoxication.)  That is my experience to the best of my ability and I make no claim as to what this event is or what it is not. I beg the reader to take in but not judge either way several other experiences I have had that are more difficult to describe dealing with experiences at night  after I went to bed.  In the early 1970's (during puberty -and hormones) I do remember going to bed, starting to feel very heavy then the walls in my room would ""breath"" (not scary). Then I would find my self in a series of 3 absolutely hopeless hynogogic experiences.  In one I was tied across railroad tracks with a speeding train an inch from hitting me then I was balancing on a long needle that balanced on top of a radio antenna that was on top of the Empire State Building and the third experience I blocked from memory in the last few years. (I called the 3 situations ""the tourture"".)  Then still in a groggy state I would walk (sometimes run) out of the house for real and go for 10 minutes.  Coming out of the groggy state I would be outside as far as a third of a mile away from my home in my underwear (much to my extreme embasasment). My mother would sometimes find me yelling-wide eyed as If I was trying to get away from someone.  I would go back inside but it would take an hour to shake off the strangness of the whole thing.  This happened in the exact pattern maybe 20 times, then after a trip to a psycholigist and 6 or so relaxer pills the experiences ended abruptly never to happen again.  Over the decades I have had  ET dreams : one human and one short elder ""gray"". who communicated wordlessly using either an instructional 3d image projected over my minds eye with a force of emotion that shook me to my core.  My common sense tells me that all the experiences are related but I am the first to admit that the dreams and night walks could be due to my own illusions or projections (in essence nothing to do in anyway with the cigar craft my eyes saw.) I also have no negative feelings toward ET's etc. quite the opposite.  I realize that if they are real then there is a whole range of them just like there is a whole range of humans positive and negitive. I try to keep an open mind and my mouth shut but I continue to hear people I have become friends over the years describe their own Richmond UFO experiences.  They have no intention of reporting their own experiences and I can't blame them.  Their body language and tone displays honesty and openess.  On this issue I also have seen hypnotic eyed -very animated folks go off on cart-wheeling flights of pompas fancy. On another extreme I have seen stiff necked ultra myopic ""scientific"" skeptics roll their eyes in their own pious pomp.   I take both with a grain of salt.  Most people are neither extreme as they are open and are a pleasure to relate to.  I am thankful for this important web site. Thank you for taking time to read my experiences and thoughts.

Object stopped mid air. Lights sequenced. Object darted and stopped twice. In the fall of 1975,  I was newly married and enrolled in graduate school at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana.  My husband had been a US Air Force pilot of T-38s and other aircraft.  He had been trained to recognize the configuration of aircraft.  We had visited my parents at the farm in Morgan County, Indiana.  We were driving back to college on a dark Sunday evening in the fall of 1975.  There had been a heavy snowfall, but the weather had cleared.  There was a bright moon and puffy clouds in the sky. We were driving on I-69 between Indianapolis and Anderson, Indiana. I saw lights in the sky, and at first I thought the lights were coming from a large aircraft that was in a steep bank (turning). Then the lighted object seemed to bank the other direction.  I watched the lights for a couple of minutes.  I had never told my husband about seeing a UFO in 1965.  I said, ""Is that an airplane?""  He said, ""No.""  We watched the lights getting closer. We were traveling northeast and getting closer.  The lights were so close to us, that I said, ""Pull over.""  A couple of other cars pulled off to the edge of the interstate.  We were parked on the east side of the interstate, and the object stopped in the air over a large lighted parking lot of a factory or shopping area on the west side of I-69, near Anderson, Indiana.  My husband rolled down his window to get a clear view without reflection.  The lights on the craft were in a horizontal row, similar to lights coming from inside a lighted passenger compartment of a jet.  There were also red and green lights on the object.  We could hear a whirring sound, but not a roaring sound.  Then ... the lights appeared to start moving in sequence ...left to right.  I wonder now if the object was rotating on a horizontal plane and if the object was turning rather than lights coming off and on.  The object darted to the east and in about one second appeared to be stopped again to the east of I-69, maybe about two miles away from us.  ""Follow it."" ... I said.  My husband exited the interstate and headed toward the object.  The object then darted in the air to the west side of I-69 and stopped again.  Then it went behind thick clouds, and we couldn't see it at all. We continued our drive to our apartment on the Ball State campus in Muncie.  We stopped and ordered a pizza.  It was very late at night - maybe after 10pm. We told the pizza guy about the UFO, but we didn't attempt to report the incident to the FAA or even to the Muncie airport.  We had college on our minds, and the next day was just another day.  I felt so blessed that my husband, a pilot, actually saw the object, heard the whirring, and saw how quickly the object could move.  I also felt fortunate that I could have seen two UFOs and that I wasn't just seeing things back in 1965. I wonder if there is a kind of convergence of solar systems that makes space travel easier about every ten years.  I live near the Wright Patterson Air Force Base, where supposedly the wreckage and the alien victims of the Roswell, New Mexico crash are kept in a secret area.  Most of the people who know about it are probably in their seventies or eighties.  I wonder if any of them will ever talk. ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report.

Years ago, while driving from Ft. Carson, CO, to a restaurant in Fountain, CO, I remember seeing an object from my car.

I was driving east (don't remember road) on Ft. Carson, and noticed the object as I approached the I-25 overpass.

I remember thinking it was probably a balloon for a sales pitch, and I couldn't wait to go see it.  After I crossed the overpass I couldn't observe it any longer because of the decreasing road elevation (bad angle) and increasing amount of trees (obstruction).  I did my best to estimate  the point on the ground upon which I thought it was, so I could drive there and see it, but I could never find it.  I was too embarassed to ask anyone at the restaurant.  When I drove back, I u-turned to see if I could see it again, but no joy.

I had just graduated from high school two months earlier. Since this incident, I have written and published a book on automotive subjects, written for automotive magazines, and helped produce an automoitve television show. I was returning from my friend's home after working on his race car all evening. It was a week night, and I felt pretty good about our accomplishments for the evening. I turned onto the road that leads to my house, when I noticed a large bright orange glowing object in the sky. At first I thought it was the moon, but when I made eye contact with this object it began following me. I turned onto an access road to my subdivision, and when I turned, the craft (or object) had moved to the corner of the intersection. I continued slowly down the street and the craft slowly moved in front of me and lowered its altitude to approximately 100 feet above the ground. At this distance, the object appeared to be approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter, and there were two satellites moving around the object. One from the upper left hand corner, and the other from the lower left hand corner, both circumnavigating the object in a flash of sparks (similar to how a sparkler burns). It seemed like the satellites were moving along a guide that was attached to the exterior of the craft, but I couldn't physically see a guide. The paths of the satellites remained constant throughout the encounter.. The night sky around me -- that was moonless -- was illuminated in a bright golden light, while the areas around me were bathed in darkness. I stopped and exited my car ( a white 1969 Camaro SS) and stood watching the craft -- motionless and without any trace of sound -- for what seemed like an eternity. When I realized that I was involved in a stalemate, I got back in my car, turned the corner and continued to the next street. The craft continued its movement along with my car and stopped with me at the next stop sign, only now the craft was approximately 50 feet from the ground, and dangerously close to telephone poles that line the street. I turned, continued to my driveway and pulled my car into the garage. I walked out of the garage to see the craft hovering over my home, and once again it followed me to my front door. I sat on my front step and watched the craft for about five minutes. The entire time I felt no fear, only wonderment at what I was witnessing. At this point I went into my home to retrieve my dad's car keys. I left the house, still watching the craft over my home. I got in my dad's car to move it into the driveway, and watched as the craft contiued down my street. I gave chase with my dad's car, around the corner to the neighborhood ball field. I watched the craft descend through the trees onto the ball field, now flashing the same golden light in sequence around the craft. I felt a seismolgic event as it touched down and the lights went out. When the lights went out I saw what appeared to be a door opening on the craft. At this point, I raced my dad's car back home went inside and locked every window and door that wasn't secured. I called the local air force base, but they blew me off and the next day contacted Dr. Alan Hynek and filed a report. The entire time I watched this object there did not seem to be any portals or doors visible, nor were there any visible signs that such things existed, and to this day I wonder what I would have seen had I stayed longer.

As I mentioned earlier it was very late at night and we were traveling along some lonley dark stretches of highway, way off the beaten path as you might say..My wife was asleep in her seat across from me and I was listening to the radio with my window rolled part part way down so I wouldn't get sleepy...As I was driving I began to hear what sounded like a high pitched humming sound..I thought maybe I had a tire going flat so I slowed my speed down to about 45mph to see if the sound would degrade accordingly, but it didn't...regardless of my speed the sound remained constant in pitch and intensity...After a few minutes of hearing this sound I decided to pull my car over to the side of the road and do a visual check of my tires to be certain they were ok...With the car stopped and engine turned off I got out with a flashlight to have a look..my wife had woken up during this time and I had told her what I was doing..It was pitch black outside and the only light were my headlights and the stars above..The sound was still there and I asked my wife to get out of the car and see if we could determine where the sound was coming from, because it sounded like it was coming from everywhere...I decided to look up and this was when I noticed that some of the stars were being blocked out by something moving and the size of the leading edge of whatever this thing was , was un-believeable! Accordingly the stars were being blocked out to the east and west as far as we could see in either direction as the object moved to the north...The object had to be over a mile in width and length and low to the ground... After 10 minutes of watching this thing  the object finally completed moving over us, because we were finally able to see the stars re-appearing to the back of the craft. We continuously watched this black craft until we could no longer see! its out line in the stars or hear it.  The craft was moving very slow according to our perspective on the ground since the speed the stars were disappearing in front of the craft and re-appearing at the back of the craft was somewhat slow...At first we thought it was a blimp flying close to the ground but there were no lights at all on the craft, so we decided it wasn't a blimp..Having just gotten out of the Air Force after 4 years of service, I was pretty familiar with most of our military and civil aircraft at the time, but I had never seen anything like this before and believe me I had seen alot of weird things in and around the many air bases I was stationed at..

Grant Street in Bloomington, Indiana I observed three faint elliptical objects of less apparent visual magnitude than the star Mizar in the constellation Ursa Major. At the time of observation I was attempting to set up my telescope to observe the Mizar visual binary star system in the handle of Ursa Major. While sighting down the length of my telescope to get an approximate ""aim"" at Mizar, I saw three faint gray oval objects cross the area that I was about to observe. The sighting was naked eye and lasted only about seven seconds. The objects appeared to be solid oval shapes with a major axis of about 1/4"" at arms length. The appeared to be in a staggered formation, one oval slightly behind and to the side of the previous oval. In addition they seemed not to hold a tight formation but rather wandered slightly from a tight formation. The objects revealed no discernable detail to the naked eye and there was no time to track them with the telescope. There was no sound or other phenomena associated with the sighting. The heading that they traveled was approximately 285 degrees and the distance covered in the time I viewed them was approximately 85 degrees across the sky until they were lost behind trees. Altitude and size indeterminable.

I didn't think to much about it cause we have Forbes Air Base and a police helicopter in town, but what caught my eye was that it was changing colors, like most of the rainbow colors, not flashing just changing but the intensity of the light stayed the same. NOW I was wondering why our police helo was changing colors as I have never seen it do that before. It was about the same brightness as Jupiter is on a good night but slightly brighter. I watched it for about 7-10 seconds then it stopped in mid-flight. When it stopped it also stopped changing colors and changed to a VERY brilliant white light, like twice the brightness of Jupiter. That lasted about 4-5 seconds and then all at once this thing took off to the stars so fast it was gone in less than 1 second, if I had blinked I would have missed it leaving. It did not go OVER the horizon it went straight up at about a 70 degree angle to the way it was flying when I watched it before it left. It went UP INTO the stars, not leaving a trail of any kind except a light trail, the kind you see if you move a flashlight beam across a wall VERY fast. At that moment I knew it wasn't something of earth as I have seen aircraft fly all my life and none ever acted like this thing. Object was too far away to make out any shape so can't give one.

My brother and I were visiting a friend who lived in a remote area about 1 mile East of Highway 260 between Heber and Show Low, (closer to Heber).  We were standing outside enjoying the stars and interesting conversation when a large craft crossed almost directly overhead.  The tall Ponderosa pine trees did little to obscure it.  Triangular, it had slowly flashing lights red or white at the corners.  From the faint illumination of the lights and some starlight, the shape was very clear, the color was black or flat black.  There was a faint sound that to me was a very slowly turning (idling) turbine engine like a jet sitting still or an APU on a commercial jet.  Distinct, but quiet.  It almost seemed ordinary.  Almost a perfect triangle, with more or less FAA regulation lights traveling at an impossibly slow airspeed.  We all looked up and after 2 or 3 seconds my friend and my brother continued the conversation.  I was in awe.  Impossible to gauge the distance - 300 ft above us or 1500 feet, no visual clues - it was massive.  It was crawling, almost silent, yet almost ordinary looking because there was nothing dramatic about it.  I kept watching it until it was hidden by the ridgeline about 200 yards behind the house.  No matter how high it was, if it was 1500 feet above us  it had to be proportionally bigger than it appeared if it was actually only 300 feet overhead.  Nothing that massive that relies on aerodynamic lift or thrust could stay airborne moving that silently or that slowly.  It was like watching a sightseeing bus coast past a scenic spot at  5mph.  But buses don't rely on lift. My brother is not terrificaly interested in technical phenomena but he's intelligent.  My friend is a licensed Master electrican and licensed in HVAC, is very intelligent and served in Vietnam.  I worked as a mechanic and worked 2 years as an aerospace machinist before I earned my computer degree from ASU.  I've been a programmer for 2 decades, served in the Air Force and the Army, did a tour in Vietnam and am fairly familiar with aircraft.  What I saw defied the law of physics as I understand them.  25 years later the impression/memory is just as strong.  A big part of the reason for this was that, at the time, my brother and my friend did not react at all to what we had seen which astounded me.  I had just seen something impossible and apparently it hadn't registerd with 2 intelligent, informed individuals who I knew well.  It's hard to say which part of this event affected me more.  What I had seen, or their lack of response.  To this day, I don't understand what happened.  In retrospect, it almost seems like the muffled ""turbine engine sound"" and the ""legal"" appearing lights were ""camaflouge"".  Admittedly this is pure conjecture, but I repeat, nothing that massive can move that slowly and stay airborne.   Interestingly, I looked at your website for the first time today and saw a report about Childs, AZ.  My friend used to tell me about ""lights"" seen in the sky around the power station at Childs.  But a year later I met someone whose uncle was in the military and claimed that prototype Cruise missles were extensively tested in Northern Arizona, and particularly in locations like the Verde Valley where Childs is located.  I now this episode doesn't sound impressive but what I saw is burned in my memory and defies logic.  I can still vividly remember this huge black triangle ""floating"" over our heads. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) Thank you for publishing my 9/77 sighting in Heber, Arizona.  I looked today to see if you ""printed"" it and then browsed the New Mexico reports because my wife and I plan to move there. I was really impressed by someone's sighting on 1/3/94 west of Albuquerque on I-40.  She saw a ""huge""  ""silent"" ""slow"" ""black""  ""triangular"" ""craft""  with lights at a very low altitude.  She couldn't explain her reaction/response or her husband's.  I don't feel like the Lone Ranger anymore.  How similar, even though 17 years and 100 miles apart. I'm sure you see this kind of commonality in reports all the time, but it sure impressed me.  No one has given any real credence to my ""sighting"" so I never talk about it.   I've been pretty much a skeptic in spite of what I saw.  I've reactivated my email at ((e-address deleted)) since I submitted my report, but I really don't have anything to add.  My brother probably only vaguely remembers the event.  I brought up the subject a few years after it happened and he didn't remember it as being significant and I don't know where my friend moved to.  He was in a branch of Army Intelligence when he was in the Army which makes it all the stranger that he had no reaction to what we saw.  Your guess is as good as mine, but it sure was neat watching this monster cruise overhead like it was in slow motion. I feel sort of privileged or lucky, This obviously isn't a report but I appreciate your dedication to this topic and thought you might like a little feedback, so to speak, the similarities I saw between my sighting and the one in NM.  I'm becoming a believer. If you care to email me, could you give me a hint as to why you think  ""they"" don't formally contact us and just tease/study us, instead?  My theory is it's because we're such crude homicidal, genocidal morons.  It's too soon. ((END))",2003-03-21T00:00:00,,

When I was about 7 yrs old, at least once a year i would receive a visit from a little grey alien (in a dream). In this dream which seemed very real, i would be sleeping in my bed to be awakened by a ufo (silver and disc shaped) at a distance outside my window. Next thing I can remember is being floated down my front stairway, out the front door, up and over my neighbors yard, then I would be standing in a gas station parking lot in the next town over. It was a 76 gas station, which is now a Citgo, located on the westbound side of Saltonstall Parkway in East Haven, CT. This little grey alien, classic description(grey,large head w/large black eyes and very skinny) would play with me and tell me to come with him. All i can remember is refusing to go, then being back in bed, seeing the alien wave goodbye and fly off in the ufo. Since this time, i've only had one other sighting which was about 2 yrs ago. I stopped at roy rogers on washington ave in N.Haven CT to get breakfast about 7:30 am. When i came out of the restaurant, somthing in the sky was reflecting off the morning sun. i looked up and immediately seen the classic disc shaped silver ufo hovering way up in the sky. I knew what it was immediatly. I looked away and then back at it a couple of times to make sure my eyes wern't bugging out. I watched it move back, forward and side to side in an erratic manner.

Couple this with the large amount of media coverage which occurred which means this event is researchable & verifiable....AND yet...it has never been properly reported!! I distinctly recall the Radio station I was listening to receiving streams of excited callers and it took over discussion for quite some time. The Papers and TV also covered it however within a few days it had been ""explained away"" as 'reflections of a fishing fleet at sea' or parts of 'skylab' or 'venus' etc Description of event: At dusk a 'mothercraft' (2-3 football fields in size) flew over the city at a very low altitude as a very large dark shape with long trailing arms on either side, set against the fading light of an early evening sky. I witnessed it with a girlfriend and actually stopped the car in a suburban street to watch it in awe. Reminiscent of the opening of the original Star Wars 1 movie without all the craft detail. The following night (Sunday) the hills where swarming with people (I estimate 30-40 groups of 3-5 people) waiting for it (with Binocs etc) to return. It could easily have been a scene out of a Spielberg movie! What makes my role in this a bit unique was that the night before (Friday) I had sat on the bonnet of my car for 15 mins and studied a smaller 3 tiered space craft (Clearly visible windows on each level, not dissimilar to NZ's Parliament 'Beehive') hover on the outskirts of the city approx 200 feet away across a field and just above some poplar trees (75-100 feet above the ground). Although I studied the windows intently there was no sign of life or movement at all. There was also no missing time or anything like that either. It then proceeded to fly slowly over the western edge of the city in the exact opposite direction than that of the 'mothercraft' the following Sat night. I was in visual contact with it for over an hour. I have a large artists impression (a quite accurate representation) of this smaller craft. In short an event at least as big as any of the major UFO sightings worldwide and it has never made it into the annals of UFOlogy.....and it deserves to be. I would be very interested to hear if anyone else has or does report this event. My bet is that given the numbers who witnessed the large craft a researcher would be able to uncover many of them with some publicity. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The sighting occurred with a friend on Tybee Island, Georgia in late December of 1980. The objects were amber to orange glowing spheres. We had seen several (2) earlier the same evening on the way out to the island on US 80, that were positioned over an area proximate to the Savannah River somewhere near Ft. Pulaski National Monument. These moved slowly east to west at slightly different altitudes and then descended below tree level. Their desent was very slow. We eventually ended up at old Fort Screven on Tybee, on the wall facing the Atlantic. Out over the water was another one of these glowing objects that just seemed to hang in the air. From out vantage point, we double checked our bearings by identifying various landmarks both north and south of us along the shore. The glowing object seemed to wobble once or twice and may have made some slight movement but we couldn't be sure. After about 30 minutes or so, the object, right before our eyes, just winked out. It was gone, poof. None of the objects emitted any noise whatsoever. We were familiar with the appearances and characteristics of helicopters coming and going from the Coast Guard station on the island and the objects we witnessed could in no way be mistaken for helicopters or planes.

I cannot remember the exact time or date, as I was only 11 at the time - 23 years ago!  However, I can remember EVERY second of the actual event. Reading is appx 50 miles west of London, and was on the flight path for Concorde coming into Heathrow.  As it was so close to landing at the time it went overhead, it was very low in the sky, and extremely loud.  Our windows would shake, and phone conversations were impossible for the 20-30 seconds that Concorde was passing overhead. This particular day was warm, bright blue skies, with a little wispy broken white cloud.  Very clear, very bright.  Myself and appx 5-8 other children were watching Concorde go over, as we always did. Someone called out:  ""What's that?  Is that a helicopter?"" Someone else: ""Thats NOT a helicopter!"" It was in fact a classic silver disc.  It was flying alongside Concorde (elevations are impossible to judge, but that was the impression).  It flew alongside Concorde, matching it perfectly, for about 30-40 seconds. It then flew off (flew is the wrong term - it shot off like a bullet!) at a right-angle to it's previous direction of flight.  It flew away and up until it vanished into the clouds. My brother and I have since independently remembered TWO further events (one while we were at dinner with Budd Hopkins at the Leeds UFO conference funnily enough!).  One was a traingle of white lights hovering over the car, and the other was a bright blue sphere hovering over some woods visible from our (shared) bedroom window at 4.01 am in the morning.  Both of these events were since forgotten, and we independently remembered particular details which agreed.  The concorde sighting has always been crystal clear in my memory. A couple of years ago I was remembering the Concorde event.  Shortly afterwards I returned to Reading to visit relatives.  I bumped into a friend who I hadn't seen in about 12 years - but I remembered him being there in that playground.  Before we could talk about anything else, I said ""This'll sound weird - do you remember back at Westwood Farm (the school) looking up at Concorde and seeing something?"" He instantly said ""Yeah - a silver disc that shot off"" I replied ""Thank you, I didn't imagine it!"" ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Peter, Thanks very much for coming back to me - I have submitted this report to various places before, but never had a single response!  Thanks. I will try my best with your questions: 1)  ""At the time of your sighting, which side of the Concorde were you viewing, the right, or left?"" - I was on the ground looking straight up at it as it passed overhead.  EG if I was facing West, it was flying west, and therefore would have been travelling from 'behind' us, overhead, and away in front of us into the distance. 2) ""Also, where was the disc, relative to the Concorde, e.g. ""above"" or ""below"" the aircraft, as you faced it, or ahead or behind it?"" - It's hard to judge relative vertical distances from the ground looking straight up.  But the impression that we all had was that it was flying right alongside.  If that was the case, I don't see how passengers could have missed it! 3) ""In addition, can you provide a detailed description of how the disc moved, relative to the aircraft, i.e. from what direction did it approach; if it hovered close to the aircraft, where was it located; where did the disc go, relative to the flight path of the aircraft?"" - We didn't see it approach unfortunately.  When we all looked up at the concorde it was already there.  Someone spotted it and said ""What's that? Is that a helicopter?""  Once it had been pointed out it was glaringly obvious, as it was shiny silver.  It flew right alongside the plane, matching it's speed perfectly, and then flew off very fast at a right angle to it's previous flight direction.  It may also have been going up at this point, as it disappeared into some clouds. 4) ""Also, what was the relative size of the disc, compared, for example to the diameter of the fuselage of the aircraft?"" - I have attached a (very poor - forgive me!) picture which should indicate the relative sizes.  It was considerably smaller than the plane, but still large enough to be clearly seen. I have heard you ask people on the Jeff Rense show to do the arms' length description?  I have tried this, and would estimate that at arm's length Concorde would have been appx as long as my thumb at the height it was.  It used to go over pretty low!  The picture (sorry again!) shows the size relative to that.  The dotted line is the departure angle it took. I hope this helps you to get a picture of the event.  I know how hard it is to picture it without seeing it, as it's so clear to me! The other witness I have mentioned isn't really a friend, just someone I was at school with.  Apart from that chance encounter a few years back we've never spoken since school.  He was pretty taken aback when this was the first thing I asked him about!  However, I will try my best to find out  where he is now and ask him to submit a report.

It was then that we stopped tormenting the babysitter (who was trying to get us down off the roof) and just sat there, watching this dim and yet bright yellow oval shapped object just hover, suspendid in animation over a small hill coverd in pine trees. At first, i thought it was some kind of bird or plane, because i remember seeing something similer a few months back. But there was something different about this object. There was no noise, not even a sound of a car. Everything just seemed to be still...if anything, that is what i remember most about that night...i couldent even hear our babysitter yelling at us. Then it happened, after being still for at least a few minutes, it started to move, but move very slowly. Just gliding from one side for a short distance, stop, and then move to the other. My younger brother then started yelling with excitement to the babysitter saying ""hey, look at that, look up, look up!"" Then we all started saying that to the babysitter. Pointing to the thing in the sky but looking at her. With all the excitement, she looked up, and we knew she saw it because she just stopped with her mouth open and stood there. But then she smiled adn said that itwas a bird, she had an expression on her face as if thats what she wanted to belive that. I don't know about the others, but i know that what we saw that night was no bird. It was to big, to quiet, to visible, and had a unfamilar light about it to be a bird!

I had an unusual experience when I was 15 in the fall of 1981.  I had never had an experience like it before, nor since, and I am now 37.  Right after it happened, I told two friends and my mom.  They did not believe me though I had never had a reputation for lying or even having been a daydreamer.  In 1981, I was popular, had good grades, was a cheerleader, and did not do drugs or smoke.  I had nothing to gain by telling a false story.  My friends and mom thought I had a ""dream,"" though I kept insisting I had not.  I had no clue as to what the experience was about, but as the years went by, and I heard more and more about people’s experiences with UFOs, I came to wonder if it was of the same nature.  I have always been skeptical of UFO stories, but there are so many similarities to my experience.  This is what happened (exactly), as I remember it like it happened yesterday.  It was right after 10:00 p.m. on a school night.  I had just hung up from talking on the phone.  I wasn’t sleepy yet, so I dimmed my light and turned over on my left side with my head propped up on my pillow.  I closed my eyes to relax when I distinctly heard a scurrying sound coming from the back of my closet.  Since we lived at the end of a cul-de-sac near the woods (only one other house around), it wasn’t unusual to have squirrels on the roof.  I thought maybe one of them had gotten down in the wall.  I recall giggling to myself thinking how appalled my mother would be when she found out there was a squirrel in her wall.  It was such a nonthreatening sound, I didn’t bother to open my eyes.  Right after the scurrying stopped, I heard crinkling paper (but it was distant).  Again, I thought, what are those rodents up to now?  Then the crinkling stopped, and in its place I heard a faint murmuring of voices (like in a crowded room).  I thought about getting up and looking out my window, as teens like to come down into our circle to hang out.  Maybe someone was playing their radio.  As I debated on whether I should get up or not, a l! oud clea r voice suddenly spoke near my right ear (the one not on the pillow).  It said something I didn’t quite catch, but the last words were ""the gun.""  When something startles you, your natural reaction is to fly up, and that’s exactly what I thought I was doing, when I had what I call a ""time gap.""  In the split second I was turning to see what had spoken, I found myself flat on my back vertical with my bed with my right arm extended upward.  It was pitch black (though my light had been left on), and I strained to see the tips of the fingers on my extended arm.  I was paralyzed, but not in pain.  My whole body had an electrical current running through it (like when your leg goes to sleep).  I was stunned because I had no recollection of coming into that position.   I thought, how did I get like this?  Then something else began to happen.  Up to this point, I thought I was lying on the bed.  I didn’t realize I was actually levitating over the bed until my body, in a perfectly straight form (with arm raised), began slowly moving counterclockwise.  When I felt the bed sheets grazing my back, I knew I was the one moving and not the bed.  In a 180 degree position (cross with bed), my body would be longer than the width of the bed, so my head and feet would stick out in the air.  As my head cleared the bed, I literally felt my hair FALL off the edge!!  That was when ALL doubt left me as to the reality of what was happening.  This was NOT a dream!  Reaching the 180 degree mark with the bed, I stopped, then began moving back the same direction I had come.  When I was vertical with the bed again, my whole body dropped (including my arm) onto the bed.  I was released from my paralysis, though not from the electrical current.  In a panic, I reached for the phone on my right, but it had no dial tone, just a loud buzzing sound.  I threw it on the floor.  I then leaped out of my bed to the left side and landed upright on my feet.  I was going to run out of my room to my mom’s across the hall.  I took one step and looked! up all at the same time.  I stopped in dead fear because instead of my bedroom door being there, there was a very black hole (tunnel like) in front of me.  It was already pitch black, but this hole was blacker than black.  I was too scared to go forward, so I decided to yell instead.  When I opened my mouth to yell  ""“mom,"" my voice was electric and it came out like I was holding a vibrator to my throat.  The sound scared me so bad, I threw my hand over my mouth in utter shock.  At that very moment, I had another ""time gap.""  In a split second, I was back on my bed, turned to the left, head on the pillow, light dimmed, just as I was before the whole event happened.  I spun around and looked at my whole room.  My phone was back in the cradle, and only 10 minutes had passed on the clock, though I felt like it had been at least an hour.  If you saw or know anything unusual that happened in my area during the time mentioned, please let me know.  This has bothered me for years.

Towards evening in early September 1982 just before my son Michael was born on the 10th I was upstairs in my house in Mount Kiscolooking out of the bedroom window facing west. The sky was a clear blue, but slightly at and above the tree line I noticed a red glow in the sky. I thought someone had set off a firework and I looked more intently. The red glow was moving from right to left in my field of view (or southwards) I thought this was very strange and then I saw that there was an aircraft in front of the glow, but it had no wings. The front part was a glowing light blue sphere and attached to the sphere at the rear was a brightly glowing/pulsating orange/red cylinder the length of which was about twice the diameter of the blue sphere. The diameter of the cylinder was about one quarter of the diameter of the sphere and projected straight back parallel to the direction of flight for about two or three sphere diameters. I thought to myself that the cylinder was the power source driving the sphere forward. There was no noise. Without any reference it is always difficult to tell whether an object traveling in space is far or near, especially if the surfaces are smooth. However, I estimated that it was about the size of a Boeing 747 or larger and flying at 2000ft in altitude at about 500 mph. It was only in view about 10 or 15 seconds altogether. Of course, it could have been larger and further away, but probably not smaller or nearer as it was behind the tree branches on my property. When it disappeared from view I rushed downstairs and exclaimed to my wife that I had seen a UFO. She looked at me very skeptically. However, the next day in the New York Times there was a small mention that an unidentified craft had been sighted by several people. It had been tracked on radar as coming over the Canadian border flying south until it reached Atlanta and then it turned abruptly east and headed out into the Atlantic. There were various nutty explanations given by learned people who had not even seen it. E.g. Mars in the ascendant! ((NUFORC Note:  Date in September 1982 is approximate.

It was a clear October night around 22:10 and I was walking home from a friends house alone. Where I lived there were not street lights so it was pretty dark. The majority of the walk was towards the east. When I got to a point that I had to turn South, I noticed an abnormal amount of barking dogs. MUCH more than normal. I could tell the difference in the dogs barking at me and something else. There were dogs 3 streets over in all directions going crazy. More like, howling and whining than anything else. Some were barking at me I could tell but it sounded like dogs from 1/2 a mile away were going nuts. There were no cars driving around either. As I turned to the South, a large fireball caught my eye in the Southern Sky. It was moving West to East about 60 degrees off the horizon at a relatively slow pace. It looked like a small sun with a fat tail behind it that went to a point very quickly. As I was staring at it, 8 smaller spheres relative in size to the original ball split off from the larger ball and just sort of drifted behind it. The smaller spheres sort of exploded off the large sphere in all directions except in the front of it. I watched this whole thing as I walked slowly home. The spheres never changed speed but it was a constant quick pace across the southern sky. I was able to view this event until the speres disapeared over the eastern horizon. As soon as I couldn't see it anymore, the barking stopped. I could hear my two dogs as well since I was close to home. I told my friends about it and of course I was crazy, making things up. One of my sisters friends said her boyfriend at the time was driving south on another road about 5 miles away and pulled over along with 6 other cars to observe the same thing I was seeing.

""Looked like grey metal. The craft was turning at a medium pace in a circle hovering right above us. The craft was so big it looked like it was a lid to a cookie jar that we were inside. I started running in circles crying...my mother was grabbing me trying to get me in the house...As soon as she got into the house she called my grandmother up on the phone. My grandpa and grandma looked outside and seen the same craft. They said it looked like it was right above them  object. My mother left the phone to go see if it was still there. My mother and I went outside and it was still there. A second later it took off slowily in a diagonal direction upwards then come to a complete stop..then it Zoomed off with a flash in the opposite direction leaving our site. My grandpa seen 1 other small craft leaving with the main one...But I only seen one. Concerned, my mother called The GC Police dept. And said "" Please listen. this is not a prank. There was something over our house about 5 minutes ago"" The police said. MAMM, we havent had any reportings of any objects in the sky today.It was probably just a plane. My mom got pissed and hung up. The next day I seen something on TV about sightings of a Bush election plane flying around..""Sounds like they were trying to justify something"" I would like to see this object again. My memory is slightly clouded due to the time passed. I can say that this was a FLYING SAUCER without a doubt. It wasnt little flying lights or a falling star ...It was a Huge grey metal disk that must have been over a mile in diameter "" I forgot to mention, my grandma lived 1 mile away from us."" I seen what appeared to be windows with light comming out of them..The funny thing was.This thing had alot of light comming from it, but the groung wasnt lit up nor were the houses in the general area...I find it hard to believe nobody else seen the same thing even thought it was 11:300 or later. Oops almost forgot..There wasnt any sound from the object that I could hear. ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-03-21T00:00:00,42.3252,-83.3453

Here is the accounts of my life since the first sighting. First Sighting: In 1983 or 84 I was at my house at 36th Street and Lupine. We were the back house in a very dark culdisac. It was very dark there and easy to watch the night skies. My stepsister and I noticed three stars above the McDowell Mountains just east of Scottsdale Airport that appeared to be moving very slightly. I don't know how high up they were but it was high. We discussed how they couldn't be helicopters because there wasn't any sound from the blades. We also discussed that they couldn't be planes because the were staying in one spot. They were in a triangle type formation. They looked to be teetering or swaying weightlessly. When we noticed this we immediatly knew we were looking at something very different. They hovered above us silently for about two minutes. Then one of them shot off to the south like a bullet and it was gone. These were the fastest things I have ever seen to this day. The other two hovered a while longer and then one zipped off into the east. The one that remained hovered for about 30 seconds and then it went straight up until we could no longer see it. We were overwhelmed at what we witnessed. You just know when you see something like that what it is and you know inside what you have seen, it's like they connect with you somehow. We later watched the news and saw reports of people calling in seeing what we had seen. My life forever changed after that night. I began to have feelings of insight or intuition as I call it. The night of my time loss: I was at a party in the desert with some freinds and it was getting late so decided that it was time to leave. Nobody would give me a ride back into town so I started to walk. I walked a distance about half way to town and I noticed the sky above me began to pulse an intense blue flashing strobe and I don't remember anything after that or losing any time but that 30 minute walk took 2 hours longer than it should have. I know I lost about two t! o three hours and arrived just outside of town, how did I walked that far without knowing it. That was a very scary night. I began to get migrains after that night that hurt so bad I would almost pass out and vomit. I had never even had a headache before that night. It's all very strange and confusing. I have predicted things like putting on my seatbelt 10 seconds before my wife and I were involved in an accident, I had a feeling something was about to happen and put on the seatbelt real fast and the next thing I know we were involved in a pretty serious accident. I was with a freind at a late night movie asked him for some strange reason to look up at the lights and at that exact moment the entire parking lights(about 50) all shut off at that second. Even I was freaked out by this, I don't know why I asked him to look at them, I just did and that still trips me out. There are many more occassions where these types of things happened to me.  Recently we were at Lord of the Rings Two Towers and I had a feeling something was wrong at home, I leaned over during the movie and I asked my wife if she left the Christmas lights on at home because it was a three hour movie, I was sensing or worrying about fire. When we arrived at  home I found a candle my step-daughter had left burning on her desk shelf and it was starting to burn the shelf above, my wife was amazed by this! It might seem trivial, but something as simple as driving someplace, feeling when to leave with my intuition and I experience no traffic and make it through every green light. Does anyone else experience these types of things? I was able to start putting computers together without any knowledge of them. I automatically knew how they worked and I instantly knew how to build them. There are many more things I have experienced but it would take all day to write them down, and I feel very strange writing about this. It feels better to finally get this off my chest. Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in June 1983, assuming that it may have been summertime that the witness would have been walking a long distance at night.  Optic migraine headaches can be preceded by the occurrence of ""flashing blue triangles"" in the visual field, but we have no way of knowing whether that may have been the cause of the witness's experience.

We lived in a house at the time and at about 20:00hs my mother prepared to go to the terrace to pick up our clothes, so I tell her to wait as I would get my binoculars (7x50) and enjoy a small observing session with her (astronomy is my hobby). When we got there, she was the one who first saw the object and said ""What is that!?"", I promptly turned and saw a Delta formation with 10 to 15 lights rapidly climbing on the East, their lights have a distinct blue color and appeared to be travelling very high with no sound. At first I thought they should be some sort of military aircraft, but then they started an incredible manouver with all the lights mixing with each other like a swarm of bees, my mother just said ""Ooohhh!!"" and I felt a strange feeling of facing an unearthly reality, I've just keep thinking ""This was not done by humans"". The crafts continue passing overhead and I pointed the binoculars at them, nothing more could be seen, only points of lights with maybe a little haze around them (but it could be the focus because I was really excited). I would like to point out that I couldn't figure out if it was a single triangular object with lights on its bottom side or if they were distinct objects; anyway as the crafts continue they slowly changed light color from blue (rising east) to blue-green (overhead) to a fiery red as they approached the West horizon. The apparent size of the formation was 1 degree (2 full moons) and their intensity approached -1 magnitude. I have managed to watch two more manouvers through binoculars (really incredible) and each of those manouvers lasted for about 3 seconds, after that all lights returned to their original positions instantly. No news appeared on local television or newsapaper although someone else should have seen the objects. The apparent velocity was very similar to a low earth orbit satellite, but I have no clue about their real altitude or velocity, the lights didn't blink at any time.

We were watching satellites move across the sky and looking for shooting stars. He asked me ""What is that?"" and pointed up, in an westerly direction I believe. I saw in the sky a small rectangular shape. I'm not sure of the exact size, as it appeared to be pretty high in the sky; If I extended my arm fully, I could easily cover my view of it with my thumb. It was approximately a 4 to 1 length to width ratio in size. It appeared to be in 3 even, connected sections: the outer 2 sections were a darkish green, the center section was a brighter, lighter green. It moved slowly across the sky; it took about 2-3 minutes to move about the length of my hand if my arm were extended, before disappearing. It did not change direction, and moved across the sky with one of the long edges leading as opposed to a narrow end. There was no sound accompanying the movement that I or my boyfriend could discern. This has always been a very strong memory for me, as I had (and have) never seen anything resembling it, both in terms of real aircraft, as well as fictional UFOs from stories and movies.

I had read in the news that the shuttle would be overhead so I went outside to my backyard a few minutes early to get adjusted to the dark. I saw the Shuttle exactly at the time that was mentioned on the news. This was the first time I had seen a Space Shuttle overhead. I yelled for my mom to come out to see. At this time I noticed another light trailing the shuttle maybe the distance of your hand if you held it straight up. This ball of light was slightly smaller than the shuttle and I forget the color. Anyway as my mom was walking out the small ball of light shot silently and instantaneously down behind the foothills. I was facing west at the time. All I saw was a beam of light somewhat similar to a bright Perseid meteor shooting behind the hills. The ball of light was gone. My mom never saw it since she was still walking outside. I've still remembered it to this day since I'm pretty skeptical of UFO reports but I don't know of any explanation for this.  I'm filing this report because I'm wondering if anyone has seen similar things especially near a Space Shuttle. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in July 1985 is approximate.

After being there a few weeks i began to feel as though i was being wacthed but i kinda shrugged it off. This would accure every few days i'd catch a glimps of something moving in the corner of my eye and look and nothing would be there.(oh well , i must be tripping) i'd say to myself. Now i must describe my room for your benefit of later events..... .....it was pretty big 27ft  by 40ft and i had a king sized water bed with a headboard with shelves in it about 4ft high(you know the one, everyones got it) full with padded rails and all. in the headboard on a shelf was a gold three cylinder bank ,one cycinder for quarters ,one for dimes and one for nickels ,welded together but each cylinder was at different level and the bank stood about a foot tall (example)>>__ ___ __ Well...you get the idea... anyway ..one night i was sleeping and all of a sudden i just woke up....(i was lying on my left side close to the right side of the bed) AND WHEN I WOKE SUDDENLY ,STANDING IN MY VIEW WAS A 3ft TALL CREATURE !!! It's apearance was smooth it's color was white(I MEAN TRUE WHITE!)there was no hair anywhere , it had BIG BLACK BUG EYES !, NO MOUTH(no slit-nothing), A HUMP WHERE A NOSE SHOULD BE ,NO EARS ,it was just standing there at the side of my bed ""LOOKING AT THAT DARN BANK"" as if it had never seen anything like it (i guess it hadn't)  I SAID OUT LOUD ""WHAT THE ..?

This would be about 1/2 the size of a thumb nail at arms length.  I expected the ""plane"" to disappear behind the hill.  All the while I'm getting closer.  Just as I expected the craft to disappear, I saw the craft cross between the top of the hill and my car.  That's when I realized the craft was coming straight down.  At this point I was directly in front of the hill and I see this thing start to fly horizontally through the trees.  At this point, the size would be about two hands held at arms length.  It had three red lights forming a triangle.  For some reason, it reminded me of the back end of an automobile.  The third brake light was still novel at this time.  I distinctly remember thinking ""Hmmmm.... I wonder if there's a road up there and this is the rear of an automobile.""  Now this thought is riduculous; I just saw this thing come out of the sky and fly through the trees!  I just shrugged it off and drove on. I drove through Rockfish.  (This hardly qualifies as a town, just a railroad crossing and a couple of houses.)  I was on my way toward Shipman, somewhere near Ball Mountain.  This would be approximately 5 to 10 minutes later.  This thing flew right over my car!  It filled the entire windshield!  It floated across the road from right to left.  It was a perfect equilateral triangle defined by blood red lights in each corner.  These lights would be about three or four feet in diameter, and there was about 30 feet between the lights.  It was just above the trees.  I'm guessing there was about 40 feet from one side of the road to the other and it took several seconds to cross this distance.  I watched this thing float away and it kind of followed the terain at treetop level and had a very peculiar way of moving.  When it changed direction it would point one apex into the direction it was moving.  This appeared as a small rotation.  I continued to watch this thing for ten to fifteen seconds.  By this point, I'm turning around and looking over my left shoulder and was just creeping along.  It finally went out of sight and I drove home and FORGOT IT!  Literally!  I was sitting around talking with my wife, Dad, and Sister and in passing the subject of UFO's came up.  At that point I suddenly ""remembered"" the event and described it to my family.  That was also the first time I felt frightened. I started driving this route home every night after this event.  Two more events of note occured.  One night about three miles from Rockfish, I again saw this triangle shape just hanging motionless above another ridge.  This time, however, the corner lights were yellow.  The craft appeared about the size of a thumb nail at arms length.  I stopped the car and got out.  Like my initial sighting, I had the distinct feeling that this thing was aware of my presence.  I watched for about twenty seconds and this thing did that peculiar rotation and descended behind the ridge.  Another night, in the vicinity of Ball Mountain again, a jet flew over the car and it was LOUD and LOW!  It really made me jump!  Now we don't typically see jets flying low in the mountains at night! It has only been recently that I figured out what was so peculiar and may account for my feeling of being watched.  At all times when viewing this object, it appeared as a perfect equilateral triangle no matter how it moved in relationship to me.  If it were a flat object with lights on the bottom, you would expect the relationship of the lights to change as this thing manuevered.  This was not the case.  If it were a flat object, it had to keep one face focused on me as it moved around i. e. it was aware of me.  I even thought that perhaps the object was a tetrahendon, but the the same argument still applies.  I have never seen this observation descibed in other ""triangle"" reports.  Have you? I did start having bad nightmares after this event and would wake myself up screaming.  They do not happen as often anymore.  I have no idea if they are related to this sighting.  One other odd thing.  I have never been able since to exactly pinpoint the spot near Ball Mountain where this thing flew over my car.  A couple of spots look almost, but not quite ""right."" Believe me, this is NOT a hoax.  It really happened.  I have a degree in physics form the University of Virginia and now work as an aerospace engineer in Charlottesville.  This thing has haunted me for years and I thought it was time to share it.  Thank you for the forum you provide and all you hoaxers out there please take it elsewhere.

When I got closer I was shocked to see that there were two separate sources of light, one being the beacon and the other being unidentified. When I got to the precise area where the light was, which was about 1/4 mile from the airport beacon, I saw the object producing the light.  It was about 100 yards away from me at a position just above the tree tops.  I had a very good view of the craft.  I exited my truck and stood at the side of the road observing it for approximately 1 minute.  It was saucer shaped but had flat sides which did not come to a point. It was approximately 200 feet in diameter and had bright lights around its peerimeter and on to and bottom.  The lights varied in color from green to blue to white. It made absolutely no noise.  As I watched it I made a decision to leave the road to attempt to get underneath the craft as it was only 100 yards away.  I heard a vehicle coming down the road and looked in that direction to see if they were going to obvserve the object and slow down or stop.  I was only looking in that direction for a second or two and when I turned my head to watch the object again, it was gone.  It had made no noise at any time.

I looked up and say a Dark triangular object hovering in the sky. It had 3 red lights on the tips. The lights were not flashing. After watching it for a moment a strange haze (bluish gray) emitted from what I assume to be the back of the object (facing the East side). The object then began moving west at a decent rate of speed. Then It emitted a bright reddish orange light and started moving incredibly fast (seemed to be moving higher too) Then 2 or 3 helicopters flew over the area, then 4 or 5 jets flew past the helicopters chasing the object.

We had gone out there looking at agave roasting rings, and just checking out the country. The date is approx. It could have been any time between 1988 and 1992. The sun had just gone down but it was still light out. We were on the north end of a small valley, having followed a jeep trail up an aluvial fan untill it ended. We had stopped to take a leak and, while looking south toward Las Vegas, we saw a very bright light rise from behind the hills on the other end of the valley and stop. We were a couple of valleys north of Vegas, so it appeared to have risen from a valley between us and Las Vegas. It sat perfectly still for so long that I began to think that I hadn't seen it rise, and that it was venus or something. But then it slowly dropped back behind the hill. After awhile, it rose back up and then started to move around. The way it moved was amazing. It would go from stopped to moving very fast with no acceleration or deceleration time. It would do geometric patterns with 90 degree angles without slowing down. It would get very bright and then get so dim we could hardly see it. Then it dropped behind the hill. Shortly after it rose the next time, another one came up. They sat perfectly still for just a moment and then they instantly started moving fast, flying in a chaotic pattern all around each other... like gnats, or humming birds. Then, they both darted out of sight. Shortly after they were gone (it was then completly dark) several helicoptors came over the hill from the  southeast (the dirrection of nellis AFB). They seemed to be combing the area. So my friend and I headded back. On the way down out of the park there was an area where we could briefly see the road further down, before a turn in the road obscured our view. In that brief time we saw a white truck with a shell. Looked like a government truck. By the time we could see the road again it was gone, and I'm pretty sure there was no other road.

While my scout platoon was in the desert at fort irwin ca on a training exercise I beleive we witnessed a ufo. Here's what I remember, about 2 am in the morning we were conducting a screen line waiting for an attack to come from the other unit that was in the box ie training area and we reported a light (helicopter) inbound about 500ft above the ground and roughly 5 miles out. we viewed this with night vision goggles. it continued in bound heading north, within a couple of minutes another scout vehicle reported contact with it. we all just kept looking at it because we thought it was a helicopter bringing in the enemy somewhere. A minute or so later another light and reported it as another helicopter was on the same path and heading in the same direction a few seconds after that we reported one more light(helicopter). so now we had three of them and at least one other scout vehicle was seeing the same thing and tracking it as well. Within a couple of minutes the lead copter went directly up in the air about  and the sky got brighter, really brighter, all this was happening about 5 miles from my position but it got so bright that you could see the change without your night vision goggles. we reported to the commander at the toc that we beleived a helo just exploded and we had a real world emergency. now all the scout vehicles could see the sky getting way brighter. I mean really bright and it was staying that way not like a firecracker but like a slow build to brightness. not daylight but definatly noticeable. We were rasing hell on the radio with the toc telling them to check with bluefor and see if they had a helicopter go down and we were looking for red stars which would signal a real world emergency. we saw none. after alot of radio chatter between the toc and us they said it was not a helicopter but they would investigate it. so for about an hr we watched the sky get really bright and the start to dim out and basically didnt do our mission any more but talked on the radio about what was going on. finally the toc told us that a missle from one of the airforce bases went awry and they had to self destruct it so thats what the lights were. about 1 hr later we saw orange lights moving in the desert floor like a fireball moving really fast. like it was racing up and down the floor in a super fast car. this also happened about 3-5 miles from my position but others saw it as well. the toc thought my entire platoon was nuts but we all saw it. finally the orange light went out and nothing else happened. after the mission ended a day or so later we all asked what was up and were told the missle story but no reference to the orange light other than special forces were supposedly in the area and may have been doing something. no special forces could have done what I saw. they had to have been driving on the desert floor 2000 miles an hr. after the first helicopter blew up or missle or whatever it was, the other lights just kept moving north and eventually went out of view. I truly believe I saw something and not what the army said it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))",2003-03-21T00:00:00,35.3001,-116.74419999999999

I initially thought it was just an airplane or helicopter. The light began moving East and back West in very fast straight lines.  The movements were first short and then covered increasingly longer distances until it was due South, standing still directly over the horizon of the lake.  The light then moved up and down in quick jerking motions, and East and West in very short jerking motions.  It then shot off diagonally to the South-Southwest at a speed faster than any of it's earlier movements and disappeared.  I often spend time watching for another similar light but have seen nothing in the 10 + years since.  It is important to note that in 1992 the army base at Fort McLelland, which is now closed, was still open.  Fort McLelland is South-Southeast of Weiss Lake where the sighthing occurred.  The date of the sighting was near other sightings in Northeast Alabama. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-03-21T00:00:00,34.1707,-85.7641

Perhaps a close encounter from my childhood? I really dont know I see all these posts about things happening in the past. I might as well share my one unexplainable experience. It either occured in 92 or 93. I know this because my youngest sisters crying woke me up in the very early hours of the morning and at that time she must have been one or two yrs old. Im guessing between 1 and 3AM this event occured. I was laying on my bunk bed which was placed against the wall, which right on the other side was my baby sister. Her crying not only woke me up, but my parents also. And in a minute i could hear my stepdad walking across the hardwood floor of the living room to tend to my sister. I awoke facing the wall inches from my face. I turned on my opposite side to get more comfortable and i saw something standing two feet away from my position in my room. I had not a clue as to what it was. But whatever it was it was not there when i had gone to sleep. It was as tall as my bunk bed, so i was horizontal with the upper portion of it. i was very scared, frozen into staring at it. I saw no discernable features, it didnt move, but it definately was smooth (skinned?) cuz the only light from the fishtank around the corner allowed me to see it well enough. I stared for five minutes while right around the corner my stepdad tended to my sister. I was too scared to move or utter a sound, so i forced myself to turn back towards the wall, shut my eyes, and sleep. The next morning that space in my room was empty, exactly as it were when i went to sleep. I havent told any of my family about this, they already think im crazy. Ive told a few friends. But this is one of those childhood memories when i was about 8 or 9 yrs of age, before i knew anything about aliens or abductions. I KNOW it wasnt a nightmare. I hope my sharing this helps someone out there, and i could care less if im believed or not. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2003-03-21T00:00:00,40.9883,-73.7954

The exact distance was hard to estimate and could of been one mile away. I had a powerful set of binoculars at the time and focused as best as I could on the object trying very hard to steady my hand . The craft was dark in color and all I could make out were lights, both green and red, blinking in a sequenced triangle pattern. What ever it was slowly moved from left to right several times but never changed alltitude . I was so convinced it was a UFO that I called the williamsburg police department and reported the incident . After I had hung up the phone I noticed the UFO had disappeared from where it had hovered for about 30 minutes. I was in the process of telling my wife about my conversation with the Sheriffs office when a blinding light flashed directly above our two story house. The light was so bright that the yard lit up like it was day time . There was not a cloud in the sky that night,  no chance of rain , and the flash of light was brighter than lighting . My wife and I became a little frightened at that point because there was no sound like lightning and if there was no lightning just exactly what caused the flash of light.

The other occurance was in '97 or '98..My dad was out on a fishing trip and my mom was sleeping on the couch..I happened to look out the window of our family room around 9pm..the curtains weren't open all of the way, but I got a good view of this light..it was just like the other one, but it was closer (almost felt that it was above the neighbor's house) and orange..I listened for normal plane and hellecopter sounds, but there were none..I was looking West out the window and had to move to keep the ""star"" looking thing in my sight..it traveled from North to South.. These lights scared me a lot at the time, making me not want to look outside because I might see them again..my parents and I always joke about if it has flashing lights, it's not a UFO, it's a plane or hellicopter, so it was weird when these lights never blinked or never had more than one single light on it..I also looked outside for more stars, but these were cloudy nights.. Ashville is right over an underground river..I've read that that could cause our Geomagnetic Fields to be higher than usual, which might create some kind of light phenomenon..I'm not sure if it's that because these looked more like vehicles than something to do with air particles..

Each set was in a perfect triangle, and then the three sets of lights were also in a perfect triangle.  The lights were moving at a moderate pace, neither real fast or real slowly.  When I got home, I saw something on the news that night about whether there was a UFO or not, but I wasn't allowed to stay up to watch it, so I never found out what it was.

But this was MUCH, MUCH bigger, at about 1000 feet up I could bracket it with my hands being about 8 inches apart... As more people walked by some stopped till there were about 20 people watching....just looking at each other and oohing and aahing and saying  ""oh my god""  ""oh my god"" ... the 4 cops were shaking their heads, shuffling their feet,  and putting their hands on their heads like they were wondering whether or not they were going to report this...or just agree to all keep their mouths shut... one Cop next to me looked at me and we shook our heads and he said...""Definitely a UFO""  and I said ""definitely a UF Something"" ... after about 5 minutes or so, the craft started rising up into the sky and it got smaller as it rose and went completely out of sight into the clouds or fog...

Were you up there (pointing to where I'd been) by all the cops?""   I said yeah! wasn't that amazing? and he went ""YEAH!""

PA This is so weird. I had just told my new husband of my seeing a UFO in 1996 when we decided to watch some tv and found a program on UFO's on the History Channel. Well, when it aired the report from a pilot over Pittsburgh I was screaming because I had just described the same thing to my husband! Please take me seriously - I was very disappointed that nobody had ever gotten back to me as I did report the sighting to the Post Gazette newspaper. What I witnessed was so amazing.  We were just driving along a rural road in my friends pick up truck - there was a light in the sky - we both saw it but didn't comment because we just assumed it was a plane - until a few minutes later when we realized the light had not moved! I remember commenting ""what in the world?"" at about the same time my companion came to the same realization that something just wasn't right. I am delighted to have this forum to report this to as I have thought about it so often during the years. Anyway, my friend just happened to have a pair of binoculars in his truck and told me to take a look at the light through them - which I did AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES!! Without the binoculars the light was just a light but with the binoculars it all became clear! My first response was ""Oh My God, Oh My God, Oh My God""! I shouted for my friend to stop the truck - to pull over because I was dumbstruck! I was looking at the most magnificent sight - a huge round object with huge round lights - two of which were lit - the lights had what I called ""hoods"" over them - making them look like the hanging traffic lights. The lights would go off and I could see that they would come on at a different location on the object and then back to where I was looking. Tonight as I was trying to describe to my husband what I had witness I used the word ""energy"" - as in I could feel a great ""energy"" within this object - as though it were seething with power but I did not really feel frightened - just in awe. Well, as we watched the UFO program I saw where the pilot ! over Pit tsburgh described what he has seen as ""pulsating"" and I just had the chills as that would exactly describe what I had seen. The object was black - a very dull black and it was huge! I really could not tell how big it was until I realized that the lights were coming on on the other side of it and then I was able to ascertain that it was huge - it was blacking out a huge area of the sky! I could not imagine why more people had not reported seeing it but then I realized that without the binoculars it just looked like a light in the sky.  When I called the newspaper I was told nobody else had reported it. In the time it took me to hand the binoculars over to my friend it was gone - however, he did see the light earlier. So, this was my experience and now I am convinced that others saw it too - especially the pilot. I wish I could remember the month - I cannot and I had just told my husband that I was pretty sure it was 1996 and then I heard the pilot had seen one in 1996 and I am now convinced that I saw a UFO. Thank you for listening to my story. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2003-03-21T00:00:00,40.88344038461538,-79.90976153846154

My accounts of sitings have never been made public, but after reviewing the reports, I feel that I ought to go public with what I have seen. My first account I wish to report, was in Bloomingburg, NY.  It was July 1988, the 2nd to last wednesday of that month.  Around 6:30 pm, I was putting a full teapot of water on my stove when I looked up, out the window that faced Rt. 17M.  I lived next to a white victorian home across from the cemetary, in a little rental bungalow.  It had been raining and as I looked out the window, above the telephone and electrical wires was a slow moving triangular shaped object with yellow, green and white lights in each corner of the object.  I dropped the teapot, tore open the kitchen door and ran out in my socks across the front lawn.  The object disappeared behind the victorian house and in the few seconds it took me to race to the edge of the shoulder of the road, the object disappeared.  My fiance at the time, had come outdoors behind me, questioning what I had been doing....and I told him.  About a minute later, to the east of us (towards Middletown, NY) there was a bright flash of light that seemed to have come from the behind the mountain to our right...a few miles down Rt. 17M.   There was not a sound around, everything was silent, not the sound of crickets or anything and the air felt strange, almost electrified. I ran inside the house, and called the Middletown State Police Barracks, Troop F and reported the siting.  The officer who answered the telephone explained that he had already received several phone calls reporting the same siting. The next morning, as I went to work at George's Deli (now VEO mart) in Bullville, I opened the store as the a.m. opening shift, at 5:30 am.  The Times Herald Record, for Thursday morning, had a front page article on the siting, stating that a little over 250 telephone calls had come in the previous night, reporting the siting.  Stuart Airport was said to have sent out a flight test mission of 7 fighter planes practicing, yet it was not accurate, because Stuart Airport was known, for years, to have done test missions on the last Thursday of the month.  This was just one object that was reported and for a government airplane, which makes a great deal of noise, it was not of our making, that I am sure.  ( I had seen a triangular shaped object 2 years prior, while hanging out with a friend at cowhill in Chester/Sugarloaf, NY about a 30 minute drive east of Middletown).  My friend and I watched this object from the mountain top for 15 minutes, it did not move when suddenly it just shot off in an upward direction and disappeared.  We chalked it up to an LSD flashback from our partying days as we had both watched it but thought we had both seen something that did not exist. The second incident that I would like to report, occurred in Sussex, NJ on July 15, 1995.  I had been heading towards Newton, NJ, to attend classes at Sussex County Community College.  I was driving my vehicle on Rt. 23, about 1/4 mile passed the Sussex County Airport.  The time was about 5:15 p.m.  To my right, above the trees was a triangular shaped object moving a bit faster than my speed of 45 m.p.h.  It was a dark colored object, dull in texture.  There was no sound coming from the object as it stayed approximately 2 car lengths ahead of me to the right.  I sped up to try to get even with it, but to no avail, I could not.  When I reached the intersection that led to Space Farms, to my right (I have been out of NJ now since September, 1996 and I do not remember the name of that road), the object suddenly took off at a speed I had witnessed before in Chester/Sugarloaf, NY.  In a blink of an eye, it disappeared, in the direction of Newton, NJ (it passed over the Sussex County Fair Grounds where I noticed a similar report had been made regarding the witnesses at the rodeo) and was gone.  Amazed, I stopped at a friend's place in Newton, a block before the community college to tell her and her husband about it (her husband is retired Air force officer), she told me she too saw the same object only moments before I arrived, and that it too had disappeared...she explained, over the college towards Port Jervis, NY direction. I have had other unexplainable incidents in my childhood, yet as an adult, I have also seen many, sometimes alone and other times, with witnesses.  I would like to explain the other details of other events, if you are interested, please contact me at email address provided in form and I would be more than happy to divulge the information, times, dates and accounts as well as witnesses.

Kentucky... On the morning of November 23, 1996 I was driving alone and witnessed a large triangle type of UFO. The craft appeared to be a helicopter from a distance but as it got closer I began to realize that it was not a chopper at all. It was very large, at least 300 feet from corner to corner. It had three large lights on the bottom located in the corners of the triangle. Two white lights and one red. The red light was in the front of the craft as it led with that corner. The lights were bright and did not contain a hot spot. They were uniformly lit and I would estimate that they were at least 12 to 14 feet in diameter. As I said before the craft got closer, in fact it hovered above me for about 3 minutes. It was about 100 feet or so above me and was totaly silent. It was low enough that the light from under the craft was actually bouncing back off the ground and illuminating the underside of the craft. I was able to see that the craft had a flat black type of paint. Exactly what you would see on the F117 or the other stealth vehicles. I was able to notice a series of rectangular panels that were surrounded by rivets, they reminded me of a traditional aircraft like a large jet for instance. If you look at a large jet you will notice what I am refering to, they are covered with rectangular panels that are surrounded by rivets. The craft hovered above me and I was truly amazed by it. I did flash a peace sign with my gloved hand through the sun roof which was open. After about 3 minutes of hovering I began to think of the numerous abduction stories that I had heard about or seen on TV & how people would say that something approached them and then the next thing they remembered an hour or two had passed and they are on their way home. As this thought began to scare me I reached down to start my car and when I looked back up the craft was gone in an instant. I did not experience any lost time or witness anything that would lead me to believe that this was of alien origin. It has taken me many years to feel comfortable enough to share this publicly online as I know what I saw was real. I am also aware that very few witnesses have reported any kind of details relating to the panels with rivets that make up this craft. I have not seen it again since that night in November 96. I hope this story allows anyone else who has seen it to realize that they are not the only one out there who has had this thing come down on them and hover.

I was driving with two friends across Bob Sikes (3-Mile) bridge going South from Pensacola to Gulf Breeze.  Halfway across, at the crest of the bridge, we were startled to notice an immensely bright light approximately 200 yards away from us at roughly eye level (about 100 ft. off the water).  It was disc shaped and was emitting pulses of light, much like tracer fire, in a triangular array of about 30 degrees, and only traveling perhaps 4 diameters out away from the craft before the pulses stopped.  The effect was visually as if a dotted triangle was temporarily attached to a brightly glowing sphere.  This emission would go on for 10-15 seconds at a time, after which, it would stop and then recur anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes later.  I stopped immediately upon exiting the bridge and went to the edge of the bay to be able to watch with as little light pollution as possible.  When the lights were not emitting from the craft, it would fade to a dull, almost black, shade of red.  As it traveled East away from us, it would become difficutlt to track it visually while it was not in its' bright phase.  When it was approximately 5 miles from us, we noticed another craft, also pulsing identical light emissions, approaching the first from about 45 degrees to the the North.  The two never got closer than a couple of miles from each other.  Approximately 10 minutes had gone by at this time.  Immediately after noticing the second craft, we noticed a third approaching the first from about about 30 degrees from the South.  At this point, the emissions were coming less frequently, and we could only be sure of the exact location of all three craft when they would emit, which they did not do in unison.  When they reached roughly the current location of the Garcon Point bridge (approximately 10 miles from our vantage point, they all three dissapeared at the same time.

On all of the nights i'd see them (this was third night), planes and helicopters would be flying around too, they'd fly up to a craft and quickly turn and fly away. The crafts themselves made no noise and had white and light greenish-blue lights.

It flew relatively slowly from the back of the house forward (heading north) and turned up and disappeared as soon as it cleared the roof. It was only about 15 feet from the nose to rear, if that, and had slightly rounded edges. It made no noise and the entire bottom was covered in small, irregularly sized and shaped lights in the same white and light greenish-blue of the other crafts. Their placement and shapes reminded me of a mosaic. I didn't see the top or sides of the craft. After the triangular craft flew over, the 4 crafts in the square formation were gone as well.

One morning as I stepped outside to a clear blue sky my attention was drawn toward the sky to something I'd never seen before.  Above the Holloman Air Force Base runway at an unknown height was an abnormal contrail.  It was not the usual long straight contrail but a single consistent contrail that looped in a tight group.  It looped in not only tight radiuses but also sharp right turns! It may have been weeks or even months from the above incident when an Albuquerque news broadcast showed a picture taken of an abnormal contrail over Kirkland AFB over 100 miles away from Holloman.  The report was made public after people swamped the news network with calls.  The news reported that they had contacted the local Air Force Base and questioned the contrails in the sky.  The Air Force responded that they were not created by military aircraft but gave no other explanation. The contrails on the television were very similar to those I had seen in the past.  If that was not surprising enough, as I stepped outside that same morning, in the sky over Holloman AFB was the same type of contrail as shown on the news broadcast over 100 miles away??

My family and I were driving from a birthday party (only one of us had been drinking, and that person had only one Lager) in Bognor Regis. As we came up one of the main roads towards the motorway, I looked up into the sky and saw what looked like a blurred circle that seemed to be stationary. To avoid the traffic of the motorway, the driver decided to take the backroads, as we turned on to one of the backroads the blurred circle dissapeared from my view, I thought nothing of it. Around 10 minutes later I looked up at the sky again and saw not one blurred circle but now 2, they seemed to almost be 'dancing' in the night sky. A couple of minutes later another blurred circle seemed to appear out of no where. Thinking that I was seeing things I called to the passanger in the front passanger seat (which is on the left side for the UK. I was seated in the left rear passanger seat) and told them to look out of their window. They looked out and they too saw the 3 circles moving in an almost figure 8 pattern in the night sky (all in a line, like follow the leader). We sat and watched them for a couple more minutes, then we told the other passanger and the driver. The other passanger leaned across and saw the circles as well. We drove on for a few more minutes (it was now about 24:00), and the curiosity of the driver caused them to slow the car and stop, they then got out and watched the blurred circles. We sat there watching them (except the driver, who was standing outside the car) for about another 10 minutes, then 1 of the 3 blurred circles (the one that was leading the figure 8 'dance') dropped a smaller object that seemed to be 'sharper' and brighter than the blurred circles (its shape was hard to tell from our distance, but I would say it looked cylinderical). Then suddenly out of no where a much larger blurred circle appeared, the 3 smaller blurred circles then appeared to 'enter' the larger one, the larger blurred circle then dissapeared again. The driver got back in the car and we drove on towards our ! destinat ion without any more sightings of the UFOs. Driver: Former Royal Lifeguard, medically discharged (one of the original soldiers to test depleted uranium munitions. Lead to asthma, and cancer). Worked as a mechnanic during the time of the sighting. Had not been drinking on the night it happened. Was aged 36 at the time. Front Passanger: Was working as a part-time cleaner at the time.

My sister and I were driving up a hill by a field with a line of tall trees on either side of the road in a very rural town.  There are no street lights, so it gets very dark and clear.  Out of nowhere a bright yellow-white spherical object shot across our field of view, right in front of us, covering the arc of sky we could see between the trees flanking the road  (about 20 degrees of sky)  this occurred extremely fast (a few seconds at most)  but long enough to tell that it was a discrete spherical glowing object traveling horizontally.  It appeared similar in size to the moon, but a little brighter  (not blinding).  There was no trailing tail or ""halo"" around the object...I've grown up in this town and seen plenty of fireball meteors (good viewing, no city lights) and this was nothing like them, I knew it the instant I saw it.  Given its speed and size, I guess it was going several hundred miles per hour no more than a hundred feet over the trees.  I was really impressed by how fast it moved.. that I especially remember.  And thinking it simply couldn't be some very large, distant object...it would have to be moving insanely fast to have the same effect, then.  My sister both were shocked, and immediately agreed that we had no idea what could possibly look or behave like what we had just saw. I am a research scientist and have a background that includes astronomy and physics.  My sister is a very bright, level headed student.  This event was completely outside her conceptual experience and I was just as shocked as she was. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

However I did take a large number of undergraduate classes in astronomy and physics.  As far as further information, I talked with my sister and she didn't have anything to add, and didn't want to submit a report.  We're still not sure of the date.  I know that I was picking her up from a school dance, and that I was no longer in high school myself.  That limits it to either 1997 or 1998.   Plus it was not winter (or summer).  So it was probably fall or spring.  I can tell you precisely where the event occurred, if that helps at all.  It was traveling northwest, and the object crossed our path moving east/northeast.  I don't have a map handy, but the area we were at was dead in the center of woodstock, CT, right by the intersection of Joy Rd and Rte 169. hope this helps..

We had told our parents we were camping out in the woods, but had just spent the evening running around town and having fun, planning to return to our houses around dawn.  We were laying on the north side of the lawn that faced City Hall.  Myself and one of the other boys had almost gone to sleep, but the other one was just laying there watching the stars.  After a few minutes he excitedly yelled, ""did you see that"" along with some other phrases that I don't remember, but he was very excited. We were a little agitated because we were almost asleep and this guy was known for his pranks, but to humor him we watched for a few minutes and didn't see anything so we tried to go back to sleep.  What he had seen was a streak of light that had gone across the sky at a very high altitude and lasted only for several seconds but had traveled from horizon to horizon in that brief time.  After about 15 or 20 minutes he yelled that he had seen the same thing again, so this time myself and the other friend decided to wait it out to see if he was pulling our leg.  Sure enough, after 20 minutes or so we all three saw a little steak of light go across the sky at a tremendous speed.  I think if we had blinked we would have missed it.  We watched this happen at least 6 times, including the 2 times observed by the first friend.  Each time it happened the streak of light was a few degrees farther north until on the last sighting it was barely visible toward the city of Oak Hill, West Virginia. We even theorized that maybe the object was going all the way around the Earth and we were seeing the same object instead of 6 individual ones.  The boy who had first seen the light stayed awake practically all night, but myself and the other friend eventually went to sleep.

I was preparing for bed with no lights on in the room I shared with my younger brother one night, and while pulling my sweatshirt up over my head, I felt a sudden surge of what I can only describe as something like an electric current run through my body starting at my scalp and flowing down all the way to my feet. As I quickly removed the shirt, I noticed flashing red lights reflecting off the upermost branches of the fruit trees outside the high open window at the top of the bedroom wall. I could see the bottom of the eaves, and they were in shadow just above the top of the window. As I was wondering what angle the red light was coming from, the rounded leading edge of what I would see later was a saucer shaped craft slowly came into view from the north, directly above the house, moving away from me very slowly to the south, blocking out the stars as it went. At that point I was less than 30 feet from the bottom of the saucer, about 8 to 10 feet to the west of it's center. At several poimts around the rim of the vehicle were bright bluish-white lights that blinked slowly on and off. When the lights were on, they were a solid field of light with no filaments or bulbs visible,even as close as I was. When they went off, there was nothing in that spot, as if the skin of the ship had instantly covered them over.It made absolutely no sound, but my German Shepherd was throwing a fit in the back yard, as it was moving directly toward him. As I realized this was something out of the ordinary, to say the least, I began to notice details on the bottom edge and body of the craft. It was moving so slowly that it took 3 or 4 seconds to move about 15 feet. That was when I first saw the detailed edge of a strangely shaped window in the underbody of the craft. It took perhaps another second or so before I could actually see into the interior. All this time, I was frozen in my tracks, unable to move. I was so frightened by what I was seeing, that I wanted to run and warn my Mother of what was happening.! But the harder I tried to move, the more I realized that I couldn't. The craft moved very smoothly and steadily, not wobbling in the least, and the flashig red lights reflected off it's surface as if it were made of polished chrome. When it reached a point directly above the dog, he suddenly became quiet. I could see at that time that it was perhaps 30 feet or so across. Within a second or so it was no longer right above me, and I found I could finally move, so I began screaming at the top of my lungs. I remember my brother waking up at that point, and I ran out of the room without saying anything to him. I met my Mother in the hall, and told her what had happened. She said that the lights were from a police car she had seen stop in front of the house. I finally convinced her that there was more to it than that, and she went to look out the back door. I was so shaken up that I couldn't go with her. She returned and told me that she had seen the craft moving slowly away to the south, when it quickly accelerated away faster than a jet, and disappeared to the south. The police report appeared in the local newspaper the next day, saying the officers had chased a flying disc down our road to a point directly in front of our house, where it suddenly slowed and turned southward, flying exactly over our home, then sped off in a southerly direction at incredible speed. As we lived quite close to Selfridge Air Force Base, both my family and the officers were well aquainted with the different types and speed of military aircraft at the time, so when they say incredible speed, they mean it. That incident so traumatized me, and my Mother, that I blocked it out of my mind for years afterward, and even now, I can't bring my mind to recall certain details of what I saw. Slowly over the years, I've been able to remember a little more, and a little more, but not enough to satisfy my curiosity. I want to remember who or what I saw inside that ship, and I know there were certain details about the edges of the windows that ! absolutly astounded me for some reason, but my memory will not yet allow me to know these things. I truly hope that someday I will. This was my first of several related incidents, and by far the most documented, what with police officers as additional witnesses, so I decided to report it on this website. After keeping it to myself all this time, it feels good just to know it has finally been reported. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,,

When I was a teenager, my friend and I were out in the evening when we noticed low in the sky about 20-30 degrees above the horizon,a set of five orange glowing spheres or circular shapes. It was more like a glow than a bright light, but with dstinct round edges, not fuzzy. The spheres were in a line, with the edges touching each other, so as to form one object. The center sphere was the largest, about half the size of a full moon. The next adjacent two were smaller, and the outer two were the smallest, about half the size of the center sphere. We stood there for a few minutes staring at it in amazement. There were no sounds, movement, blinking or rays of light coming from it. Just completely still and glowing orange.  My house was at the edge of a subdivision, and the direction was east over a wooded undeveloped area.  It was very dark, so there were no street lights or ground lights to confuse it with something else.  The spheres were much bigger than any aircraft lights. We ran down the street to get another friend to come out and see it, but a few minutes later it was gone.  A few days later, as I recall, there was a short newspaper article that various people in Savannah had seen orange glowing lights in the night sky.  I assume it was the same object that we had seen.  Whoever they interviewed explained that it was migrating ducks flying in a ""v"" formation and their bellies glowed orange from reflected light. Yeah, right! Duck bellies are not perfectly round and are extremely tiny in the sky! I have never seen anything like that since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,32.02970094086022,-81.13525336021505

While on guard duty in the Republic of Vietnam (with Battery A, 1st Battalion, 7th Artillery) my job was to scan the treeline with a starlite scope for enemy movement/lights.  We had received mortar fire recently upon our dug-in position in the ""Catcher's Mitt"" area of South Vietnam.  This area had never been occupied by U.S. forces until our arrival late in November of 1969 by air assault.   While scanning the treeline I saw a saucer shaped craft flying above the trees.  It tracked slowly from south to north and as I followed it a dome-like structure came into view sitting on the side of a hill. In the view from a 1969 vintage starlite scope any light source appeared green.  The dome slowly pulsed and as the saucer approached, it appeared to enter the dome, no details were discernible, only that the saucer disappeared into the dome.   I continued to watch, and sent the second guard to get the battery commander, an artillery captain (Captain ((name deleted))).  As I watched, the saucer, or a second one that was its twin, left the dome and ""launched"" into the sky.  About that time the captain arrived and I said ""Take a look at that sir.""   He did, watching for five or six minutes then he straightened up.  ""What should we do sir?"" I asked.   He replied we were to do nothing and no report was to be written up.  I watched the dome all night, it continued to pulse, but when I left guard duty a few hours later the saucer had not returned.  There was never any discernible sounds, I listened for the ""whomp, whomp"" of a chopper or the sound of jets and never heard anything.  I mentioned the incident to the guard releaving me, but he was unconcerned as long as it ""Wasn't VC"".   The following night I took a look through the scope to where the dome had been the night before, but it was gone. I've never reported this other than to my captain.

It was on or around 1998 (I do not remember the date), during a ""warmer"" month (Spring, Summer or Fall.  I would say Summer).  The time of day was approximately early afternoon.  I was working on the second floor of a two-story building of a satellite office of a major corporation in Dickson City, Pennsylvania.  I was sitting at my desk, which faced a row of large non-shaded windows.  As I looked up from my work, I saw out the window an object that was moving nearly laterally through the sky. The object was dark in color (I would say flat black.)  It’s size I would estimate as that of a small plane (say a Lear Jet) I saw no details, no markings, no marker lights, no windows, etc.  The object did not even appear to have any reflections or glare.  It was chevron in shape, like a wide ""V.""  (There was no ""tail"" or any other protrusions.)  Each of the 3 ""tips"" of the ""V"" came to a point, with the widest section being (using this example) at the nadir of the ""V.""  I would say the angle of the ""V"" was about 100 degrees. The object was moving (nearly) from left to right from where I was (now standing) by the window.  It was approximately one quarter, to one half mile away from me.  It was ""flying"" with it’s ""wings"" perpendicular to the ground (like a plane would normally fly), and the bottom point of the ""V"" was pointing in the direction of it’s movement (like it was the ""nose"" of the vehicle). There was no exhaust or contrail. The sky that day was partly cloudy, with a good base to the clouds (in other words the clouds did not vary much in elevation, the base of each cloud was at pretty much at the same elevation).  The sky was light ""sky blue"" in between the clouds.  Other than the clouds, the visibility was unlimited. I do not know the objects elevation, but it was flying just below the cloud layer, because the craft would every now and then ""skim"" the bottom of the clouds. Its speed appeared to be approximately, one and a half, to two times the speed that a ""Piper Cub"" type airplane would fly at, at that distance and elevation. It was completely rigid in its motion.  In other words, it did not increase or decrease elevation, or speed.  It made no wobbles or movements of pitch, yaw or roll.  There was of course, no flapping motion (it was NOT a bird in my opinion).  It’s flight was completely steady. From the moment I first saw it, I watched it for about 10 seconds, then turned to go to my office door to see if anyone else was close enough to call over and see it with me.  No one was there, so I immediately went back to the window.  I was away for approximately, 3 or 4 seconds. When I got back to the window, it was a little further along its flight path, traveling in the same manner as I have already noted. Then I noticed another object, exactly the same type as described, coming from the other direction (180 degrees from the first objects direction), and it was traveling in the exact same manner as the first.  It appeared to be on an exact collision course with the first object. When the objects got almost ""nose-to-nose"" with each other, they proceeded to do one ""loop-de-loop"" around each other. The ""loop-de-loop"" was accomplished by each craft, by increasing elevation.  (If you remember the old ""Hot Wheels"" toy car TV commercials with the yellow ""Hot Wheels"" track and how the miniature cars would do a loop around the track, that is how these objects each appeared to travel around each other, but in opposite directions.)  The ""loop"" was not vertical.  The plane of the loop, would have been at about a 50-60 degree angle, using the ground as the base level for the angle.  (The objects were still at their approximate elevation, just that the angle of the loop’s plane, compared to the ground, would have been about 50 to 60 degrees.) The size of the diameter, of the circular type loop that each did around each other, I would estimate to be approximately twice the length of the distance between wing tip to wing tip, of one of the objects. After completing the ""loop-de-loop,"" each object continued flying in the same matter as I originally described, on each of their respective original courses. I watched each object until both were out of sight. The entire event, lasted from first sight to last sight, approximately 40-50 seconds. Immediately after seeing this, I quickly noted the time, date, and estimated the angles, etc.  Then I sent email to a local TV station, asking if the weather department knew the elevation of the cloud layer that day above Dickson City, PA was.  The station never answered my email.  So subsequently, I was never able to calculate the altitude, distance, or speed of the objects.  Moreover, since then, I cannot find my original notes.  This is the FIRST TIME I am reporting this to anyone. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-03-21T00:00:00,41.4636,-75.6291

The triangle passed in front of a large pine plantation ( I later checked in daylight and this plantation was about 5 km from the road, so the triangle was big and flying very low at that point (the pines were on a slight rise and were about 130 feet high).

There was a small open field to my left. Just then I had a strange feeling come over me, something said look up and there it was, about 100 feet or so in the sky was a plane or so I thought. It was over my right shoulder, I stopped for a second then rode my bike under the ship. It moved real slow, I was not scared at the time. I was not peddling either, just coasting along, and it floated like a balloon would. The color red sticks out in my mind and I don't know why. It was triangle shaped, more like a V or wing. Not really big, about the size of a jet fighter (plane). I saw lights underneath the craft. It happened so long ago I don't remember the details such as markings, engines, or glass. I know what I saw was real. The ship was so close to me I could have hit it with a rock. It finally dawned on me that there was no sound, no engine noise. All I remember hearing was a muffling sound. Like the noise your fridge or deep freeze would make. I still hear that sound now and then. I remember chasing after it but that's all I remember.

I don't remember the exact date. I was taking an evening graduate level chemistry class on the north side of Indianapolis. Class had finished and I was walking through the parking lot to my car. It was about sunset. The sky was clear. Some bright, moving objects in the western sky caught my attention. I remember three objects. Two of them were tracing out a more or less circular path about 180 degrees opposed to each other, as if they were orbiting around a common center and trying to stay as far apart as possible. The third object was moving in its own oval path to the south of the first two. As the objects moved, they would reflect the setting sun, then the reflection would fade and a dark shape could be seen. This is similar to how the sunlight plays off an airliner near sunset, and at first I thought the objects were planes in a holding pattern. However, something that's hard to put my finger on held my attention - something unfamiliar about the shape, or maybe the way the objects seemed to glide or float, different from the way a plane flies. They also didn't seem to bank as they turned. I could hear no sound or see any lights on the objects. As I continued to watch, the third object, the one farthest to the south, started to move east, directly toward me. It passed almost directly overhead and continued east until it was lost in the dusk. As it passed overhead I got a good look at it. The main part of the object was crescent-shaped and seemed to be made of a dull-finished material. It looked dull red as it was overhead. Projecting back from the center of the crescent was a sort of stubby rectangular ""fuselage"" that was highly reflective, like polished metal. This was the part that reflected the sun. There was no sign of a tail assembly of any kind or engines. There was no sound, contrails, or lights, nor could I see any windows. I remember the object seeming to be in the size range of an asprin tablet to a dime held at arm's length. It's hard to estimate the object's altitude and true size. As I said, it was about sunset, but due to buildings and trees I couldn't tell if the sun had actually gone below the horizon. My first impression was that the sun was down, and the object was very high to catch its last rays, which meant it had to be huge. If the sun had still not set, the object could have been lower and smaller. As the object went out of sight, the first two objects were still circling in the west. I'd guess the whole observation lasted about five minutes. I don't know if anybody else in the parking lot saw the objects or not, and I was too fixed on observing to call anybody's attention to them. I never reported the incident, only told a few family members. While this is an old sighting, I thought it might be of interest. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in September 1971 is approximate.

Near the downtown grocery was also a water tower and a police communications tower which were probably high points/tallest objects in the immediate area. We saw a metallic saucer-shaped object with red, green and white lights that appeared the size of a small plane not much higher than the water and communications towers. We noticed it as we headed toward these towers then watched it approach them, hover in a stationary position and then head back east. We attempted to follow its path in the car but lost it fairly quickly. We thought it seemed to head further east toward other communication or radio towers.  My mother was educated, I have two degrees, father is an attorney. We had no reason to disbelieve the existance of a UFO and we had always been star-gazers in the spring and summer months as my mother had taken an astronomy course. We never really told anyone outside our family because at that time there were already so many stories that seemed unbelievable. I guess we just assumed ours would seem just like all the others. But it was as real as  could be. Just like anything else we might have looked at that night, there was no reason not to believe what we saw.  I do not know the exact date or year.

When I was in college I told my physics teacher  regarding this experience and a symbol I kept rememebering. he told me it was a Greek letter and a physics symbol that stood for ""electro-magnetic self propulsed"">.

I saw what appeared to be a very large, trangular aircraft.  What interested me was the fact that it appeared to be flying at an extremely high altitude, yet nonetheless appeared extremely large.  It was all black and a perfect triangular shape.  While I didn't know this at the time, it looked just like the modern stealth B-52 bomber. I listened and could not hear a typical jet engine sound.  It was silent.  It was also moving very slowly.  I saw what appeared to be windows on the bottom of this craft though they could have been tiles.  I watched for about a minute until the bell rang and I had to go to class.

When I looked for the origin of the reflection I saw a triangular shaped object about 1/4 mile or less to my right. It was gray in color with out any markings or windows. The craft was going a little faster than I was going and I speeded up to try to keep up with it. The craft moved towards me slightly and banking like an airplane would. That is when I saw that it did not have a vertical tail like an airplane. I followed it for about one mile when it flew over  the crest of a hill which was covered with mature trees. They were about 60 feet tall. The craft was only about 100 feet above the ground. When I got on the other side of the trees it was gone. I turned around and retraced where I had seen it and made sure about my bearings. When I got to my sisters house I told her about it and of coarse she thought that I was crazy. This happened on a Saturday and the following Friday on the local tv news they said that the radar at the Albany County airport recorded an object heading south from Saratoga Springs at over 4,000 mph and made a right angle turn towawds the east. They said that it happened a week before which is when I saw what I saw. They also said that there were about 40 sightings of ufo's that same day.

Because I was only ~7 years old at the time, I only remember that to this day I believe I saw a UFO at very close range.  It seemed to appear out of nowhere, as I don't remember having any feelings of fright that something was coming towards me.  All I can remember is that while walking towards the housing from the Non-commissioned officers housing side of the road to the officers side, I crossed a small open grassy/weedy space when I felt different and I believe I heard something when this huge ""thing"" seemed to appear out of nowhere impairing my ability to see straight above me. I remember it seemed to be hovering just above tree line straight above me.  It displayed moving colored lights.  At one time I could have said what colors, but the only color I am mostly sure of this many years later is blue.  You would think at age ~7 I would have been horribly frightened.  I was quite the rascal when I was young, so I was likely analyzing everything and at the same time I was a little afraid.  I remember feeling uncomfortable and a little scared, and I did run home after about a minute or so of being awe struck.  I can't remember if I told my mother or father upon my return.

I remain to believe to this day that I saw something that was technologically impossible for that time.  It just took years later to understand that as a child I didn't have much of an idea about technological abilities for that time.  I couldn't sleep so thought I would finally see what I could find about Luke AFB around 1967 with any links to UFO sightings.  I found one specific link that summarized a UFO being right above Luke AFB.  As soon as I saw this, I felt compelled to write something about my experience no matter if it fell into the abyss somewhere or not.  Really the sighting itself has not been that big of a deal.  It's only that I have wondered about things all these years:  What was it, who or what was inside, why was it right above me, was something watching me?  One strange thing too is that since I couldn't really remember how it appeared when it did without me noticing anything before, I had often wondered about the sound or the feeling that something was wrong before it actually happened.  Like I had some instinctive alarm that there was some impending danger, but then dismissed it and ran off.  Or, if something affected me in some way prior to its suddenly appearing above me.  If it hadn't been so fast at seemingly coming out of nowhere, maybe I never would have questioned what it was.  I don't know, and never will. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At the time of this event I was 38 weeks pregnant and 27 years old.  I am now a 30 year old single mother, in a professional field and working towards a masters degree in computer science.  I'm a very grounded, technical minded person who is skeptical of all things that seem illogical or cannot be tangibly seen, and this is why I've waited so long in reporting this event. I was sleeping in the guest room alone due to my being uncomfortable in my pregnancy.  I had just moved to Montgomery, and my 17 year old sister was visiting in order to help me set up the house for the baby.  She was asleep in the den on a sleeper sofa.  Earlier in the night, we'd left the sliding glass doors open to let in fresh cool air because I was always complaining that I was too warm.  I recall that I awoke in the night and instinctively walked into the den, almost as if I were sleep walking, and indeed I believed that I was doing so at the time.  The entire room was bathed in light, coming from the back yard, and it was so bright that I could not see anything in the yard clearly - not the pool ten feet from the sliding glass doors, nor even the patio furniture directly outside.  I could see that there were forty or fifty large moths on the ceiling of the den, and their shadows were long from the light.  At this point I felt a deep dread and blacked out. The next morning I awoke in the guest bedroom with dirty feet.  I went immediately into the den to wake my sister, and shrunk back when I saw the moths on the ceiling.  They were not there the night before when I'd gone to bed, and seemed to me to be evidence of the event.  My sister's feet and bedsheets were not mussed or dirty, and it seemed she'd not been disturbed at all.  Never at any other point while I lived at this residence did so many moths enter the house at one time.",2003-03-21T00:00:00,32.372222543950365,-86.2398247156153

I was walking back to my dorm at Indiana State University at around 19:05 when I looked up between the buildings in front of me and saw a very large fireball that was bright green in the center, and had a tail of orange flame that moved relatively slowly across the sky in front of me.  It looked to fly directly over our campus, west to east, but it was fairly impossible to tell just how large or how high up it was.  It really freaked me out though...  There were about 10 other people within 100 yards of me on campus that noticed it too, and I heard loud yells of astonishment coming out of the windows of the dorms on campus near me (apparently they saw it too...).  Unfourtunatley, I had a limited field of view because of the surrounding buildings, but started to run to try and get a clearer view once it went behind a building, but couldn't get a clear view.  I later heard on the radio that the object had been seen around town, and was being explained away by local authorities as ""space debris"" on the radio.  It was a very big, very dramatic fireball, the likes of would never have imagined.  Later that night, I went with a friend to an observatory on top of one of the classroom buildings to try and see some of the Leonid Meteor action that was supposed to be taking place that night.  After being there for about a half hour, we were standing next to two older couples who were up there for the same reason.  One of the ladies suddenly said loudly, ""what is that?!""  I looked up and after searching for an instant, I saw to my utter amazement a trianguler shaped object with no lights move silently overhead.  The clear night was disturbed by only a few very wispy and insignificant clouds at what looked to be about 2,000 plus feet, and the object just happened to catch my eye because of its movement, but my friend, and the other three older people couldn't spot it.  It was relatively the same shade as the night sky, and again, had no lights on it.  Well I felt like Iw as frozen, I was so surprised by the whole e! xperienc e.  I watched the object for a good 15 seconds before it disappeared above some of the low-level clouds that I mentioned, and was heading from north to nearly due south.  It the single most shocking-awe inspiring thing I have ever witnessed in my life.  To describe the craft in more detail, again, it was triangular in shape, and moving point-forward.  It had molding or cross-beams underneath that met in the center, and extended straight out to each of the three triangle points.  I am extremely familiar with military and civilian aircraft, and wasn't anything I've ever seen or even heard of.  It was completely foreign.  And, again, possibly the wierdest and most disturbing thing was the fact that it had no lights, and flew SILENTLY directly overheadat what appeared to be no more than 4,000-5,000 feet i'd estimate.  I know this sounds nuts, but I swear that it's absolutely true.  TO the say the least, it was one interesting evening.  First, the unbelievable fireball object, and then the UFO that I saw at the observatory.  And the fact that I wasn't even the first one to see the UFO helps me to be able to assure myself that, yeah, this really happened.  I will remember it for the rest of my life.

I heard no sound coming from the object. It flew east to west direction, coming from the direction of the water to the direction of the land.

A US top secret aircraft flying over downtown Stockton.This was not the Nevada desert.Whoever controlled this craft cared not who saw it...Which brings up the most perplexing question to me.Did anyone else see it at all?

The light source went to the horizon.  Normally, at that speed, it should have vanished over the horizon.

Back in June of 1978, my boyfriend ((name deleted)) and I were in the back field sitting in the front seat of his car (65 Chevy Impala).  There was a breeze coming in the side window of the car.  The radio was on, the key was in the accessory position.  I think the Steve Miller Band was on the radio at the time.  I was sitting back with my feet on the dash, so I had a good view of the sky.   The car was facing west, on the two track road behind the house in the field.  I saw a light that looked like a bright star, far off toward the northwest.  The light got brighter, as it zig-zagged downward in a pattern.  It stopped every few seconds and just froze there for a second or two before moving again.  It got larger as it came down, and I said, ""((name deleted)), what the hell is that?"".  I sat up straight in the seat and by then the UFO was directly in front of the car to the west.  The windows were down on the car, and I heard a very loud deep humming noise that I still remember to this day. I will never forget that sound!   I would guess it was about 300 yards in front of us and about 200 feet in the air (?).  At that time the radio went dead.  I could see colors rotating around the UFO around the very edge of the craft.  I saw greenish, blue and white colors.  I began to get scared, and told ((name deleted)), ""Lets go back to the house and get ((name deleted--witness #3))!""  ((name deleted)) tried to start the car, and it only clicked when he turned the key on.  It was the first time that car ever didn't start!!

We all went outside, and stood near the little shed in the backyard.  ((name deleted--witness #4)) stood on the step of the shed, and ((name deleted--witness #3)) told us, ""Feel the building!  There is vibration going through it!""  The sound was so loud that we could feel the vibration inside our bodies.  We just stood there, and I remember saying something about, ""We should tell ((name deleted--individual #5)) about this"".  (He was a man in Central Lake who studied UFOs and had a large antenna in his yard).  The UFO was shaped like a pie-plate.  It stayed there and hummed for about 10 minutes and then slowly drifted off toward the southwest.  I remember all the crickets and grasshoppers quit making any sound.  It was totally silent after the UFO left.  We stood there at least another five minutes and ((name deleted)) and I were too scared to go and get the car.  We left it in the field all night, and when we went back the next morning, it started right up!  All of the details were kiind of like a faded dream even right after that.

There was absolutely no resemblence to a helicopter or airplane I was convinced it was not our ordinary aircraft.  After another minute or so the objecty slowly ascended straight up until it was out of my line of sight.  It is hard for me to estimate the size of the object.

Five us went to the light show at Uxmal in Yucatan, which took place at about nine in the evening. There were about fifty people there. During the show a disc appeared in the air about 50 yards to the right of where the audience was seated. It was about 80 to 100 feet across. It revolved slowly, counterclockwise as seen from below. It was no more than 100 feet off the ground. There were yellow and orange lights around the outside of the disc. When we first saw it, there were things that looked like long thin neon tubes hanging from the edge of the disc. They changed color, and were retracted into the edges of the disc, as it spun around. The top side of the disc was slightly domed, and gave off a red glow. As we watched the disc moved forward, and gained altitude. Then we noticed that there was another one, very high overhead, also rotating and giving off the orange and yellow lights around the rim. We watch the first one climb and then join the other one, and they both moved off toward the west in the sky, until they were so far away we lost sight of them. Some people may have actually thought that it was part of the light show. After it was over everyone moved out of there as fast as possible.

It seemed to be directly in the middle of the moon. Now this craft was very large in size and was lit up all over and just appeared out of nowhere. I mean literally that it was if someone just turned on a bunch of colorful lights.We were traveling eastbound on highway 16 towards U.S. 31and approximately 12-15 miles from GRISSOM AFB. When it appeared i kinda shook my head to make sure i was seeing correctly and turned to the back to look at my daughter, who had fallen off to sleep. I look to my left and it was still there traveling slowly heading in a eastern direction. I then look to the south where GAFB is located and notice in the southern, southern east and straight east sky a numerous amount of aircraft. At this time the large craft ,what i would describe now was in a triangular or a diamond shape that seemed to be picking up speed and gaining altitude. At the first moment i spotted this craft out of my drivers side window (which would be the north) i instantly was like WHOA!! But now that it had been gaining speed i  tried to keep up at a rate of about 80mph but thought that it was not wise to jeopardize my daughters life traveling at a high rate of speed to try to catch something that is impossible to catch. Anyway, this craft from what i could see was now very far from me to the point that i had lost sight of it all together, but the planes were still in the air. i myself had a hard time putting this altogether because i have been really inerested in ufo's but when this sighting happened i thought no way  someone like me that is on the look out for them could actually encounter one.  I firmly believe that this was the real deal and can't really tell anyone for they would call me crazy. I ! have rep orted another encounter to you most recently on large yellow lights in sky hovering. I have no idea what triggered me to recount this, but it is not the only ones i have witnessed.

On a call, I watched a storm cloud moving South, low ceiling, coming directly over the city.  A glimmer caught my eye, underniether the storm cloud, of which I observed 5 pill/saucer aircrafts.  The crafts stayed in relatively close proximity of each other.  They would swing out, in a free flight circle pattern.  Each in a different direction.  This would be my best explaination of what thier movements were like:  They had no boundries as to which direction or speed.  The would scramble from a certain ""dot pattern"".  As Braille is a series of ""dot patterns"" to reprent a certain letter/number, the crafts would swing out tens of yards, and return to the central point, and creat a new ""dot pattern"".  It was a sort of a communication dance.  I ran to the other room and 5 co workers came over to the window to see.  I pointed the crafts out and we each stood in excited silence.  As they watched, I scanned the storm cloud.  At the very south tip of the could (front edge), I saw a 6th ship entirely motionless, as if supervising the Communication Dance. The shape and color of the ships were interesting as well.  They were a pill shaped, most likely the size of a minivan.  They were at to much of a distance to see any detailed caps, lids, handles, or symbols.  Their undersides were a dark shade, possibly to camoflauge when looking up at them, from underniether a storm cloud.  The tops were a very metallic silver, which would glimmer off the afternoon sun, at such an angle to beam under the approaching storm cloud. -6 total Ships -A Communicational Dance -Metallic roofs, and Dark underbellies. -2:00 in the afternoon, plarty cloud sky, storm cloud approaching -My high vantage point from downtown Denver -Ships mainly over Stapleton/Commerce City/Rocky Flats area -Low pressure level storm cloud, which the ships were under, so they weren't very high in the sky (maybe Traffic Helicoper heights) -No lights were seen on ship, fore the time of day -No exhast trails present -No haze, ships has a very clear appearance -All Ships were of the same ""make & model', thus objects not emitted from each other -No beams, just a lot of motion and apparent intentional movement -No change in color, solid colors of the structure -No landings -No sound, due to our distance -No aircraft in the vicinty, but Stapleton is Denver's old airport, and there are Military bases in the area, as well as D.I.A. -No physical distruptions in our vicinty due to activity I, and my co-workers, were Internet Service Technicians working on a sunday afternoon.

We could see the smoke from the fires in Manhatten and were all looking up at the sky, as most people were that day. We were astounded when we saw what first appeared to be an airliner in the sky, but our moods quickly switched when we realized that what we were looking at was much larger than a commercial aircraft. It was somewhat cigar/diamond/elongated shaped and appeared to be rotating like a football in flight. It was not anything that I had ever seen before, or since. The object was also moving at a tremendous amount of speed and I cannot say for sure if it was changing colors or if the rotation was causing the sun to reflect off of the hull in a brilliant white light. The object, from my best guess, had to be approximately 35 to 50 thousand feet up, and once it started to move southward, it moved with a speed I have never witnessed before. There was no sound, and I quickly lost sight of it. We had all thought that maybe it was some kind of military aircraft, but none like any of us had ever seen.

There were lights on top, which we did not find unusual, as this is (was) the case with many buoys. They are frequently placed at a distance close enough for swimmers, and far out enough for boaters. I was soothed by the motion of the lights. After a few minutes, I couldn't say exactly how many, the lights lifted and hovered. They stayed in that hovering position for about 30 or 40 seconds, then flew off. It was not a lazy, slow type of flight, but very fast. They took off to the left of us and were out of sight before I could even blink an eye. I had never, and have not to this day, seen anything that fast in my life. At first I thought I must have been imagining the whole thing, but when I asked my boyfriend, he confirmed to me that he had seen the same thing.

I called my brother over to the window to have a look as I couldn't believe my eyes; even at that age I could tell it was a UFO immediately. We had a very clear view with no restrictions in the way so my brother was able to confirm what I saw.  The object was completely spherical and approx 1m in diameter (without any creases, bumps, folds, depressions or protrusions) and had no lights, emissions, or sounds coming from it, it was completely seamless. It was a non-reflective dull metal colour which remained constant throughout the experience. We watched the object from our bedroom window for approx 15 mins; it was motionless and remained hovering over the fir tree (approx 1m above it) without touching it or anything else for the whole time. We watched it for so long, I guess we were hoping it might move, but it didn't. We then decided to go out and see it, so we rushed out the bedroom down the stairs and out the front door, which must have taken 5-7 seconds as I remember running as fast as I could. As soon as I opened the door I could see the fir tree and the sphere was gone.  To this day its one of the most vivid things I can remember, which can be best described as a ""Seamless Non-reflective giant ball bearing 1 meter in diameter"" hovering for 15mins.

They appeared to be single lights, not multiple lights seen from a distance.  They looked like stars except for they were moving or twinkling.  They were about half or two thirds the brightness of Jupiter.  They moved about as fast as a commercial jetliner does but I'm not sure of the distance, they could have been moving faster.  I don't think it was cold outside so it must have at least not been in the winter.  It was about 1982.  I saw them above Tullahoma Tennessee.  There was an air force base and a space institute nearby at the time.  I think that they are still there.  The triangle and  lights formed was about the width in the sky as an outstretched palm at arms length.  There was no audible sound. They came together from different parts of the sky without ever turning around the way a plane might and came together into what seemed like an isosceles triangle, then moving back the way they had come.

This event happened during the summer on a cloudless day.  My wife and I had stopped at a dairy store she went in as I waited in my truck.  I was parked facing West about a block away was a two story building and over the top of it in the distance I saw an object that was long and wingless heading NE.  The object seemed to be rotating as it went forward. As it rotated it changed color from flat black to shiny silver or reflective like chrome.  Just then my wife came out of the store and I pointed it out she said to follow it. I drove North about 5 blocks West 1 block and North again for another 8 blocks. Meanwhile, the object was angling closer to our location. I was going about 35-40 mph and keeping with it.  Then it slowed to a stop and hung in the air. My best guess is it was maybe 30- 50 ft. long and 200-300 feet in the air.  At this point it was only about a block form my location.  As we sat watching it hang there rotating chrome and flat black a young man walked by and I pointed it out to him and asked what he thought it was, he said he didn't know what it was and hurried on his way.  We watched it for about two or three minutes then it started moving again.  This time it headed So.E we had to go South to an East-west road and by the time we got to the next main road it gone behind the trees and we lost it. We went straight home and called the nearest AF base, Richards-Gabauer, in Missouri to report what we saw.  They said they had no other reports but later that day the local weather man said the strange thing folks were seeing in the was a weather balloon. Imagine that!!

((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS)) Craft seen in the eveing after Sunday evening church services. I reported this before. There was some things I wanted to add to my report. My mom, a friend, an elderly couple we were riding with, and myself saw this craft. It came in from the north, lowered it's altitude which had probably been 100,000 ft. to 80,000ft. It hovered for two minutes, then raised back to 100,000 ft., and then flew south and just disappeared. We had just gotten out of Sunday evening church services and had seen this object talking as I stated before. My friend and I talked about it afterward, saying it back to outer space. I was only a kid at the time, eleven years old to be exact, while I believed in life on other planets and in Bigfoot, I did not believe in u.f.o.s until I saw this craft. It was saucer shaped, and was just a bright round object, white in color. We told the church choir director about it the follownig Wednsday, who asked if it was a helicopter, but my mom pointed out it was too high altitude for a helicoptor. I had wanted to tell all this before to this agency but was pressed for time the last time I did this. This is not a cheap gag, nor a tall tale. This is the truth as well as I can remember over the last twenty-one years. The adults were straight laced. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After work, my girlfriends and I would go to a cul de sac in the back of the country club to hang out and party.  They were building new homes back there, but none were completed. The road was completed and allowed for some privacy, as few cars ever drove by.  That night we,  (there were three of us in the front seat),  were just pulling up to the back of the ""cul de sac""(before having any drinks), when a bright light came over the top of the car.  The three of us were unable to move, it was like we were frozen in time.  We were facing forward and we were unable to communicate or move.  I guess during this time the car shut off.  We all came out of this trance at the same time.  We all began to cry simultaneously and I tried quickly to get the car started to get out of there.  At about the same time we noticed truck lights behind us on the main road leading to the ""cul de sac"". The truck passed and we left as quickly as possible.  What we remebered, we all recounted pretty much exactly the same things, was that the car was shaking, like it was lifted up and dropped.  This was at the very beginning I think, so maybe it was the fact that I could not move and because the car was a stick shift, shook as it was out of gear and shut off?  When we came back, the car was difficult to start and that may have been the fear, maybe I was unable to simply start it, but I do recall the cassette deck being screwed up and the clock on the dash.  We all estimated we had lost about ten to fifteen minutes as we knew when we arrived. We went to a local bowling alley and got a guy we knew to go back with us to see if anything was there.  Unfortunately, we were too frightened and opted to stay down the road about a mile, while he did it alone.  He laughed at us and, of course, this became a joke with our other friends.  I spoke with my father about it later that night and he said it must have been something,(because I had not bee! n home on a Saturday night @9:00 PM since I was in Junior High).  Anyway, I am 38 now, A Financial Planner, sane individual.  All three of us grew up to be responsible, educated, professinal adults.  However, I am unable to forget this event.  Please, I am open to any insight. I witnessed another similar event after this one, I posted that earlier this year.  One of the same girls was with me again. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Well we went out to eat for breakfast about 10oclock and when we were driving back to his house I saw a line in the sky. Its wasnt long, nor short it was in the middle. It wasnt a cloud because it was moving in a different dirrection as in the way the earth was rotating. It wasnt one of those plan theat leave the smoke behind either. So my first 2 thoughts that it couldnt be them so i thought UFO!! Well i starting yelling at my mom look next to the sun (since thats were this craft or object was located). Of corseshe starting yellin back at me I cant look at the sun im driving. Well I got really upset because i saw a UFO (or atleast what i think it could of ben) and noone was there to witness this with me. We then were in my grandfathers house for about 2 hours. We starting drinvin down a really big hill and all of a sudden i scaremd at my mom and yelled ""there it is! its still there!! see i wasnt lieing!!"" Now since he sun was almost down my mom could of looked over in te location this craft was. Now the first thig that also cam to her mind was it cant be a cloud or a plane, so she also belive it was a UFO. We then got to the bootom of the hill, not taking our eyes off this craft, and suddenly, it dissapperd!!! That was the last my mom and I talked about this.

There is a nearby house closer to the base of the mountain, approximately a quarter mile from my mother's home. Other than that, the nearest house is about one mile away. The only access to this area is via one road, which passes by an abandoned quarry. We were hiking throughout the day, and as early evening approched we made a campfire at the end of the quarry, where the heavily wooded area begins, roughly two-thirds of a mile from the nearest paved road. We stayed there until it was all but completely dark, and headed back to my mother's home where my Jeep was parked. The road we walked on splits in two at this area, the left road going to the lower neighbor's house (a summer home for a married couple who are teachers) and the right fork leading to my moher's home. As we travelled to my mother's home one of us spotted a bright light moving through the trees near the house below us. It moved very erratically, swooping up and down, left and right, etc. We all began to look at the light and talk about what it could be, all the while moving closer to my mother's home. As we neared the house the light turned its attention towards us. It looked like a set of car headlights, only they were very bright and emitted no beam. The light was intensely bright but was easy on the eyes. The light maintained an elevation equal to ours, and the distance the light was off the ground is about thirty feet or so. This ruled out most things we could name it as being, and the fact that it made no noise and created no wind was beginning to intriugue us. We approched the house and stood in front of it, the light following and ""watching"" us the entire time. When we stood still, we noticed a second set of lights that appeared to the right of the first. At this time I noticed a third set of lights above the trees to my right, moving up and down the mountainside, appearing occasionally. Our attention was most! ly focus ed on the two sets of lights in front of us, ""inside"" a cluster of trees, about thirty feet ahead of us, if not closer. The lights hovered in place, but moved in an erratic pattern staying about two to three feet in one spot. It looked like it was peering from person to person, checking us out. We all had the feeling that this was unusually strange. The lights had a mesh-like covering. It was like looking at a huge set of diamonds that glowed brightly, mostly with a yellowish-white color. The lights began to move between the trees and appeared to be moving closer, bobbing left and right, but they were moving closer so slowly that you wouldn'y notice them getting closer unless you stared at them. At this time we decided to move up to the deck surrounding the house, and I went into the house to check what time it was. It was 9PM. I went outside onto the deck and joined my friends, who were still watching the lights intently. We continued to watch the lights for about fifteen minutes. All of a sudden, the set of lights on the right shut off, as quick as a light switch. About a second later the set on the left shut off, but they shut off in two stages. This first stage decreased the brightness to about half, then they shut off completely. They also made a sound, they only sound they made that we heard, a sound similar to shutting off a circuit breaker switch. Before shutting off the left side lights angled slightly, the right-most lens being higher than the left. At that moment I said, ""If anyone wants to leave, just say the word"". Two of my friends said yes, and I agreed. We walked quickly to the rear of the house, got into the Jeep, and as I put the key into the ignition I thought about people not being able to start a vehilce when nearby to something like this. Thankfully, it started and I turned on the lights, checked the time, which was 9:20PM, and began to drive slowly out the road. We all peered around the corner of the house, and one of us saw a set of lights streak into the sky straight up, at an in! credible rate of speed. I drove to the nearest public place, which was a retaraunt about two miles away. We got out, looked around at the tree line in the distance, and decided that we were going home to discuss it further. The following day one of my friends and I returned with cameras in hand, but found no trace of what we saw. The trees looked unharmed, there was no disturbance to the forest floor, and everything looked as it should. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about what I saw. We were all pretty freaked out about it at first, but I plan to spend more time this spring and summer up there...I hope to get some answers. My viewpoint on life and reality itself is now changed, and I need closure of some kind. I know that at least two of us will search for answers. Wish us luck. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was driving home from my second shift job in Rush county and drove through Knightstown on state road 40.I was halfway between Knightstown and Dunreith,in Henry County,driving east.No other traffic was in the vicinity as far as I could tell/remember.It was a clear,warm starry night and as I looked off to the northeast,there was a huge black 'hole' in the sky in a triangular shape, probrably a quarter mile ahead of me.I thought I was seeing things so I sped up and rolled my window down to get a better look until I was almost partly underneath a third of it.It made absolutely no sound and as I slowed to about 5mph,I realized how huge this thing was.Paint a triangle in at least 2 football fields,side by side to get somewhat an idea.It seemed to be rotating very slowly but was stationary.I saw very faint colored lights on the tips.I could'nt make out any 'structure'or 'protrusions'on it.Just blackness. I did'nt feel threatened by it,but the size of it overwhelmed me and I drove off quickly for about another 1/4 mile and and again slowed down.As I looked back,it was still just sitting there,hovering.I was just very anxious(and scared) to get home in New Castle at this point to tell my folks what I had seen.I reported it the the H.C.sheriffs office,they took my name,phone# and was told they would check it out.I never heard back from them.I always rode home with a co-worker after that,I never witnessed it again. I've always wondered what would have happened if I had stopped and got out of my car.I sometimes think I missed out on a once in a lifetime chance of being part of something 'special'.In any case,I've never seen or experienced anything remotely like it since.

PD)) The sphere moved in an absolute straight line just above the tree line. I was in the backyard of my residence.  The residence is located in the pine woods of Bastrop County, about 5 miles north of the city of Bastrop.  The back yard was small, only about 30 x 50'.  There were trees surrounding the rest of the house and some small scrubs then larger trees in back of the yard.  I had notice a passenger plane passing over just a few minutes before.  I was shooting a BB pistol when something moving at my left side in the air caught my attention.  When I first looked up, my immediate thought was that it was a dandelion puff then I realized a puff would be too heavy to fly.  Upon closer observation, it appeared to be a sphere in shape, of metalic construction.  It was traveling about ten to fifteen feet above the tree line in an absolute straight line without wavering.  The speed is estimated to be about 5mph.  There was a slight breeze which made me think that this object was under some kind of power or it would have wavered in the wind.  I wanted to get my camera but thought that it would be out of sight by the time I retrieved it.  As the object passed at about a 10 degree angle from where I was standing, and about forty feet away, I opened fire with my BB pistol.  I had my doubts that I would hit it but felt like if I could, I may be able to alter its course.  I shot at it several times and then observed it as it went out of sight beyond the trees in the front yard.  I have relived this event many times, wondering just what it was that I observed.  I have never observed another unexplained object since that time or even before. ((NUFORC Note:  The year of the sighting is unknown to us, given the error in the date submitted by the witness.

We were at a summer resort by the sea, about 45 kilometers on the west of Antalya.Just after dinner, without any alcohol and walked to the sea shore about 75 feet away from our bungalow and our dinning table. Lit a cigarette and seatted on one of the woodden strechs and started to look to the sky. Time was some minutes after 21.00 hours. I noticed the signal lights of an airplane,one red and the other green. The body of object had a color like aluminium but little darker. I did not pay any attention as I thought it was an airplane leading to the airport about 30 miles away. I kept smoking and noticed that the airplane / object was at the same position. I said how come an airplane stays at the same point. Started to look more carefully. At that time the object started to generate powerful red, green and yellow lights. As if the lights were generating from speedy propellers. With the effect of these new lights the body of the object became more visible. The shape was regtangular. The power of the lights were not the same. It seemed as if the power of lights were increasing with the increasing speed of the propellers. Red light got powerful , then the green light got more powerful than the red one. They were like the fancy lights of Las Vegas. Iwas shocked with what I have observed. Called my wife a few times to make her my witness but she did not attend as she was washing the dishes.  Light generation kept on some time then they became weaker and the object went straight up with an unbelieveable speed.

One night in the early spring of 1990,  my younger brother and I were out basically just being  teenagers-preparing for a weekend night of underage drinking and cruising around.  We had to drive about 12 miles down State Highway 6 to Clifton, Tx. to get ice for our cooler since no stores were open in our hometown of Valley Mills.  On the way back, as our beer was cooling down, something happened that made us totally forget our plans.  Between the two towns, as we were driving along, my brother suddenly yelled ""What the hell is that???!!!""  I looked over towards a very large, open field and saw a sight that was probably the most amazing thing I have ever seen.  To this day, over 10 years later, the details are as sharp and clear in my mind as if it had happened yesterday. The object in the field was of enormous size.  It was hovering, probably not even 50 feet above the ground and VERY close to the highway.  I could see the outline of it-oval in shape and dark- colored.  It appeared to be larger than a football field and had a single row of lights along its middle.  The lights were different colors-amber,red, blue, and green; and almond-shaped.  But it wasn't the colors or shape of them that made an impression on me-it  was the light they produced.  It seemed that they were made of liquid or possibly a gaseous substance.  It is very hard to describe, because they were like no lights I have ever seen.  The closest I can compare them to would be neon; but still very different from neon. They were much brighter than standard neon but they didn't produce a glare-it was more like they were glowing.  Something in them seemed to be swirling or moving.  As I said, they were like nothing on this earth. The sighting only lasted a couple of minutes-I slowed and pulled onto the shoulder of the road, transfixed.  We both stared in disbelief and fascination until suddenly fear took over and I stepped on the gas and got out of there as fast as I could!  We were both so freaked out we forgot about our beer and went straight home.  We told my mom and my grandma about what we had seen; and they wanted to see if it was still there.  We drove out to the area, but it was gone. I've told many people about my ufo sighting in the years since; but never reported it officially.  I truly believe that it was not of this planet, and I've often wondered what we might have seen had we stayed a little longer. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in March 1990 is approximate.

The second cluster had only three lights, moving in the same direction, but the third cluster had four lights all moving together but rotating on an axis, in a counterclockwise fashion. The fourth cluster only had three lights, but it was a little different then the rest, because as it went over the highway it rotated slightly, and it reflected the orange highway lights from below.

The camcorder was on, but not recording,(it was on locked mode)and I turned around to look out over the hill, and there was a bright, but small light out at about 45 degrees up from the ground at the horizon, there was no type of sound that I remember hearing.  I looked back around and yelled to my friend, ""Is the camera on?  Are you filming this?"" Both of my friends were already looking at it and the one with the camera replied, ""I just hit the record button.""  That model of camcorder has a mechanism that automaticaly rewinds a few seconds and then starts to record.  When the object slowly faded to nothing, and then I shouted ""Did you get that?  What was that?!""  He said, ""I think I got it, I'm not sure.""  Afterwards we stayed on the hill for around another hour just to make sure that it wasn't a plane that would pass over us, and there was nothing.  There were no clouds that night, and we didn't know how to explain it's eerie disappearance.  We decided to keep all of the facts to ourselves after no one believed us, and now we are reporting to you in hopes of finding any information we can about what we saw.

This event ranks as THE single strangest thing that has ever happened to me in my life and there are two others that witnessed this as well.  I am fuzzy on the date of this event, as somehow, all three of our memories were temporarily wiped clean.  As awesome as this spectacle was, we forgot about it, which to me lends more questions than it does answers; Our memories of this event had just gone away -- that was until last night Dec 29, 2002, when my wife made a comment about a strange looking star, and then she said, ""was that like the UFO you all saw that night?""  Then the forgotten memory hit me like a ton of bricks.  We must have told her about it before our memories lapsed. It was sometime in the summer around July or August when this occurred, we are not for sure the date.  But, ((female name deleted)), my sister-in-law, ((male name deleted)), my best friend and I were in my back yard.  They were smokers and my wife Stacie and I did not allow smoking in doors.  It was very late; I run an e-commerce site and at the time was keeping some peculiar hours due to some temporary bouts of insomnia.  I would guess it to be between 3-5am EST. I lay in a hammock looking up into the clear night appreciating nature.  The only noises to be heard were the whispers of us when we spoke infrequently and the whir of a happenstance car going by on the usually crowded Man O’ War boulevard, a major road running through Lexington, KY, which my backyard borders. A jet in a normal traffic pattern began to fly from east to west.  I heard it above us, the unmistakable whining of the jet engines.  However, this time, the plane sounded distressed, in retrospect, I believe that the tremendous noise, the strain on the engines were the pilots trying to pull-away from the object in front of it.  Although, with some of my memories still being clouded, I believe that the plane may have been distressed and the object in front of it was saving it from disaster, either way, I doubt that I will ever know the whole truth.  Whatever it was, we all now saw it.  We were in awe looking into the sky, we saw an object, which was masterfully crafted, and expertly engineered open it’s hull to accept the whining passenger jet. The massive hovering object sat in the sky above Man O’ War Boulevard, just to our west and allowed the plane to fly seemingly safely into it.  It then closed it’s cargo door and with a strange whining/buzzing/electrical noise took of in a streak leaving behind a tremendous explosion which I assumed was a sonic boom.  It ripped into the night sky creating a huge, beautifully galactic light in it’s wake, reminiscent of the Aurora Borealis mixed with the most fantastic lighting storm that you have ever seen. We sat there now in the wake of a booming explosion, and then quiet, nothing happened.  No neighbors came to their windows or doors to inspect the calamity.  No sirens, which was surprising as Lexington’s Fire Engine Station 16 sat nearly directly below where this occurrence happened. We all looked at each other with many mixed emotions "" fear, dumbfounded ness, shock, amazement.  I said, ""What in the hell just happened here?""  No one answered.  They stared into the sky trying to figure out the grand, celestial event that had just displayed itself in front of our very eyes.  If there hadn’t have been other witnesses to this fact, I would never have mentioned it to a soul for fear of being called crazy.  In the silence, I said, ""You don’t just see something like that everyday "" now do you?"" Tom replied in a dumb struck tone, ""Nope, no you sure don’t "" what just happened?"" I replied, ""That plane was just taken by that UFO."" He then said, ""Yep. Yep it sure did."" Michele laughed and said, ""It sure did. Oh my God.! We were all shaken and a bit frightened, and decided to go back inside to see if ((female name #2 deleted)) heard the commotion.  She was asleep and I awoke her, telling her that we saw a UFO.  We all remember going to sleep at that time.  It was so funny because in the backs of our minds we new that we should do something, call someone, report this news worthy event, but then we forgot, we all forgot. I called ((deleted--female #1)), who is now in Florida last night after remembering.  I asked her if she remembered the UFO, she was greeted with a ton of bricks, her memories somewhat returned.  We talked awestruck for about 15 minutes or so. What I also find funny about the event is that all of the witnesses just after that incident seemed to keep separate from each other.

My elder brother, 2 friends and I were out shooting which on occassions would start at dusk and last all night until just after dawn. We inavariably tried to get some sleep in the FWD from time to time whilst one or the other would keep watch.  It was a very clear night, absolutely no cloud and I estimate ( very roughly ) that we could see aircraft as far away as 5/10 miles. I was sleeping in the back seat when my brother woke me ""Stewart it's the UFO again - Look !"". I woke up half expecting some prank or another - the guys had been out the previous night when I was not there and had babbled on about seeing a UFO which I had dismissed with a ""Oh Really!"" attitude.  When I looked out of my left window and forward towards the forestry commision ground I saw a circular shaped light/ vehicle rise straight up from what appeared to be the forest. I immediately tried to rationalise what I was seeing - I rolled down the window to stop any glass interference but it was still there but had stopped and just hung in the sky at about a 40/50 degree elevation from the ground in relatuion to me.  I would estimate that this object was within 300 yards of us. I asked my elder brother to tell me what it was as I was really at a loss to identify it. He said it was the UFO. I screamed at him - I know it's a UFO but what is it ? ""Its a UFO"" he said rather infuriatingly. As hard as I could I struggled to reason this one out - could it be a helicopter with a night lamp - but there was no noise and I could see only the object not any helicopter or anything else near it. Could it be a light projected from the ground - no because the circle was not just light it had a physical presence ( and I may ot be describing this well ) a sort of texture - It was definately something real not just a light.  I knew by this time that with the best will in the world my friends could not be replicating this. I started at it in awe and then remembered we had the scoped rifles so I took mines out - equiped with a powerful 6X42 scope and started to study it.  I could determine a circular physical shape , bright luminescent , with a ill defined banding around the center but little else could be identified. I must have studied this object for 3 or 4 minutes at about 300 yards and no higher than 200/300 ft.  All the time I was trying to figure out what it was. So far it has risen vertically and quite slowly and then stopped. I knew Helicopters could do this and harrier jump jets but at that distance I would have expected to hear something. There was no wind to block sound.  The craft then moved from it's hover position from my right to my left. It moved quickly with incredible speed but stopped instantly. I know we have fast aircraft but I doubt anything can demonstrate this level of acceleration and it came to an instant stop eg from whatever speed to zero instantly. I had only travelled about 200/300 yards and stopped behind but above the corner tree where the two fields meet, still off our ground but only just off. I shouted did you see that and ofcourse they all did.  We had the night lamps ourselves - these are million candle power lamps and it was suggested by my brother to ""Lamp It"" eg switch on the lamp and aim it at the object. This was not to increase the view of it - that was not necessary - it was more to provoke it or communicate with it in some way. The eldest chap there did not want us to do this - he was very nervous of what he was seeing and did not want the thing to come any closer that it already was.  Behind and below the craft on the horizon I could see an aircraft with its normal navigation lighting heading in our general direction. If the aircarft which must have been 5/10 miles away continued in our direction ( Common site with aeroplanes passing over us at normal height regularly) then it would come close to the bright object albeit the object was still only at about 200/300 ft off the ground. We watched , me through the scope and using the naked eye and the craft just hovered. You could determine some activity eg shimmer/vibration but in was not moving.  The Aeroplane continued to approach and we stared , transfixed by this encounter and eager to see what if anything was going to happen as the aircraft was on course to fly over the object.  When the aircraft was a few miles distant the object moved again. It shot upwards to the left and stopped instantly again. Then it literally accelerated from zero to disappear in a second heading left and away from us. It's speed of departing was instant eg almost in the blink of an eye.  I am not sure of the actual dates and times however within a day or two of our sighting the morning TV programme showed a report on fishermen in cornwall having captured a UFO on video. Whilst I know that video was subsequently disproved or belittled what I can say is that the object we saw resembled what they caught on video.  To say the event had an effect on me - we wanted to go check out the woods where the object rose from but were frightened to without our rifles and the ground it rose from was not ours. I told a lot of people about this and met with a lot of ridicule but I am a very logical person in my early 40's , my brother and his friends are about 10 years older and the eldest was a business man who had retired. I would have given a lot of money to have a video camera that night instead of our rifles.  For weeks I tried and tried evaluate what I had seen and were there any other possible explanations. For the reasons given below I remain convinced to this day that what I was seeing was either a very specialised and earth shattering new aircraft of ours as yet not made public and has not been made public in the 10 years since or that the object was not man made.  1] I believe the object demonstrated intelligence in that it moved vertically then horizontally with amazing acceleration and deceleration ( well instantly stopping ). 2] I had a clear site of the object and even better through my telescope. 3] I am used to seeing british fighters at ground level practising where I used to fish and when they move they make an enormous racket that you can hear for miles let alone 200/300 yards. 4] I had a significant amount of time to study it. 5] My brother is army trained and was involved in flying drones etc as well as aircraft recognition.  Overall I do not know what it was but it still facinates me as to what it could have been. I hope this helps anyone who studies these events. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It seemed to me that the hight was about 10 meters. The formation floated over the trees at the right site of the street. There was no sound. There was no wind that night. It was about 17 degrees Celcius. The formation was made of completely round balls in two circles. The balls in the inner circle were bigger as the balls in the outer circle. They were 'made of' white smoke or clouds (misty?). When I reached my house and stopped, the formation also stopped mooving and I watched it for quite some time. The inner circle rotated slowly in the opposite direction as the outer circle. I looked around if one of the neighbours was still awake, in order to ask somebody if I was imagining this event, but I saw no lights burning. I had to feed my pats and so I entered the house. In the backgarden I tried to find the formation in the sky, but couldn't find it. When I left my house again, the formation was gone. I felt uncomfortable. I cycled back to the centre of town to meet my husband and friends and told them what I saw. I could not give an explanation and realised that I had seen a UFO. One friend told about lasershows, projecting light on clowds, but I was sure I had not seen something like that. A few months later I saw a show like that and this was something completely different. About a year back I saw a picture on Discovery Channel of a UFO that was seen in (if I remember well) Australia, simular to what I had seen. This is the first time I report my observation.

One evening, I was letting our puppy out ((deleted)) before going to bed.  I was outside monitoring him ((deleted)) and I happen to glance up in the sky to check out the weather.  It was a clear night and going over the house, at a moderate speed was a HUGE triangular shaped object.  It was going in a North Westerly direction.  I knew it was a triangle as it had three white lights on each of the three points.  At the base of triangle (in the middle) there were two red lights.  The lights did not flash nor blink and were on constantly.  No other features could be seen.  What was interesting about this vehicle, along with the massive size, was the fact that as it flew over the house, it did not make any kind of noise at all.  As I observed the craft going overhead, I looked around the sky and noticed off to the South West a small plane flying in a North Easterly direction.  I am not sure how far the plane was away but I could hear its engine running.  I could also make out the flashing strobe on the small plane as well as the red and green port and starboard lights.  The next morning, I told my wife (she was working nights on the night in question and wasnt home and I also told our neighbors who lived in the upper part of the house...they too were not home at the time otherwise I would have called them out to witness themselves).  A couple of years later, I was watching the television show ""Unsolved Mysteries"" on NBC and they ran a segment on some sightings in Vancouver...a local radio talk show host had seen some strange flying objects in the sky and had mentioned it the next day on his show - he received quite a few calls into his show from other witnesses. I remember commenting with a great deal of excitement to my wife that I was certain that that was the same sighting I had seen though I couldnt remember the specific dates.  I have told numerous people over the years and most are interested in the sighting. No one has ever been critical or made fun of my story...I think that bodes positively for my reputation. I have thought often about filing an official report but didnt know where and eventually, I considered the time lag too much to report.  While still living at the address where the sighting was, I used to watch large airliners go overhead...they could clearly be heard and were substantially smaller then what I saw flying overhead.  To this day, if I hear an airliner flying overhead (if the weather is clear) I will have a look; I always think back to the sighting and marvel at the difference in sizes.  I dont want my personal information to be released - thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-07-16T00:00:00,49.26892572695909,-123.11223982257269

I placed my drink down and looked at it and wondered, what is that?  As soon as I looked at it I would estimate about 20 seconds it then began to move forward very slowly.  The aircraft did not fly over me, it went on a 45 degree angle and passed over about 50 yards from my left.  While it was approaching my position where I was sitting at I noticed there was no sound, no panels with nuts or bolts, no windows at all and most of all the leaves on the trees did not move and the dirt did not kick up.  I also noticed it had a white light underneath it located on the left side of the aircraft and it was moving back and forth in a slow motion like a scanner or copy machine would do. Im very familiar with aircrafts since I worked around them and I assumed it was an AF stealth stationed at Holloman AFB. Our Stealths are ""NOT"" built with the larger side on front and the smaller end at the back.  This aircrat (object) is triangular and the size of a stealth bomber and it had a very sleek and shiny black color close to charcoal.  When it flew over I heard a whoooo sound such as the wind hitting a telephone line.  I estimate its speed must have been about 25-35 mph. I know it was not a military plane, this one floated with no sound and no pulsion.  I dont know why I did not get up and look to see where it went, I know I sat there in dismay and maybe a little shocked at what I saw.

An erie and unexplainable experience on Grizzly Mountain.,Grizzly Mountain,CA,1994-08-10T01:30:00,light,2hrs,"Occurred : 8/10/1994 01:30  (Entered as : 08/10/94 1:30am) Reported: 7/12/2003 11:03:32 PM 23:03 Posted: 7/16/2003 Location: Grizzly Mountain, CA Shape: Light Duration:2hrs",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29706.html,"An erie and unexplainable experience on Grizzly Mountain. One day my wife and myself decided to go camping above Oakhurst and Bass Lake up in the mountains, she was pregnant with or son at the time.  We headed up to Grizzy Mountain where I've previously hunted since a teenager.  It was late when we got there and I set up our tent and started a fire.  While we sat there enjoying the great outdoors I began to feel very uncomfortable.  That feeling you get as if someone's watching you or your not alone.  I told my wife how I felt and she shrugged it off saying I'm probably just tired.  I agreed and went and sat in the front seat of our car to look for a something I could use as a weapon so I could make myself feel as comfortable as she was feeling.  While sitting in the front seat I noticed a light to the left of a tree top.  I thought it was just a star but then the light moved to the right of the tree top and I began to rationalize it as the rotation of the earth or something or wind blowing the tree tops, yet I felt no breeze and none of the tree tops seemed to be swaying.  I watched the light for awhile as it kept moving from one side of the tree top to the other, until I finally heard my wife call my name and ask what I was doing.  I told her to come sit in the car next to me and watch what I thought I was seeing.  She was quite annoyed by it and felt like I was trying to play a prank or something which she didnt find funny at all because she was pregnant and wasnt in the mood for it.  When she sat in the car I asked her to watch the star/ light and tell me what she thought of it.  After a few minutes she got real close to me and said she wasnt feeling very comfortable up here in the mountains anymore.  She told me she things the light keeps moving from left to right of the tree top and then back again.  That settled it for me.  I knew I wasnt just seeing things then.  Then I felt a boldness and got out of the car and started yelling up at the light saying come on down we're friendly and we mean you no harm.  I want to see what you look like ! and stuff like that.  Truely I was completely scared but by doing this it kept my nerves steady.  Then the wind began to blow real bad and I thought I sensed a movement on the ground it the surrounding trees but I couldnt tell.  The light of the fire was making it too hard to see the surroundings.  I put the fire out real quick and waited a bit so my eyes could adjust to the dark so I could try and see if I noticed any movement.  A few moments later my wife freaked out saying she felt weird and was scared for her unborn baby and ranted about other things I dont remember now.  Then I heard alot of movement in the trees about 30 yards away and it freaked me out.  I jumped in the car with her and told her screw this we're getting out of dodge. I tried to start the car and the freaken car wouldnt start.  We were both really stressin out then.  We were parked facing up hill where are camp was and my car was a stick shift, so I put it in neutral and let it roll back to pop the clutch.  It worked and the car fired up and we took off down the way we came, sky ranch road.  On our way up the road was really clear, but as we sped off back down the mountain trees started falling over next to us and branches were falling off of trees and I couldnt make any sense of where I was at.  I knew those roads like the back of my hand and due to panic or who knows what else, I felt a bit lost.  Then my wife said stop the car, we just passed that same spot awhile ago and I think we just went in a big circle.  I stopped the car and we got out of the car and we started calming each other down trying to reason all this out.  Then I became stressed out again because I knew that there was no way we could have went in a circle.  There was only one way back down that mountain , sure there were plenty of off roads to go elsewhere, but none of those roads would have took us in a circle based on where we stopped.  I couldnt make sense of any of it.  For some reason we both looked up about the same time and we both saw a blue glowing ligh! t with an ovalish/ coccoon shaped object spinning within it.  I was in awe.  It was so pretty yet so weird looking.  My wife jumped back in the car and said drive damn it.  I jumped back in the car and told her we arent going any further.  My instincts told me that when your panicing its best to just stay put and calm down regardless of the situation.  Think things out.  I checked by watch and I knew it was almost morning time and we could just wait it out.  Whatever it was it was sure to leave when the sun came up.  While waiting we both faded in and out of sleep until  I noticed things were getting alot lighter.  Thank God the sun was coming up.  When the sun came up we just sat there in the car holding each other.  I asked her if we just both had the craziest dream or what?  She said theres no way we could have had the same crazy dream and she wanted to leave.  My stubborness wouldnt let me just leave though.  I wanted to go back to camp and get my tent and belongings.  She said forget them, we can get more, but I wanted my stuff and my curiousity was killing me.  I wanted to troll around the camp in the woods and see if I found anything strange.  We got back to camp and packed things up and walked around a bit and noticed a large burnt area up aways from were we camped.  We felt real creepy again and both agreed to leave.  We told my Mom about it and my Step Dad when we got back.  My Mom was way curious because she knew I never was a story teller and never made things up.  My step Dad was probably thinking just the opposite after hearing what we just them.  We never told anyone else though.  Thought people would laugh or make fun of us.  A few months later though my Mom talked her husband into taking them up to the same spot to camp.  He knew exactly where it was at.  Hes been hunting up there for years.  The next day we went by there home and they told us they went up there to camp, but they didnt stay.  They both told us that they felt really uncomfortable at that camp spot and felt like they were ! being watched or something.  They came off the mountain the same night and came home.  I havent been back to that sight yet and dont plan on ever going there again. When I found this web site right now I couldnt resist telling our story.  It feels real good to be able to talk about it again.   Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We will attempt to confirm the date.

I saw similar in Georgia a few years ago. Mine was, I thought the moon until I realized it was moving horizontally right at the tops of the trees very slowly. It moved from the left side of my property to in front (I lived on a hill in a very rural area of Georgia). Impossible to tell how close or how large it was. Couldn't have been far or I couldn't have seen it thru the trees. Was also about 9pm at night, clear night in November. I did call a UFO org and a very nice fellow came up from Atlanta to talk to me, he took notes but came to no conclusion. Didn't dare call the local cops since I could just guess their reaction.  When the thing came around to the front I was so creeped out I went inside. I just didn't like the looks of it and I was isolated and alone there on the property. No neighbors within sight or hailing distance and 1000 acres of lumber company land to my right (where it was heading).  Memory gets less trustworthy thru the years of course but I would guess it was about the size of a quarter held at arms length. What the rising moon would look like at any rate, pale, no flashing lights or sound at all.  Updated information to above sighting report below:  It was in Banks county Georgia, I'm about 50 miles above Atlanta.  I had gone out to bring the cats in, around 9:00 in November, clear as a bell outside and saw this thing thru the trees. I thought 'oh how lovely the moon is' until I realized it was moving horizontally and not at all in the right place for the moon, I of course said something like 'oh s*' and just stood there in total amazement and watched it very slowly circle my property from the left of my house to the front, across the pasture.. The trees were bare so I could see it clearly and it stayed right at basically the same level. You are right it was too big for a helicopter and a solid softly glowing object, no flashing lights no noise, So not a blimp and too close to the trees for that also.....I wracked my brain trying to come up with some sort of perfectly ordinary object and failed.  Why is it they are so creepy? You mention that too. When it came around to the front of my house I went inside, I honestly felt I didn't want to be around if it got closer. I don't worry about airplanes and I wasn't nervous living out in the boonies by myself (humans would be my major worry there), but that thing made me nervous after that, about wandering around at night. On one hand though you want to see it again because you just can't believe its not something known, and perhaps the second time it might reveal itself.  I enclose a picture of approximately where it was when I went inside, it was about to go into the trees to the right and I figured I would either lose sight of it or it would move toward me. In reviewing this picture it was probably more the size of a dime held at arms length rather than a quarter...at any rate MUCH too big to be a star....hmmm swamp gas maybe....but what the heck is swamp gas ;-)  Don't forget me if you get some ideas, and God Bless for taking those sightings. Its important to get them down and believe me it helps to discuss these weird things with someone else.

It was moving in a slow speed, and it blended with the night sky. I didn't see any lights on it ,but it was flat looking with dark spots on it. As I looked at it I crossed the street in a daze & stupidly went into the bank to get my money out real fast ,so I could come back out and look at it,and show it to my boyfriend. It was moving so slow that I thought it would still be out there when I was finished. When I exited the bank I crossed the street looking up into the sky,again like I was in a daze and then I heard tires screeching & a car almost hit me. Still I was in a daze until I got back in the truck,and said to my boyfriend ""did you hear that noise?"" naturally he didn't because he was playing with the radio. I explained to him what I saw,and we drove around town to see if we could find it. I also tuned into the radio to see if there was any reportingsthere wasn't any,but I was told that peole did report seeing something,but I haven't found anything on it. I was never one to believe in the whole UFO thing ,but till this day I question ""WHY"" & ""WHAT"" came over me to not get my boyfriend out of the truck at the very moment & tell him,and what happened to me that I would walk across a main road without even realizing the traffic?

(Apache County is very close to the New Mexico border).  Three other people were staying at my rural home near Concho.  I arrived home at about 10 in the evening (the joys of self-employment) and as usual, the three of us sat at the kitchen table, catching up on our respective days.  One of my guests, who faced the window, exclaimed ""Holy *fill-in-the-blank*! Did you see that!""  He and one other, a woman, had seen a UFO streak by, apparently crashing.  They said there was fire in the object's wake.  I thought at first that they were talking about the comet, but they insisted that it was a craft of some sort.  We jumped in my Suzuki (resembling a white jeep), with me at the helm, still wearing high heels and skirt, and raced off in search of the crashed object.  We crossed State Highway 61 for a wild ride along an old cattle trail.  At the highway, an elderly couple had parked their white travel van and were standing at the highway, staring off into the field.  They asked if we had seen the UFO crash and I told them that we were going to try to find the crash site.  They had been driving westerly along Highway 61 toward Show Low when they saw the object streak by and appear to crash, and also described the ""fire tail"" that my guests had reported.  They were very exicted about this, and if I had more room in the jeep, I think they would have come with.  They pointed to us where they thought the object crashed.  This area has few trees -- some scattered cedar and junipers -- and a lot of rock and canyons.  I drove about 30-40 miles an hour down the cattle trail and across the rocky fields.  Periodically, we would slow down so that my passengers could move rocks out of the way.  Driving through these conditions at that speed, with the greenish glow of the comet overhead, was both nerve-wracking and surrealistic.  I was quite concerned that I'd roll the Suzuki and kill all of us, but the two who had seen the crash insisted that we keep going on.  After about an hour of this, we arrived at a very deep canyon and could drive no further.  Deep in this canyon (approximately half a mile down, at the bottom) was the crashed UFO.  It was an oblong, egg-shape.  The color was strange -- it was the color of a caucasion's skin with a fading tan, and it faintly glowed. The glow was sufficient enough to illuminate the bottom of the canyon. There were two ""pillars' for lack of a better word at the ""front"" of this object (I call it the front because that was the portion that was visible to us).  These pillars may have been posted on either side of a door -- although a doorway was not visible.  It was about the size of a barn typically seen on a small dairy farm in the midwest.  Oddly, there was a helicopter down there and a black pickup truck.  We were baffled how that truck could have gotten down the remote canyon so quickly, unless there was some road that we did not know about.  In any event, we watched this for awhile and then left. By this time, I had put in a 16 hour work day, hadn't eaten and was simply exhausted.  Nothing seemed to be happening; we did not see any people or any activity. Unfortunately, in our haste to find the crash site, we failed to bring a camera along.  We were so far out in rough country that we got lost and it took approximately 3 hours to get back home.  Later, I went to a local meeting about UFO sightings and sat next to an amiable woman who turned out to be the editor of a magazine that used to circulate here called ""White Mountain Sightings.""  We engaged in small talk while waiting for the meeting to start.  She told me she was desperately trying to find a woman who drove a white jeep, who chased after a UFO a few weeks earlier.  I told her that would be me, and gave her the same story I just reported here.  The elderly couple we had seen at the highway had filed a report with this editor.  If this is something worth more information or follow-up, I can try to locate the witnesses and the magazine editor.  Most everyone has moved from this area, but I believe that this report can be verified.  The witnesses would include the three guests at my home, the elderly couple, and myself.  This is not the first UFO I have seen, and I've seen quite a few odd things in Apache County.  However, it is the only crash that I have seen and this is the only sighting in which I have had other witnesses.

Most of my friends had their back turned and didn't see what I saw but one friend saw it out of the corner of his eye and yelled what was that.  What I saw was a bright light in the sky.  It a round ball of light.  It was about a hundred yards away hovering over the trees on top of the mountain.  It didn't make a sound.  My friend saw it when it zipped really really fast down the mountainside in a zig zag motion and faded out of sight.  I was compeltely sober.  I am a skeptical person by nature but I know what I saw.  It could be a human made aircraft that the government is not talking about but it definately was not a plane or helicopter. I may have written it off as a halucination if my friend had not seed it too. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)),2003-07-16T00:00:00,37.8015,-79.5123

It was a split second later that a spherical craft passed the plane in the opposite direction. This craft was moving at a very high rate of speed. I did not take my eyes from it, I thought it would dissappear at any moment. To my disbelief the craft made a sudden turn west towards my location. The day was sunny and mostly clear with some clouds. When this thing came over, once again I thought it was going to be gone. It was very quick and the craft started to dance in the sky. It litterally stopped to change directions and went east to west up and down (diagonally). I would guess the average travel distance was about one half mile per each direction change. Each traveled distance was done a second or so. It actually would at times pause in and out of the single cloud that was in that area. It went in the cloud, and when I thought it was gone it would pop out somewhere else. The craft finally left. I am surprised not to see any other reports in my area, but I am convinced that I would not have even been aware of this if I had not been focused on the aircraft that it intersected.

Four saucer shaped black and shiny UFOs flying in a straight line formation from south-east to north-west have been observed for several minutes in the northern part of Dublin not far from the airport. They attracted my attention because of some pulsating effect as I was bird watching on this sunny and clear sky afternoon in my garden. I ran to grab binoculars (Nicon 10x/50mm) and et voila they were really well visible flying saucers to my total astonishment. Then I've concentrated on one as they were about to hide below the roof and sun glare. It had an asymmteric bulge rotating with about approx. 1-2 times a sec thus producing an oscillating effect as the material is pitch matte black but extremely shiny (like metallic) at certain angle to the sun. No portholes, no signs, no trail, no sound, speed was that of an aircrat roughly, but nothing like an aircraft I've ever seen! It flew ignoring the usual airport air traffic, but there happened to be no craft flying at the time I was watching them with the binoculars. Total calm, no track or exhaust visible. The propulsion system, steady majestic way of flying and perfect formation were astounding. I wish I had my camera loaded with film and tele lense attached, but there was no time for that.

I have always had an interest in the so-called 'paranormal', but UFO's were never really a huge interest and my approach to unexplained phenomena is that of an open-minded skeptic, seeking out logical and most probable explainations before launching into metaphysics and talk of aliens or elaborate government conspiracies. At the time of the sighting I had been attending community college for graphic design, and working at a bookstore. I am currently between jobs and college, and plan to attend Flagler College next year to major in psychology. I have no respect for people who tell tall tales just to get attention or for laughs at other people's expense and at the expense of legitimate investigation of this phenomena, and I have nothing to gain by reporting this other than adding to the body of information you are collecting that might lead to finding similarities and patterns in sightings for better understanding this phenomena.  My sighting happened three years ago, in 1999, but it is still burned into my memory, it was so shocking and out of the ordinary, like nothing I'd ever seen or expected.  Sometime in August, in the early morning (around 2-3 am) I awoke from sleep in the condo I live in with my parents. This wasn't a usual occurance for me, as I usually sleep soundly through the night...but this of course might not be directly connected to the sighting and just a coincidence. I went into the kitchen to get a glass of water, and I sat down on the couch for about 5 minutes, sipping the water.  For some reason, whether it was on my own whim or something else that compelled me, I felt that I wanted to step out front. Maybe it was a completely self-willed decision, simply a desire to enjoy the night air, or the more unlikely scenario which has crossed my mind a few times that something/someone else compelled me...I don't rule that out but I find it the more improbable of the two possibilities.  I remember opening the front door, closing it behind me, and just as I stepped away from the door I heard an extremely loud sound, exactly like or very similar to the whine of a jumbo jet. A split second later I looked up to where the sound originated, and above me was a huge craft which seemed to be flying very low, coming towards me from (I think) the east. Incidentally, it was coming from the direction of the indian river lagoon, across which is Kennedy Space Center. It was so large and that I couldn't get a proper perspective on its exact proportions relative to how low it was flying. My best estimate is that it was at least one and a half or twice the size of a jumbo jet and only 100 to several hundred feet overhead. It seemed to be going rather slowly at first. It blocked out my entire feild of vision of the night sky and covered the roof of my condo unit which was to the left of me with its shadow. I couldn't tell what shape it was, it seemed flat on the bottom with lights, which I think were white. I only had about 10 seconds to take it all in, and it galvanized me, I just stood there dumbfounded. As it went over my head, I turned around...and this is the most puzzling thing...it had completely dissapeared!  I have heard that certain UFO'S can dart from place to place with amazing speed and precision, so maybe this is an explaination for the mysterious 'dissapearance'. I also cannot rule out the possibility that it was all a hypnogogic hallucination since it had been about 6 minutes since I woke up, but as I said I am not normally given to visual or auditory hallucianations, especially of such a vivid nature.  After the incident, I was literally shaking, and I went in the house. I expected my mother (not to mention the whole condo complex) to be awake by then since the jet-like noise the craft was making was loud enough to wake everyone within a block or two of me. But my mother, and everyone else it seemed, was either sound asleep or still in their house. I found that very odd, because it would logically follow that whatever it is I saw would have woken people up, it was so loud. One detail I do not recall is whether I felt a vibration or not...for a craft of this size and loudness, if it was following the known laws of physics, it would have shaken the windows and I would have been able to literally feel the vibration in my bones. I was so astounded and shocked in the few moments I encountered it that I simply cannot recall if I detected any vibrations. But I tend to think there wasn't since if there was, as I said, it would have woke people up, possibly even shattered some windows.  I debated whether to wake up my mother, and decided not to. I also debated with myself whether to call the police or not, I was curious if anyone else had reported sighting this craft. At the time I thought NASA might be test flying something but it would have had to have been using technology only science fiction writers dream of, and that didn't seem logical to me. I didn't report my sighting to the police because I felt kind of absurd about the whole thing, and couldn't picture myself calling in the wee hours to report a UFO sighting with lights and all, I was afraid they would assume I was a prankster,  and there is really nothing they could do about it anyhow.  Living so close to the Space Center, I am familliar with the effects of the space shuttle launches, especially when it breaks the sound barrier...our windows shake and you can hear and feel the vibrations. When the shuttle lands here in Florida, one can hear a very loud sonic boom. Of course, this craft was not traveling at any speed great enough to break the sound barrier, and it was flying low, but it should have been equivalant to one or two jumbo jets flying very low overhead, as if they lifted off moments earlier. I am thouroughly puzzled by this and its one of the main reasons I cannot logically rule out that it was a hallucination.  So there is my report. I swear by all that is sacred to me that this is not a lie or a joke. I respect what this organization is doing to collect information on legitimate UFO Sightings without dismissing us all as cranks and lunatics.  Ever since I experienced this sighting I have always been curious if anyone else has had a sighting similar or identical in nature to mine. I've heard and read about several types of UFO sightings, but have never come across details of any sightings that completely match mine. Most of the sightings I have heard/read about involving craft of the gigantic size I saw (perhaps it was one of those triangular shapes?) was not accompanied by any loud high-pitched jet noise, but were completely silent. If anyone reading this knows of similar sightings or has experienced one themselves with many or all of the same characteristics, I would be interested in being informed of this.

We contiued to watch it for a few minutes and it came closer and closer.  We couldn't hear anything but we were pretty sure it was a helicopter with its landing lights on or somthing.  As it came even closer the light shut off, and all we could see were a few green lights. We both just stood and watched in amazment as it came right over us probably only about 100 ft up in the air.  We could feel the air around us moving and a wind picked up, but still hardly ANY SOUND. All we could hear was a chopping sound like a helicopter would make but only faintly.

Aurora borealis looking lights on the horizon shoot overhead to form a pulsating circle consisting of eight curved rectangles.,Albrightsville,PA,2002-10-15T21:15:00,light,3 minutes,"Occurred : 10/15/2002 21:15  (Entered as : 10/15/02 21:15) Reported: 12/29/2002 12:10:13 PM 12:10 Posted: 3/21/2003 Location: Albrightsville, PA Shape: Light Duration:3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26786.html,"Aurora borealis looking lights on the horizon shoot overhead to form a pulsating circle consisting of eight curved rectangles. My husband and I, two elementary school teachers, were driving around 9:15 P.M. south on the Pa. turnpike (Rt. 746) just south of exit 35, the Pocono exit near Lake Harmony.  There was great visibility for several miles since we were high in the mountains in spite of the rain and mist.  Straight ahead in the southern sky above the tree lined horizon we both noticed from 5 to 8 undulating, free-formed, fuzzy-edged, vertical shapes consisting of medium to light blue lights waivering back and forth.  Their length was approximately 1/16 of the total curve of the sky.  Our first thought was northern lights or swamp gas.  However, in a flash, these hazy, soft, undefinable shapes shot to the ceiling of the thick cloud cover overhead.  While still maintaining their fuzzy edges, they took on fairly distinct slightly curved rectangular shapes that together formed a huge broken circle that must have covered perhaps a hundred square miles. There were approximately 8 of these soft-edged blue rectangles with convex and concave ends equally spaced apart.  The whole circular configuration looked like a sliced, sectional donut of bluish-white lights.  As we watched, suddenly the lights began pulsating in and out, converging in the middle and then expanding back to the original size at approximately 1/2 second intervals.  In an instant it shot down to the right side of our field of vision into a smaller, pulsating formation, maintaining the same shapes while hovering about 1/3 of the distance above the horizon. It held the same configuration for about 15 seconds when again it traveled back to its original position into the same immense circular arrangement of rectangles.  After pulsating for about 5 seconds, the formation converged and flew over the sky to the northwest horizon, behind us.  At this point, since I was driving, I couldn't see it, but my husband said it shot up through the night in a semi-radial pattern with equidistant spaces between each pale blue wide beam of diffused light dissipating to black. There were several cars on the highway at the time.  We wondered if anyone else had seen this phenomena.  Lights from the ground cannot be an explanation since no source on the land could have sent its beams that far.  Besides the light seemed to come from above.

PD))  slow moving object evolves from a light green colored embryo shape to a full saucer with tent top and wht bulb like trim. Object appeared, without the use of camcorder, as a bright white round light the size of a pencil eraser in the Southern skies of Santa Fe. As I started to film, the object looked like it was starting to fry like an egg until you started to see the bottom appear to start rolling up from the bottom. The object all the while started to pitch a pointed roof on top as the bottom rolled up to the middle where there was a slow revolving red light. As it continued slowly rotating, the pitch of the roof started to flatten out as round folding table top looking wings started to develop. The object then evolved itself into an object that looked much like a garlic or acorn. This means that the pitched roof on top of object sucked itself in like a flexible piece of aluminum while the bottom body remained looking like the bottom part of a garlic. As I continued to film for 15 minutes more, the object flattened out for another 3 to 4 minutes, meaning you could no longer see the top at all, however, the bottom finally started to flatten itself out horizontally like the traditional frisby like looking disk. As I filmed for another 3 to 4 minutes, the object popped (or should I say sprouted) it's roof up from the inside up then out just like a mushroom or a volcano. Once the new top was on the craft, you could see  small little white light-bulb looking type fixtures around the trim of the disk. The bulbs appear to be revolving or e-volving around the craft slowly like maybe 2 to 3 miles an hour. I continue to film this object every morning if skies are clear. I have tried desperately to get help from various individuals from media members to my friend who is a priest. I have cordially invited several individuals to join me as I film but have not been succesful. I don't know whether they believe I am crazy or if they are having a hard time manipulating all the detail seen on the video?

We were returning to San Francisco along I-5, when at some point after passing through Buttonwillow or thereabouts (it could have been even further north than that, but it was a few years ago) I noticed 3 white lights in the sky to my right at about 1000 ft.  I was the driver in my Jeep Wrangler with the top down, so the lights were easy for me to spot.  What was interesting was the position of the lights - they were almost completely vertical. Eventually they became obscured by a tree line and I continued driving for about 5 minutes when I came upon an open field and realized the object was descending.  It just seemed odd and I was curious, so I decided to pull over and try to get a better look at it (much to my friend's dismay!) As it descended, the 3 lights leveled out and it descended to just a few feet above the ground.  As soon as it was level and was skirting across the field in my direction, one of the 3 lights, the one in the middle, faded out completely as though it had been switched off.  It continued in our direction and it looked as if it would quickly overtake us when suddenly it shot back up in the air, again sideways, the third light came back on, and it seemed to cover quite a bit of distance in a short amount of time heading southeast.  Then, apparently following the same course, it repeated the above...  again it descended in the same field, light went out, came toward us, again it shot upward and sideways, and again headed southeast along the highway.  It did this 3 or 4 times, and then it finally headed southeast and  disappeared fairly quickly.  By this time my friend was freaking out and wanted to get out of there, so we continued on our way.  At first I thought it was a glider of some kind because it made absolutely no noise the entire time.  But I was under the impression that glider pilots generally fly during the day and at higher altitudes, and I don't think it would hav! e been fast enough to cover as much ground as it did when it gained altitude and headed away from us.  It also didn't look like any glider I've ever seen - it was dark, almost black and it was hard to discern its shape until it was almost right on top of us, and even then if it wasn't for the position of the lights we may have had a harder time noticing the outline as a sort of flying wing similar to a stealth bomber or something.  By this time my friend was freaking out and wanted to get out of there, so we continued on our way.  I have absolutely no idea what it was, but I always assumed there had to be some logical explanation, like maybe some kind of crop duster, an experimental aircraft, or maybe some crazy guy flying a home-brewed glider in the pitch black of night.  Whatever it was it was wierd. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-07-16T00:00:00,35.4383,-119.4912

I was at a stoplight when I thought that it was very close to the ground (est. 500-600ft) and couldn't imagine an airplane being in such close proximity.  It was at this point when I realized that it appeared to be stationary and not moving.  It was approx. 1/8-1/4 mile down range and to my left as I was at the traffic light and as I continued on my way the road curves to the left and the object was now directly to my left about 9 o'clock and still 500-600 ft in the air.  At this point I stopped my car in the middle of the road and rolled down the window to try and hear if it was a hovering helicopter or something.  It was dead quiet and now I could see that there were two distinct red pulsing lights to the rear of this object.  They pulsed slowly and intermittently.  I stared at this object in utter disbelief all the while waiting for another car to come by so I could verify this with someone else.  There were no other cars around.  I couldn't believe it and as I continued to stare at this thing for about 30-45 seconds I know it was completely still in its position.  Very bright forward lights with no defraction of light, by the way, and slowly pulsing red rear lights.  After this duration of time, this ""thing"" completely catapulted forward from its position roughly 1/4-1/2 mile away within 1/2-1 second.  When it did this I had a distinct guttural vibration of some sort and it took off like that and slowed immediately.  I literally screamed and took off to come home.  After I made my left turn at the next light  I knew I could see this object about 1/4 mile down the road and to my left because it was a clear view from there.  As I passed this area I could see the red pulsing lights, still the same distance above the ground but it looked to be about 3/4 mile away and it seemed to be slowly moving in that direction (away from me).  I made my right turn to enter my housing! development (300 feet away) and as I was going down this road I kept looking in my rearview mirror to see if I could see anything at all.  As I was driving down this winding road, all of a sudden this ""craft"" of somesort appears at my 11o'clock and coming directly overhead on a slight angle so that as it passed over I would then be at my 5 o'clock position.  It still seemed to be about 500-600 feet above ground and I again stopped my car in the middle of the road and rolled down my window to stick my head out to get a better view.  I was literally shaking with fear and/or excitement, I guess.  As it passed over me very slowly, I could make out what seemed to be underneath structure of some sort with 4 additional ""lights"" facing downward.  Because of the location of the red still pulsing lights, I had the distinct impression that it was sort of triangular in shape but more like a wedge/boomerang.  It was moving very slowly and didn't make any noise at all.  It was extremely quiet and it traveled out of my sightline (many trees line this street)and I raced home thinking it was going to turn around and follow me.  I don't know for sure if it was the same craft as I observed prior to this, but I am convinced it was the same shape and size.",2003-07-16T00:00:00,39.7615,-75.1245

My friend poo-pooed me with his thoughts on the subject but I think they are typical of the crafts that I have seen many times on TV.  It would be nice to have some one look at these and give me an expert opinion. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Incident: Gigantic ""Stealth"" Object Encountered Near Halleck, Nevada Date: Late Nov./Early Dec 2002 Location: Hwy. 229, 10 mi. SE of Interstate 80, 25 mi. ENE of Elko, NV (Elko County) Number of witnesses: 1 Description: Shape, Size, Altitude, Speed of object all unknown; No discernable features, no lights, just black void in sky casting giant shadow on ground. Witness account: Between 12:30am and 1:00am on a Saturday night in late November or early December of 2002 (not sure of exact date), I was driving my truck northwest on Nevada State Highway 229 just a mile or two north of the Lamoille/Ft. Halleck Road (dirt), from which I had just exited.  I was scouting out good vantage points for nighttime photography of the Ruby Mountains, the west slopes of which were now about 7 miles behind me. Under a mostly clear sky with a bright moon, I was cruising very slowly along the road, stopping occasionally to glance back and evaluate the panorama for good shooting locations.  This was perfectly safe to do because the road has an EXTREMELY low volume of traffic, especially at night.  As it turned out, on this particular night I encountered no other vehicles on the road.  Hwy. 229 is used primarily for access to local ranches and to the Ruby Lake National Wildlife Refuge (about 60-70 miles south and lying on the east side of the Ruby Range), and for all practical purposes would give a first-time visitor the impression of being a closed but well maintained seasonal road. I had just descended into a shallow ""dip"" in the landscape about a half-mile across and then came to a complete stop.  I turned off my lights so I could better view the full distance behind me under moonlight, and left my engine running just in case I had to quickly clear the way for any approaching traffic. My truck windows are heavily tinted, preventing one from getting a crystal clear view of distant nighttime surroundings.  Since it wasn't too frigid outside, I rolled down my driver's side window to look back toward the mountains and see if any light pollution was visible from rural homes or ranches.  However, this only gave me a good view of everything on my side of the truck, so I had to alternately look through the back window to see the land to the rear and rear right. While I was turned to my right and looking out the rear window, I became aware that the bright moonlight I had been bathed in all night was suddenly not there.  As I described to a friend recently, what happened during the next few seconds was a lightning fast series of thought processes and internal debates with myself in trying to rationalize why the moonlight was gone when no clouds were present to obstruct it.  At no time was I in a panic.  Everything happened too fast for me to develop any sense of fear about the situation.  Maybe it was because I was preoccupied with my scouting mission and not dwelling on thoughts of being all alone and vulnerable out in the middle of ""J.S. Nowhere."" I guess my first reaction was to look up through the rear window thinking I might spot a large owl or other nocturnal bird of prey, which had swooped down low over the truck.  I saw nothing ... and I mean NOTHING ... no moon ... no stars ... just pitch black.  However, the shadow covering me persisted.  I shifted my eyes downward onto the landscape behind me and could see a sharp outer boundary of the shadow about 1/8 of a mile back down the road (beyond that, the land was visibly lit by the moon).  I then spun around and looked out my open driver's window to see the western boundary of the shadow, about 100 yards away, moving at a brisk pace toward me.  So whatever was casting this shadow was moving west to east. I stuck my head out the window and looked up, but I saw absolutely no discernable shape; just a mysterious mass of darkness the size or altitude of which I simply could not determine.  In the span of about 15 seconds, the shadow moved across the area where I was parked and disappeared over a low hill to the east side of the highway.  The moonlight now once again flooded the truck and immediate surroundings. Not having seen or heard the source of the shadow (my truck engine remained running during the incident), I have absolutely no idea how big or how high the object was or how fast it was moving.  All I know is that it was huge enough to cast a shadow I estimate to have been up to 1/4 mile across and moving about 30 - 40 miles per hour. The odd thing about this whole experience is that I never felt frightened or in any kind of danger.  I knew that something strange had just happened, but didn't really fathom the weirdness of it until sometime later.  In fact, I was only recently prompted to report this experience. All the above is fact as I remember it.  Now for the conjecture.  My belief is that the object was some sort of experimental aircraft, perhaps a mega-sized ""stealth blimp"" much like that reported numerous times since the early `90s.  I believe one of the most famous sightings of such a craft occurred just a few years ago in southern Illinois.  It was reported by several policemen, who tracked it into Missouri.  If what I witnessed (or didn't witness) was some kind of experimental military craft, it was far from any test facility, where you'd expect to find such a vehicle.  Could it be that developers wanted to see how far out of the safe zone they could fly this thing without being spotted by the citizenry?  Unless someone else saw it before I did, then the testers succeeded in flying the device some 300 miles from the nearest test site - the Nellis Test Range (part of which is better known as ""Area 51"")- before it was spotted ... or at least detected by yours truly. Even if anyone else on the ground experienced what I did that night, they were probably just as perplexed as I when they looked up and couldn't see any definite, solid object in the sky above.  So my question to readers is whether or not anyone else has encountered such a virtually invisible object elsewhere in Nevada or any other place. One interesting sidenote to this:  Just recently, I caught the tail end of a radio news report about an ""unknown, unauthorized aircraft"" flying low and disturbing livestock on ranchland in the Crescent Valley area (90 miles SW of where my encounter took place).  I didn't get enough details about that particular sighting, but I gathered from the story that it was a follow-up to a previous report from some weeks prior.  I'm now wondering if that sighting actually occurred the same night as mine.  If there is anyone out there, especially in the Elko, Carlin or Crescent Valley area, who might have more info about the other sighting, I'd like to know so I could follow up and maybe start piecing together the puzzle.  If this is indeed some kind of stealth blimp, how big could it possibly be ... and why would it be so big? ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

First off let me say that I live near Sioux Falls but would like to remain anonymous. Still can't believe I'm telling this but here goes. Around 12/07/02, at approximately 2330 hours, I observed a very bright, tear drop shaped object, travel from north to south across the eastern sky in relation to my position. The odd thing was that it appeared to travel in an upwards direction and then blinked out of sight. Duration was approx. 1.5 seconds. It was bright white in color and the light tailed behind it or at least appeared to. It is difficult to say since it was travelling so fast. I first chalked it up to something skipping off our atmosphere. Which perhaps is true. The thing is, I saw the same thing this past weekend, around 01/16/03, at approximately 0230 hours. This one was in the same general area of the sky as before. Except it appeared to travel upwards from south to north, ie: opposite direction. I am not sure what I have been seeing, but these two are not the only strange objects I've seen in the sky recently. I work outside at night so I occasionally see objects. These have all caught my eyes as I have been driving. So at least to me they are very noticeable. They have all lasted long enough to get a reasonable look at them. At last eye exam I tested around 20/10, plus I have a stygmatism on top of that, so I'm correctable to even better. Since I spend most of my time in the hours of darkness, perhaps my eyes are more sensitive to movement and light in the sky, and I'm just seeing more of the junk that's hitting the atmosphere than most others can see. Who knows. I am a college educated professional. I have doubted this stuff, but man, when you see weird stuff you can't explain, it bothers you and you really can't tell anyone about it. Especially with what I do for a living, supposed to be the unflappable one. Some who read this will understand what I'm saying with that last statement and wanting to remain anonymous. Anyhow, I see this stuff probably at least once a week over the skies north of Sioux Falls, SD. I see meteorites almost nightly, so I generally notice when somethings a little different. Well there you have it, hope this helps some people tell what they have seen. Reading the others on here helped me to do it. All I know is that there have to be more people like me, seeing this stuff and just not saying anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
