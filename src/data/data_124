They shimmered from orange to bright white.  Orion was rising in the south eastern sky and these objects were flying in a wedge formation just below the feet of Orion.  ""There shouldn't be anything that bright there!""  I thought to myself.  The objects were more luminous then our brightest star Sirius I also thought which drew my attention to them in the first place.  The lead object was even more so then the trailer.  This viewing lasted approximately ten seconds.  The first object slowly dimmed out of sight still high in the sky, I'd say 30 degrees from the horizon. Then the other about one to two seconds later.  The movement seems to give me an indication to altitude in my opinion.  I view the night sky almost on a daily basis and have seen many things such as satellite's, meteors, high flying military and passenger aircraft.  I cannot say what they were or were not.

I was clicking photos of the bonfire when I saw the Moonrise in the eastern sky.  I alerted everyone that they must look at the beautiful sleepy Moon.  Initially, all looked at the Moon but soon all got engaged with the fun activities around the bonfire. I kept on clicking the rising Moon’s photos.  I got so engrossed in taking photos of the beautiful Moon using my Nikon P900 camera that I totally forgot I was watching the Moon through a very high optical zoom lens.  Suddenly I saw a HUGE horizontal shadow across the lower part of the Moon; I tried to click the shadow but couldn’t focus and soon realized that the shadow was fast disappearing towards the right side of the Moon. Luckily one click that I took captured a part of the shadow (in the attached photo). I would request if experts can kindly examine the photo and especially the shadow while it was captured crossing a Moon’s crater the horizontal shadow is clearly appearing crooked on the uneven surface of the crater.",2019-01-11T00:00:00,,

Triangular object glides over car while driving outside of town.,Wichita,KS,2019-01-03T21:30:00,triangle,5 minutes,"Occurred : 1/3/2019 21:30  (Entered as : 01/03/19 21:30) Reported: 1/8/2019 8:18:32 PM 20:18 Posted: 1/11/2019 Location: Wichita, KS Shape: Triangle Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/144/S144368.html,"Triangular object glides over car while driving outside of town. On January 3, 2019, at approximately 9:30pm, our 11 month old son was fussy, so I took him out for a car ride.  I suspected that it might take a while to get him to go to sleep and since it was a nice night, I decided to head north out of town. We live in N.E. Wichita just outside of Bel Aire.  I drove North on Oliver to 53rd St. N.  I then turned East on 53rd to Greenwich.  At Greenwich I turned South until 45th St. At 45th St I then proceeded back to the West.  At some point, as I was approaching Rock Rd. (on 45th St.), I noticed a rather large and bright light ahead of me on the horizon.  The light looked white or a white/yellow.  I thought at first it might be a light on the water tower or a radio tower in the distance.  As I continued West on 45th I realized that the water tower and its lights were not in line with this light (which seemed to be stationary).  I passed the water tower and proceeded West on 45th St and could now see the radio tower in the distance an it’s lights. The tower was North of the light in question.  The light at this time had begun to dim and didn’t seem as bright.  It was however in the same position (or so it seemed) as it was when I first noticed it (1.5 miles ago).   As I approached Oliver (sti! ll on 45th St.) the light seemed to be getting lower, as it was now becoming obstructed by trees.  At this time, my best guess was that the light was a mile or two in front of me.  As I approached Hydraulic (still on 45th St.), I stopped for a train which was crossing the road.  I believe there were 2 cars in front of me.  While waiting for the train (2 minutes) the light did not move.  If it did it may have moved toward me.  Just before the train finished passing, the light began to move toward me and to the North.   As I approached the intersection of 45th & Hydraulic I could now see 3 lights in the shape of a triangle. It crossed Hydraulic at approximately 1/4 of a mile to the North of 45th St. The front light (front as in relation to its travel E-NE) was blue in color.  The two rear lights were white or slightly whitish-yellow.  I also noticed that the lights did not blink or flash, as I expected to see a helicopter or some type of plane.  When the object passed over Hydraulic, I e! stimate that it may have been at an altitude of about 1,000 ft.  As it passed over Hydraulic I turned North to try an follow it as it was moving rather slow.  As I traveled further North on Hydraulic I started to lose sight of it out the passenger side of our van.  I approached 53rd St and turned East where I could see it ahead of me.  It seemed to begin moving at a faster rate of speed.  By the time I approached Oliver it was well off in the distance.  I would estimate that it was 10 miles away by that time. I debated whether or not to post this report for fear of some kind of misidentification on my part but after watching the air traffic in the night sky the following days I became more sure about the differences in this object and that of other aircraft.  Most aircraft I’ve seen have some kind of red light, this had none.  The altitude at which the object in question was also odd.  The aircraft I see here are in a landing pattern or take off at that altitude and this object did not fit the typical flight pattern of other aircraft from the surrounding airports.  The main difference was the 3 solid lights beneath the object.  They did not flash or blink. There was also no beacon light on this object.  I believe that at the close proximity in which I was to the object I would have seen a beacon light, however the 3 lights beneath the object were the only ones I could see.  At 45th & Hydraulic (my closest position to the object) it was moving very slow.  I also rolled the windows down a! t that point and could not hear the propellers of a plane or helicopter. Also, I do believe the vehicle stopped in front of me while waiting for the train took notice of it and tried to follow it as well.  The car turned North on Hydraulic then East on 53rd, then South on Oliver back to 45th where it then turned West again on 45th.  The drivers behavior seemed to be very distracted as if they were watching the objects flight. I hope this might encourage others in the Wichita area to consider sharing their sightings as well.",2019-01-11T00:00:00,37.696397848537,-97.32954010327022

It appeared to have somewhat of a face; the eyes were staring through me, and was not a friendly gaze. I remember being frightened; however, could not break my gaze. Then it disappeared.

They didn't have any real consistency of pattern, but they were fairly close.  The lights were huge and bright, red/yellow/ and a blue-ish purple on the outer edges.  But it would dissipate, and they get smaller, and less colorful, almost like stars, but their movements were not normal, they could hover for ages in one spot, then they'd disappear, reappear, brighter and glow like, then they'd turn back to nothing but a star again.  It was so odd.  And because I had seen the previous one and always regretted not being able to take a pic or follow it, I made sure to go inside and get my phone and take a video of what I saw.

While driving in car with wife and infant son at approx. 20:00 heading south on a sparsely populated stretch of road, a bright, solid orange light was observed to the southeast.  It appeared to be an aircraft heading toward us with its landing light illuminated, though the light was orange and not the usual white.

I alerted my wife who was behind my driver’s seat with the baby, and I rolled both of our windows down so that we each had the same vantage point. The object appeared very small, though its true distance was difficult to ascertain.  It appeared to be a solid ball of orange light, illuminating and extending outward from the leading edge of which was a fan-shaped swath of dimmer orange light that did not appear to be solid.  It was in the sky close to the bright, nearly full moon, which was partially visible from behind a broken layer of clouds covering approx. 80% of the sky.  The clouds were thin enough to be translucent to the light of the moon. The object was zig-zagging about very slowly, and was framed through the branches of a tall, bare tree which gave a reference point from which to gauge the object’s speed of movement.  As it began to move or rise away to the northeast, it faded into the clouds.

On Wednesday, April 17th, 2019, at approximately 20:20 hrs., I took my dogs out to the back yard as I normally do every day around this time.  My rear door faces South, so when I walk outside, I’m looking almost due South.  It was mostly cloudy with high thin clouds and I could see the brightest stars in the sky intermittently through the clouds.  My attention was drawn almost directly above, to a silent, triangle shaped object that was heading South at a rather slow rate of speed compared to the everyday air traffic in the area.   Another interesting comparison to the everyday local air traffic is it goes East to West or West to East and very rarely have I ever seen it travel North to South.  The only things that appear to deviate from that pattern are helicopters, hot air balloons or powered parachutes and none of these can be mistaken for what I saw. I watched in disbelief as I attempted to explain it away in my mind, but I couldn’t.  There were three white or dull white lights, each marked a corner of the triangle and it had one slowly, pulsating red light in the center.  I was able to see an outline of the triangle since the moon had the clouds somewhat glowing.  I didn’t have my phone with me when I reached for it to snap a picture and I could feel my heart pounding harder with each second that I watched, knowing that no one would believe me.  I thought I saw a green light near the front of the triangle which, appeared to be circling in a sporadic manner of directions.  The green light looked like just a light that I couldn’t determine an outline for, much smaller and much less intense compared to the triangle.  This all happened in probably less than a minute, but I couldn’t leave my dogs out, so I called inside to my wife, but she didn’t hear me over the TV.

I figured it was a star or a plane, because there is an airport nearby and bright blinking stars and planes head in that direction (west) constantly.  Tonight (4/17/19) I kept an eye out, and before bed (10:30pm), I looked out and to the southwest I saw a very bright light, VERY low to the ground, definitely wasn't a helicopter (we have them all the time and they are loud), would have maybe been over McGalliard Road or close to it, hard to judge, but definitely CLOSE.  It looked stationary and like it was turning and the light (like a spot light) started to blink.  I hurried away to get my mom, literally not 2 minutes, and it was gone.  My mom has claimed that when she sees it, she feels it knows she is watching, then it zips off like a flash.  I never saw it leave.  It was just gone after I got here and went to the window.  I am generally a skeptical believer, but I have been looking out here for 22 years at this location (just observing the night sky, not looking for UFOs), and this wasn't something normal.  I, too, felt like it knew I saw it, although I can't say why I felt that way.  It looked like a large object (details indistinguishable because the light was turning in my direction and blinding) with a very bright light attached to it that started to blink brightly as the object turned to my direction.  lol  NOT NORMAL AT ALL.  Oddly enough, I saw something very similar nearby in the country about twenty years ago.  I'm going to watch for it again the next few nights since it seems to be returning.  I immediately went to google to see if there have been in any sightings recently here, and found this website and decided to leave this report. I'll report again if I see it again.

Last night I was sitting in my hot tub and facing due east so the jet of water could hit my lower back.  My husband had already gone inside, so I was alone and staring up, hoping to see a meteor.  I heard something that caused me to moved my gaze straight up and I saw something moving fast -- it was huge, moving fast, and intermittently visible.  It was like a ship whose cloaking device was sputtering.  The object was not lit, but it seemed like it was reflecting the light from the cities below. It was flying higher than planes coming into PSP airport, but below the level of planes flying from LAX to the East Coast (which one can still hear and see with their flashing lights).  In the distance it seemed to suddenly stop, and then four or five separate objects flew away from it for a few seconds and then they flew back and merged with the object, and then the object suddenly seemed to fly straight up really fast and disappear. Honestly, it could have been a stealth bomber flying out of March AFB in Riverside -- they probably don't publish their training missions so it would be hard to verify.  It is not impossible that the objects i saw flying away from it could have been panels reflecting city lights.  But it didn't seem to behave like a bomber would -- streaking across the sky, making a bit of noise but then no more noise, suddenly stopping and disappearing and appearing, and then suddenly streaking straight up.  I did not see any trails or exhaust or jet engine plumes that a fighter might make, but I don't know how the B2's mask those. I have seen B2's fly in the skies above So Cal during events like the Rose Parade, and this didn't look like that and it certainly didn't behave like that.  At that hour, around ten thirty at night, it was very dark and the moon was not visible.  The Coachella Valley is in the desert but it is fairly heavily developed so there is considerable light pollution.  There are plenty of undeveloped areas around, so if the AF wanted to fly training missions, why would they fly right over a populated area with a busy airport?  I ran inside and told my husband what I had seen to try to keep ""contemporaneous notes"" and to try to explain and understand what I had seen.  I was in a hot tub thus didn't have my phone at hand to take any pictures (and probably wouldn't have had the time anyway).

I walked outside and saw some sort of aircraft flying very low, at first the aircraft kind of looked like a large drone.  As it approached closer, I realized it was much too large to be a drone.  It was shaped more like an octagon from what I could tell and had red and white lights all over it.  There were lights covering it and it made it hard to make out the exact shape, but as said before, it imitated a large drone. It was the size of a commercial aircraft, flying not much higher than the trees and making zero noise. I watched it fly over my house, it made a circle over our property and then flew in the same direction that the choppers flew in.  I was completely freaked out. I was not a believer in these until now.  I noted that my dogs responded to the event because they were missing for hours (until right after the aircraft passed through).

These sighting's have been going on for some time now, I can't be exact when I first noticed what started out as ""strange things"". To be honest, after I realized it was not my eyes playing tricks on me I thought perhaps I was losing my mind.  That would be easier to explain I think, but I assure anyone who reads my report, I am not crazy nor have I lost my mind.  I am however beside my self trying to grasp the reality of what I have been witnessing. When I first noticed something ""odd,"" it was some kind of ""something"" I didn't know what, that streaked across the sky at a quick as lightning speed, it was by accident that I happened to notice these things and they were so fast if I blinked I would miss it.  After some time I then realized the origin of where they were coming from.  To the East of my location I have a pretty good view of the mountains a good estimate of the distance from me to there I would say somewhere between 2 to 4 miles, 2 at the least and 4 at the most, this being a straight shot.  This is Weyerhaeuser property.  When the day light begins to fade and dusk is setting in, just on the ridge of the mountain top there you will notice a illuminating light coming from behind the mountain, if you see the light an watch closely you will notice what looks to be something like an orb, light in color, white/bluish most often, occasionally red shoot straight up in the sky, so fast it almost seems like it was just shot from a sling shot, if you blink you will miss it.  As i became more aware of these things and knew what to look for the more i questioned my reality, i am trying to grasp and comprehend what this is that i am seeing. Recently i have noticed some changes in what i knew as routine, also in appearance. Each Orb, as i referred to them as that shot off from over that mountain top came directly over head of my location, gradually made a u turn and shot off into the distance, destination unknown.  Then i saw one, closer and reduced speed i noticed after making a u turn the object is not an orb at all, they are disks and from looking underneath it's clear to see it is a disk shape outlined with lights.  Now that i know this i can recognize these disks at random in the sky and what i suspect trying to hide their presence behind what i thought were clouds.  The ""clouds"" also illuminate the white lights shaping the discs so although one could easily not notice, one could notice if they knew what to look for. These sightings have been going on for months now, i have been committed to watching, observing, and trying to learn more about these objects.  What shocks me and the more i learn the more shocked i get is, I sware on my life and everything i love, even on my only child i am telling the truth when i say there are hundreds of these things, possibly thousands.  There are signs of some kind of intelligence from these things might i just add.  They are there every day, and every night.  I really hope that there is somebody out there that can tell me what these things are exactly, what their purpose is, possible their intentions, something.  Tell me i'm wrong, but don't tell me i'm crazy. I can't help feeling frightened at times wondering what is the meaning behind these things?  And i can't help but to feel some excitement of the idea. what are they doing here? and what could there possibly be over that mountain top that they are so interested in? Where do they go when they shoot off into the sky?  Why are there so many of them?  And why the hell has nobody els seen these things?  Who do i even tell about what i'm seeing?  And would they even believe me?  Well that's why i am writing this now, where it goes and what comes of it i can only wait to find out. I will follow up on the situation in soon time for those that are curious, and believe what i am saying. I am telling the truth, i don't care to be ridiculed over something i hesitated and debated even speaking up about.  Don't pass judgement until you see for yourself, that's fair enough and all i ask.

Got to my neighborhood and a glimmer in the sky caught my eye.  It was very, very bright with a green/blue color to it, and from the initial quick glance, I honestly thought it was a glare and wrote it off as such. I continued home, turned into my cul-de-sac (just 30secs away from initial catching of attn). I saw two bright lights, greenish-blue, parallel to each other (mimicking a military helicopter, with the parallel and straight form) hovering steadily.  The lights weren't flashing, though. it was still and so silent. Something randomly hit me subconsciously, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. The, what i thought was helicopter, seemed to be 3mi out at that point.  I immediately grabbed my phone and fumbled to the rec. button.  And as soon as i raised my phone to rec, the aircraft instantly moved.  I was spotting it in the south, it was hovering steadily, no flashing of its green/blue lights, just hovering (thats why I thought it was just a helicopter at first. via perspective).  As soon as i lifted my phone to rec what i was seeing the craft turned and sped towards me and my daughters direction. By the time I realized that this thing was a triangle shape, it was slowly gliding over us, about 1000ft up.  It was completely silent. my initial thoughts were a giant drone, but it was eerily quiet out. It slowly moved over my head, no sound, triangular shaped, back two 'wing lights' were lit up with greenish blue lights, the rest of the craft was illuminated somehow, just not externally.  It very well could have been the extremely bright and vivid  lights of the crafts wings. As the object moved overhead towards the north, I got a good look at its underside. it was ribbed like  strips of metal work or the belly of a turtle.  the material the ship was made of wasnt shiny or prone to glare like metal.  it acted more like paper or plastic, but it undoubtedly had the resemblance of the resilience and toughness of metal. As it passed over my head, it began blinking the green and blue lights, now including red center light. It stoppped about 100yds out, backed up, did an elongated turn and continued north, still flashing its lights. I've never came across such an equally terrifying exp. and curiosity spiking exp.

The First UFO  	I was driving home on I-5 North-bound, just South of Downtown Seattle coming from the West Seattle Bridge.  This was bout a week or a little more after the Alaska Way viaduct closed, so all the North-bound traffic was backed up on I-5, on top of the usual slow rush hour traffic of the Seattle area.  Barely creeping along, often stopped completely, I sat in what looked like a river of red lights in front of me.  Having little better to do than to look out my windshield and wait for the traffic to move, something out of the ordinary caught my eye.  It had red and green blinking lights on it, much like the airplanes that are frequently passing over Seattle to land at the Sea-Tac Airport South of the city.  What was different about this is that it was not moving, it was sitting stationary in the same place in dark sky. 	I watched this object blink with red and green lights like an airplane for several minutes, and it definitely did not move.  It was sitting in the sky, close to street lights, maybe a little bit higher, directly above the freeway packed with hundreds of cars.  When I got closer to it, it was still in the same place, I just watched it carefully, and it was not attached to a tower, (it was a little way south of the downtown skyscrapers), and not something attached to a street light either.  When I got close enough to try to capture a video of this object while I was stopped, but then the cars in front of me started to move again, so I had to move forward.  Just after I stopped again and got a good look at this object with red and green lights, it was still in the same spot, but it started rotating and I saw its white headlights at least twice.  After two or three rotations it started to slowly fly away from me, and disappeared over a hill to the southeast of where I was.  This was ! odd to me because all of the other planes I observed that night flew southward, toward either Boeing or Sea-Tac airports.  Because it started moving shortly after I was about to started filming, it would have looked like a normal airplane moving through the night sky. 	My feeling is that this object was a 3D hologram projection that looked like an airplane, but was most likely an alien craft in reality.  It was probably able to sense when I was about to start filming, and then it started moving after that.  I feel that it could have also been an ET craft with occupants aboard who were aware of me, and wanted to show me what they can do and/or give me a sign.  I have absolutely no idea if any other drivers or people in the area saw this object.  Multiple airplanes flew overhead while this object sat stationary in the air, below the level of the other planes.  Again, it looked like an airplane with a red and a green light that would blink every second or so. The Second UFO 	Later this evening, I was walking my dog in my neighborhood in Northeastern Seattle, when I looked up into one area of the clear night sky, I saw another unidentified object, also with red and green lights.  This second one appeared a lot like a large star in the sky, less radiant, but still colored light, but with alternating red and green lights, where the the earlier one had blinking red and green lights.  This second object also looked like one spherical light of alternating red and green, never dark.  I watched this object for at least a minute, and it was not moving through the sky, not like an airplane would.  When I got to a spot where I could try to film it with my iPhone, I zoomed in and could pick up something faintly, but then it started moving away from me, in a similar fashion as the earlier object.  As it was moving away from me in a northwestern direction, it was no longer green, and became a red blinking light. 	Both of the unidentified flying objects I witnessed on this night, of January 25th, 2019, hovered and moved silently as far as I could tell. Both moved very smoothly through the sky, and both seemed to know when I was watching and trying to film them.  I am certain these red and green lighted objects were not ordinary terrestrial objects, I have lived in Seattle all of my life and am very familiar with how airplanes and satellites look in the night sky.",2019-02-01T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

At first, I thought it was a set of military helicopters because Rickenbacker Air Force Base is close by.  I see helicopters flying in a straight line formation all the time.  As I got closer to my exit, I continued to notice the lights.  I took the Diley Road exit off State Route 33 and come to a stop at the light on the exit ramp.  At that point, I started to really pay attention to the lights.  There were defiantly 3 lights and they were in a perfectly straight line.  2 were brighter than the third.  The one I could see on my left was the brightest.  There was no sound and the lights did not move for the 2 minutes I sat at the light waiting to turn.  At that point, I decided to take a picture.  As I continued on my way to work, I had to stop at a stop sign 1 minute from the stopligh! t on the exit ramp.  At the stop sign, I was still facing the same southeast direction.  The 3 lights were in the same area of the sky, not moving, and making no sound.  After I made a left turn at the stop sign, I was traveling north and no longer facing in the direction of the lights and could not tell if they were still there.  I have never seen a UFO and not 100% sure I believe in them.  I have seen lights in the sky before, but I can always figure out what I am seeing.  This time I could not tell what I was looking at.

When I saw the third one whiz by in less than 20 seconds, I ran out back to see about ten (10) flashing objects that were red, orange, and yellow in color, moving quickly across the sky a little south over our house.  They were moving from the southwest to northeast at a fairly good speed.   I screamed for my husband and he came out and saw them as well and he called our next-door neighbors who live approximately 60 feet to our east.  The husband and wife both came outside and watched them from their back deck which is approximately 3.5 feet off the ground.  My husband and I were on a level brick patio.   They continued to fly over for about 10-15 minutes.  Estimate approximately 100 individual flying objects.  I called our son who lives approximately one mile south and he got to an area ! above his apartment where he could see them in the distance, looking north towards our home.   I called 911 to report the incident while it was occurring.  I also posted something on our local Facebook Resident’s page and just saw that someone else saw them.   I called our local television station and reported it.  They indicated that I was the first to call them about it and they would call around and inquire about it.  I gave them my phone number.    I would estimate that the objects were flying under 5,000 feet in the sky.  The sky is clear and you can see the usual jets flying in their flight pattern and the stars very clearly.  These were not jets or stars.   We could not see any shape to them due to the brightness of the flashing lights.  They came in clusters of about ten (10) at a time, with maybe one (1) minute spacing for approximately 10-15 minutes.

My camera just shows ! a black image where I took the video.

I was heading north and the plane seemed to be heading south.  I could make out the side of the plane and the belly.  It was a large purple plane with a yellow stripe going down the middle, towards the end of the stripe it turned red and ends at a sharp point, i do not remember any writing or logos as my brain was melting.  I noticed my breathing was picking up and i found my self on my knees looking out the back window (i always sit in the rear passenger seat in ubers) im a grown man who had a grown man driving me, im sure i came off odd because the man eventually noticed me and awkwardly asked ""lots of good sights round here huh?..."" I didnt even reply as i couldn't wrap my mind around what i had just saw. I remember i desperately wanted to scream LOOK LOOK! or ask him to pull over but while im wathcing this i couldnt get anything out.  It may have been becaude this man was a stranger and i didnt wanna look insane or because i was in shock and or amazement.

The whole thing was seemingly harmless but ive been replaying it in my head over and over, i have googled it and some people have claimed to have captured exactly what i described on camera and its very eerie.  Its also propably unrelated but one thing i have found very odd is that ever since that day i have been having some very out of the ordinary good luck.!

Eventually a cloud develops around the light, it explodes and disappears. This is a sighting I had in the late 90’s - possibly ’97 or ’98 in Los Angeles county, California.   I wasn’t aware of Peter Davenport or of NUFORC at the time.  By the time I did find out about NUFORC, I figured it was too long after the fact to bother.  I decided to write this just because it seemed unlike any ufo sighting I’ve heard of and wanted to put it on record, for whatever it’s worth.  Maybe now I'll be able to stop thinking about it. It happened on an early August weekday morning around 5:30ish a.m.  I had to drive several miles to Brentwood to pick up a prescription at my doc’s home, before going to work.  I started off from my home in Santa Monica, heading north/west.  After driving a minute or two, initially heading north, I noticed a low stationary light (no blinking lights), probably several miles off to the north/west (toward Pacific Palisades).  It was low enough to be a helicopter, although for some reason it didn’t look like a helicopter (don’t recall now why I thought that).  As I continued driving I kept my eye on the light.  It started moving east and slightly south - in my direction.  I began traveling due east toward Brentwood.  The object continued its trajectory in my direction and was soon nearly parallel with my vehicle.  I came to a traffic light and immediately turned left (north), stopping at a second traffic light, finding myself suddenly in a confluence of heavy, early a.m. commuter traffic.  As I waited for the red light to change, I remember opening my window to look skyward for the object.  I was surprised to see it very close, nearly overhead, extremely bright, stationary and silent.  I couldn’t make out any shape of a craft.  I was familiar with the variety of helicopters typically flying around L.A. having lived there for decades.  This didn’t have any features of a helicopter.  I wondered if the light might have been a search or flood light, but saw no evidence of that as I looked around me.  When the traffic light turned green I turned my attention back to the road, disappointed I wouldn’t be able to keep track of the object. A couple of minutes later I crossed Sunset Boulevard, continuing north into the dark foothills of the Santa Monica mountains.  I was now the only car on a quiet residential road.  I looked into the sky again and towards the west saw what I assumed was the same bright light that had appeared overhead minutes earlier.  I pulled over and stopped to get a better look.  It was a mile or 2 away from me, maybe more.   It was stationary and low but well above the horizon.  At this point the sky was still very dark, but moments away from the first light of daybreak. Then I observed this: the bright light began to dim out.  As that happened, fog or a cloud surrounded the light, obscuring the dimming light even more.  Suddenly what almost appeared as an explosion of light seemed to burst behind the cloud.  The explosion, which almost looked electrical or charged began to dim again before quickly disappearing completely.  As I was staring at the spot, there was just enough daylight in the sky to observe the silhouette of a small cloud where the light had been.  I remember holding out my arm trying to get an idea of its size.  It looked like a cotton ball at arm’s distance.  Within 30-60 seconds it too vanished, evaporated.  The sky was dark and completely cloudless, with sunlight just appearing in the east.  The sighting only lasted maybe 60-90 seconds total, as I recall.  Another thing - as bizarre as it seems, I had a sense of communication or connection with the light when I first began observing it, maybe 7-10 minutes earlier, as I le! ft my home.  I had the crazy thought that it was following me, but that could easily have been imagination.  Also, for the record I’ve had numerous sightings since childhood.  This was just the longest lasting and most dramatic.  Later I checked to find out the moon’s location.  It set around 11 p.m. the night before.  One last thing - at the time of the event I assumed that the second object I saw was the same object which I first observed upon leaving my home, but in actuality I don't know that for a fact since wasn't able to watch the first object continuously.   Thank you for your efforts and perseverance, Peter Davenport.",2019-01-24T00:00:00,,

The object virtually flew right over my head (seemed to be less than 1/4 mile to the west), yet it was 100% silent.  It is difficult to estimate its size, as I could only make out the lights and not the body of the craft itself.  The lights numbered between 6 and 10 and were arranged in a triangle.  They were very dim, such that if I hadn't already been looking in that direction with my pupils adjusted to view the dim starlight I certainly wouldn't have seen it.  The lights didn't blink or change at all, and also lacked any discernable hues, appearing to be a dim grey shade.

I watched the light and there was only a solid, steady pale orange glow -- the blinking lights I anticipated would appear never did.  Maybe most noticeable was the total absence of sound that always accompanies the aircraft I see at this approximate distance.  I did see a flight cross in the distance from west to east, its lights appearing smaller indicating it was probably either smaller or farther away than whatever it was I had noticed! which remained stationary as the aircraft passed behind it to the south; the aircraft was easily identifiable by the blinking of its lights.

It was a mostly cloudy night with a clearing in the middle of the night sky.  He was looking North at a star when he noticed through the clouds at an approx. 40% angle from the horizon a group of glowing discs (approximate total of 18 disc objects) coming out of the clouds into the clear sky (cloudless)area.  When my husband first saw the objects, he yelled loudly for me, my daughter and son to come outside immediately to view the disc formations.  We were able to watch and witness the last half of the visible formation flight until they disappeared into the clouds to the south . The glowing discs were traveling from North to South over the Los Angeles San Fernando Valley area in a straight line at approximately 10,000 feet of altitude and about 85% of perpendicular.  There were two sets of flying triangle formations with one formation having 6 discs and the other formation having 8 discs.  Those two formations traveled on a steady course North to South.  In between the two formations 4 same sized glowing discs moved independently around the entire time.  The entire observation time was approximately 20-22 seconds. No aircraft that we know of can travel at that speed and altitude and change direction that quickly.  The discs all were the same and they were all a glowing steady bright white light.  There were no flashing white lights, green lights or red lights at all like a normal airplane.

I had been down at Blue Sluice Lake with my camera.  As I was approaching Roswell Rd, I could see a lovely sunset forming in my review mirror and decided to turn onto a side road that runs up to the local ball fields.  The road runs very close to high tension power lines where you can get a long view of the lines reaching toward the sun.  I've captured the sunset at this location several times in the past. I drove up to the ball field, turned around and drove back down, parking my car off to the side.  As I exited my car and crossed the road towards the tower closest to the road, I noted a very bright spot in the sky, as though the sun was reflecting from something.  It was off in the distance, irregular in shape with some small puffy clouds close by.  As I lifted my camera and zoomed in a bit I could detect sort of a boomerang shape.  I snapped a couple of photos, to be sure to capture the object before it could fade into the clouds, then I took a few seconds to adjust the camera.  It was getting dark, so I cranked the camera ISO up to 2000.  I didn't have a tripod for long exposure, so my pictures are a bit noisy. By the time I lifted my camera again, the small clouds around the object had dissipated.  The attached image was taken at 28 mpg, un-retouched, but resized for posting.  The excerpt was taken before resizing. Thank you.  Joan Hair",2019-03-21T00:00:00,,

I explained that I have a night vision video camera that I set up most nights in my back garden. To date there has not been a night where I have not picked up a number of items that are not planes and not satellites.  I own two telescopes and hope to get a close up of one of the many things I have Seen along with my wife. The last four times I have set this up and left it alone for a few hours we are getting orbs flying close over the top of the camera. at first I thought it was maybe leaves blown by the wind, but we are now getting them from all directions even when thre is no wind at all, then we realized that there are o leaves and besides they are too big and they are lit from the inside, tonight this has happened more than a dozen times and all at a remarkable speed, almost fast enough to produce a comet tail effect. I am still getting just as many objects as ever. I am at present trying to set up my telescopes, one with a special cctc camera that has been modified to collect light, but doing this as you will be ware will reduce the area of sky I cover and any given time, however it will I hope be lucky enough to give a clearer picture of the object, and with about twenty or more a night we should get lucky. this new thing with these orbs has happened before but not in the number we got tonight, the camerai am using still gives a night sky but one can actually see the clouds and their form all in a black and white picture. the area where we live does have a record when it comes to U.F.O.s  and my interest is getting solid proof, however, with the addition of these lights I am wondering what comes next, we have been able to get a reaction to a flashing tourch where the signal is copied very clearly, which does not happen with satellites, besides they do not change direction in flight as these objects can do. I am a little concerned as I do not think that we are prepaered for first hand contact, so would be grateful for some advise regarding this possibility. I have been interested in this subject for many years, hence the use of good telescopes good enough to pick out interesting items on the moon that tend to be out of line with reports from NASA. I would be grateful for some advise  concerning the above",2019-03-21T00:00:00,,

I was driving while this was happening and only was able to capture about 2 seconds of the ufo on my cellphone video, where you can see a yellow spot behind pine trees, before it disappeared.

I am an attorney and an extreme skeptic of things such as this, but I am unnerved.   I saw a vertical row of red lights with a blue light to the right side of the object.  I see multiple planes daily in this area so my instinct was that it was simply a plane.  The object, however, hovered.  Meaning it was stationary for a few seconds which was odd because it was very visible although distant.  As I tried to process if it was actually hovering or not, it shot straight up in the sky a great distance but still in view, leaving no streak of light.  It moved in a manner that no plane could move.   I was in shock at that point and then the object dropped down to where it was very quickly and did so on a right outward angle.  It hovered for another second and then shot off to the right, seemingly in a straight line and vanished.  Moments later, two white lights appeared which to be normal aircraft flying in the same vicinity as where I saw the object.  The object I saw was not a plane, it was not a star, it was not a meteor.  I could see clearly that it was a flying object but I could only make out the read and blue lights that made it appear horizontal.  The colors were more like police lights.  The erratic movement of the object is what leads me to question.  I have never seen anything fly like that in my life.   I am an adult female, professional mother of two.  I saw something!

A powerful Nikon P900 camera which has an incredible 83X zoom.  I just got it back from having it converted to full spectrum.  So it will record in infrared and UV.  I installed a 665nm IR pass filter with a MC/UV filter.   I was in my backyard in the Mid-Cities, Texas, area and had pointed towards a plane flying overhead.  It was on autofocus and my tripod was in the house.  Once I lost sight of the plane behind the trees I scanned through the vapor trail which curiously looked like a chem trail.  I was fumbling with the camera hoping to get it to focus when I caught a flash of light.  I then zoomed in on the light and it came into focus a few times.  I videoed for approx 5 minutes.  I kept losing the object without the tripod so I made the decision to enter the house to retrieve it and come back out to film.  In my excitement I never restarted recording!!!!!!!  And dang it, I had it zoomed in and in frame and steady!  But I never hit record.   The video I do have is fairly compelling.  You can tell it’s not anything like a standard flying craft we’re familiar with.  It had a field around it and sometimes looked like a hamburger on it’s edge!  Like a patty in the middle of two pieces of bread.  Very strange.  The time was approximately 5:45 PM Jan 27th, 2019.

I went to my back deck and snapped a few pics and in one there is an odd blue gauge of some sort and a circular craft with orange lights hoovering over the trees.  My brain was still not processing what I was witnessing – it just seemed suspended in air with no sound then shot right up out of sight. I went inside and ran into my room and snapped some more pics from outside of my South facing window.  I caught what looks like to hairless figures staring right into my window – I did NOT see them in real time and after that I don’t recall much to be honest- I only have what is on my cameras and my hand held device.

Red +green laser (?) light when viewed on approach.  Long diamond rectangular. VERY dim but loud. We live about 150 metres from the High River Regional Hospital, in High River, Alberta.  We witness one or more Stars air ambulance flights in and out of the hospital every week.  In the last month or two we have been noticing (while in the house) that they seem to be circling for longer periods and waking us in the night more frequently.  Always only one aircraft.   At 3AM Monday, January, 28th, 2019 - (earlier today) - the following took place: my companion woke me up standing next to the bed listening to what he thought was yet another STARS air ambulance circling, circling for what he believed had been ""hours"".  I awoke more fully and heard the chopper sound.  One aircraft. I looked out of our upper north and south loft windows but could not see a helicopter.  Because it was loud enough to believe that it was at least as close as we are to the hospital - if not circling right above it -  I decided I would get a closer look at this to see if there were some! sort of emergency vehicle back up (or what)?! I was considering walking over to the Hospital to complain.  Upon stepping outside (cold and clear night) I sought the sound out but couldn't visually place it.  It moved toward and near me, then away again fairly quickly but slow enough to think I should be able to get a visual of this ""helicopter"".  The close swoop over my vicinity took about 10 seconds.  It sounded like it was circling a larger area of town as I could hear it in the distance with the sound receding and then getting louder again.  Always coming back again to swoop around the west side of the hospital area.  I was on the west end of its apparent orbit.  After hearing 2 passes and confirming that I could not get a visual, I stood perfectly still in a few shadows of the house and my eyes locked upon a very dim glow, but I could only do so for a brief moment, as it moved across in a counter clockwise manner. I saw it three more times.  Once over the low slope of my roof, nearly head on - this is the only time I witnessed l! ight on the object - a very small red light which came in and out of view very quickly.  It appeared to be stationary but not a spotlight.  Like it was pointing directly in front of the object's path of flight.  My companion said he saw a small red light, and the same small green light.  If I hadn't seen this light the object might have appeared to be a projection, but the light seemed to ground it in reality!  I witnessed the ""helicopter"" curve from the north to the south, then to the east, in a counter clockwise movement.  Because it was a clear night - I could see the light of the stars become blocked and that was how I got a visual approximation, initially.  As my retina adjusted I realized it was indeed a visually distinguishable object, but only barely so.  I am not certain if it was emitting a glow - or if the glow was due to the low moonlight in the clear sky.  However, I could see it in about 3/4's of it's orbital path.  It seemed to be rectangular, longish.  It was narrower at the front but I could not tell if it was pointed.  It had a wider tail end, and it may have been flat on its underside.  I tried to view the object through binoculars but could not get a visual lock on it for more than a few seconds, it was so hard to track.  I spent about an hour going in and out of the house as it was quite cold out, too cold to remain standing in one spot for long.   Naturally, I wish I had some audio/visual record of it but I do not have access to anything reliable that could do that. I'd like some answers about what this is and really don't know where to start asking the questions!  Thanks for reading my report.",2019-02-01T00:00:00,50.58339999999999,-113.8687

It was late in the evening.  But not dark out.  I stay with my parents and help take care of them. This day was no different than any other.  Being late in the evening they usually lay down to sleep early in the day and I relax in my recliner and browse the internet on my computer in my room.  I remember that I started getting sleepy.  As I was relaxed back in the chair about to doze off.  Looking at my screen on the computer I noticed something moving in the doorway in my periphery. My computer desk is directly to the right of the doorway on the same wall.  Just about 2-3 foot away.  So I became fully aware that something was coming into the room.  I thought it might be my mother waking up and to come check on me.  She is short in stature around 5 Ft.  But I suddenly realized that the door knob on the door was chest to neck high to this thing. My door was slightly open just about 12 inches the best I can remember.  From the shock of becoming aware.  I immediately woke up from my stupor and began to focus.  My reaction by nature is fight not flight.  My adrenaline started building as I am discovering the details.  The creature was 3-4 foot tall, larger head, and brown skin.  I recall the eyes being black. Kind of like the typical grey reports and kind of resembled it but the eye shape was different.  It appeared to have no clothing and the skin was slightly wrinkled.  As far as digits, I couldn't get a count on them. My chair is roughly 5-6 foot away from the door.  As I started to raise up to get out of my chair.  This thing some how came through my cracked door with out moving it and covered 5-6 feet in just 1-2 seconds.  At this point I had eye to eye contact as it touched my left forearm that was still resting on the recliner.  I suddenly felt calm and like I was under sleeping gas.  I remember continuing to watch it as my body relaxed and eyes closed.  I do not recall anything after that other than waking up and immediately going to check on my parents.  They was asleep and 1-2 hours passed to the best of my recollection. I kept it to myself for a long while thinking I imagined it quite frankly.  But I know that it was not a vivid dream, I was in fact fully awake.  I don't know what else I could provide with this report.  But maybe it helps with someone else's.

Difficult to judge distance, but appeared to move from below low level clouds to a higher elevation.  First saw only one light, which moved from approximately 50 degrees of arc to roughly 110 degrees relative to my position before disappearing. Light changed both intensity and color over approximately 1-2 minutes of observation.   Intensity would fade, then return to original brightness.  The light at first appeared to be an aircraft in the holding pattern of IAH.  Approach vector matched typical inbound commercial aircraft. After initial observation, it became clear that this was not a commercial airliner, due to a single light source.  Meaning there were no approach or running lights, nor were there any strobes.  No typical turbofan engine sound could be heard (no discernible noise at all related to the light)  Approach speed and angle were consistent with powered flight on a steady course.  After 2-3 minutes a second light appeared, following the same trajectory as the first.  I observed both of these until they appeared to either dissipate or disappear into the clouds.  Shortly after the first two lights disappeared, a second pair could be observed above the tree line, however these were on a different trajectory in their flight path.  The first set travelled from a 12 o’clock position to a 9 o’clock position, from my perspective as the observer.  The second followed a narrower flight path from 12 to 1 o’clock position.  A third pair of lights followed a 12 to 3 o’clock path.  Other observers present suggested this could have been a Chinese lantern or a drone.  Drone was not plausible due to the number, apparent altitude, lack of sound, and lack of running lights.  Chinese lanterns could not have moved at the apparent speed and divergent trajectories.  I took several photos of the lights and attempted a video, these were not very detailed.   However, the lights matched a video recording posted on YouTube that was filmed in South Carolina during December 24th.  The audio description also matches what I observed.  https://youtu.be/WQsSORRSzSE  I’m filing this report after doing some research and seeing a pattern of similar observations during the same period of time.",2019-01-24T00:00:00,30.106909170305677,-95.4739580786026

Strobe lights and entities on ground.,Frankford,WV,,unknown,45 minutes,"Occurred : 1/15/1964 23:30  (Entered as : 1/15/1964 23:30) Reported: 2/9/2019 4:46:31 AM 04:46 Posted: 2/14/2019 Location: Frankford, WV Shape: Unknown Duration:45 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/144/S144825.html,"Strobe lights and entities on ground. Observation:  I was returning from a basketball game late at night from the local high school.  The school was three miles from my home.  Usually I was able to ride most of the way with a friend and walk home the rest of the way.  I was 16 years old and lived on a small farm bordering a mountain.  My father was a poultry farmer and part time carpenter. I was walking the winding county road the last half mile to our home which turned off to the right.  The driveway passed an old two-story house on the left, where my father kept his carpentry tools, and the long poultry house.  The driveway continued, with our home on the right. There was snow on the ground (perhaps six inches), and the sky was completely cloudy.  Before I reached the driveway, a beam of light came through the clouds and circled the ground on the hill about 200 yards in front of me on the far side of the driveway on the side of the hill.  I paused, confused that any airplane of any sort would be out there in the middle of the night on a West Virginia mountainside.  I continued for a few steps and another strobe of light beamed through the cloud coverage.  Once again I paused and looked for something that could be the source of the light. Seeing nothing more, I continued on.  Shortly a third beam of light beamed through the clouds to the same spot and made a tight circle and disappeared.  After stopping and observing nothing more, I continued on and went to bed. The next morning, while my mother was fixing my breakfast, I told her of the incident.  She relayed to me that shortly before I came home, my father was awakened by a light shining through the bedroom window.  Looking out the window, he saw a bright light (like an orb) between the old house and the poultry house.  Fearing someone was trying to breaking in the old house to get his tools, he quickly put on his clothes and grabbed his shotgun. To head off the intruders, he ran around the poultry house to head them off from behind.  Visibility was pretty good, with the snow on the ground making it somewhat easy to see.  As he rounded the poultry house, the “orb” came out from between the two buildings and proceeded to move toward the spot where I later saw the strobe light beam to the ground.  Surprisingly, a second orb was sighted at the edge of the county road.  It also started moving up the hill too, moving toward the same spot.  As my father chased them, he saw a third orb near the ground where the strobe light had appeared. All three lights came together at the same spot and disappeared.  Approximately a half hour later, I came home and saw the strobe lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,37.9389,-80.3768

Though both my sightings are from years ago (which is before all the recognition it is getting currently), I want to be on record on this data-base.  I hope this will add more credence to the number of sightings reported, especially since Erich von Daniken’s book “Chariots of the Gods?”, of occurrences that have been surfacing since. Fall – 1974   This is a period in Southwestern Ontario that had a lot of sightings of ‘lights in the sky’.  To add ‘authority’ to the circumstances, it was the first time that I remember when Provincial Police even admitted to sightings – in the local Newspaper!  I was driving home from the country around 3 A.M with a friend of mine.  I had a convertible so no tricks were played with the glass or mirrors in the car. My friend was catching a nap when I looked in my rear-view mirror and saw a very strong single headlight behind me. It was above the road so I assumed it was a motorcycle coming down a hill behind me.  Still, it looked a little strange so I nudged my friend to have a look. By the time he stirred the giant single light was at the rear of my moving car. It was so bright, it reminded me of the Sun.  As I slowed down, we both turned in our seats to look.  At that precise moment the light quickly vanished straight up into the sky.  Harrier jets were the only air-vehicle to be able to rise horizontally at that time, but not at the speed that this light did.  There was NO sound at all from the UFO during this experience so I knew it wasn’t a motorcycle or a helicopter, etc. Summer – 1995  I was travelling at dusk on a major highway.  The sun had not quite gone down. I noticed ahead of me in the sky 3 triangular-shaped air vehicles that were flying in formation.  When I looked again, they picked up speed and were gone.  I thought of experimental aircraft from the Air force but realized nothing could go that fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

On January 5th, 2019, at 8:30 pm my 15 year old son and I were staying overnight at our hunting club in Taylor County, Ga.  The area is very rural and at least 10 to 12 miles from the nearest towns located between Talbotton, Ga, and Butler, Ga.  There was no light pollution whatsoever and a clear night. Our tent had gotten wet inside due to a lot of rain the past few weeks, so we ended up sleeping in our truck parked in a small field at our hunting club.  While sitting in the truck wasting time surfing the internet on our cell phones my son noticed a bright object far up in the sky and asked me what it was.  At first I thought it was a planet or star just brighter and standing out from the other stars.  The object then began moving from side to side, up and down, circular motions and straight lines.  At this time, we both became excited and curious as to what this thing was. We began filming the object with our cell phones the best we could.  As the object moved around it appeared to change shape from a ball of white light to a bluish color, then yellowish and red colors. + At times the outer edges of the circular object would look fuzzy and flash from dim to bright and change shapes as it moved. We continued to watch this thing for at least 30 minutes while we talked back and forth about what it could be and if anyone would believe us even though we have video of it on our cell phones. The object simply disappeared in less than a blink of an eye as 3 to 4 Airplanes were approaching in its direction.  Needless to say it took us a long time to fall asleep that night and overslept the next morning till 11:00 a.m. when we were supposed to be in our deer stands by daybreak.

The largest segment was a ovoid, like an egg.  The next largest segment was about 40% the size of the large segment—either an oval or an orb.  Two smaller round objects protruded from the side facing me, on each segment.  It appeared white-colored.  I tried to assess distance, size, etc.  There was utter silence.  No engine sound at all as is the case with blimps or aircraft.  No strings as might exist with a kite.  No propellers or turbines as might be the case with a drone.   As I drove along Rte. 333 toward Rte. 116 to head north, I got a good look.  I believe the object/craft was large and well beyond the immediate landscape.

It was again in the southwestern sky close to the coastline.  It was again white.  But now, I could tell it was moving.

I looked due south and noticed a solid green light that, with the glow of the clouds around it, looked to be just under half the size of a full moon in the night sky.  It moved north directly overhead and glowed with a kind of high intensity neon green.  I have never seen a colored light shine through the clouds so brightly.  At the time, the national weather service reported a cloud ceiling of 2,300 feet, and there was very light rain. I have an app called Flight Radar 24.  I checked this app, and no aircrafts with a transponder were anywhere within 50 miles of my location.  Being familiar with aviation and having flown an aircraft before,  I looked for an accompanying red light or even a white strobe light and there were none. The object made no noise at all, and the night was quiet enough to have heard either a propeller or jet engine at high altitude.  The intensity of the light did not change, and comparing it with other aircraft that typically fly over, it appeared to have a ground speed of well over 1000 mph.  Overall, it took approximately 1 minute to go from the southern horizon to disappear across the northern horizon.  These times were documented by a text I sent to my wife immediately before seeing it, and a phone call to my wife when it was disappearing to the north.   I tried to take a video with my cell phone but was unable to keep up with the object to even view it in the screen.

Since that day, I have been scared/paranoid because I didn't know what it actually was, or what the presence of these energies meant. This morning at 1:00 a.m., I went into my garage, looked out of the door window into my backyard and gazed at a beautiful starry night.  Then, I noticed one of the stars was close and moving inconsistently at different speeds all over a specific area.  I took a look at the rest of the stars to notice that ALL of the ""stars"" were moving. It was so hard to believe what I was seeing because there were over hundreds of lights moving near and far that imitated stars.  I tried to look for stars that were still, but there were none.  I tried to convince myself that the moving lights could have been anything else, but it was an undeniable site to see. Many of the light's movements were synced and some abnormally flickerd, or would disappear and reappear. I watched every single light bounce around in the sky and became angry because it didn't seem real, for it was like a fantasy, and why did I actually see this happen. Imagine looking at a clear night sky  in the middle of no where(where I'm from) and realizing they are all mysterious, unexplainable, vibrant balls of light that continuously moved, and occasionally morphed into different shapes.

I never thought I would be making a UFO report to NUFORC, but I suppose there is a first time for everything..  I was on my way to Seattle from the Lakewood 512 Park and Ride, riding on the #594 Sound Transit this morning.  It was a sunny and clear morning at about 9:15 am after we had merged onto the I-5 Northbound somewhere around 84th st exit, or a little past that, but way before the Tacoma Dome, I was looking out the bus window, sitting in the very back- left or driver side-seat; I witnessed up in the sky to the west (about a ¼ mile out), not far from the freeway, what appeared to be-2 silent, silver orb or sphere like objects (3 to 5 ft in diameter?), that were either reflecting the sun or had sun like-light emanating from them (hard to tell)-flying at insanely high rates of speed and what looked-to-me like one was chasing after the other!  At first thought, the most logical explanation I was thinking was,“ Wow, those are some fast moving drones!! ”  But then I quickly realised that that was impossible due to the fact that they were travelling way too fast, making dive bombing and zig zagging motions thru the sky and stopping and then darting off at a right angle and then shooting straight back up into the sky and then disappeared!  As I witnessed this I pointed and yelled to my friend who was sitting 2 seats forward, directly in front of me, “Nate, look!  Look!  What the hell are those?! ”   He immediately glanced out his window to his left and scanned the skies but couldn’t see what i was seeing.  A few other passengers glanced up from their smartphones and looked at me like I’m crazy and then went back to whatever it was that they were doing.  So, I seem to be the only one who witnessed this 10 to 15 second event.  It happened so fast that I didn’t even have a chance to try and get video of it with my own smartphone, which I really wished I had been able to do, because nobody is gonna believe this...I hardly believe it myself!  I do know that Fort Lewis McChord joint army/air force! base is very close to here.  So, is possible it could of been something from there they were testing?  If so, I’ve never seen anything move like that and at those speeds in all my life!  They literally defied our known laws of physics.  If anyone else witnessed what I saw, please report it!  I know that even tho my friend didn’t see what I saw, he believes me and knows that I don’t make things up.  But, it would be reassuring to know that I didn’t hallucinate the event and am not the only witness, and that perhaps someone else from this area of Washington had seen it too and can corroborate my story.

Have video. On March 18th, around 11:30 a.m.  A clear and sunny day.  I was parked in my car at Port Republic Park in New Jersey.  I was returning emails and phone calls for work, when I looked across the water and saw a black helicopter moving very slow, almost just hovering at about a hundred feet in the air.  I watch this for 15 minutes or so.  At this point the helicopter was too loud for me to talk business on the phone so I decided to leave.  As I drove around down  the road the helicopter was coming my way so I pulled off to the side and waited for it to come to me.  As it got closer all the dirt wind sticks and leaves we're being blown all around me.  Being this close I was able to get a good look at the helicopter.  It was all black no markings at all, no numbers or letters or names.  There was a person in a jumpsuit sitting outside the helicopter taking photos.  There was another car doing the same thing I was but I never talked to him.  I was so fixated on the helicopter I almost missed it.  I noticed above the helicopter a sphere with multiple flat sides like a hexagon.   The sphere was spinning slowly and hovering or moving very slowly at this point. I could see  the sun  bouncing off  the flat metallic  sides  as it spun.  I'm not sure if the helicopter was aware or not.  At this point I took out my phone and videotaped but had noticed the sphere was gone from my site.  At this point I continued to follow the helicopter at about 10 miles an hour or slower.  I could clearly see the person in the helicopter taking photos and at one point of me and my car so I thought I better leave.  When I got home and took a look at the video I realized that the sphere was in the sky but had just had moved more to the right. Unfortunately my phone video did not do it justice.  That being said I did document the strange event as you can see.  When you look at the video enlarged  and slow down and you will see the object appear in the bottom Circle then in one frame jumps to the second Circle.  I don't know how long 1 frame is but that seems ungodly fast to me.  If it wasn't for seeing that jump I may have just wrote it off to a strange sighting that could have been anything.

Apache and Durango,  The Lakes Business Park   So I was watching the moon and noticed hey the moon doesnt look right with this warping quality.  The moon appeared to be peeling and shimmering at the edges sort of like how hot blacktop distorts what you see with the heat convection, but in a way that made me uneasy.  So I thought hey maybe I should see if my camphone can capture what I was seeing.  I zoomed all the way in and aimed the camera and found a steady position and this took around 30 seconds to prepare.  Video quality was junk because my phone wasnt created for long distance zoom but I pressed record anyways.  The only object in the clear sky that I could see with my camera up to that point was the moon, but as soon as I pressed record, literally within milliseconds of activating the record function, this tiny white dot appeared traversing in front of the moon.  I held my steady position suddenly full of excitement that this could be a UFO.  I couldnt actually see it with my eyes but the camera picked it up fine.  This thing is obviously high altitude.  At first I thought it was a huge coincidence that I basically got ready to film a UFO without knowing it.  Sent me for a loop.  Distance was very difficult to determine but whatever it was it was definitely very high altitude.  Difficult to not think it was actually at the moon itself, but if it were at the moon it would need to be exceptionally bright and large to shine through the daytime blue sky. UFO?  Plane?  The ISS?   The recording is 48 seconds long.  The object approaches the moon from the right at around 51% up from the bottom of it in a straight line with a slight descent and then disappears.  It then reappears hovering for a fraction of a second on the left side of the moon inside that darker area as though it materialized out of nothing.  You can clearly see it didnt fly straight through solidly, the contrast of the dark patch on the left side of the moon makes it easier to see.  It then continued its path in the same direction behind the bare branches of the nearby tree.  I filmed it till it left my line of sight. It appeared to pulsars somewhat and with the lower resolutions you can see this pulsating more clearly.  I rewatched this Video a hundred times and truly its easy to obsess over because they I filmed this thing and its exciting.  My camera phone is a plain common android smart phone, nothing fancy.  I am sending you the whole 48 second video.  What I already posted online is a shortened 10 second version. I have seen It is of various sorts several times before. Last ones were 2015, 2 in 2014, here in Las Vegas, a whole bunch of them in 2011 and 2012 in Los Angeles and first one was 1994 in Oregon when I was a young kid.  This would be my first actual filming of a UFO in my whole life and funny that it was fully through chance and coincidence and perfect timing. I tried reporting this on the MUFON site but there is an error and forms cannot be submitted. I also tried sending the whole video but since it is 100.38MB and my email limit for attachments is 24MB I decided to upload it to Vimeo and peovide the link.

Date is approximate.  We first witnessed a diamond shaped craft hovering very close to a tall microwave tower east of Batesville, Mississippi.  Viewing it through binoculars, I was able to make out an array of red, green, blue, and yellow lights that seemed to be pulsing more than flashing.   After a few minutes, the object was joined by a second one, which also hovered near the tower for a while.  They then accelerated east across the sky at a speed faster than anything I’ve ever witnessed...  I would estimate they flew from one end of the sky to the other in less than two or three seconds.   I waited outside, hoping and, oddly, expecting, that they would return, and a couple hours later, three of them appeared from the east, as quickly as the first two had exited in that direction, and stopped suddenly near the tower again, hovering for a while before returning east.   I’ve thought about this event many times since then, and I’ve remembered it in great detail.  One thing that would help pinpoint the date is the fact that the weather report on the 10:00 PM news of Memphis station WMC mentioned “a lot of UFO sightings around the mid south tonight”.  I’ve tried to find transcripts of the news and haven’t had any luck. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thanks for the follow up.  The sighting state was actually Mississippi, and I live in Oregon now.  It’s possible I mistyped in the form, so my apologies.  I’ll get back to you if I remember more, but one thing that I’ll note is that it was dark when I first saw them, and I remember being outside for three hours.  The news aired at 10:00 PM, so sunset that day was quite early (before 7).  This would indicate a winter month, and I’m thinking probably January or February of 1992.

Summer of 1993  Just after Lunch; 12 Noon – 1pm   Not sure how I feel about sharing my story but it happened and changed my life. I was only 10 years old, I was at my friend ((female friend's name deleted)) house and we were inside playing hide and go seek.  We were scolded for being to loud and were sent outside to play.  Seems like all summer long we sat drawing with sidewalk chalk, as we sit in the drive way a shadow came over us.  There were no large trees and it was a clear day.  We looked at each other and then looked up.  What we saw sounds crazy at best. It was a large tear drop shape craft.  It was about; 20-25 feet long, 12-15 feet wide, and I couldn’t tell the height but it would have been large enough for full grown adults.  It was like liquid metal, we couldn’t see ourselves in the reflection but it was a mirror like silver.  It also had a ripple like a stone tossed into water.  It didn’t make any noise.  There was no heat coming off it.  It just hung there; if we would have reached up, we could have touched it.  It was only 6-7 feet off the ground. We were kind of in a state of shock, I guess, because we didn’t move or say anything.  But to a kid, I guess it was confusing.  But then we snapped out of it and started screaming, we were so loud that ((female friend's name deleted)) parents ran out to see what was going on.  Just as we started screaming, the craft took off, high and fast, towards Nicholasville Rd, as we were on University Ave.  We were pointing and trying to explain what happened, but her parents couldn’t or didn’t see it and it seemed to stop and watch as we tried to explain what was happening.  We were pointing at it as it sat there for a moment; it was reflective so it matched the blue sky.  You could only see it if you knew what to look for I guess. We were scolded for scaring everyone and making up a story.  ((female friend's name deleted)) had to go inside, and I was sent home.  I ran back to my house on Crescent Ave. screaming for my mom.  She heard me and met me outside trying to calm me down.  My mom tried to calm me down and I didn’t know anything about UFO, but my mom actually said to me, “It was probably just a weather balloon.”  I remember thinking this wasn’t a balloon.  She got me inside, and she was cooking dinner but we had just had lunch.  I don’t know the time but it wasn’t normal.  I was confused and scared, for a long time.  ((female friend's name deleted)) and I were never allowed to play together again.  Her family thought that I was putting stories that gave her nightmares. I started having problems sleeping as well; I was sleep walking, having horrible dreams, and having sleep paralysis.  On several occasions my mom saw me trying to walk outside in my sleep, she had to put locks on the doors that I couldn’t reach.  When I couldn’t get out the doors, I actually tried to go out the window.  According to her she asked me why I was trying to get outside, and I said because the blimp is out there.  I was having dreams of blimps chasing me and of my neighbors back yard being on fire.  I couldn’t scream though I tried no sound would come out. I couldn’t move.  When I was finally able to I would start screaming out of control.  After I told my mom that she decided I needed to go to the doctor.  My primary care said I needed a therapist and a sleep study.  I started fearing everything; like shower curtains, heights, darkness, and I feared going to sleep so bad that I would stay awake for days.  I was awake so long that I would start seeing things and becoming mo! re fearful. I was taken to the Woodland Group in Lexington to see a therapist.  I really liked the guy, he had a labyrinth in his back yard.  The started doing hypnosis on me to see what got me so worked up.  He put headphones on my ears and the music would go back and forth left to right in my ears.  He also had me follow a light left to right until I got tired, not asleep just tired.  The only thing I remember him telling me to touch my face when I was scared and that it would relax me.  It worked and I got over my fears, sometimes I still catch myself touching my face in specific spots.  I also still have sleep paralysis, but it doesn’t scare me anymore. When I stop and think about that night, I feel at peace now.  I can’t remember something about a slender figure that opened his arms and seem to hold me.  It was like he cared about me and wanted me to know that.  I think I recall everything being white and sooth. Later in life I became a Deputy (law enforcement officer) and I worked with a Deputy that was stationed at Area 51 as a test piolet, in the 50s.  He has passed away now, but I always wonder why he decided to tell me about a missing aircraft that occurred when he was there.  I don’t know why this always occurs around me.  But it worries me that no one seems to understand this was real, it happened and I don’t know how to convince people to understand me.  My family jokes about it, one time I got real serious and spoke to my mom about it all as an adult.  Her story changed she said it was probably something the local University made and was flying.  If we had that technology then why hasn’t it come out yet, it’s not us.",2019-02-22T00:00:00,38.00883948620362,-84.47708249286394

On this night, ny father was sitting outside on our back patio in the dark, only a porch light illuminating the area.  My mother and I were indoors, talking, sitting at the kitchen table. That room has windows which face north, one of which overlooks the back patio.  That window was partially open, as was at least one other. At approx. 9:48 pm EDT, my father shouted something unintelligible (to me) through the open window nearest the table where I sat inside the house.  My mom understood what he'd said, telling me of my father, ""He's demanding I come outside!""  After that, I heard him as he continued yelling to my mom to come outside ""right now"" to see something. I will outside, instead, anticipating an announcement to the effect of, ""There's a skunk in our yard! (There is long precedent for this sort of statement).  I walked to the door, and as I crossed the patio toward my father, he pointed toward the sky (it being nearly entirely dark, this was not terribly useful and I did not even know he'd done until I saw a photo taken that night).  I asked where to look, and then he explained to me where to look in the sky:  toward the far northwest to the west side of a large tree in our backyard. Once I turned  to look in that direction, it was easy to see the object to which what he'd been referring.  It appeared to be quite large, utilizing nearby homes and trees as a point of reference, and was a vibrant, brightly-colored object which appeared nearly round in shape.  It seemed to glow, and that glow was quite intense, the entire object a uniformly-brilliant red-orange and lacked any discrepancy in intensity over its entire visible surface. It appeared to be relatively large, greater than the size of any plane (civilian or military) I've yet to see under similar circumstances.  It appeared, initially, to be flying a bit lower than even the typical passenger planes which I see daily as they fly to and from a nearby airport.  The only crafts I've seen in such a low flight paths have been F-15s & F-16s flying during either the local, annual air show, or else flying in and out of nearby Wright-Patterson AFB. This red object moved quite rapidly, heading east with its initial path seemingly parallel to the earth.  After about 30 seconds, it disappeared from my view as our backyard tree obscured my line of sight entirely, then returned to view.  When it did, it appeared to remain moving forward from West to east, still traveling parallel to the ground for about ten seconds.  Then, it suddenly appeared smaller (from which change I'd generally infer either a change in size, luminosity, or distance from the point of observation, but whatever occurred did so seemingly instantaneously). Then, still appearing smaller, the object apparently gained altitude, rising from  a former point about 35 degrees above horizon to ~45 degrees above horizon, and then, at zenith, the object seemed to cease moving completely.  It did not move nor vary in size or light intensity for several seconds, then began moving in a manner completely different from how it had moved before stopping.  It repeatedly moved in what appeared to be a linear, upward direction perpendicular to the going (without any associated forward or backward motion), did the same moving downward, eastward, westward, or at varying angles; it seemed to move closer at times, farther away  at others, each of the perpendicular motions made occurred without the object also moving in any direction parallel to the ground, yet other  times it moved forward (west to east) or backward while apparently accelerating or decelerating.  It also would simply cease moving and remain static, as well as move in sharply curving and angled paths as it appeared to simultaneously move up or down. It remained the same shade of glowing, vivid reddish-orange throughout, its light initially seeming to vary in intensity relative to its distance from me, but after the first 60 seconds or so, these changes in light intensity seemed to lack any correlation with the way it appeared to move. It was during the sequence of rapid, varied movements that the object again appeared to completely cease moving, and, while remaining stationary, appeared to divide into two of itself, yet both objects appeared identical in shape, and color/luminosity.  There was no visible division of the first object; it simply appeared to change from one object into two, the second appearing (at first) as if conjoined with the first object, as initially, a small portion of the edge of its upper left (west) quadrant appearing to either overlap or be contained within the edge of the lower right (east) quadrant of the first/original object.  The only visible sign that accompanied the appearance of the second object was a quick, less-than-a-second, flare-like emission from the lower-right (east) quadrant of the first object; this quickly-appearing and quickly-fading flare was the same color as the object itself.  The second object appeared nearly identical to the first/original, except it appear! ed to be slightly smaller.  The second object remained visible for only a second or less; it then vanished entirely, without any apparent movement at all. The original object remained, now alone again.  It remained visible for ~90 seconds more after the second object disappeared, the original resuming its prior series of sharp, quick motions (without any apparent pattern or sequence) alternated with seconds of apparent non-movement. It had been visible for 3-4 minutes when it again appeared to stop in place, stationary, then its light intensified as it appeared to increase slightly in size (perhaps it was moving closer to me).  Immediately after that, at an incredible speed, the object moved silently to the east, then appeared to gain altitude at this same, ultra-rapid speed (closest to which I can compare its speed is to that of a meteor streaking across fhe night sky) as it moved east-to-west at quite a steep angle, although it did not move in a straight line as it did so.  It never ceased that motion, but once it reached its highest point, it moved with the same sort of extremely rapid speed toward the east/southeast before vanishing, seemingly among the clouds in that direction. Whether its motion was linear or otherwise, each motion of the object was quite fluid & it always appeared to move with a noticeably agile ease.  The object seemed entirely silent throughout.",2019-02-22T00:00:00,39.73540852059925,-84.16762780898877

Low on the horizon was a moving light. I told him it was a plane (Prescott Airport is behind our location, so they are not uncommon).  He said not that one, and pointed to a light above the rooftops in the distance. As we watched, it seemed to bob and drift slightly like someone's hobby drone.  I managed to get and extreme zoom steady picture (which had to be greatly enlarged on my pc).  It appeared to have 6 red lights and 2 blue/green.  It seemed to be changing colors, but it was a distance.  On one photo where I moved, it appears as a multicolored streak, showing the different colors. Thinking it was someone's drone, I forgot about it.  A couple of hours later I went out to look at the stars before going to bed.  It was still there, just higher in the sky. I sent photos to a professor at Embry Riddle Aeronautic University in Prescott.  I knew that they had a UAV program.  He eventually got back to me and said no body there claims it.

This event occurred in Patchogue, NY in the early 1950s and is a secondhand report, as most of the people who experienced it have since passed away.  This is an event I heard described multiple times over the course of many years. In the early 1950s in Patchogue there was a water tower in the woods west of Fordham Street and Nottingham Ave not far from where the current water tower on Waterworks Road now stands.  My understanding is that the current water tower in that area is not the same one however, I could be wrong about that. Kids who grew up in that area at that time used to run through the woods, which were more extensive then, and play.  The base of the water tower was a favorite spot for the neighborhood kids to hang out.  Many of the residents on Fordham and Nottingham had been there since the 1910s, and in some cases were second generation living in that neighborhood.  Also, the water tower was visible from the front or back yards of many of the homes on Fordham and Nottingham. One day in the early 1950s, a woman who was a second generation resident of that neighborhood was hanging laundry in her backyard while her three young children quietly played.  She happened to look up at the water tower an saw what she described as a large gold disc hovering above it.  She stood observing it for several minutes.  The circumference of the disc was greater than the circumference of the bulb of the water tower and was described as “a large gold saucer”.  The disc shot off, disappearing at a high rate of speed. Two of this resident’s children remember the saucer.  One described the saucer as the resident did, the other claims to have only seen a gold flash as it moved off at a high rate of speed. The resident also stated the following, “I don’t know who those people were inside it but, they weren’t from here”.  Neither of this resident’s children with memory of this event claim to have ever entered this object.  This resident never responded when asked if she had entered the craft.  When asked how she knew there were people inside the object and how she knew they weren’t from “here”, the resident seemed to be holding something back, as if considering what to say.

I don’t recall the exact date or time, but it was in 1999, it was cold outside, and late at night. A friend of mine paged me (remember pagers? lol), and I called him back, and he tells me a ufo just flew over his house which was a few miles away from me.  He said it morphed as it went by, and made a strange whirring sound.  I go outside to maybe see if it came my way, and it did.  There’s this orange glowing thing just sitting in the sky. Friends with me fetched some binoculars, and I saw it was almond/teardrop in shape, the entire thing flower orange, no sign of anything metallic, and on the larger end of it was a red, slowly pulsating glow.  It would then move sightly in one direction, turn, and go in the other very slowly.  I watched it for 10-15 minutes until it turned again and flew away in the opposite direction as me. Over time, I’ve seen them here and there, much further away.  I always felt watched, too, but it never felt sinister or malicious to me. It was an incredible experience.  I never heard any sound, though, just my friend who saw it fly over him.  He also said men in black visited his neighbourhood the next day. Also, I had a dream after that night of seeing an alien lying on the ground in what looked like a waiting room.  I sat on a couch, and to my 11 o clock was a hallway that had walls of bright light that led to a dark room.  I look over at the alien, and its eyes open, glowing orange, and I suddenly have a piercing pain in my head. I closed my eyes, and then saw myself sitting on a surgeon’s table in a dark room lit only by the hallway.  Then I woke up.  Makes me wonder if I was abducted.  It still didn’t feel evil to me, though, and I swear my cognition improved the next few days.  It was insane.

But once I locked onto it and my vision adjusted to it, it was not a satellite.   It was a V of white colored lights, with one at the tip, and two down each side, like geese in formation.  The magnitude of their brightest was like that of a dim star or satellite.  I picked it up at about an 11 o'clock position in the sky.  It was moving at an enormous rate of speed, so that it had passed over my position and down to a 2 or 3 o'clock position and out of sight.  There were no clouds, it just faded to nothing.   The whole sighting took place in 4 or 5 seconds.  There was no sound, no debris like a meteor would normally shed while it went.  Their was not outline visible, only the shape of the white lites.  Everything about it gave me! the sense it was beyond our atmosphere and very far in space.  I knew when I saw it that it was something incredible.   I waited for approximately 20 minutes to see if I would see anything else, while trying very hard to process what I had seen.  I have never seen anything in my life that caused me such excitement and bewilderment.  I felt 100% that I had just witnessed a UFO sighting.   I cannot say if it was man-made or not.

I shut off the TV, the room was dark and I looked out the south facing window of our Lakeville, MN, home as I often do to reflect before bed time.  We face a large field about a half mile across with new housing development on the other side.  There is a very large new apartment building straight across from us.  I saw a small bright light in the distant sky above the apartment building to our south.  This is common because we live on a  flight path to MPLS Airport. I watched for a couple minutes and the light seemed to be still so I decided it was a star but it was too low and bright to be a star.  I watched a few more minutes then stood up to leave the room.  I noticed it had moved a little.  I thought I want to see what this slow bright airplane is.  Usually the lights go from just visible to an obvious airplane with landing lights and sound over our house in less then five minutes. A few more minutes (probably 2 or 3) passed and the light was noticeably closer.  I saw pulsating or revolving red lights at the top of a sort of triangle.  The red lights seemed to revolve but the bright lights seemed to radiate down the triangle from the red lights.  It was coming straight at me from the south so I decided to wait and see what this was. It approached closer and angled off to the east toward Saint Paul.  The image stopped getting bigger but I could see it pretty clearly.  The red lights appeared more stationery but flashing.  The bright lights seemed to be traveling down at an angle like they were following a rope from the top of a sail on a sailboat.  The lights came down both sides from the top in a tag along format.  Both sides didn't appear to be synchronized but both were the same.  The light seemed to travel back and forth between the bottom corners, not as bright as the others and more random.  There was very little, if any noise, from it but I felt I did detect a slight distant jet engine sound. It moved further away to the north east until it was back to being a strange bright slow moving light in the sky.  I went to bed.  I told my wife about it this morning.

There were probably several dozen such ""light streams"" going from the top to the bottom of its body.  It also moved in a jellyfish-like fashion.  It made no sound and slowly flew higher.

It was low to the ground (about as high as a water tower), and about as big as a very large water tower.  It had three very bright lights that appeared to be shining downward, one on each end of the wing, and one at the nose.  It also had flashing red and green lights at the rear, almost like antennas.  It was in the shape of a stealth airplane, but it was hovering completely still.  I didn’t think to wind my window down, but I didn’t hear a single sound, so it definitely wasn't an airplane or helicopter.  It didn’t make any wind either.  I thought for sure I would see something holding it up like it was built there, but there definitely was nothing underneath it.  Other than the two wings, it almost looked hollow from underneath, but it was hard to tell because the lights were so bright. We continued to drive up the road a few miles in awe over what we just saw when we decided to turn around and go back to look at it again, but it wasn’t there anymore.  We then turn back around heading south again,  a few miles past where we had seen it the first time, we saw it again but it was farther away and a little bit higher this time and it was moving slowly.  Still no wind coming from it. I tried to video tape it but because it was dark the only thing you can see were the lights.  We pulled off a side road so that we could watch it.  It moved like a drone going forward and sideways very smoothly.  It was traveling away from us at the speed of let’s say maybe a helicopter until we couldn’t see it anymore.

A friend and I drove from Los Angeles area out to the Salton Sea area on 01/17/18.  We were going out that way to shoot astro photography, so we had all our camera gear.  On the way out when we were on highway 111 I believe, when we saw a group of fireballs in the sky.  They illuminated one after another going in a line what seemed like 2 or 300 feet in the air.  I think there were about five or six in the first cluster we saw.  One would light up really bright just like a ball of fire, then as it was going out after 1 second or so the next would light up, so on and so forth.  We were pretty astounded at the sight of them and couldn't figure out what it was.  I was thinking some sort of oil pipe we couldn't see burning off fumes or something.  We really had no idea.  We kept driving another 30 minutes or so and arrived at the Salton sea area.  We were in the Bombay beach ruins section.  Soon after we arrived we saw another group of fireballs shoot through the sky.  I set up my tripod and camera and started shooting continuously trying to capture the fireballs. I have included the one picture I got in unedited format, edited, zoomed and highly contrasted. I hate it when I see ufo images that look fake or terrible. I wanted to include all the high res pics and zooms and what not. Our night was already feeling pretty special from the fireballs when we heard a very low and loud sonic boom. We both looked at each other like ""did you just hear that?"" We kept shooting and over the night saw a couple more groups of fireballs and heard about 7 to 10 more sonic booms. All of this was seeming very strange. We decided to walk up to another part of the beach area. While we were in this area we saw two lights coming over the Salton sea towards us. It was very dark, the craft was silent. It was cigar shaped and had a green light on the front and a white light on the back. It was a couple hundred feet in the air and moved completely silently. Since it was so dark and it was moving I wasn't able to get an image other than the green and white lights. It looked and moved like a blimp, but we could not see it and the fact that it came after fireballs and sonic booms made it feel even stranger. I don't know if there is a military base out there or what was going on. I'd love to hear if you've had more sightings out there of if any of this can be explained.",2019-02-27T00:00:00,,

My mother and I went outside to see several silvery-whitish orbs (definitely a metallic glint) in the sky above our home, not sure how high up, but perhaps a half mile?  What was remarkable about them was that they were doing what was some kind of coordinated dance; two and three orbs would merge together into one orb, and then would separate again, and spin around each other gracefully.  In some cases three orbs would form a triangle with three points, and then merge into one orb again, and then move back into a triangle formation.  Other times two orbs would merge, separate, dance around each other, and then merge again. I have seen a number of UFOs in my life, but this was most remarkable, and clearly not of this world.  Interestingly, my mother was not able to see them other than saying, ""All I see are some glints of metal in the sky.""

Triangular shaped craft sighted in Japan   LOCATION:  Northeast of Matsusaka, Mie Japan approximately 1.0 km (estimated) from the Pacific Ocean.  Driving on Route 23. SEASON: Summer, 26 degrees Celsius  TIME: 20:30 hours (8:30PM) approximately. Visibility:	Clear skies,  Night. OBJECT: Triangular shaped (Black?). No Lights other than glowing exhaust. No sound. BACKGROUND: I am a retired USAF veteran who has worked on the flight-line and worked with, and seen most fighter jets and other cargo craft in the conventional inventory including the U2, and the SR-71 at that time.  I left the Air Force in 1991.  This object resembled nothing I’ve ever seen before. SIGHTING:	 I was driving southwest on route 23 that generally parallels the Pacific Ocean.  At approximately 8:30 PM, dark but clear skies,  I was approaching an intersection with a stoplight about 300 meters ahead.  While my vehicle (van) was decelerating and still in motion, I saw an object moving rapidly to my left through my front windshield. DESCRIPTION: The object was triangular in shape and moved extremely fast. The craft was positioned about 30 degrees high off of the horizon.  It moved from my 12 o’clock position to my 9 o’clock position.  It covered the length of my windshield in approximately 2-3 seconds where there after it completely vanished. The flight path followed a straight line with about a 5 degree descent. DETAILS:  The exhaust port glowed with a bright orange color.  Because of the brightness of the glowing exhaust I could barely make out the shape of the craft and it appeared to be triangular in shape.  I could not estimate the size of the object because it was dark and there were no structures with which to reference it with.  (I will say that from my perspective in the van it was almost about the width of a dime held at arm’s length)  SOUND/LIGHTS: The object had no blinking lights, nor did it make any sound. DISTANCE:  I would estimate the craft to have been 1km away from my position, but this a general guess based on the clarity of the glowing engine (exhaust port). When the craft vanished, it was high enough off the horizon that no mountains, houses or other structures could have obscured it.  In addition, the skies were clear and I could not see any clouds. When I reached the intersection, I had a clear view of the sky and its former flight path.  I watched for a very long time and the object never reappeared. OTHER: There is a Japanese Self Defense forces helicopter base about 12km south of the location of the sighting, however they only fly helicopters.  No Jets are flown from there and there are no civilian airports nearby. I have two American friends who have also witnessed triangular shaped craft within the same area.  One is an aeronautical engineer.",2019-02-27T00:00:00,,

The night of the blood moon, I was on the porch with binoculars looking at the details of the moon and the stars surrounding the moon.  I decided to scan the sky to look at more stars since the sky was filled with so many bright stars.  As I scanned with the binoculars from the left to right my vision was disturbed by something because I wasn’t seeing any stars.  I thought I ended up looking to low into the trees.  I dropped the binoculars to gain visual of the sky again but I wasn’t looking at the trees.  The area in the sky I came to was obviously different to my naked eyes.  No stars and the shade of the dark sky was a different shade of black.  But there also seemed to be visual texture covering the area.  All I’ve been able to describe it as is a piece of paper that’s been crumpled and then layed out flat again but now very wrinkly. It was so close and large it seemed like a wall. I couldn’t make out a definite shape.  It looked like a puddle covered with a sheer wrinkled cloth.  I had no idea what I was seeing so I looked through the binoculars.  That’s when I was able to see the scattered lights within the form.  No defined pattern.  Lots of very small pin dot lights and about 10 large white lights that did not flicker like drone lights that I’m use to seeing in my area. I quickly went to the garage asking my friend to come look at something and grab the gun so he could look through the scope.  We walked out the door and I pointed to the right back corner of the house for him to go too.  Instead as I was looking at the sky the object was now at the other end of the house straight up and much smaller like it was higher in the sky.  The object moved from one side of the house to the other and higher up in the 3 minutes it took me to get him outside.  He immediately seen the cluster of lights. He didn’t notice the shape color or wrinkles until he looked in his scope.  I knew with his logical thinking he would tell me what it was. His reaction scared me.  He verified what I seen almost exactly without me telling him what I actually seen. Over a 5 hour period we took turns going outside to look at the object to try and make some logical sense of what we were observing.  The object never moved. After about 5 hours it either got higher or further away to were we couldn’t see the lights anymore.  I don’t know exactly how large it was but my first visual it was extremely large.  Once it moved it was much smaller but I felt it was just so incredibly high in the sky it looked small.  The lights were small an dim as well.  We both had a feeling it was very large and that we may have only been seeing a small portion of it. I have seen this object every weekend since the blood moon except when it’s cloudy.  I’ve tried to tell my self it’s just a cluster of stars.  Do stars move large distances within minutes? Are stars in the middle of a dark colored form?  And each time I see it it’s not always in the same spot. •	I read a post of a sighting of two young girls and seen the pictures of the object seen. This is why I’m writing.  The size.  The description of the ripples.  I can’t give a definite shape to match but I know what I have been seeing and I can’t find a logical explanation.  And that scares me.",2019-02-27T00:00:00,46.744,-92.5739

It was haze gray in color, spherical or perhaps saucer-shaped, and hung in the sky to the left of my plane at about 20 degrees below the horizon.  As it drifted under the wing I tried to make out the direction it was traveling or any wings I could discern but could not.  My plane's wing eventually obscured the object and I was unable to relocate it. I thought it was just another aircraft until a just few minutes later when an approaching airliner flew safely past my plane, streaking contrails as it did.  It was only then that I realized the object I had seen had produced no contrails whatsoever and may have not even been moving. The sighting occurred about 9 AM CST.  SWA 2168 was flying at 41,000 feet and was somewhere south of Pine Springs, TX.  I estimate the object was 5-10k feet below my plane though it is difficult to gauge the size/distance of something unfamiliar.",2019-01-24T00:00:00,,

We ended up at the other end of Clearview – he parked the car, we got out and went over the bankement.  There was this huge circular object with multi-coloured lights that was stationary in the water over Lake Ponchatrain..I am not sure how many feet it was out -- there was absolutely no noise. It stayed there for maybe 30-45 seconds, then started moving very slowly towards the bank where I & my friend were standing -- I started running towards it… but I just couldn’t get close enough.  My friend and I then ran up on the bank to watch it slowly leave and literally disappear without a trace. There were other people that night who had seen the same thing – they were standing further down from my friend and I.  I want to say at least six people maybe more.

We all went outside to see what this was.  It was the largest thing I've ever saw.  Disc shaped with what now I would call blue white light coming from it.  It made no sound at all.  It just hung in the air like it was suspended.  I do not know how long it was there?  It finally moved so quickly that it bent over very large old trees, moved with speeds so quickly that we knew this was not a air force vehicle.  The speed at which it moved is unheard of, and the way it turned sideways in the sky was not like any plane, helicopter, or anything else we see in the sky daily.   This thing was the size of 4 football fields, made no sound at all, and was still as of it were hanging in the sky.   None of us ever reported this to! anyone d/t the backlash of reporting such things.  I was a kid when this happened, and now a adult.  This was very frightening, and continues to be one of the most frightening experience I've ever encountered.  The light coming from it did stop.  Now thinking back on this event the light reminded me of what we call blue florescent light now.   At the time, I remember thinking it was extremely bright.  It was still visible due to its enormous size, & outdoor lighting.  None of us spoke about this the following day which I find very strange.  I only remembered it as a adult having a dream.   I called family members to ask if this is what we saw, and they confirmed it.

The approximate time of my sighting was November or December or January of 2009 or 2010.  Very clear, no clouds, no wind.  I've always enjoyed looking at the stars at night and in winter everything is very clear.  There were no leaves on the trees; otherwise I couldn't have seen anything.  It was around 9:00 p.m.  I usually stand in the driveway just outside the side door.  Some lights drew my attention to the sky further up the driveway (westward) just past the garage door.  I walked over, stood, and continued looking up. I could clearly see a black triangular object, stationary, completely silent.  I could only tell there was something there because of the nine or so green and gold lights which were evenly spaced around the outside edge and defined the isosceles triangular shape.  I stood for at least five-ten minutes, a long time.  It was cold.  I wanted my husband to see it but thought it would probably disappear while I was trying to find him in the house, so I just stayed there. The object did not make me feel threatened or anything other than curious.  My initial thought was that it was a B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, but it was the wrong shape and the lights certainly weren't in line with stealth.  Besides, it wasn't moving at all or making any sound, and I don't think the B-2 has either of those capabilities. I repeat, there was never any movement from the object.  It never made any sound AT ALL, no hum, nothing.  I have far beyond excellent hearing.  There was no audible disturbance of any kind, no air movement.  The object did not appear to be very high up, perhaps less than 60-90 feet.  It was not large.  I made the ""find your dominant eye"" shape with my hands above my upturned face, and the object fit inside the triangle made by my hands. Finally I ran into the house because I wanted someone else to see it.  I shouted for my husband to come out.  Instead of coming, he said ""what is it"" because I didn't sound panicked or scared. I said Just Come Out.  Immediately I returned to the spot I had been standing in, but the object was gone.  I felt distinctly irritated.  I looked all around the area of sky that I could see from that position, and there was nothing there.  I walked down the driveway and looked in every direction.  Nothing.  My husband FINALLY came out.  My desire to share this with him was a wasted effort.  Next time he can find his own UFO.  For many nights I went outside and looked in every visible area of the sky from our driveway.  I never again saw that object or any other object.  Note:  I remember thinking the craft's lights reminded me of Christmas Lights, which is what makes me think it was probably in November or December or January.  It was definitely after 2006.  My approximation of 2009 or 2010 is just what sticks in my mind.",2019-01-17T00:00:00,34.04023923444976,-84.34734832535885

This stretch of freeway is sparsely populated and pretty dark at night, so they shone incredibly brightly.  They also seemed to be not more than a couple hundred feet or so above the horizon, so initially I thought maybe it could have been lights from a tower of some kind, but I've never noticed them before in all my time driving that stretch of road.   I asked my wife if she saw them; to which she commented that she thought it was strange that they were so orange.  I then asked her to Google if there were any kind of air fields or radio towers in that area.  Her quick search determined there shouldn't be anything in that direction.  She went back to looking at her phone, but even though I was driving, my eyes were fixated on them.  If you drew a straight line between them, they would seem to be perfec! tly parallel to the ground, and they didn't move at all, at least they didn't seem to from my perspective.  They didn't blink, they didn't pulse, they didn't move, they were just there, and bright.  It was like they were staring at me. I just stared right back at them for several minutes while I drove.

What I mean is, it at first resembled a commercial airplane considering the size and formation of lights, but it was flying at a height just barely above the trees/power lines and housetops, flying N/NW.  There were 2 white lights where wings of a jet or plane might be, and one red light at the tail that was flashing (hence, forming a triangle).   I know this sounds like a commercial airplane, but there's no way that this ""plane"" would have been flying so low and without sound to boot.  After noticing these anomalies, we began to chase after it, heading N on Graham Street and E on Delaware to jog over to SR-1 N.   As we headed N on SR-1 and could still see the object for a few minutes, this time flying NE/N, until it was gone above the industrial park just south of the! SR-1/I-70 Interchange.  Looking back on the event, and even though this sighting happened after dark, my wife believes that the object looked, most-likely, that it was in fact 1 or 2 separate objects (accounting for both of the white lights) with the red-lit flashing object in tow.  I couldn't necessarily say that I saw anything between the lights, and she's not saying that she could either, but that made more sense to her senses and what she was actually seeing than it being 1 solid craft.  Again, this is a densely-populated area that would not have seen a commercial-sized aircraft this low EVER - but that was precisely the size of it.  Finally, the lights, while appearing not dissimilar in color and size to that of a plane, had an odd, square-shapedness about them.  I have only seen 2 objects in my life that have made me scratch my head and I look up a lot.  It should be noted that my previous sighting (which I did report to NUFORC with the date of 8/15/02) overlapped with this sighting at the location of Graham St./Delaware St.   Meaning th at the object we witnessed last night passed over nearly the EXACT airspace of my only other previous sighting of a shiny spherical UFO.",2019-01-11T00:00:00,39.8306,-85.1742

I watched it briefly until it disappeared behind a canopy of oak trees which lined the street.  Moments later, I saw it reappear from behind the trees and a few seconds later a second one, then a third one. I would describe these ""lights"" as spheres with an orange/yellow color.  The three looked identical and moved laterally or parallel to the ground not appearing to gain or lose altitude.  I now realize that the first light I saw was the last one to disappear behind the trees just before they all reappeared.  They were all equidistant to each other, and if an imaginary line were drawn connecting them, the end result would be a triangle.  I don't know if these were three separate spheres, or if they were three lights on a single larger possibly triangular shaped conveyance.

Dear Peter,   Let me start by saying that I am a Coast-2-Coast Insider and value the work you do immensely.  Thank you for all of your hard work and dedication.   I have had two UFO sightings in my lifetime.  Being a former Law Enforcement Intelligence Analyst, I can appreciate you wanting the facts as clear and concise as possible.  The latest incident just recently took place, so I will give this information first.  The second sighting took place in the 90’s within a quarter of a mile from this latest one.  I will send that information separately…   February 8, 2019:  While traveling northeast on Route 126 (Sabattus Street) headed home from picking up take-out, I noticed a large gray/black stream of what appeared to be smoke in the sky from a distance.  (Maybe ¾ of a mile away.)  As I crested Steven’s Hill, I could clearly see that the smoke trail included a huge, orange fireball passing over Sabattus Mountain off to my left, which I couldn’t see from the bottom of the hill.  My first thought was that an airplane was engulfed in flames, but the orange ball was not dropping in the sky as would be expected.  My second thought was a meteor of some type, as it streaked across the sky, but in a much, much slower motion.  The object was heading south-east only slightly dropping in altitude. The evening was clear with blue sky and the sun setting behind me as I drove toward the object.  Several vehicles before me could (obviously) see the same object that I was seeing, as some pulled over and/or slowed down.  I quickly passed these vehicles to see if I could get a better view of the object.  My house is not far from the location that it was heading towards. (Within a mile.)  As I passed the lake, I tried to get my (cell phone) video activated, but I could not keep an eye on the object and record while driving at the same time.  I immediately called my sister (who lives next door to me) to look outside, but she did not answer her phone. Once I passed by Sabattus Lake (on my left), I could clearly see the object in front of me, starting to move towards my right.  The area is rural and while Route 126 is a main road, traffic only travels at 45-50 mph within that stretch.  When I approached my road on the right, I could see the orange ball burn out as the object started slowing down, almost as if it came to a stop and leveled out.  It hovered in place for the better part of 30-45 seconds and no longer had a trail of smoke behind it.  I immediately pulled over and threw my car in park!   The object was a gray elongated, oval shaped craft of some sort.  No wings, like an airplane.  Way too long to be a helicopter and I saw no propellers or movement of any sort.  On estimate I would say possibly the size of a football field and shiny metallic.  It was still too high to see any clear small characteristics such as windows and/or doors.  All I could see was a huge metallic form hovering above the field.  There were no lights visible. I will say that I drive with my eyeglasses on, so I was looking at the object/craft with 20/20 vision.  When I had pulled over, several other vehicles were doing the same (on both sides of the road).  I once again grabbed my phone to take a video, but I didn’t want to look away for fear that I would miss something!  A car that pulled in behind me had a man jumping out of the driver’s seat, yelling at a female in the passenger seat to get her phone and take a video.  I was trying to do the same, but I couldn’t open my camera fast enough. With my window unrolled, I can only estimate that it hovered about the level that our Life Flight helicopter flies by at.  (Slightly above tree-top level.)  It was less than ¼ of a mile away from me, hovering what seemed like forever until it tipped upward slightly on the right and took off diagonally.  It went fast to the right, stopped and then straight up and disappeared from sight. I was in awe!  When I looked around at the other vehicles across the road from me, people were still looking and searching the sky.  I drove off leaving roughly 6-10 other vehicles still on the side of the road. With all that said, I will say that the past two weeks have been very eventful in the skies around here.  We have a hot tub and go out nightly, under the stars.  We have had more helicopters and low-flying planes in this area (nightly) than EVER in the past 45 years that I’ve lived here.  There was a report on the evening news saying that all the helicopters/aircraft were here for a “training mission”, but I don’t buy it!  There were too many people that saw the craft that I saw.  It’s too coincidental to now have them conduct a “mid-winter training” in our rural area after such an event.  Something is out there and it was clearly in trouble, but somehow it corrected itself, extinguished itself, even, and took off again.  I can’t explain it, but I do know that there have been several sightings around Sabattus Mountain over the years.  I will try to find some of the newspaper articles and send them your way!  If I could be of any further help, please don’t hesitate to contact me!",2019-02-22T00:00:00,44.1316,-70.0606

This was our third encounter in this area.  We were returning to the Toronto area from Port Dover heading East on St Johns Rd.  My wife noticed a scintillating star (22:40) ahead which was the same as our first encounter. After turning North on HWY 6, I started looking for a good place to get off the main road and she started unpacking my Nikon DSLR.  After shooting a few shots directly out my driver side window at right angle to the road (42.857849 N -80.128051 E, bearing 77 degrees East, 20 degrees elevation 22:53-23:01 - dsc0475.jpg – dsc0488.jpg and dsc_0487.mov) and not being able to get a clear shot I switched to video.  The object was cycling through the entire spectrum four times a second (Established by image DCS_0478.jpg, which was an accidental shot while still lining up the object, the motion in the shot is from the camera moving, but the shutter speed was ½ second and the entire colour spectrum is cycled twice). At the point I was sure it wasn’t a star or any natural object I had seen before, nor was it the ISS or a satellite.  It didn’t have the lighting for a licensed aircraft.  I thought it might be a drone until it had been visible for 30 minutes, I haven’t known any drones with the ability to stay aloft that long. We then packed up and travelled down the highway a few kilometers to another street in an attempt to triangulate a location.  At that location we took some more video and photos (42.905104 N -80.099142 E, bearing 75 degrees East, 20 degrees elevation 23:10-23:12 - dsc0489.jpg – dsc0492.jpg and dsc_0491.mov) which turned out the same. We packed up again and headed out hoping to see some noticeable change in the bearing.  While driving my wife attempted to get some photos with my camera while I was driving (DSC0492.jpg – DSC0503.jpg) with varying degrees of success.  She also took some photos at the observation stops over my shoulder (Jarvis1-Jarvis3). We finally lost sight of the object as we merged onto the HWY403 as we entered Hamilton and came down the escarpment.  We may have caught sight of the object in the predicted location according o my in-dash navigation system, but as we hadn’t had LOS through Hamilton, I’m not willing to guarantee that it is the same object.  If it was, we still had sight of the object when we reached our destination at 01:00 in Brampton and lost sight behind buildings.  At all times the Navigation system showed the object as being East and we could see it at 20 degrees elevation. At no point were we able to identify the object.  The colour changes reminded me of old Commodore 64 programs that would cycle through the colour palette to create a flashing sprite.  I still wonder if an object like this were seen 2000 years ago if it could have been the Star of Bethlehem and wondered how long it could keep the same position relative to the ground.  Even the stars had shifted close to 20 degrees from the Earths rotation over the entire trip. Some of the images when image filters are used appear to show faint ghost copies of the object. We’re planning a follow-up trip for a week this summer in the same area to see if we can collect more data.",2019-02-22T00:00:00,,

UFO sighting in Everglades National Park at East Cape in the Florida Bay 2-1-19:  I was with a friend in a small motor boat at about 10:00 in the morning.  We left the Flamingo Marina at around 9:30 am and were heading out to explore the Florida Bay, which is part of Everglades National Park.  We decided to check out East Cape which is 9.9 miles from the Marina.  (Look at the location on a map, it is a very remote area).   At approximately 10:00 am, we were approaching East Cape which is part of Cape Sable, the southernmost point in the Florida Peninsula.   I wanted to visit this location, because this is a remote area where you can camp on the beach, but can only get their by boat.  As we were approaching the beach, I turned on my GoPro and started filming. Shortly after I started filming I saw what I thought was a balloon silently floating near the tree line.  My first impression was that it was one of those colored helium birthday balloons.  It was silent and slowly floated upwards while slowly rotating.  As it rotated, there was a different color on each side of it.  I know one side was blue and as it rotated, the other side was more of a purple color.   It appeared to be small like a balloon, but the more I watched it, the colors appeared to be brighter and as it ascended, I got the impression that it wasn’t just reflecting light, but was actually illuminated. My friend was driving the boat and I assume he was looking straight ahead as we were heading to the beach.  I was sitting in the front of the boat filming.  On the video, you can hear me say to my friend “that is a balloon right?”  After he didn’t respond I called his name and asked again “that’s a balloon right?”  He didn’t see anything.  I pointed to it and described it and he said he couldn’t see anything.  Shortly thereafter, it floated up and disappeared in the clouds. I was so excited that I had filmed something unusual and even if it turned out to be a balloon, it would have been a great story to tell and show the video of the “ufo” to my friends.  I couldn’t wait to get home and watch the video on a bigger monitor so that I could figure out what it was.  That night, I watched the video back on the GoPro and it was too small, I couldn’t see anything.  When I got home I immediately downloaded the video onto my PC and watched the video on a big monitor.  As I played back the video, there was nothing there!  I couldn’t see anything in the location where I remember seeing the object.  I watched the video over and over many times and there is no trace of the object that I saw.  And I DEFINITELY saw something very colorful floating and rotating in the sky that morning. As I watched the video over and over, I noticed a white object floating across the sky coming from the opposite direction of the colored object that I saw.  The white object on the video is seen much higher up in the sky and could very well be an airplane.  At the time I shot the video, I did not notice an airplane in the sky and don’t remember hearing anything either.  The object I saw was lower to the ground and slowly ascending and rotating. That’s my story and I swear that I saw something.  I don’t know what it was, but it was there and it was beautiful.  The strange part, and the part that confirms for me that what I saw was NOT a balloon, is that it did not show up on the video.  I don’t know why my friend didn’t see anything, I can’t explain it. I would like have the video analyzed and see if there is something there that isn’t visible during regular playback.  Maybe something would show up with infrared filters or something.   I don’t know anything about that, but I know I saw something. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes himself as a medical specialist.  We suspect that he is a  highly qualified witness.

Between hours of roughly 5:30 pm and 6:30 pm PST on Feb 2, 2019, we were sitting in our hot tub.  It was dark night conditions with clouds and no stars visible.  Suddenly a yellow oblong shape tracked across the sky in a N - NNE route.  It would have been below the cloud cover.  There was no 'tail'.  It was distinctly not round, and not fully teardrop, but just oblong.   The event didn’t last more than 1 minute, and though I didn’t see it 'appear' because the hot tub lid obscured the view, it disappeared as a sort of blur that seemed to me that it was being obscured by clouds, as it headed away from us.  It was never directly over us as if trying to BE over us personally.  It just tracked along a bit to the east of our exact position as we looked up. It was a golden yellow color like campfire flame, not white or red or green as would normal aircraft lights be.  The entire shape was the same color, not blinking or shifting intensity, and not leaving behind a trail or tail of any kind.  The full shape just moved across the sky.

At approximately 18:00 hours, 6:00P.M. PST local time, I was sitting on my couch in my apartment when I noticed a circular well-lit red object, with a flashing green light beneath it, zip at a very high rate of speed across the horizon from south to north at an extremely accelerated rate.  It was at a modest altitude, clearly visible, approximately 3 to 4 miles due West.   It then began a series of aeronautical maneuvers directly over Hollywood Blvd. to the South, and Franklin Avenue to the north.  It then returned at that same high rate of speed then stopped in a totally frozen hover above Hollywood itself.   I opened my sliding glass door to my balcony to hear if it made the sound of a helicopter.  It made no sound whatsoever, all the while flashing a green light under its carriage.  It then accelerated straight up approximately 1000 feet immediately, again at extreme rates of speed, then began a series of ascending and descending aerobatic moves from a dead stop in both horizontal and vertical motions.  It in no way acted like a drone, helicopter, small aircraft, or military aircraft.  From my perspective it appeared to be the size of a small dirigible but not as large as a blimp.  It moved both smoothly, and dramatically quickly, far faster and more dynamic than any other aircraft I have seen.  It was able multiple times to stop on a dime and hover silently then accelerate to different altitudes and horizons on a grid.  And then quickly accelerated to the West and out of my visual range.   As a previous witness in 1978 of a translucent orbed object over the night sky of Simi Valley, California, I have had previous experience with be unique movement of these craft.  My sighting this evening falls into that category.

They were all the same size similar to stars of a blue and white color.  The ""stars"" pattern was that of a rhombus.  The heaviest concentration were centralized creating a single glow.   WhenI I grabbed my binoculars and viewed the formation, they were all blue and white star objects.  At the center was a perfect chandelier pattern with loosely scattered ""stars"" to the left and right sides of the chandelier within the overall rhombus.  I was shocked to see the brightest central area of the rhombus was a heavy grouping of the lights in a perfect chandelier shape.  As the minutes passed the formation of outter loose lights were moving into the central chandelier or the entire object was rotating making the outter lights appear to be moving inward.  The formation gradually grew dimmer and more dim as it appeared to be moving out further in an ESE direction until it was no longer visible.  2 others in the area were also watching this occur. My initial explanation before the binoculars was re-entering glowing hot space debri.  My second thought sometime of explosion in the air.  A 3rd would be a massive amount of aircraft chaff glittering, glowing and hovering in the air.  With the binoculars the only logical explanation I can come up with is drones flying in a formation shape out to sea. Nothing else I can think of makes sense.

We can lie in bed and look out at the stars or passing aircraft in the sky.  On this particular night, the sky was clear. During the above time  frame, I was watching TV when my wife remarked, “What in the world is that? I looked out of one of the windows to observe something moving in the sky from a northwestern direction toward the southeast.  What we were looking at was something with a very bright red light on top of an orange light.  We at first thought it was a helicopter but I have never seen a helicopter with that type lighting.  My wife then said, “Look, there is another one.”  I remarked that there must be a bad wreck, and they are sending two helicopters.  (It is noted that we live near a hospital, and it is not unusual for us to see and hear helicopters at night).  We the saw a third object ; and then a fourth; fifth and sixth.  All of these objects looked alike with the same red and orange lights.  All six of  these objects were visible at one time. My wife jumped out of bed and went to the other end of our house to see where these objects were going.  They kept coming about fifteen seconds apart.  We observed a total of fourteen of these object, all with the same lights. All of these objects followed the same path and seemed to be traveling at  about  the speed of a helicopter. Some of them seemed to be at an altitude of about 2,000 feet and some at about 1000 feet although this is only a guess.  As they passed not far from our house, they seemed to climb to the southeast and then disappear. The fact that we never heard any sound from these objects caused us to think they might be  drones but why would there be fourteen of them all going the same route?  We were never able to see any frame as all we could focus on were the bright red and orange lights. There is nothing of interest known to us that would be on the course that these objects took.

It was a very clear sky, no cloud coverage, all stars were visible.  We are in the country so the night sky is quite clear to us. We were standing together chatting about a game we were playing, when off to my right and up just slightly above the tree line, I noticed a bright orange light in the sky,  I nudged him and was just about to say “look a plane,” when the light went bright red then back to orange again.  We were both looking directly at it and my husband said, “What is that?”  As we both watched, it proceeded up into the air at about a 15 degree ascension.  Moving fast through the sky from a NNW to a NNE direction, at one point, the bright light disappeared, and we then could see what appeared to be a very bright, orange flame coloured streak going across the sky. The streak seemed to consist of either flames (I say flames because we saw actual sparks) or a laser like trail in the sky. I find it hard to actually describe it in words.  We noticed the flames were very thin, and very very straight in the air.  Then the streak slowly vanished or burnt out. It was as if the light had streaked through the air then vanished and all that was left was the propulsion burn off. We both ran with our dogs to the back of the house to see if we could see it in the distance, or see if it would reappear, but it had totally vanished in about 6 to 7 seconds.  If we had our backs turned we would have missed it completely. It was traveling very fast, very silent, and it felt like it would have been easy to miss if we were not in the right place at the right time.

Well, to make a long story short (too late now), I came to my apartment which was right across the street from where I was snapping the pictures.  I hooked up the camera to the computer and began looking at the photos I got.  I noticed nothing but sky on several initial photos.  But when I looked at this one my jaw dropped.  I saw these 9 very clear dots of light that appeared to be near the path of the rocket.   I checked the photos after that one and the dots didn't appear.   I think I may have inadvertently photographed a swarm of UFOs watching the launch. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides photo, which shows small whie objects against a blue sky.

This would be the general location which air craft departing Sky Harbor would acesend.   At first glance I assumed it was a commercial aircraft.  I did a double take noticing that the lights or illuminations from the craft did not strobe or blink as the take off and landing lights, nor were the lights of different colors(red white, green) but a solid vibrant orange red color.  The object first appears elongated as the fussolage of a commercial aircraft, but I notice the the craft is not ascending, but moving steadily towards the east and a smooth steady but greater rate of the than a commercial or private aircraft.  I noticed there was no sounds of engine, after-burners or propulsion of any kind.

The object appeared to  turn counterclockwise as if to face south and took an “orb” shape vs elongated cigar shape.  As the craft moved to my twelve o’clock, it immediately stopped in place.  It hovered in place motionless.

After the final flash, the orb which still remains orange/red glow began and swif, vertical assertion without sounds of engine, jets or propellers.  It moved vertically several thousand feet when the orange glow of the orb dimmed to almost invisible or as if it had disappeared behind clouds or contrails and then was no longer visible.

It moved to sit over the parking lot across the road.

At first glance the object could have been mistaken for Venus but it was too large.  As a process of elimination, I verified that there were no planets or major stars at that location with Google night sky and manual observations of celestial bodies.  I also eliminated the possibility of aircraft easily as there were several commercial aircraft flying at different altitudes and directions.  All the aircraft were very small in comparison. The object appeared to be round but pulsed brightly in a fashion that made it look like it was flaring the light in a sort of diamond shape.  The object cycled through multiple colors at a steady rate and exhibited a range of color beyond what is seen on commercial and private aircraft. There was no sound but I can't say for sure it was silent as it seemed to be several miles away across the city.  I assumed that this object had to have been seen by more people than myself due to its size, color shifting and duration that it was visible.  I scanned the local news the following day and none of them mentored it.  I did find a video on YouTube of someone else that did see it, and they shot a video of it with their phone.  I didn't stay out to see the object disappear but the person shooting the video did.  They filmed it until it just vanished from sight.  It didn't fly away.  It faded from view while never moving during the entire episode. I will attempt to upload the video or link it for you to review.  I didn't try recording it myself because my phone camera doesn't zoom out to distances that far well and the video from the other person I found does not properly show exactly how large and brilliant the object actually was.

After 11 mins, a long line of clouds covered the object and he either lost it or it disappeared.  There was nothing in the sky visible to him besides this object at NNE, a plane flying west of the object and some clouds.  He went inside after no longer being able to see the object and uploaded the video. (MUFON CMS, 97533)  [Photos aren’t very probative, but they do seem to show a dumbbell-shaped object.

Tonight, around 8:30pm, I had this urge to look out our back sliding glass door, and to my surprise, I saw the full moon and it seemed bigger/closer than usual and extremely bright!  So bright that it not only gave more light into the sky, but it also produced a ring shape light onto the ground and the middle was shadowed.  I told my mom & step dad then returned to the door to admire the strangeness to it.  I glanced up to the right of the moon and that’s when I saw the first craft.  It was very close at first, there was no sound from it, I could see 3 different color lights that appeared to be spinning in a circle, most were white but there was at least 1 blue and 1 red light,  I yelled for my step dad to come see it because it was just hovering in the air.  It didn’t appear to be moving at first and a few minutes later you could see it gradually moving farther away and upward into the sky.  It would also move slightly right or left.  It wasn’t going fast like it had a des! tination to get to but seemed to be scanning the area.  Once it was too far to see all three lights as well as when it was close another aircraft showed up from the right.  This one did have a faint sound and was going quite fast.  It only had a white light, the light would flash once disappear and then flash again when it got some distance away.  It went right in front of the first craft slightly turned flying left under the moon & right above the tree line.  It then stayed in one area but going upwards and downwards until it just disappeared.  A few minutes later i saw the same flashing light craft much farther left, it was going slow at first, but sped up to disappear around the side of the house.  During all of this the other one was still just hovering in the same spot, it would get a little closer and then go back farther/higher again.  It continued to do this, around 10 I had to stop looking to put my son to bed.  I kept checking until 10:30pm or 11 and that’s when it was fin! ally out of sight.  This sighting was the most amazing for me because t his craft didn’t seem to mind that it was seen and it stayed hovering around the same area the longest amount of time I’ve ever seen any kind of craft do..  while the others seemed to make sure it was not in any danger.  Myself, my mom, step dad and 3 year old all got a great look at this amazing sighting & were all amazed by it.  My puppy also broke off his chain around the time this first occurred, we usually hear him barking or running around the house when this happens but he was extremely calm and was drawn to the ring light & would look toward the craft.",2019-01-24T00:00:00,44.7243,-83.455

Directly across my front door in the sky was a very bright star like light that was a bright yellow white.  Lower than a star though.  It was in a area of the sky that the planes turn around to land at the Rochester airport.  So my first thought was it was a plane turning around like they do. Again, this unusually bright star was BRIGHT, kinda flickering and in that plane turn around area in the sky right near Lake Ontario. While watching this bright light it slowly faded away and disappeared.  It never moved from its spot in the sky.  At that time I assumed it was a plane turning around but 15 seconds later it slowly faded back to its full brightness.  It did this multiple times not moving from its spot in the sky for about 15 min. I continued to check on it while I was getting ready it eventually disappeared after a hour of this.  I didn't see it leave but was definitely unusual. The sky was clear that morning, no clouds and was still dark. I didn't think to take a picture or thought it was weird at the time because I assume it must be explainable.  When I got up the next morning and went to smoke it wasn't there so definitely wasn't a star. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Driving home from work south on rt 5 near Island Rd. on Northampton/Easthampton line when I saw three stationary bright white lights hovering over the Connecticut River between Mt. Tom and Skinner Mt.  The lights were in a straight row, with the 2 outer lights being slightly larger.   Of the three lights, the center one was strobing slowly which I thought was odd since planes usually have the lights on their wings flashing.  This was a pure, bright, white light, not a yellow light that incandescent bulbs emit.  The center light was level with the other two and was pulsating separately.  The center light emitted a more ""rainbow"" like light, similar to a moonstone, but was mostly white-passing.   I thought it was a plane coming in for a landing since it seemed flat, at the Northampton airport nearby but there were not standard blue, green, or red flashing lights to indicate it was an aircraft.  It also did not waver up or down, it remained stationary in the sky until I had been pulled over for about 30 seconds or so.  I then thought it might be a dual propeller helicopter, but it was MUCH too large to be that.  I thought that it was then possibly a drone, but it was much too large to be a drone.   After I had pulled over to the side of the road to continue monitoring the craft, it began to tilt starboard upon its path heading north.  It slowly crossed to my left, past the line where my car was pulled over which was when I was able to see the bottom of the craft as it was still in a tilt position hovering over the river.  There were 4 identical sized pure white bright lights emitting from the bottom of the craft in a square/diamond shape.   In addition, there were 2 more of the smaller center-strobing lights beneath the craft, below where the center one was seen when I first saw the craft facing toward me.  I turned off my radio and lowered my window to hear if it was making any sound, but I didn't detect that it was.  There were cars travelling both ways in the distance so it may have distorted my! hearing No sound like helicopter blades or a plane's engine even when it was parallel with my vehicle and less than 1/2 mile away from my car over the river.   The craft slowly continued its course at about 30-40 MPH north/north east over the river (less than 500 ft above the water) before I pulled back into traffic and headed home.  The sun had set by this time so I was not able to see much else of the craft in the darkness other than the positioning of the lights at both angles that I viewed the craft.  I felt like I was looking at something I wasn't supposed to be looking at, as it only changed course after I had pulled off the road and started intently staring at it.  I was shocked no one in front or behind me had pulled over to witness it with me.  After about 1 minute of direct sight with the craft, it began travelling away from me, following the river north/northeast, I decided I wanted to head home as I was scared about the actuality of what I had just seen.   It was not my first time seeing a UFO, but it was the first time I had seen one this close up.",2019-01-04T00:00:00,42.2903,-72.6404

The objects were not flying in formation and were spread out high and low, some were swirling about the others.  Many of the objects in the lead would actually reverse direction and join those trailing behind.   One object was observed diving at a very high right of speed, stopping, making a 180 degree turn upwards and disappearing in a cloud above it. Not knowing the size of the objects it was difficult for me to judge their distance.  I would make a guess of anywhere between a half mile and three quarters mile in distance from my location. My eyesight is very good and I was able to see that the objects did not flap wings as a bird would.  Secondly, the sun would strike some of the objects and I could see that they appeared to be silver in color. I had my I-Phone 8 with me and began taking a video.  I took 4 videos in total. I continued watching and observed that the objects continued in a southerly direction and were almost directly above downtown Roseville. The objects continued their swirling gyrations and after a couple of minutes were lost to sight.

The satellite continued across the sky and out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare from an Iridium satellite?  PD))",2019-02-07T00:00:00,40.8624,-78.1734

This unusual craft was brought to my attention by a person passing by. I observed this craft with other witnesses. I captured this on my tablet but it’s difficult to make out. It appeared to be metallic, circular in shape, no sound, it had what appeared to be white lights on the bottom of the craft that would illuminate the under airfoil – the lights looked like the large LED lights you see on the big screen TV in stadiums for say a hockey game, and it seemed to be moving incredibly slowly.  This craft had no navigational lights (red & green), no tail, no wings, no visible landing gear, no visible windows. Their were other aircrafts in the area that we could identify and see that they were from Harbor Air & they were fixed wing float planes that appeared to be diverting from the area. At or around 1504 the craft just disappeared. I have raw video in HD. Some people who witnessed this event made all kinds of conjecture, saying it could be drones, could be “demonic” or “inter dimensional."" It sure didn’t look like a helicopter & it didn’t have any wings, no markings (identifiable call sign, company logo), no sound & the other aircrafts turned the other way, literally!  I am former student pilot from CZBB and I have experienced “unusual traffic” before but never have attempted to capture the event. Just happened to have my tablet available. *In the videos the craft appears to be this flashing white circular small objet.  It’s hard to see in the video but in person it was much larger & more visible.  In the still images it’s hard to see, but it too looks like a small white bright circular object.

Last night, she was feeding her horses with our dog by the barn which is in an oak tree grove at a short distance from our house.  She first noticed the horses acting strangely.  They became excited and nervous.  Normally, when she is feeding them, they are calm and docile.  Then, our dog became spooked and tried to run away from the barn and back to the house.  He had to stop at the gate where he stayed at a distance pacing nervously. ((Daughter's name deleted)) looked around to see if there was a wild animal around that was causing the animals to act strangely.  She did not see anything but she did hear the sound of something scraping along the tops of the trees by the barn.   She looked up and, in the dark, could make out some sort of craft slowly gliding across the top of the trees.  There was no sound except for the sound of something hitting the very top of the trees.  There were no lights.  It was too dark for her to see the object clearly. The object was moving roughly south to north at a very slow pace. ((Daughter's name deleted)) had the feeling that the craft, or whatever was operating it, was aware of her presence. After it cleared the oak grove and moved further north, she noticed a pink glow in the northern horizon that she thought may have been directly related to the craft. I decided to write about this encounter because this is the second craft that ((Daughter's name deleted)) has seen by the barn.  The first sighting was a daytime sighting in which the craft followed the exact same south to north path. In the first sighting, from approximately 3 years ago, ((Daughter's name deleted)) first noticed that everything in her general vicinity went still and silent.  She noticed movement above her and saw a very low flying, triangular shaped, metallic craft slowly flying above the tree tops.  Again, there was no noise and no lights.  The craft glided slowly above the oak grove and over to the north. At the time, ((Daughter's name deleted)) said the craft was silver in color and that it had a glass window of some sort on the top where the ""pilot"" could theoretically see out of it.  She had never seen any type of airplane that looked similar.  She could not see through the window because she was beneath the craft and was at the wrong angle to see inside the window on the top of the craft. In both cases, she said that she kept blinking her eyes and shaking her head to clear her mind because she could not believe what she was seeing.  She was so confused both times as the craft flew overhead that she just stared at it trying to adjust her eyes so that she could figure out what she was witnessing.  It was not until the craft was gone that she became alarmed and came straight up to the house to report the sightings to me. ((Daughter's name deleted)) is not prone to flights of fancy.  She was visibly shaken after both sightings.  I absolutely believe that she saw something that she could not explain or understand in both cases. I asked if there was any type of motor or engine that she could see.  She said, in both cases, that she could not hear any noise at all.  In the daytime sighting she said that the craft was smooth, and that she saw no engines, motors, or other  forms of propulsion. ((Daughter/witness)) drew a picture of the craft from 3 years ago.

My sister commented that two planes shouldn’t be flying that close together. We watched the lights and realized they were moving exactly in tandem, one after the other, about the length of a football field apart.  The light in front was a blinking white light, and the lights in the back were blinking in a fast pattern red and white. We assumed this was one plane following the other, but then realized that the area between the two sets of lights was totally blacked out, and as it passed, we could see stars blacked out behind it. It was very dark, and we couldn’t clearly see an outline of an aircraft, but it appears it was sort of shaped like a long, slim blimp.  There was no noise, and the craft was moving slower than flights we normally see coming into the airport area of Belgrade for landing.  It was also fairly low to the ground, and it continued directly east over Bozeman and continued eastward until we could no longer see the lights.

I took 6 pictures facing West from my back yard before reviewing them with my LG V40 phone.  I saw this little black triangle and zoomed in the best I could and I started seeing it most the pictures.

I was curious to see if anyone else reported anything strange in the area or possibly was able to get a video or more evidence of what it was or could be.  I marked that there may have been 2 objects.  There is a green orb that definitely looked out of place, but I didn’t really notice it as much on my phone, more so on my computer monitor.

Let me start off by saying I am a firm believer that there is some weird ((deleted--stuff)) going on call it aliens or whatever but I'm a 19 year old native of Albuquerque, New Mexico, so I have heard the UFO stories of Roswell and other UFO stories that birth from New Mexico, but this one I was able to experience first-hand and up close. this was the scariest thing i have experienced but it has left me wondering if anyone else witnessed this. At about 11:00 p.m through 12:00 a.m February 19, 2019, (Just Last night) in Albuquerque I noticed a formation of three dots starting on the Northwest side of our Mountains (Sandia Mountains).  As I stared closer these dots were actually moving simultaneously south going along the base of the mountains.  These lights were the brightest lights in the city so I thought maybe a search party along the mountains or something with a logical explanation but the longer I stared the more intrigued I became at how they were just able to float and connect to each other in synchronicity, so I got in my truck and drove up Paseo Del Norte eastbound towards the Sandias where the lights were floating and slowly moving.  As I got closer to the lights they became almost mesmerizing and bear with me but seemed like an acid trip or some sort of hallucinogenic matrix within those light formations but the even weirder part is once I was at the street, Louisiana, still going up Paseo, it started to smell so foul almost like rotten eggs or rotting bodies, this was a clear indicator that whatever was up on those mountains was creating some sort of disgusting gas or odor which made me almost delusional and confused.  I immediately turned around and went home to get my brother so I could have a witness.  (My iPhone 6s could not pick up ((deleted--stuff)) on the camera).   After picking up my brother from the west-side of town, we drove to a small hill that overlooks the city and fair enough the lights were there and moving pretty close to were the Sandia Casino is and at that point I had enough and went home. There is a YouTube video:  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEHxfKn6dVo&list=LLp59OiX9hU9cvilK9Ckf3bw&t=0s&index=3)  The video shows 2 lights that are exactly like one of the many bright lights I saw last night. I'm glad I found this video since I was not able to get a video or a picture of the actual event.  Another statement to add was that these lights started on the north side of the bas! e of the mountain and 'floated' to the south side of the base of that mountain in such a strange manner, almost like the way programs can stack on top of each other on a computer.  Like if there is a virus spamming a bunch of programs on a computer.  It may be smart to add that there is a military base on the south side area where the UFO's were floating to (Kirtland Air-force Base, Manzano Base)",2019-02-22T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

Clear day, nothing but blue sky. Happened to be looking up while I was waiting and saw a class silver disc saucer.  First noticed that it was much higher up than standard aircraft and traveling at a constant but noticeably faster speed than normal airplanes. I observed it travel across the sky this way for a good 30 secs.  Then, all of sudden it stopped on a dime in middair for a few seconds and hovered.  It then traveled extremely quickly for a short distance in a different direction before pausing again, this time only for a brief moment, then it took off in a third direction, this time at a rate of insane speed and became blur that left my field of view in a fraction of a second.

We made an attempt to touch or catch this material but upon contact with it, it disintegrated and disappeared before our eyes!  We then looked up, and approximately 75 to 100 feet above us, there was a rust or copper colored UFO.  It did not look like any UFO I have seen before in pictures.  It was a turtle shell like object, flat on the bottom, with 4 objects dangling from it almost like a prehistoric craft the size of two regular size trucks. We then reached to grab our phones to capture a picture of it and as we looked back up at it,  it ""flew"" away north east at a ridiculously fast speed.  Like it was in warpspeed.  Leaving behind a trail of white light that also disappeared within seconds!  This thing looked like nothing I have ever seen before.  It had to have come from behind us in the western direction because we did not see or know of its coming upon us.  It was also silent, it made no noise.  It had no lights,  nothing.

I watched as it came closer to where I was.  It was the same color and almost the same intensity as those orange street lights.  I didn't want to lose it and wanted a better look so I quickly made the turn and had to take an immediate left onto my street.   I pulled over, shut my car off and got out of my car so I could see if there was any breeze like maybe it was a lantern.  No,it wasn't.  It was approximately slightly larger than one of those exercise balls (though it's difficult to determine size and how high it was ).  It seemed to be approximately 50-100 ft in the air.  Noiseless, floating against ! the breeze turned toward the south and then the light went out as soon as it was almost directly above me and I could still see there was some structure but very dark and as it moved away from me I lost track of where it was.

I intended to previously submit this, however circumstances following the event caused the submission to be forgotten following drafting the description and posting the video.  I showed this video the Clyde Lewis and he encouraged be to submit the report.)  Video of object can be seen on Youtube: https://youtu.be/NU6_C_Gqgnc  Me and my mother were traveling south-east bound in my car, taking a fork in the road when I spotted and pointed out three objects that appeared to be comets (first thing that went through my mind)..  I only saw one at first but two more came into sight moments later as I winded down the curvy road. (total of three)  I pointed them out in a bit of a panic because they appeared to be really big.  They started out half the size of the moon, though shrank as they moved and appeared to be moving away over and past the mountain.  Their movements were 'graceful' being the only way I can describe it.  Their tails were white with a bit yellowish toward the end.  I slowed to a crawl as we neared an intersection, and noted they were totally silent. It was not like a firework, nor a flare, the tail seemed to emit off the object so slowly (especially at first when they were quite long).  The objects continued making sharp banking turns side to side independent of one another. The tails curved in response to the movements, glowing fire-like tails lingered quite a ways behind the objects creating them (to such an extent that when they made turns, the tails formed C-shapes).  At this point the third lowest UFO dipped below the houses and vanished as they moved over the mountain. (picture them in a triangle pattern with a flat face down of the triangle, the left most point was lower than the right most two points, with the top point high near the moon in the sky viewing SE)  I hurried as quickly as I could into the school parking lot (trying to take care, there were still cars and possibly kids around) at that intersection and parked as quickly as possible.  At this point the right most light was dipping below the house's roof lines, and as I struggled out of the car, flipping my phone on and trying to get it into camera mode the object took one final turn from right to left. Finally I got the camera up and started taking video of the final object which had drastically slowed it's banking movements, and was now slowly descending before vanishing behind a house's roof top.  Towards the end of the sighting, about the time I parked, the object's tails significantly reduced in length.  I know exactly where I parked, and I was facing down towards two homes. So I know right where it was in the sky in what direction. We proceeded to rush in the direction of where the objects dipped behind the houses (which are, in turn, on a mountain/hill. If the objects were still in the sky they could still be fairly high in elevation just on the other side of the mountain. This was our line of thought as we attempted to get on the other side of Mt. Scott.)  My mother riding with me got a better look (since I was driving). She reports ""The object was silver/metallic egg-shaped. The flame was undulating and was being emitted from object's widest perimeter in a ribbon type form.""  The video picks up moments before the final object disappeared behind the houses to the other side of the mountain. By this time the objects had grown much smaller due to the distance they've moved and two of the three weren't visible.  The phone's camera shifted to a red tone, ruining the color representation of the object. (I have no idea why). The video is unedited, and the zoom was digital zoom on the phone. For a brief moment before I zoom in, you can see the moon and surroundings for size and perspective.

I called out the UFO, pointing at it, to my wife.  I always do this with what is obviously planes which amuses her, and I actually did think this was a plane at first.  As usual, I asked her if she saw any blinking (planes have blinking lights), and she watched it ready to tell me she sees it blinking.  This took longer than usual and we both stopped walking.  She said “there, it blinked.  Wait, no it just got dimmer… I don’t like the way it’s moving.”.  This was as the light started moving faster, faster, in my opinion, then most planes move across the sky.  In all this time there was no blinking lights, though the light did get brighter and dimmer.

I told my wife that I thought that was a real one.

I was walking out of a food store when I saw a bright, steady red light moving east to west which at first appeared to be an airplane.  I noticed immediately it was not blinking but did not have the characteristics of a helicopter in flight at night. I tried to photograph and video it with my cellphone.  Just as I was putting away the phone, I saw an identical object move in the same direction just a short distance behind the previous one.  For about 7 seconds I could see both bright red lights moving at the same speed.  I tried to take pictures and video. I drove towards a neighboring area away from the bright street lights.  I had the impression that the air traffic was off, as planes appeared to be circling the airport.  I could count 4 or 5 airplanes, clearly seen as blinking lights.  Even airplanes that were moving away appeared like distant blinking dots.  A small airplane landing at the little airport nearby appeared as one red light not too bright with a blinking red light.  It was landing west to east and it was easy to identify as a small airplane. At this point, I spotted the third, even brighter red light in the same point and moving in the same direction as the other two.  This was about 21:10 hours.  I walked away from my car to photograph and video it as it was even more clear than the other two and again did  not resemble a plane.  No sound could be heard at all.  Even the regular planes I could hear when they are visible that way, much more helicopters. After I lost sight of the third light, I waited about 15 more minutes but could not see anything besides planes.  On video the planes also appear as blinking lights, small and white or white and red.

I was driving North toward the Catalina Mountains when I turned my gaze to the left and was startled by an intense set of lights on a large, pitch-black object which appeared to be within 5-6 blocks West of my intersection.  I was startled by how large the object appeared to be compared to usual aircraft, how close it appeared to me, the intensity and unique semi-linear organization of the lights, and by the fact that the craft appeared to be stationary in the sky.  It was lower than a helicopter would typically be, but was larger and flatter than a helicopter. I immediately pulled over with the intent of getting a picture.  Once I was stopped and facing the object straight on, I noticed the rectangular shape and what appeared to be a projection on the far dorsal surface, with some of the lights set further back on the craft than others (in contrast to the semi-linear arrangement of my initial perspective).  Within about 3 seconds of me getting a good look at it from this view, it began a Southeast descent at only about 10mph faster than what I'd expect from a typical aircraft.   At this point I considered that perhaps it was just a helicopter, but I did not hear any sound as it descended and the shape of the object was more bizarre from the sideview, appearing wide across and essentially flat.  One light flashed a couple of times at a quick/strobe-like rate while the others were larger, had a slightly more yellowish hue, and remained constant. I turned my car back around the way I'd initially come, to try and follow it, but by the time I had stopped at a stop sign and turned South, it had gone.  This seemed unusual to me because my view of the horizon was fairly good, and at the speed I had seen it travelling (55 miles at most) I fully expected to still see it after the ~5 seconds it took to get my car reoriented, but I saw no trace whatsoever. No one in surrounding cars seemed to see it, but I did feel uncomfortable with how low and near me it seemed, and I got the impression that it ""responded"" to me pulling over to face it because it had been hovering in the same spot while I was watching it while still driving, but started descending/moving away a very short time after I pulled over.  The only other thing I can think to note is that there had been a power outage 4-5 hours prior in that area, including outage for the traffic lights of the intersection I was at when I saw the object.",2019-01-24T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

I say it was a cylinder shape because the two main compartments were cylindrical in shape as well as rod connecting the two parts.  There also appeared to be a horizontal laying rod shape on top.  The top compartment was bigger than the bottom.   I  saw no lights or coloring on object.  Felt like I was looking at some sort of engine part that was solid black floating in the sky.   I originally thought it was a drone as my neighbor has one and i see it often.  I thought the horizontal rod was a blade but realized it wasn't spinning.  I ran out the front door two seconds after it left my view from the window it was gone.  It also occurred to me that if it were one of the neighbors drones it would have been out of their eyesight and would not have flown it that far.  I looked out the back window across the horse pasture where said neighbors would have been flying the drone from they were not there.  Nor could the drone flown fast enough to completely vanish from sight after a two second gap.  Nor did I hear any sounds that usually accompanies a drone.  I have no idea on the real size of the thing based on the fact that I have no idea how far away it was.   It was against the gray cloudy sky and did not pass any objects that could have given me a rough guess on size.  It was definitely odd shaped and fast moving.  I would not have been able to have been quick enough to take a picture if i had my phone camera on and with me, it was only there for a few seconds.  Not sure what it could have been but after some research into drones have concluded that no one has made a drone of that shape as of yet.

I had stopped at the Worth rd intersection taking notice of the recent additions to the local casino to my right... the new building stood out.  Headed north again I went about a mile or so before catching a glimpse of a amber/orange colored light. - now before I go on, I’ll note that I’ve been hyper aware of the existence of these orbs since my sighting in 2016, so I’ll admit that I stop the car and examine the sky and rule out many anomalies before jumping to the UFO conclusion...  that being said, I’ll continue - mind you, I’m trying to split my attention between driving and watching this amber/orange light. I keep catching the the activity of this light and realize that it’s more than one light.  At one point there was at least for to five, and the movements between them varied... one would be somewhat still, the others kind a random, but different almost swirling to swarming... they would dim and un-dim and randomly “dance like fireflies” - they remind me of fireflies! - Like how a firefly can be right there in front of you and go out in a moment, just disappearing into the black of night.  This is very much like a sighting two years ago on December 13, which was also during the full moon of that month and year - we had four strange moon events in ‘16 - this was I believe on the fourth of those.  On that event, my mother and I witnessed “orbs” above Hale, MI. - as soon as I realized I was seeing a similar event I called my mom who had been with me during the previous sighting to let her know I was seeing them again.  (This was at 6:18pm according to my phone log) I was letting her know I was hoping to get to a spot where I could get out and get some video.  On our previous sighting, the orbs were hard to catch on the iPhone but did get two brief vids before the battery died from the cold air - this time, as I was taking to my mom about trying to get a video and looking for a spot to pull of the road...  all the activity slowed. I got off the phone and kept a close eye on the spot where they had been.  Unfortunately I did not get an opportunity to get photos or videos.  The thought had crossed my mind that other cars/drivers were seeing something similar as we all seemed to be slowing, even the cars heading opposite my direction.  I had hoped that I’d get a closer look as I was headed toward the city of Omer, where these objects seemed to be located above.  This sighting marks the second definitive “orb” sighting for me, and the third object sighting here in northern Michigan that I’d label without question a UFO",2018-12-14T00:00:00,,

(+/- a couple minutes)  	Location:  The north entrance of Deception Pass Bridge, HWY 20, between Anacortes and Oak Harbor WA, USA. The event started in the south south-east sky and went further east as it descended.  I was traveling in a southerly direction at the time. 	Witness:   Myself, traveling in my car alone on my usual commute home from work.  I was traveling at 40 mph with cruise control on.  As soon as I got home, I posted a brief of my sighting on Facebook. When I got to work on the 7th, I told many co-workers about it.  One, who saw my FB posting and was off work at the time said he saw it too.  Another, who was at work and traveling home about the same time, said he saw it as well.  	Event:      I saw a very bright flash of white light (similar to a lightening flash on a clear dark night) to my left. It lit up the entire half of the sky. I turned to it immediately and looked through the forward half of my driver's side window. I saw what I can best describe as a classical comet. It was a large white ball, followed by a very long and tapering white tail. If I was able to freeze it in position, and trace its outline with a marker on my window, the ball was the size of a nickel and the tail was between 8-10”.  It was descending toward the ground at an extremely steep angle, about 10-15 degrees shy of 90 (straight down). In terms of overall length, it took up roughly 30 degrees of sky. The entire event, from beginning to end lasted no more than about 2 seconds.  It is possible that it might have been slightly longer, because there is a large rock wall just to the left of the road at that position, so it could have blocked the view of it until I rounded the corner approaching the bridge.

He fails to tell me that the first night the light appeared in my window, he and his buddy were in the shooting stand, coyote hunting, when they saw a bright light to the west, that rose up just over the tree tops moved further to the west a little bit and then lowered back down behind the trees I've tried to record it but the video always cuts off a minute or 2 into the recording and twice my laptop has completely factory reset itself, erasing everything on it.  It is quite annoying. The nights I was awake for this event, as the pink light begins to fade, I get this feeling that not only is something or someone looking at me thru my window, but I also get this feeling of extreme exhaustion.  And I end up passed out wherever I am sitting at that time. Last night, January 16th, at 2 A.M. cst.  My boyfriend tells me that while I'm asleep in my bed and he is in the shooting house, he watches this light, just as before, rise up over the trees, move to the west, and lower back down behind the tree line.  Just as I had seen the nights before.  He also states that the object emits a dull roar, like an aircraft would make. It seems to be moving away from us, but it just happens to be right over a significant place in history that is off limits to the public.  I know, I sound crazy, but I have 2 other people who will confirm my story and i hope someone else comes forward with their account of this event.  I'm not sure what it is, but its not the first strange thing that has happened in the skies over our house.  This is just the first time I have thought to report it.   Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.",2019-01-17T00:00:00,,

I saw a light in the east/ north-east it was about 10° to 15° above the horizon.  It was bright enough that I pulled my car over by a pasture with cattle and got out of my car to take a better look.  This was at about 425pm.  The sky was generally cloudless and the sun was almost down.  It did not move so Id thought it was a star, it twinkled like one.  I though it was Possibly venus however it was blue,  like how whitelights can appear blue,  not like a blue led but still between blue and white.  If it was a star,  it was several times brighter than any star id ever seen other than the sun.  Within about 60 seconds of my observing it the star vanished.  It was instantaneous.  I looked at the place where it had been for maybe 20 to 30 seconds before giving up on seeing it again.   As I was getting back in my car I looked up at an airli! ner above my head.  There once again was the blue star only this time it was moving at the same pace as the airliner.  There were no clouds, and it was right at dawn so I couldnt guess its elevation, only that I believe it was above the plane by a possibly 2 or 3 hundred feet and it was over its right wing,  The airliner was flying southwest.  Whatever it was stayed with the airliner untill the plane began turning east.  Just as the plane began to do this the blue light disappeared again just as suddenly as before.

It was the shape of a line, or cylinder, and I could see that it was illuminated because the sun has already set and was behind the object, but it was fully illuminated bright white on its east side, opposite the sun.   As I noticed it wasn't growing and instead rotating, another, smaller object appeared slightly to the north of it.  I drove through a forested section of the road and came to a clearing and pulled off to the shoulder to view them some more.   I then noticed 2 more similar shaped objects to the north of the first 2.  They were moving very slowly in the sky, and as I tracked them, I could see movement relative to the other objects, and saw that they were traveling west towards the twilight.  The first object I saw eventually disappeared to the west, followed by the 2nd, and finally the last 2 disappeared.   I am certain they were not planes, helicopters or hot air balloons.   I have never seen anything quite like these lights in the sky before.  I have logged thousands of miles sailing offshore and many moonless nights at sea, and although I have seen some very strange things in the sky, nothing viewed has ever compelled me to write about before.   I would like to know if there were any other witnesses as it was rush hour and there were many cars driving around at that time.

It was dark outside so I was unable to see the color of the object; I could easily make out the square shaped silhouette.  On the bottom of all four corners there were circular shaped white/silver lights.  There were a few lights along the vertical side wall around the corners (they were small and I was unable to determine the shape).  There were long horizontal linear lights in the center of each side.  These lights extended approximately half the distance of each side of the object  and stopped approximately 1/4 from each corner (they seem to be sort of centered on each side).  There were a couple other randomly located lights along the underside.  The object hovered for approx 45 seconds then rotated 180(+/-) degrees and slowly and smoothly moved away toward the SE.  During all of the movement it never appeared to change elevation,  or pitch.  It just appeared to pivot and glide.  The total amount of time that I had it in sight was approximately 3 minutes. Side note:  I was driving on my way home when I saw this object.  I was in mid conversation with my wife and subconsciously stopped in the middle of the road and  became fixated on this object.  I stepped out of my truck and just stared at it.  It was completely quiet.  Even during movement it did not produce a sound.  It was by far the largest object that I have ever seen in the sky.  The shape was unlike any plane, helicopter, etc. that I have ever seen.  My wife apparently kept asking what was wrong and all I could say was “hold on.

After getting home I thought about calling the local police department and reporting it but did not do so for fear of any potential backlash.

I immediately went outside and saw about 20 small lights about the size of a bright star, white in color, slowly blinking about 0.5 seconds on and 1 seconds off, independently, without co-ordination, in a loose long cluster estimated to be 0.25 to 0.5 miles long, moving together at varied, but maintained altitudes, at 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon at a distance of about 4 miles.  They were roughly moving from Southeast to Northwest.  Distance is only roughly estimated as there were very few objects for any frame of reference.   Other people were standing close by, (and I tried to collect their impressions) and one person pulled up and hopped out his car and said he had seen them slowly headed this way for the last 5 to 10 minutes as he drove from Gallup, New Mexico, on Highway 264, west to Ganado, AZ.  There was no discernable shape to any of the objects, as the objects were too far away to make out any details, and the hospital compound lights interfered with good visibility – think orangish halogen or mercury-vapor lamps.   The objects passed behind the gym, a two-story structure about 100 yards away, at quite a distance behind the gym, more than one mile, for sure, and then headed North by Northwest with an inferred slight course change to the North.  The objects could have been easily between 4 and 20 miles away, and distance estimation is unreliable due to night sky and! lack of any shape or moonlight.  The lights looked independen! t in movement, blinking independently and similarly, and moving together, as in a formation.  There was no noise, odor, or any other unusual phenomenon noted with their passage.   They disappeared over the last 10 seconds of the sighting, quickly to the north, growing dimmer.  The entire episode for me lasted 30 seconds.  I have seen Air Force, Marine and Army helicopters do the same, but not in these numbers at night, nor in this remote location, and the objects passed silently.  I would think a large formation of helicopters at night would be readily identified by their noise signature.   About 2400 hours, one of the ER Techs noted that someone had posted info on Facebook of a similar sighting in the area around Chuska Mountain, NM, about 38 miles from Ganado, and that this sighting had occurred about 2100 hours, for a flight time of 12 min, resulting in a speed calculation of 190 miles an hour.  This speed is much more in the range of military helicopters.   The Facebook reference also has video attached, and the reference is: Facebook, Road Conditions Navajo Reservation Wide, D... C......: 3 hours ago, ""Yooo anyone see all those blinking lights going over Chuska Mountain from Red Valley?"" Scroll down to video posted by R...... D....  and this was what I saw. IF this was a military op, then it should be easy to verify. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible military exercise??

I hope that works, my tablet won't copy/paste.  ((name deleted)), Bozeman, MT.  We spoke this evening. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS; ORIGINAL E-MAILED REPORT)) I walked out onto our patio with my daughter and immediately noted how bright Venus was that morning.  I showed my grand daughter how, just before sunrise, she could use her hand to measure from the sun to a point in the sky and at noon that day find and see Venus at mid day.   A few minutes later I was looking directly overhead to see the big dipper when I noticed a very bright object to the north.  I thought at first it might be the ISS, but it was travelling almost directly north to south.  After maybe a minute it suddenly became very dim, but I could still see it clearly.  About this time my daughter lost interest.  Just a few seconds after the object became dim it began to accelerate faster than any satellite I have watched.  When the object was directly over head still travelling very fast it performed a perfect 450 degree turn and sped  away to the east and vanished.  When the object performed the perfect counter clockwise circle plus 90 degrees it either left a vapor trail or it was so fast that my eyes were seeing what you see when a child twirls a sparkler.  This event happened about one hour before sunrise.  I would speculate that the object was reflecting sunlight and became dim as it reduced altitude.  When helicopters patrol transmission lines and reach a point where the line makes a 90 degree turn the pilot will do a circular 450 degree pattern returning to the end point and continue down the line.  This object performed the exact maneuver at an incredible speed.  I would also note that the circular turn made by this object was absolutely symmetrical.  I have been a true UFO sceptic all my life and have never had the remotest inclination to believe in them until this event on Tuesday.

The view from my camera phone showed the object bouncing up and down and left and right sort of in the same area though.  I took about 10 or 15 pictures.  Then I zoomed in with my camera and begin to make a video.  It was changing colors from blue to green to Yellow to Orange.  It seems to have a distinct Ring around The edge with a few spiky shaped things coming around the outside edge.  Maybe three of them?  It started shooting way up high and down low in all directions to the left and the right all corners of my camera screen blinking and changing colors all the while.  Towards the end it was zipping back and forth so fast it seems to split off in two or three different crafts.  But I believe it was just the speed of the object that made it appear that way. It never did disappear the only reason I left is because the person that was ! with me insisted on going.  I would have stayed there forever.  I zoomed in on some of the still shots that I took later on.  Amazing!  I swear it seem to be a being in there with big dark eyes a little skinny neck and a greenish colored head.  If you zoom in on some of the steel shots you'll see what I'm speaking of.  It is the most amazing beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life!

At approximately 3:30 a.m. EST while on work break in South Charlotte I heard a strange whooshing sound for about 5 minutes, I looked up and did not initially see anything.  The sound continued, but did not get louder nor distant, then I saw a single red blinking light followed by 3 very bright and vibrant white lights (brighter than those that come from Xenon gas bulbs) that flashed one at a time making a line pattern in a different direction than the red light, making it appear as if the object was changing course,  however,  when the red light would re-appear, it was at the front of the direction the object was moving, and the white lights were angled off to the side. .  If all those lights were to be illuminated at once, it would have made an “L” shape.  I see all types of commercial and military air craft here at night especially being in the flight pattern of the airport, I have also seen weather balloons, satellites (no blinking to their lights) and the international space station fly over.  None of which had the sound or light patterns I experienced tonight.  The strangest part of this experience was that when my eyes focused on those lights as it was directly above my head, the sound ceased.  Even as the object passed, and what you would usually hear from the rear of a craft as it passes by, there was complete silence as I watched it move overhead then eventually out of sight.  I have to add, I am a total skeptic and I have tried for hours to make logic of this experience, but the more I try, the more questions I have.  Most importantly, if it were a military type jet propulsion aircraft the sound is more like a constant distant thunder (even when it is very high in the sky) that gets louder as it gets closer, then the sound gradually fades.  This was not at all like anything I have ever heard…the sound was more like the noise an MRI machine makes at top speed.

I was walking Mickler Beach that is located in Jackonville, Florida. I was there because I was waiting to see the launch of Falcon Heavy 9 from Cape Canaveral at 230 am.  While I was waiting for the launch to happen I was observing the stars, at the time there was no moon.  I saw a couple of shooting stars and satellites.  When out of the blue I saw this bright light coming from the northwest.    I was impressed so I pull my cellphone and started recording.  It was moving strangely, I concluded that it was no plane or helicopter, because it didn't make any noises and it was just a bright intermittent bright light. after two minutes it looks like it went southeast extremely fast or it went up (I couldn't see it after). I am sending this video to see what it was.  I didn't come to any conclusion. Thank you!

Well like I said in the report I was at the beach. Exactly Mickler Beach. Its located in the city of jacksonville, florida. I was waiting for the rocket falcon heavy 9 launch at 230am on the 25th of June 2009. I don't know why my celluphone didnt picked any stars. It was a clear beautiful night. Moonless for a couple of hours. I was looking at the stars and stuff up there. When from the corner of my eye I sae a shooting star. When I looked the direction in disapeard.  I SAW this very bright light.  Then I took my camera and started filming it. It was doing some crazy moves. And the thing that caught my attention was that it didn't have any directional lighta requeird by the FAA on any fying aircraft. I can't tell what it was and like I said unfortunatly no stars where picked up on my celluphone SAMSUNG GALAXY S10E. It was doing some crazy manouvers and all of the sudden it was gone.  Took of like to the south east.  I was speech less. And all I have ia that video and unfortunatlly I was the only one at that beach.  Again thank you ao much for responding.

Then I noticed the light was on one end of a fairly long object with a yellow light on the opposite end.  The shape looked like the edge of a silver iPhone, with a green light on one end and a yellow light on the other.   After observing it for 20 or so seconds, I noticed 3 more identical objects appear slightly below the first.  The group of objects appeared to be moving in a south-easterly direction, though at a very slow speed.  Over the course of a minute or 2 the lower 3 craft disappeared from my sight, but the one I initially spotted was visible for nearly 5 minutes.  It eventually became more and more difficult to pick out in the sky.  These objects were higher than any of the commercial airliners that few by the vicinity. There were other people there with me but were unable to see! what I was seeing. Background:  I'm a sailplane pilot and often look to the sky at soaring birds.  I've noticed that if you stare at a patch of sky for a while on a clear day you can find gaggles of birds soaring in the 3000-5000 foot range.  Also, I don't like flying with polarized sunglasses, but on this day I had a new pair that are polarized.  Sunglass can help you see definition in clouds and sky that you wouldn't otherwise notice.
