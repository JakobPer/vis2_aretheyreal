I commute over 50 miles each way to work.  My commute home generally takes 2 hours because of the stop-and-go traffic on the 91 freeway, therefore I have plenty of time to observe more than just the back bumper of the car in front of me.   At 5:45 p.m. (dusk) the sun had just set and the full moon was rising just over the north east horizon.  It was crystal clear sky.  The direction of the freeway is due east.   I was watching the lights in the sky of many planes/helicopters, some reporting on traffic conditions and others in a typical landing approach for near by airports, when a bright light (distant, but bright) caught my attention to the north, or out my driver's side window.  I know the difference between aircraft landing and strobe lights and a star.  This was more like a star in the sense that its light was consistent and its intensity.  To the left of me it traveled from as high as I could see (top of my window), to what seemed to be straight down towards the earth, but more like it was traveling beyond the horizon moving away from me and disappearing as it followed the curvature of the earth.  No trail was following it.   I immediately question myself as to what I had just seen and tried to apply earthly logic to explain it away, but I came to the same conclusion.  It was not a plane, meteor, or star.  I did consider that perhaps it was a falling star.  I have seen falling stars on many occasions and the light seems to fizzle out as it is traveling and they appear (obviously) very high in the atmosphere.  It was not dark enough at that time to see stars.   Also, this seemed to propel itself across the sky at a tremendous rate of speed as opposed to ""falling"".  It was way to far away to see a shape, as I mentioned it was star-like, but there is something deep inside of me that knows it was either not of this world or a vehicle that is not known to the general public (if it is of this world).

From the North-West, I noticed a bright white light in the distance. I thought it odd, because the light was much brighter than one would expect for an airplane. I kept watching the light aproaching while slowly moving through traffic.  It seemed to be moving slowly and on a level path to go directly over the Interstate. As it aproached I noticed it was more than one light. It apeared to be 5-6 lights in a row and the were pulsing in a left to right pattern.  At this time I looked around to see if anyone else was observing and several drivers around me were also looking in that direction and pointing, to show their passengers the lights. By now it was getting fairly close to where I was located and I could make out more definition of the lights.  The lights apeared to be circulating around whatever object was. I could not definately make out a shape, due to the highway lights and the orientation of the object to my vehicle. The lights were not only white, but seemed to posess an irridecent color shifting quality, with different hues of red, blue and possibly yellow.  As the craft passed over, and behind my car, I rolled down the window to see if I could identify what it was. Unfortunately, the angle of the crafts travel took it at an akward angle that I could not see, due to the fact that I was still trying to drive and watch traffic.  I did not notice any sound, though there may have been. With many cars around me traffic possibly would have drown out any noise the craft was making.  I am not sure what I saw, but it was unlike anything I had seen in the past.

I repositioned myself and looked out the front to the right and noticed that object as well. My son was sitting next to me in the back seat and saw the two objects also. The objects were very bright and sparkled like the finest diamond with a thousand bursts of colorful flares inside them.  The closer we got to the one on the left hand side of the car, the further down I had to get my head to the floor so that I could see it.   After a few moments I could not see it anymore and so I asked my son if he could see it out of his side window.  He said it was gone.  I asked my wife where the bright light on her side of the van was.  She also said it was gone.  There was quite a bit of traffic on the road moving with us and coming toward us, so she was mostly paying attention to the road, like a good driver.   My mother said that the light on the right side 2 miles ahead was moving away from us.  I stooped down and looked at it as it slowly disappeared to the east. I kept looking into the sky on the rest of our journey home, which took about 25 more minutes after that, hoping to get another look at what I had just seen.  I saw many lights; they were all just small planes having the small red flashing light on them, dim compared to the two we had just witnessed.   It was a full moon, partly cloudy, crystal clear stars above, snow on the ground (which reflected a lot of moonlight around to make it seem no so dark that night), and it was about 20 degrees F.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,40.1703733197556,-105.08544969450101

I like looking at the moon, so occasionally I would look at it again. One time I looked at it there was a bright light just to the right of the moon. I assumed it was Venus or a bright star, although I've never seen one so close to such a bright full moon. I looked again about 10 minutes later, and now the same light was to the LEFT of the moon. That didn't seem right to me. Someone told me they thought it was probably Mars. Two problems with that: it didn't have the usual reddish tint and was brighter than it would be EVEN IF it was AWAY FROM a full moon--it should have appeared even dimmer to me because of the brightness of the full moon so close to it; and how did it move over to the other side of the moon? I decided at the time to doubt my observations, but now I am more curious, as there have been other reports of this object, one with photos, on this site.

While I was waiting, I was observing this bright star ( I think it was the planet Mars that I was seeing) and some of the other stars that was shinning that night.  I noticed the moon was just beginning to rise on the horizon.  The moon was mostly hidden by some oak trees, but I could still see the moon’s light shinning through the trees.   Then I noticed a blinking red light moving in the sky near the upper left of the moon.  The red light would stay on for about 1 second and then off for 1 second as the object traveled  North in direction.   I watched it for about a minute, then I ran inside to get my Mom who I was visiting Christmas day.  We both hurried back outside, and I was able to quickly locate the object again.  She had a little difficulty at first in locating the object, but finally she was able to locate the blinking red light  in the sky.  It might have been a plane flying, but I thought a plane also had a white strobe light that flashes brilliantly off and on, not a red light for a strobe light.  Normally when I see a plane flying at night, I would see a white, strobe light flashing off and on, and red lights or green light that is continuously lit on.  The red light seem bigger in light effect than the red lights I normally see on the wing's tip of a plane. I didn’t hear any noise of any planes flying while observing the blinking red light; it was just really quite outside except for when a car occasionally drives by me on the road. Maybe it was a plane flying, and if it was a plane flying, it definably didn’t have the normal lights it suppose to have to indicate that it was a plane flying.  It almost seem like it was a satellite moving across the sky, but it would have been way too low, I think, for it to be a satellite, especially blinking off and on a red light.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,30.462935377358487,-87.26545408805032

I exited the car on the driver’s side and something caught my eye at almost star level, very high in the sky. I saw three extrememly bright amber lights,first in a straight line formation, stacked on top of each other. The objects hovered around each other, moving as I describe in “slow motion”. They 3 lights floated out of the stacked line formation and made a circle type formation, then back into a slightly curved line. There was no noise coming from the objects at all. This was nothing like I had ever seen before. The objects or object didn’t move like any airplanes or helicopter that I have seen. The silence and “slow motion” movement  looked extremely fluid and bizarre. The objects were completely stationary in between these intervals of formation for seconds at a time. The objects did not move across the sky, but stayed in the same area for the entire duration of our sighting. My wife,nervous from my silence standing outside the car, remained inside the car, asking what I was seeing. I urged her to come out and take a look. She instantly was taken aback by the strange lights and told me to run in inside and grab the video camera. The objects were seen by us for about a minute or two before I got the camera and returned. There is where the video begins. The lights were stationary ,extremely bright and slowly went back into a straight line or up and down formation.

I believe this may be an explainable event, however, I do not understand it.  Above you use the word ""craft"", which does not apply (that I know, anyway). About 11:30 pm, I was riding my bike on a bike path and saw a blue and green glowing (as on fire, except it was blue green) ""patch"" or object streak at a low angle.  Let me try to describe it another way.  I would have thought it was a meteor, and in many ways it acted like a meteor, except for the following :  1) The ""appearance"" or Burn started relatively low in the sky. I do not understand, if it was a meteor why it would be so low before it looked like it began to ""burn"".  2) I know it was low in the sky, because the mountains here rise rather abruptly in this area. I was at sea level, and the mountains aer several thousand feet north of where I was - in front of where I was.  I had my bike helmet on, thus further obstructing the amount of overhead sky I could have seen. The object ""appeared"" - began to ""burn"" suddenly, as though it was just entering the atmosphere.  I hope this makes sense. However, the thing is, this occurred so low - it didn't make sense to me.  Also, the color - definitely blue and green.  At first I thought ""it must be like I've heard of frozen ice falling out of airplans"" because this area where I was biking is near the airport and near the flight path.  2) I went back the next night to the same spot to recreate what I would have been able to see from where I was riding, given my helmet, given the mountains, etc. 3) Also, perhaps meteors do this, I don't know...but it was at almost a horizontal path.  It was on a downward slope, but not a steep one, if this makes sense.  Also it was definitely between me and the mounts, for example. I know this for sure.  It seemed close.  4) Of course, something so unexpected, when time goes by, it's like you wish you could just rewind time so you could take better notes.   and also 5) it seemed a little too slow to be a meteor, especially one tha! t low. I mean, it happened quickly, in some ways, and yet, given how close it seemed, it seems to me if it was a meteor, it should have been moving faster.

His house is located on the far north east side of Tucson, off of Catalina highway and it is surrounded by moutains. It was over these moutains that I saw an extremely bright light off in the distance that appeared to be rising at an angle in the sky. At first, I assumed it was a police helicopter shining its spot light in our direction but it was moving at an abnormally fast pace and the light never seemed to shine in any other direction. Planes, as well as helicopters, fly over my boyfriend's house quite frequently and they both have a very distinct sound. The object I witnessed made no noise what so ever. At this point, I called my boyfriend over to look at it and as we both stood watching it, the object appeared to freeze where it was and simply hover in place. The two of us got the feeling that it was watching us and ran inside of the house to wake up my boyfriend's mother. We were inside of the house for twenty seconds at the most before returning outside.  In the short period of time that we were inside of the house, the object had made it's way all of the way over to the other side of the sky and was now gliding slowly towards the city. It was flying incredibly low and from what I could make out, it appeared to be triangle shaped with a bright red light that protruded slightly from the center with three smaller, but incredibly bright white lights at each rounded point. My boyfriend's mother, who was a skeptic, described it as looking like a ferris wheel turned on it's side with the red light representing the axis. The three of us watched it in the distance and as we did, it appeared to go straight up in the air, then down at an angle and hover for a moment, then go straight up again and repeat the zig-zag pattern until we lost sight of it.  Another unusual event had occured a few months prior at the location where I first spotted the object in the sky which I feel is worth mentioning.

It was silent and reflecting the lights of the parking lot off of the bottom of it.  There really wasn't a shape to it...it was just a mass moving across the sky reflecting everything that it flew over from the bottom.  We watched it until we could'nt see it any longer.   It continued to reflect items that it flew over until it was out of site.  Very strange...I felt puzzled not frightened, but it struck me as something definitely not of this world.

I was just about to put it out and go inside when she yelled to me and pointed to the north eastern part of the sky. To my amazement I saw what first appeared to be a helicopter but in the seconds there after it was undeniable that this was nothing that I had ever seen before. At first it was an incredibly bright light as if pointing in our direction with a hint of red light with it. The thing I noticed right away was that there was no sound what so ever coming from this thing in the sky. As we watched we saw it grow larger as it came closer and more detail into our line of sight. While it was on the horizon approaching us, it appeared to be the classic saucer shaped object. As it got closer, I could see that it was actually in the shape of a triangle(when viewed from underneath) with rounded edges.  When compared with the size of a large, full moon, it would have been slightly smaller in the sky about 95% of the time we viewed it, except the short time it went almost directly over top of where we were.  It didn't go directly over top of us, however it was very close and as it went over top of us I could see that there was something protruding from the center of the underbelly that had a red light that was in the shape of a sphere. At this point I could tell that it was between eighty five and a hundred and ten feet in the air. The whole time it did not make a sound and the interesting thing that I noticed was that it seemed like every coyotye in ear shot was howling seemingly at whatever we were witnessing. There were other lights around the edges of the craft and they seemed to be a bright white. As we watched it, I saw that it seemed to be going straight up and down five to ten feet in short, quick spurts or jerks similiar to seeing a piece of metal bouncing or being pushed around between two magnets.  After noticing this I was suddenly struck with absolute terror, as it suddenly became clear to me that compared to this, I was nothing more than an ant, to possibly be stepped on at any moment.  At this point my girlfriend and I were so frightened and overwhelmed that we ran into the house and after a few panicky moments decided to wake my mother.  Soon the three of us were outside attempting to find this thing in the sky again, and to my surprise, in that short period of time, the object had suddenly switched to the opposite corner of the sky(southwest) though still very visible.  We watched it float towards the southwest for anothr minute or two until all of a sudden it just disappeared as if someone flipped a light switch.  That was the last we saw of the object.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

All of a sudden another orb indentilcal to this one zipped into view right besides the first orb. I watched in astonishment as these magnificent amber colored star-like orbs rocked and moved in direct opposite distances from each other, like a dance. Then suddenly the orb that appeared after the first orb shot away into the night sky and out of sight. I ran into the house to call my family to come outside to see this awesome sight, but when we all ran back outside, to my utter dissapointment, both orbs were gone! These glowing star-like orbs moved much faster then shooting stars and were much larger in size than any planet in the night sky!! Their movements were short and quick, and they could stand motionless for at least a minute at a time. Never in my enitre life have I seen anything like this! It was indeed something just like something out of this world.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,30.277359740259737,-83.02021168831169

He believed  that what we observed must rationally be birds flying at high attitude.

The time and date is memorable because it was my birthday and my wife and I were visiting New Orleans to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and my 65th birthday. The light that I observed was unusual because it proceeded across the night sky at a remarkable speed…taking less than a few seconds to pass overhead and disappear in the night glare of downtown New Orleans.  By comparison, moments after the light disappeared, a commercial airliner moved across the sky at a snail’s pace. The size of the light was comparable to lights one might see on an airplane, not particularly bright but not flashing or changing in color.  If at the altitude of normal air traffic, the light would have been moving much faster than the speed of sound.  If at a lower altitude, one would have expected a horrendous noise (as from jet fighter plane) but no sound was heard. The light was definitely not a meteor or a satellite.

At first I thought it might be a parachute, but it appeared that at least one of the surfaces that reflected light was flat and metallic.

It was very large, not a planet, and deifinetley not a star.  After some few min. of observation I asked my wife and seven year old son to come out and look at it.  All agreeded that it was not a normal object.  It was moving in a west by nortwest direction.  In the time I observed the object had moved approximately 3-4 degrees in a space of just a few min, and was soon behind the treeline.  I attempted to set up my 6 in parabolic telescope to get a better look at it but could not do so in time.  I am certian that this was not a planetary nor star object because it moved at a greater speed than the star field behind it.  There was no noise, nor any other physical phenomina associated with this incident.  Thinking it couldn have been the International Space Station I check its orbital path on the NASA web page and discovered that the ISS orbit passes over northern to central to southeast Canada and New England in the US.  It could not have been the ISS.  I will observe the night sky tonight with my telescope set up to see if it reappears. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of a planet??  PD))",2007-08-07T00:00:00,,

Yesterday I spoke to him more about it and to give me the details so I could report it here.  He said that about 20:00 he was outside his house and he saw something catch his eye.  He was facing east at this point.  He decided to use the binoculars to see if he could spot what it was that he saw.  The light that caught his eye seemed to have moved behind a passing cloud, so he directed his view to the end of the cloud.  After looking for it to come out the other end, there was nothing.  For a while he just decided to stay and keep watching the sky when he looked up and saw what appeared to be a red circle doing semi circles in the air.  It was big or low enough to see with the naked eye.  When using the binoculars, he could see that it was actually two orbs stuck together.  He said that it wasn't light, like a flashlight, but more like internal, luminescent light, sort of ""glowy"".  One other thing he said was that after while of observing this, he started to panic for some reason, he said he actually panicked and did not know what to do, or who to tell.  He lost the object after a while when he was trying to refocus the binoculars.  Al i can say about this is that i can't believe I missed it.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,32.6707,-117.0946

WHAT A WILD BIRTHDAY PARTY!! 23 March 2007   Friday 23 March 2007, at approximately 9:20 PM, I was watching TV In bed.  It was my (Jeff Challender) 54th birthday.  My wife came running into the room suddenly in a high state of excitement, and told me to come outside right NOW!  Our son Max had spotted something in the sky that he was certain was a UFO!!  I put on my bathrobe, and stepped out onto the front lawn.  There, in the sky, low over the houses across the street at 10 to 15° above the horizon, was a UFO all right!  There can be NO DOUBT ABOUT IT!  It’s position varied from due west, to northwest during the time we had it in sight.  This thing, which seemed to be at least a half-kilometer distant, was literally dancing about in the air.  It was soundless, and bright blue-white.  My wife rushed to get the camcorder, and once I got it started, continued to video tape this thing for almost 20 MINUTES!!  I can barely describe the excitement.  We watched this thing perform the most impossible maneuvers.  It moved behind trees, returned and went behind the trees again.  I hobbled up the street to follow it at one point, and it returned to its previous position, as if toying with me.  So I went back to my chair on our lawn, and sat down.  I “told” it I could not, and would not, chase it again, and that it had better stay in sight for me or I wouldn't continue to film it.  I said these things half tongue in cheek, but THE THING SEEMED TO RESPOND!  It DID come out from behind the trees, and stay there!  It continued to bob up and down, and flit from side to side.  Right after I told it to DO SOMETHING, it brightened considerably and performed something like a “fish hook” maneuver!  It's all so unbelievable even now!  Finally, after nearly 20 minutes in sight, it dipped ""behind"" the neighbor's garage across the street.  My wife said, ""Oh, don't go away!"".   After a moment or two, IT CAME BACK UP!  It stunted some more, finally going back DOWN behind the same garage for the final time, which was due west of our location.  It didn't return.  It looked to us like it may have LANDED somewhere in the agricultural lands about a kilometer to our west!  We waited an additional 20 minutes or so, hoping it would come back again.  Unfortunately, it did not.  So I went into the house and played the tape back on our TV.  The tape came out sensationally!  I did not zoom on the object but a couple brief times.  I held the camera quite steadily by propping my elbow on the armrest of the lawn chair, and kept the houses across the street in the field of view almost the entire time.  The film is incredible.  We couldn't sleep until well after midnight.  Must have watched the tape a half-dozen times last night.  Can't wait to get into the full analysis, with enlargements and speed manipulation.  In the end, I'll have a 30 to 45 minute production detailing the entire event on DVD.  Max saw the object first.  He says it was here Wednesday night, after Janet and I had gone to bed.  He tells us it was dancing around out there for at least an hour.  AND that it hovered directly over our house for a time.  We have no reason to disbelieve Max.  He told me about this sighting on Thursday morning before he went to school.  So this thing was here twice in three days.  Who knows, it may have been out there Thursday night as well.  We didn't look.  Our local MUFON field investigator came Sunday 25 March 2007, to take down my formal report.  He also viewed the video tape and was blown out of his socks. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Jeff Challender, noted investigator of the UFO phenomenon, for sharing the information with our Center, and for having forwarded the video footage of the object he captured.

Basically, I was just stargazing this night instead of using the telescope.  Orion was well to the west and setting and Gemini was in the southwest and Saturn was SSW to the right of the constellation Leo.  The condition was clear for a change and I was noting the light pollution due to an article I recently read in Sky & Telescope. Just as I was gazing near Castor and Pollux a pair of red lights set evenly apart was moving at a very fast rate from those star locations towards the east.  There was no noise.  The width these light were apart was just about the width of a finger held at arms length away from the body.  The lights remained evenly apart the whole duration.  I could not determine any kind of shape between or around the lights or if it was one or two objects. The only aircraft that was near was a plane coming from the NNE and headed south towards Buffalo and that made a definite noise.  About 12:15 or so I went inside to consult the NASA http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/tracking/ website to verify where the ISS was located, which was New Zealand at the time.

My wife and I began to walk home from the neighbors around 21:35.  We were looking up at the sky as it was a perfectly clear night with a crescent moon.  I saw a blinking white light zipping along from north, north east to south, south west.  I pointed it out to my wife “look a satellite, watch it blink as it tumbles” we watched it until just past 90 degrees directly over us.  Then my wife noticed a second object, “Look there’s another one!” only this one wasn’t flashing.  I thought “that’s odd that two would be orbiting so close together.  We’re lucky to see this.”  As the second light passed 90 degrees above us I could make out a flashing collision light that seemed to be mounted to the tail of an aircraft, and we immediately heard the sound of a jet that struck me as quite loud (the first object made no sound at all which had me convinced that we were looking at a satellite).  The distance between the two was maintained until they both disappeared from our view. I would estimate that the objects were around three to five miles apart as they were the distance of a 12” ruler held at arms length.  Both objects were moving quite rapidly and were only visible to us for around 45 seconds.  We could hear the jet well after it was out of sight.  We live near the approach corridor for Charlotte Douglas Int'l, so we are familiar with the behavior, look, and sound of civilian jet aircraft.  We heard this jet for nearly a minute after it was out of sight.  My wife even commented on how long we could still hear it, “is that the jet we still hear?”.  This leads me to believe that this was a military aircraft chasing something with the afterburners lit.  This would explain our still hearing it even after it was long of sight, and both aircraft appeared to be at extremely high altitude.  My guess would be between 35 to 45 thousand feet as neither appeared much larger than the stars that were visible.  Military aircraft are never seen near here due to the high concentration of civilian aircraft that pass over our area.

They performed a change in direction towards southeast while one of them crossed aparently bellow the other. At this moment they entered a very small cloud (or passed over it) but I could still see them trough the cloud. I shouted for my husband to look from the bedroom window but he came to the varanda instead, trying to understand what was going on. After this change in direction, they flew straight paralel positioned (without that random movement component I noticed at first) vanishing at the distance.

I don't know but I have been watching these things in the sky for the past two weeks.  First I thought they were helicopters flying around at night, but I couldn't hear any helicopters or see any spotlights.  Then I kept noticing them out every night.  There are sometimes 3 or 4 at a time in the sky and they just hang there.  They are blue, red, green and white flashing and pretty high in the sky, but if you even take a minute to look around you can see they are there.  I usually stay up most nights and like to look out at the sky and last night we came home late from a weather seminar and when I looked out the window I showed one to my husband.  He kept saying that what I am watching is airplanes in a holding pattern waiting to go to airports.  I kept telling him no way.  Saturday night I got the telecope out and tried to focus on this one ""thing"" in the sky and it took me a good 40 minutes to figure out how to use this telecope.  I finally got it in view and I'm telling you I couldn't keep a focus on this thing to get a clear definite description.  I could see the lights of blue, green, red and white. It seemed like they were rotating in a circle or something.  Finally after 45 minutes this thing just moved behind a house roof in my view and then never appeared again.  My husband, after the 45 minutes, said yeah, that was strange, for it to be just sitting there for 45 minutes.  He is a big skeptic and a big logical chemical engineer.  He has an explanation for everything and he really was short for words.  Last night (Sunday night), we came home from a quick errand and when we got out of the car I started to point out to him at least five different spots in the sky where the same types of blinking lights were just sitting.  I am not insane.  He started to look around and I could tell he was a little uneasy about how many were just up there.  I said, well, I don't care if the aliens are going to present themselves to us, I just hope they aren't violent.  One other thing is one day last week when I was just watching the sky in my sunroom I noticed one that was sitting there.  When a plane (which I did know was a plane) came flying through the sky, this thing flew over rather quickly to where the plane was, stopped for a few seconds while the plane passed, and then just flew off.

This was an account given to me this evening by my daughter as we were at a restaurant eating dinner. She has no interest in UFO's and is a typical 13 year old liking shopping and Hannah Montana. I am a pure skeptic myself but she rarely is untruthful and I can always tell.  In my opinion she was not lying nor would she have a reason to be untruthful.  Here is what I can remember from our conversation. She was in bed last weekend which would be around the 20th of January I guess and it was around 11 PM at night. She heard a large gush of wind and looked out her bedroom window. She then witnessed a triangular shaped craft hovering just above a tree in the front of her house. She said it was ""five feet"" away but from her description it was more then likely about twenty feet away from her window. It apparently made no noise other then the initial gushing from its decent.  She drew a picture of it on her napkin and it is a standard triangle with little lights making the triangle form on the bottom and one larger light in the center of it.  I asked her why she did not go get her mom or grab her camera but she stated ""I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It kind of made me stay there."" Which I take is that it mesmerized her in some way.  As I said she knows nothing about UFO's but I have seen a few programs on the History channel discussing the triangle craft sightings so I got pretty interested as it was a near perfect description of the footage seen on those shows. I asked her how big it was and she tried describing the size. The best I can come up with is an estimate and it was not very big. Maybe twenty feet long and able to hold two people max.  I asked her what it was doing and she stated it was hovering over the tree top. She said she blinked her eyes and it was gone ""disappeared.""  This event occurred in Graham WA in the area between Highway 7 and Meridian St which is still rural and heavily wooded. It is funny because just a few weeks ago, in our local paper, they had an article on Dennis Kucinich UFO sighting and they said it occurred at Shirley McClain's home in... Graham WA.  Again, I do not believe in aliens and personally I think this is the next ""stealth"" fighter of its age and will be unveiled soon. For decades people reported the Stealth as an alien spacecraft until it lost its top secret status. The same thing will happen for the triangle crafts and I cannot wait as this technology is astounding.  This account does not end here either and this is where I started to wonder if she was making this all up. She said she saw the craft again the next night! She had a sleep over at her friends (they live four miles away) so that would make the first account happening last Friday for the record. So on Saturday they get into her friends parents hot tub outside and she sees the craft again off in the distance about one hundred yards away. Her friends who thought she was crazy before saw it to and it simply descended from the top of the trees downward toward the ground and out of sight.  This account was given to me two hours ago by my daughter and is accurate. I believe she saw the craft both instances and that McChord airforce base, which is near by, is performing tests on the triangle aircraft in Graham, Washington as we speak.  If you need more info or need me to speak with her again for more detail let me know as this is all I have.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,47.0173,-122.2968

The centre is concave or indented and you can almost make out the panels on the craft. It is self-illuminating with some kind of energy field running over the skin of the Craft. Every now and then it starts to shimmer the energy grows and it moves at an amazing speed and turns in to a blur moving about so fast it gives the impression of a slinky or a snake moving and changing colours. Brilliant white, electric blue, purple, red and green. It then slows down stops and goes back to normal it kind of vibrates or moves so fast it looks like it is vibrating. It did this several times until I ran our of battery I caught all this on my hard drive cam recorder the Sony DCR –SR72E. I don’t want to pass this video over the internet because I believe its worth some money. Id like to know how I can pass this footage on to make it public. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.

I saw 2 bright lights go flying by extremely fast.  The lights were above the tree line.  I jumped out of bed and quickly went to the front of the house and looked out the front window.  It was then that I saw a huge, bright light hovering in the eastern sky, seemed to be about 400 feet in the air.    I then went outside to get a better look, it was extremely cold on that morning, and I was only wearing boxer shorts.  I watched for a few minutes, then scanned the rest of the sky for the original two lights that I saw while still in bed, but could not see them anymore.  I did see two airplanes coming from the western sky with their blinking lights.  The huge hovering light that was right out front of my house just sat there still.  I then went inside and told my room mate to get up and go look and then went to get my camera. I was able to snap about 5 photos of the object.  The photos are semi-unclear, you can see the object but it looks like the object was moving in the photos - you can see a ""trai""?!?!  In any event, I saw it, my roommate saw it and it was there for at least 15 minutes.  I actually stopped looking at it and went back inside to get ready for work and forgot about it.  I  ended up getting quite ill from being out there in the cold wearing only boxer shorts.  A week and a half later and I'm still sick.  The object was never there before and I have not seen it again since.  It was definately not a planet, a star, a plane, or swamp gas!

It did not change color, no moving lights, and no beams – just a white glowing orb. It was definitely not an airplane tower, but who’s to say it wasn’t a weather balloon or a new lab experiment.

They were small and resembled very dim stars so I believe they were very high in the sky.  They fluctuated  intensity in their brightness as they moved in very erratic patterns.  They would seem to drift for a moment or two, then all of the sudden they would fade and take off in a totally different direction at many times an accelerated speed and then slow down again.

If I remember correctly, they were white with a slightly blue tint. The lights traveled over the city from slightly north of my position to directly west of my position. At its closest, the triangle appeared to be twice the size of a full moon.  It took approximately seven seconds for the triangle to travel into the distance when I lost sight of it near the tops of the houses on the west side of the avenue. (I was standing on the sidewalk of the east side of the avenue.) The triangle appeared to tilt slightly as it traveled into the distance. There were two airplanes in the area at the time. One was to the southwest and one was to the northwest. Their lights were considerably brighter and one airplane was loud. They crossed the sky at a much slower pace and with noise.

The object was a cirle with smaller circles going right from the center to the outer surface with a black dot on the inside of it that moved within the cirlce. At one point, there were 3 black dots. It glowed green around the edge and frequently changed to purple. It hovered for a very long time. As the morning progressed and the day light crept in, a haze appeared beside it and it looked like a trail of smoke. This happened 3 times. At one point, a small plane flew under it and landed without incidence and the plane is on the video under the object. The plane was not chasing the object. The object moved side to side and in and out and is very clear in our video. I also took a few digital pictures but are not as clear as the video.

Both were similar in appearance and seemed to be joined to each other by a very small darkened area located directly between them.  At first glance, my attention was drawn to what looked like one long, thin, silver rod like appendage extending downward from beneath these two adjoining lights. I could also see a faint haze with a clearly defined outer edge located beneath each of the two luminous objects. Perhaps this was due to heat or propulsion, I don't know. Yet, each of these two very faint, hazy areas were clearly shaped like the letter ""U.""  And the silver appendage was centered between these two hazy ""U"" shaped areas, in a very symmetrical pattern.  The total width of the two adjoined lights was at least as wide as a cruising jetliner. The vertical appendage beneath them was twice as long as this total width. The appendage gradually faded from view as the two disc shaped lights began to merge together to form one luminous cigar shaped object, though the small darkened area at the center remained.  From my location, driving east on Dutch Ridge Road, near the Beaver Medical Center, I'd estimate that the object(s) was hovering over Rochester or the Beaver River, at about a 2 o'clock position in the sky. The sky was blue and perfectly clear. Winds were light.  I didn't see the object fly away nor wink out.

It was a bright light with a long flaming tail.  It kept moving in all directions randomly and sometimes it would ""burn out"" to a dim blinking (like a normal airplane).  After it continued for over a minute I called my 4 year old daughter to come see.  She thought it was fireworks.  We watched and the ""tail sparks"" turned into circular lights and glowed red at times and green.

PDT, I went outside to view the Comet Holmes.  I used binoculars to try to get a better look, and as I was sweeping the binoculars, I noticed a very bright star to the lower right of the comet.  It appeared to have a cluster of lights above it, so I focused on the star and observed what looked like a “net of lights” that were white, red and green and pulsating.  I continued to adjust the focus, thinking I was not properly focusing, but determined that I was indeed focused properly on this object.    I called my husband over, pointed out the star, handed him he binoculars and asked him to look.  When I asked him what he saw, he described seeing a “Jellyfish” of lights above the star.  He confirmed that the lights were pulsating and the object was larger than the star.  We continued to take turns with the binoculars (7X35) and the object moved below the star, and to either side of the star, but with no apparent pattern of movement.  The bell shape of the “jellyfish” widened and narrowed, again with no apparent pattern. I then called my neighbor and asked her to meet me outside to look at something.  Without telling her what my husband and I had seen, I asked her to observe the star using my binoculars.  She did and asked me what the lights were below the star.  I asked her if they resembled a jellyfish with lights and she confirmed that’s exactly what it looked like.  She also observed it moving, pulsating and changing it’s position around the star.  She then had her husband come outside and instructed him to look at the star, without telling him what she had observed.  He saw the same patterns of pulsating light we other three had seen.  I got another, weaker pair of binoculars, and saw the same thing, only appearing smaller. We continued to watch this anomaly for about ten more minutes.  None of us could explain it, nor had any of ever seen anything like it. I came inside about 8:40 P.M.PDT, and looked on-line with my husband to see if we could find any information regarding our observations. We found nothing. It was beautiful and must have been absolutely enormous. I will look for it again tonight. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius.  PD))",2007-11-28T00:00:00,37.9085,-121.6002

Neither would go out, which is very unusual. Just before heading to bed I heard an immense crackle very close outside like a static charge. (The windows were open). I went to bed without investigating... which seeems kind of odd, but maybe I was just frightened. I awoke in the morning to find one of the dogs had gone to toilet in the porch (rather than go out the night before).  The next night (0100 on 06/06/06) at around the same time again, I went to the porch to let the dogs out and again, neither would go out. I stood on the porch and looked at the sky and broke wind. Immediately I thought 'oh... i don't want to frighten them' and immediately, before I could even process this strange thought, saw a craft fly from above me to the North. It was in view for about a second... it wasn't going super-fast..... i saw enough of it to be able to recall it. It had several lights on it and was about the size of the moon in the sky.... maybe not so high up?  What's odd about this comical tale is that I appeared to know something was there before I saw it... I have absolutely no idea why I would have that thought enter my head after breaking wind!  Maybe nothing to do with this but Sonora has a lot of static electricity.... I am always getting shocked when I go shopping off of metal or material. Also, the cell phone reception here is very staticy... our TV reception is always getting lost. Sometimes it's good, others it's completely dead.

My wife and I were leaving a friend’s house in Ocean Beach, and I went to start loading the car with all the goodies that our 15 month needs. As always, I was looking up at the sky as I walked to the car and noticed two bright orange lights. I thought nothing of this since there are many aircraft in the area (commercial and military) and I thought the odd colour was just due to atmospheric conditions or something else.  As I kept scanning the sky I noticed that all “normal” aircraft’s lights were their “normal” colours, with the usual flashing red markers, etc. So I looked back at the orange lights and noticed that they hadn’t seemed to have moved much, nor changed in size or intensity. This was intriguing, so I kept on watching. I noticed that the lights were moving very slowly but regularly towards the south. Then they suddenly shifted direction and started moving slowly west and then north – without changing colour/intensity/etc.  There were a few other people in the front-yard of my friend’s house and I asked them to look – but they kind of just shrugged their shoulders since I was doing a pretty good Richard Dreyfuss as the realization of seeing a real UFO was dawning on me.  I ran to my car to get my video camera and by the time I got that, powered it up and pointed it at the sky – all of 2 minutes – the lights were dim but seemed to be in the same position as when I last looked. One was dimmer than the other – even though they had both been roughly the same intensity before. I shot some footage but haven’t even bothered looking at it yet, as I expect the CMOS sensor and auto-focus probably screwed the whole “capture”. The world doesn’t need yet another crappy piece of UFO footage, I’m guessing.  Anyway, I continued to watch the lights dim-out which they did over about another 2 minutes.  Later, when trying to make sense of what I’d seen, I thought it must have been some rocket or satellite boosters or something of that nature, but there were no contrails or any smoke or haze around these lights. And if they were military jets, or something of that nature, then they must have been climbing for a hell of a long time – but without making any sound at all. And their motion from earlier wouldn’t fit normal aircraft flying characteristics.  So, this was a UFO – I’d love to think it was ET and that 2008 was going to be the year – but I’ll be happy with a much less glamorous resolution to this.  BTW - I noticed that the following report, is very similar to my own: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60019.html  I am a video systems software engineer, an amateur astronomer and a hang glider pilot. I like looking at the skies! And I’ve seen lots of video footage of rocket/shuttle launches/etc.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

There are ufo's out there, and their are closer then ever now.  How could two people see the same thing?? At the same time?  The government has found out a way to have these flying objects now and fly them around to be unselective for future wars.  Alternatively, another country has made the ship that disappeared many years ago, actually traveled in time but not without major problems and skepticism.  Also on our computers and on our TV, witch is all 2 years old.  Are picking up signs.  Someone said it is just other satellites passing by, but then why are we not hearing it none stop.  I think the plane that hit a” air pocket” last week in B.C. was probly on top of a ufo.  Skidding on top with out knowing it was there.  Because all the ones we have seen, they have appeared and disappeared, witch means they can become invisible at any given time. Some one knows and has had contact with them.

It was Christmas night in Mendham, NJ and something happened that totally freaked my dad and I out. We were walking on Roxiticus Golf Course and we were on the highest hill on the golf course. The hill was about 100 ft higher in elevation than most other parts of the golf course. We decided to sit down and catch our breaths. While half way down the hill, I looked above a partially developed hill called Brookrace and saw three whitish-red lights that were over the hill. It appeared to be a bent radio tower because they were not directly above and below each other, but in a curve shape above Brookrace. I said to my dad, “What’s that”? He said, “I don’t know, there’s no radio tower or anything up there, right”? After two minutes of observing them, the one that was placed in the middle, vertically, started to move to the right and closer to the hill. It now appeared to be about 300 ft above the top of the hill. The hill in which Brookrace is on is about 450 ft above the surrounding land. The other two lights started to drift to the right in up, down, circular, and diagonal motions. It appeared to us tat they could move in any direction that they wished and also come to a complete stop at any time. One minute later, the UFO that is more to the right and about 300 ft above the hill, corkscrewed down in a spiraling motion to about 150 ft above the top of the hill. About 20 seconds later the highest UFO dimmed its light and started moving left of the other two UFO’s. Again it was moving in odd, non-pattern like motions. Very soon after the same UFO appeared to turn on lights that went horizontally down the side of the craft. The colors of the lights were green, white and, red. The craft was about ½ of a mile away from us in the air. We could clearly see the description of it. It looked like we were seeing the side of a triangular prism. At no time did they change shape. Soon after the first craft moved away form the others, the most left UFO out of the two that were still above Brookrace started! to foll ow the other, it appeared to follow the same or a similar flight path. The third UFO stayed in the same area that we first saw it in but was doing amazingly odd movements such as zooming up and down. The top of Brookrace, as a crow flies, is about ¼ of a mile away from our position. We would have gone home to get a video camera if we knew how long they would be there, except our house was about ½ of a mile away. While the one UFO was still over Brookrace, the other two UFO’s were now directly behind us (if the starting position is directly in front of us.) The two behind us seemed to be about ½ of a mile higher in the sky than when they started. Than, about 8 minutes after first discovering them, another UFO started slowly coming over the hill in which Brookrace is situated on. This one as well as the other UFO that was there from the start headed towards the other two UFO’s behind us. They also put their side lights on and as well as all of the other UFO’s dimmed their lights before going into major (fly mode). For the entire time that we were watching the UFO’s, about 500 geese that were on the lake below Brookrace, were making loud distress calls as if something were hurting them. Over a period of about 20 minutes 3 more UFO’s came from over the hill and followed the same flight plan. Behind us, the 7 UFO’s were forming a formation that seemed to be like a sideways “T” shape.               This is the formation that they made about ¾ of a mile up in the sky  directly behind us. The formation consisted of 7 UFO’s. This may sound odd because most UFO sightings consist of 1 UFO, but we saw what we saw. Thirty seconds later, another UFO started coming towards the formation. It looked like this UFO was coming from over the nearby town of Chester, NJ. This was flying at a reasonable rate of speed (about 40-50 mph). The other UFO’s seemed to be going about 20-30 mph considering the amount of land that was passed in a certain amount of time. Thirty seconds later, it eventually joined the formation. “Wow, this is amazing” my dad said as we walked home in disbelief. As we looked up into the sky, we saw what appeared to be a shooting star, but the beam of light kept going and going, it must have been one of the UFO’s blasting off. As we walked home we saw the most amazing part of our night. While walking we glanced over at the lake where the geese had been making distress calls. We saw a UFO hovering about 80 ft above the lake in a kind of wobbling motion. It appeared to have an internal light and a triangular shape to it. It also appeared to be about 30-35 ft long. When my dad saw this, he shined his large spotlight that we had brought with us on it (it was about 600 ft away from us, the light did nothing to help us see it) as soon as he did that we felt a large vibration through our bodies. then we left and thought about it the rest of the night.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,40.7856,-74.5889

I want to ask if anyone has seen this, or if it was just me. I believe what I saw was on December 27, 2008. I was driving to work at 7:30 in the morning, driving on I30 Westward towards Dallas, Texas. It was VERY overcast this morning and traffic was not very full, due to kids being out for the holidays. I was looking straight ahead down the highway and I thought I saw a dark gray cloud. It looked like a plate sitting there up in the sky right above the highway. It was not quite to the skyscrapers, yet. It was between Mesquite and Garland, Texas. It was dark gray and was not like a plane, not silver, not outlined. I was afraid it was just a reflection from my truck windshield, but it moved. It did look like it was made of dark gray smoke under gray overcast sky. There were no lights. I watched it and it laid flat, like the typical UFO, but it was neat because it went lower and lower, in a slow, diagonal direction, like it was going to try to land. I was fascinated. It was like one description I had seen before on this site: “Smoke moving weirdly”. I was trying to see if anyone had ever seen anything like this by reading all your descriptions on the site.  Anyway, the shape was a saucer, but it was very very smokey. It then kept going lower and kind of stood up again like a plate and then got horizontal again. It moved REALLY fluid, like water. I kept looking and looking as I finally got up to the place where it should have been, but could not find it. Sort of like a rainbow situation. I could swear it was invisible and the gray overcast actually made it stand out, somehow. It was a dark gray ship and I could see the outline of it against the sky. It was truly weird.  I could have sworn it landed somewhere, but I could not see past the buildings. I was embarrassed to tell anyone. I tried to call the news, but got shy to ask if anyone had seen anything and shy to tell my family. I am still so curious if anyone else saw it. I also wondered if it could have be! en a ref lection from a car dealership, but why would they shine a shape of a UFO changing form and shape up over the highway? It is hard to believe in these things. Thanks.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,,

At approximately 10:45 p.m., a few friends and I were on our third story deck when we witnessed a strange object with two red lights hovering in the sky. Even more peculiar is that this object was being tracked by a police helicopter, which kept circling the object and shining a high intensity beam of light on it. The object did not move like any sort of aircraft we have even seen, and appeared almost stationery for five minutes before it gradually started moving downward until it eventually disappeared from view below the horizon. The helicopter began to fly at rapid speed in what appeared to be an attempt to track the object as it continued to move just below the tree lines for several more minutes. We were able to view the object while it was still high over our house with a pair of very good binoculars. Upon closer examination, one could clearly make out two very bright red lights that were close together. Its overall size appeared to be almost the same as the police helicopter's. Anything more than that would be pure speculation. However, as a person who frequently watches planes and similar craft flying over my house, I can positively state that these lights were not coming from any type of airplane advertisement, helicopter, remote controlled toy craft, or weather balloon, due to the extremely peculiar way it was able to just hover without really moving for several minutes and then take off very quickly. Also, if it made any noise from an engine, we couldn't hear it, but that may have been due to the loudness of the helicopter nearby. I don't expect the police to actually own up to chasing this thing, which is why I am reporting it here. However, I will attempt to follow up on this tomorrow by checking the local news reports and the Huntington Beach police blotter. I will submit another entry if I find anything else out.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,33.68843322932917,-118.00499422776912

However, the object drifted, and then immediately corrected its position by moving very rapidly in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal fashion.  It did this several times, at times getting much brighter.  Then there appeared to be sparks flashing around/emitting from it in different spaces and at irregular intervals.  It made no noise at all at any time.  I woke my wife (who at first thought I was crazy) and she came outside with me to watch.  She noticed three other objects (one each to our northeast, southwest, and another in the southeast) that were similar and behaved in similar ways, but that were not as bright. We watched the objects for 45 minutes and tried to video-tape the brightest one.  It looks like a star on the tape, however.  We went back inside and re-awoke at 5:00AM (about 45 minutes later while it was still dark out) to find the objects gone.  We have never witnessed anything like this before.

I couldn't make out a shape, but it was reflecting light. It appeared stationary in the sky. I tried to determine if there was any movement at all. The light turned green and we rolled forward to the next cross street, Frazee Road. The light was green there so we rolled right on through. I never looked away.

They were actually at 2 different times. Also I need to point out that I live close to an air force base. There are times when I've seen obvious unknown military planes and one would suspect these as being ""UFOs"". As we all know, not everything seen can be said to be from another planet.  The first object i saw was in the middle of a large amount of air traffic. I was in the backyard taking my dog out and happened to noticed how much air traffic was flying over. There are several distinctive paths where the airlines fly and over the years I've come to know where in they sky they usually are. There was plane after plane. Probably about 5 minutes apart in sightings. All of a sudden there was this one object that came across the sky in a totally odd flight path. It had lighting like what you see when several windows of a commercial plane is glowing. There was probably 8 double windows down the side. It sort of had a banana shape to it actually. There were no other lights. No red blinking light underneath. No landing geat lights either. Just these lights. It seemed to hold some reflection from the ground as there was a slight glow. Not a glow as if it were from the object, but just reflected up from the ground. It didn't really have a feel that it was flying straight either. I got a sense of a ""tumbling"" while watching it. It went over in an ""S"" shape too. It came from the north flying southwest, then southeast, then back southwest. It was wide curves and not sudden direction changes. I couldn't say there was no sound either as there was still many other planes flying over.  The second object came a few hours later. I decided to go back out to see if I could see something else. Just something you do I guess when you see an object like that. Sort of a hope that you see it again I guess. As I was looking up I noticed a ""star"" out of place straight over head. I know the constellations pretty well so I knew this light shouldn't be there. About that time I noticed it was actually moving. It was really slow. Iwas traveling from the west heading East. It's the path that I generally see satellites when they are illuminated by the sun. I had thought that's what this was too, but it was moving so slow I felt that was worth ruling out. It kept travling the same path and became dimmer and dimmer as it move toward the Earth's shadow. It was just like a satellite in everyway, just extremely slow. The complete time of seeing this object would be around 12 - 15 minutes.  Both of these object could easily have other explainations rather than ""UFO"". They are UFOs though in the sense that I had no clue what they were. I don't think any other regular average person could have said either. But I thought this was worth reporting. I would have sent info in sooner but I had teken pictures of the first object and was trying to get something to show up. I used a digital camera and had the settings wrong. All I got was a blurry dim light in one photo and nothing in the others. I tried to increase the brightness and played with the contrast but was unable to get a shape.

(now i cant be sure but i think it changed direction while passing between my telescope and the moons surface.) i watched for this again and saw it three more times. i then went into the house and told my wife what i had seen.

Immediately after seeing this plane, I looked directly upwards (east) and saw an almond shaped disk with a red bottom and a light reflecting off the silver of the body.  It don't believe it was a plane as there were no wings and it was too short.  There were no lights or contrail.  It was also too high to be a helicopter and there was no propeller.   I tried to visually follow the path of the disk which had disappeared within seconds.  Strangely, the plane to the left which had previously left a contrail was also gone with no remnants of the contrail.

It was far above the the highest planes because where I live Laguardia airport is right over the East River and many planes are taking off and landing.

I stared at it. It was light bluish, silverish, whiteish in color. It was two colored in that hew. It seemed to be fading into the background sky. And within a minute it faded away from view.

I immediately thought this was peculiar because first, the lights were not blinking, as you would expect to view on a plane, second, the lights appeared much larger than lights are seen on a plane.  The lights were white (the same color hue as headlights on a car (not bright white but more whitish-yellow but still very bright), they were in a completely straight horizontal row.  I assume the lights were on one object as I could not be sure due to the night sky.  In addition, I would like to note that there was no apparent noise from the object as you would expect to hear from a plane. Next, this is what startled me most.  As I left the parking lot, I was traveling south and noticed the lights were now traveling in the same direction at great speed.  I stopped my car to view and noticed the lights were now traveling vertically but still in the same southern direction as I first noticed and then suddenly out of view.  (out of view perhaps from the intense speed).  I never saw a plane travel that fast across the sky. I came home and immediately explained what I saw to my husband.  Whether this was a UFO or just a plane, it was definitely an odd experience and hope it can be explained.

However, my wife pointed out that the object was rapidly cycling through at least three colors: white, red, and green. The color cycle was not like that of an airplane or helicopter as it did not blink;  it was a fast swirling cycle that appeared to rotate clockwise over and over again.  Also, the object did not move at all in any direction, so it could not be an airplane. The chances of it being a hovering helicopter seemed slim since it did not move up or down or side to side for over an hour of observing it. The object was too high in the sky and too far away to be a light tower of any kind. I went inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars to get a better look, but the quality of the pair I was using was poor and all the best I could really make out was a bit of a closer look at the cycling of colors. They were moving very fast as I said, and I believe I could see some blue in addition to the red, green and white.

My wife and I were heading back home from shopping.  As we were driving North on Seaboard lane.  We stopped for a red light at the intersection of Seaboard and Mallory station road.  I then noticed a large cigarish shaped object in the sky not moving.  It was a semi cloudy day with very blue sky, the object appeared to be sort of a dull silver.  We see planes circling in this area quite often awaiting clearance at the Nashville international airport.  I think planes circle in at around 10,000 ft or so.  This object was large, it was longer and fatter than a Boeing 737 and no wings.  At one point as I watch it and was tying to point out to my wife wear it was I actually thought a plane was going to hit it.  The Plane turned out to be above it, as the plane flew behind it heading north, north east direction.  It was hard for my wife to see it because it was dull silver and blended well in the sky with clouds.  We then turned West onto Mallory station road.  I had lost sight of it now.  We then turned North again onto Franklin road.  We proceeded to the intersection of Franklin road and Moores lane.  It was here that I was able to then again see the same object.  Again I tried to point it out to my wife, its was then that she saw a different one east a few miles away in the sky.  Once she was able to see that one, her eyes were now trained and she saw the same one I was looking at back at the intersection of Seaboard and Mallory station rd.  Both object were similar in shape and color, one appear smaller but I think it was a distance thing.  If I were to hold a dime as arms length I would be able to cover the larger one up with half of the dime.  My wife claimed to have seen a 3rd object but I cannot confirm that one for I had only seen the 2.  She claimed they “must be airplanes”.  I argued, planes don’t just hang there especially for that long.   This is not the first time I’ve seen objects in this area.  I will be submitting my other encounters.

Daylight sighting of two small objects at altitude moving against the wind.,Longmont,CO,2008-05-24T11:20:00,other,30 seconds,"Occurred : 5/24/2008 11:20  (Entered as : 05/24/08 11:20) Reported: 5/27/2008 8:16:17 AM 08:16 Posted: 6/12/2008 Location: Longmont, CO Shape: Other Duration:30 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63555.html,"Daylight sighting of two small objects at altitude moving against the wind. On Saturday morning, May 24th, 2008 I was attending the Silver Creek High School graduation ceremony in Longmont, Colorado.  It was being held outdoors on the football field with the audience facing west, toward the Front Range of the Rockies.  The morning was sunny with a very clear blue sky and a few scattered clouds, surprising since just two days earlier an unusual mile-wide tornado hit in nearby Windsor, CO and Friday had heavy thunderstorms throughout the area. During the speeches portion of the ceremony  I watched a Twin Otter skydiver jump plane climb out of Longmont Airport about a mile and a half north of the graduation location.  Within less than 10 minutes the aircraft climbed to over 12,000 ft. and I observed seven jumpers as tiny dots freefall from the aircraft and open their chutes about 2,000 feet above the airfield.  I watched as they manuvered their very colorful chutes as they descended until they drifted out of sight below buildings in the distance. The recitation of the name of graduates and the handing out of diplomas took quite some time as there were over 200 graduates.  During the hour long process the Twin Otter returned to Longmont Muni and picked up another load and climbed out again for another jump run.  At about 11:20 am as it made its high altitude pass over the airport I watched for the jumpers.  I saw one small dot exit the airplane and looked for more jumpers since they are hard to see initially at such altitude.  As I scanned the sky I spotted two more dots lower than the first one I saw.  I assumed they were also jumpers and I watched them for the deployment of the their chutes. As I watched the two dots, which looked identical to each other with white and dark markings, I realized they were not dropping but moving sideways at 3 to 4 thousand feet above the ground.  My thought was they were gliding in freefall, but as I continued to watch them they were moving further west, away from the airport drop zone.  Maybe they were birds I thought as they moved in relationship to one another, but no wings or flapping were evident.  I pointed them out to my 21 year old son seated next to me and asked what he thought they were.  As we continued to watch, it was clear they were not descending but moving further and further to the west, directly into the very brisk wind that morning.  At one point they maneuvered very close to each other, then apart again.  These two dots continue west toward the mountains and twice near the end, before they were lost to our vision due to distance, they turned and we each saw a glint of sunlight off of them. At this point we don't know what they were.  Obviously not jumpers, unless they had some special flying suit, but they moved several miles west and we never saw any chutes, plus they were in the air too long to be in any kind of free fall.  They could not have been birds due to the speed they were moving which appeared to be greater than 60 mph horizontally, and the metallic glint of sunlight from both of them in the distance does not occur with birds. As a pilot of both fixed wing and helicopters with 40 years of experience, I did not recognize them as any conventional aircraft.  There was no real discernible shape other than just a dot, as a jumper would appear in free fall, yet they moved independent of one another but continuously in the same direction, never more than about 500 feet apart, but sometimes closer. We watched for about 20 or 30 seconds until they disappeared in the distance.  I know these were not birds or waterfowl, due to the speed and lack of any wings.  Additionally ducks or geese will fly in tight formation to conserve energy and these were moving all about. Without any logical explanation of what these two items were, I can only call them a pair of true un-indentified flying objects.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,40.1703733197556,-105.08544969450101

Sometime just around dusk, I was in Adams County, Ohio on May 24th, 2008 to do some stargazing with my telescope.  Before the stars started to come out, I was laying on the ground watching the sky when a saw a bright spot.  I assumed it was a planet, so I spun my telescope over to spot what it was.  It seemed to bright and too early.  At first I wasn’t even sure it was moving.  In the eyepiece I saw a sphere, fairly bright, and neutral colored glow.  I though something was wrong with the lens because there was something that looked like a long string extending from it, with a glowing reddish light on the end, it looked like there may have been a light where it connected also.  The string seemed to swing back and forth on the bottom of the sphere as I watched.  This object moved across the sky for about 10 minutes from about the South and West a bit, heading north.  I estimate it only crossed about 15-20 degrees of sky before it vanished.  It’s path wasn’t consistent with a pass over of the International Space Station that same night, so I’m unsure if this was some other sort of object, maybe a satellite or weather device.  I doubt the object is of any importance; I just have not been able to find any other astronomical reports fitting the description of what I saw.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,38.9713,-83.346

Ventura, CA First witness statement This began at approximately 9:40 p.m. I was sitting with my husband in our hot tub and happened to glance to the sky.  I did not look directly up, but just raised my eyes slightly and looked toward the Northeast.  I noticed a chevron-shape flying across the sky.  I thought it was birds because of the formation, and because it looked like there were independent objects creating the formation.  But it was dark outside…and unless they were iridescent birds that happened to be getting a reflection from the moon, I don’t know how they would be lit up.  I said to my husband, “What is that?  Birds, or a UFO?”  I said it very casually, because I really didn’t know WHAT I was seeing.  He said, “Maybe it’s a B2 bomber running a test,” (as we have military bases around and sometimes do see this type of thing.  But we didn’t really see lights, just simply illumination.  Then, he said that it was moving much too quickly to be an aircraft.  A few seconds later, while we were still wondering what we saw, there was another one.  This was appeared to fly in the same flight path of the first, but its shape was slightly different.  It was more of a flattened chevron, while the first was a very triangular shape.  These both flew in the direction from the West to the East.  Within what seemed like a minute, but I don’t know for sure as there is not a lighted clock outside, a helicopter flew by.  The helicopter also looked like it was flying in the same flight path, although it may have been lower.  It was definitely slower and noisy, whereas the first two objects were silent.  About eight minutes later, we saw another one.  This one looked farther away to me, and it flew from the Northeast toward the Southwest.  This one seemed more like the first in its shape.  We saw this one for what seemed like a longer time – maybe a total of 15-20 seconds.  Approximately five minutes after that, we saw another one.  This one also flew from the West to the East and we were able to see it for about 12-15 seconds.  While we were staring at the sky trying to figure out what we saw, or see more, or who knows what, we saw several regular aircraft.  They all moved a lot slower than what we saw.  We also saw some satellites that appeared to be moving fairly quickly.  However, because of their blinking, it is hard to determine how fast they were moving compared to blinking.   Second witness statement: On the night of May 24, 2008 at approximately 9:40 pm, my wife and I were relaxing in our hot tub, looking up at the sky in Ventura, CA.  Suddenly, my wife said, ""What is that?"" and I looked up and saw a chevron shaped 'thing' flying through the sky. We live near the coast in Southern California, so the 'thing' was coming from the ocean, moving west to east. It was moving very quickly, faster than conventional aircraft that we see regularly in our area. The 'thing' was in the shape of a 'V', or a chevron and was made up of single lights or dots, probably 8 in total.  About a minute after seeing the object, another identical object moved across the sky in the same direction, following the direction of the first object.  It looked identical and was moving along the same direction. We heard no sound and saw no conventional contrails from aircraft which appear to be at a similar altitude.  Approximately 5 minutes later, we both saw another identical object moving across the sky from the North to the South.  It appeared to be the same shape and moving the same speed as the previous 'things.'    We sat and pondered what the objects were for approximately 10 minutes when another 'thing' flew through the sky along the same path and at the same rate as the first and second 'things.  We continued to look into the sky for an additional 15 minutes or so and did not see anything else that resembled the first sighting.  The objects appeared to be moving at a higher rate of speed than conventional aircraft, and were completely silent in their movement.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,34.29657455830389,-119.23991625441697

I went outside to get a better view and what I saw was a bright flashing light that was not moving but hovering quietly. It began flashing blue lights and it flashed them in sequences. It would flash a light every second for three seconds and at the third second count it would hold for a longer period of time become very bright and then dim away for a few seconds before starting again. It then seemed to turn and move up and to the left. It stayed in that place and continued blinking and then it would seem to go far away and then appear again. I ruled out any chance of it being a star or an aircraft and after doing this and moving quickly to different positions it stopped completely and went out of sight. My neighbor looked at it and also saw it. A few minutes after it went away it seemed to appear one more time and as it blinked it’s lights you could see the outline of a dark circular shape around it in which the lights were reflecting off of it.

After about 2 minutes, the craft gradually got smaller for about 10 seconds, and then completely disapppeared like it went into stealth mode, again, no smoke or anything, it just vanished. Within minutes of seeing the craft, a small army type plane was flying in the same general area where we had seen the craft.  We kept looking for the next two hours of golf, but no reappearance occurred. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was located directly below Orions belt half way to the horizon and was the brightest object in the sky. I got a pair of binoculars out (7x35) to take a closer look and became intrigued. Through the binoculars the color changes were more prominent and I was convinced it wasn't a star. We had just gotten a new telescope over Christmas (Celestron) so I called my husband up (who is a total skeptic) and showed him thru the binoculars and had him bring the telescope out on the patio and focus on the object. What we saw left us both speechless. It was a spherical shaped object with a 2 rows of spinning color lights and an open center (like a donut). There were at least 5 different colors and they were spinning very rapidly. We don't have a video recorder, but did attempt to video it on our camera. I was so excited!! I called fox 11 news, and reported it on a different ufo sighting website. I ran and got my 7 yr old daughter and let her watch thru the telescope. I also called a friend that I was hoping had a telescope - but turned out not to have one. I then called the Griffith Observatory. The man who answered listened to my description and put me on hold. When he came back, he said it was just a star (the brightest one in the sky with an orange tint - and said it was called something like Orions dog?). I am certainly not an astronomer... but, since when do stars have holes in the middle and spinning rows of light? The object did not change its behavior other than drifting upward very gradually until I went to sleep at 930pm. It's too cloudy tonite for me to check for it again. My husband and I are both Management level professionals in the healthcare field, and neither of us have ever seen anything looking like a UFO before. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the star, Sirius.

The sound I heard was like nothing I had ever heard before except for maybe on a movie.  I laid my head back down and then our dog, along with the neighbors dog, started barking frantically. This was a real shock, my dog normally does not bark. This was when my wife and I both were startled.   After about 10-15 minutes of the barking, I had enough and got out of bed.  I looked through the shade and saw something very large at the outer edge of my yard.  It had no lights, it was on the ground, and it made no noise.  It did not move. The moon was bright, but there were clouds in the sky. I did not have on my glasses, but there was something defiantly there. Approximate size was probably 30x25 ft. It seemed a lighter color on the outskirts and very dark in the middle. I was half asleep when all of this happened, I remember saying something to my wife about it then going back to bed. Then hours later I awoke realizing what had happened. I looked again and there was nothing there. I went to work that day thinking I imagined the whole thing until I got home that evening. That’s when my wife made the comment about our dog barking and not sleeping well. I realized then that possibly there had been something there after all. On Thursday evening, the 27th at around 18:39, while my wife was cleaning up after supper  cooking supper, the dogs started barking again. I arrived back home after taking some trash to the dump. She explained to me about the dogs and I went outside on the back porch. At this time the dogs had stopped barking and I could not see anything. I am a skeptic, and I don’t know what it was that night or the next.  And I don’t know what is going to happen tonight.  All I know is that something happened.  Believe me or not, that’s your prerogative.  Thanks for listening.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,37.2021,-79.6285

When it was overhead it was about the size of a full moon, circular in shapr with a hint of being oglong, and was glowing all white, there were no lights or markings other than entire thing was a solid white glowing ball of light and was gliding fast across the sky. I will never forget it and what my son witnessed last night sounds EXACTLY the same as what I saw except when he saw it , it was about 100 ft off the ground and ion his words ""bigger than our house"" Our house is 24 ft wide and 28 ft long.

He is a student but would NEVER do such a thing and I was the one reporting it as he told me what happened.

Black rectangle clear daylight sighting near highway,Schaumburg,IL,2006-11-09T09:00:00,rectangle,1 minute 45 seconds,"Occurred : 11/9/2006 09:00  (Entered as : 11/09/06 9:00) Reported: 11/9/2006 7:52:19 PM 19:52 Posted: 12/7/2006 Location: Schaumburg/ Palatine/ Rolling Meadows, IL Shape: Rectangle Duration:1 minute 45 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53332.html,"Black rectangle clear daylight sighting near highway I was driving in my car, southbound on Rt 53 in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, south of Palatine Rd, when I very clearly observed a large black rectangle hanging in the sky, approximately one mile west of the highway and 30 degrees to the south.  It was fairly low, maybe 500 feet or less in altitude.  The object appeared to be approximately twice as thick, and 25% longer, than a large passenger jet.  It was rush hour, traffic was very fast and heavy, and throughout the sighting I did not feel it was safe to pull over to the narrow left shoulder of the highway.  I was concentrating on watching the object while intermittently making sure I didn’t drive off the road or hit another car.  The object appeared to be hovering in the sky, blimp-like.  The bright morning sun was in the east, and the object was in the west, so it was fully illuminated from my perspective.  Visibility was extremely clear.  An aircraft in that circumstance would appear bright whitish-silver, but this object was dark black.  The edges of the rectangle were fairly sharp and stark, but it is possible that there was some additional dimension at the edges.  After driving for maybe 15-20 seconds, I lost sight of the object behind some trees.  After another 25 seconds or so, I passed the trees and was able to see the object again.  At this point it was maybe two-thirds its original size, and I felt that it was moving to the southwest, perhaps 90 miles an hour or so, roughly keeping pace with me in a southern direction, but moving farther west away from the highway.  It was still starkly black.  I watched it for maybe another 20 seconds, when before my eyes it began to fade.  Within about five seconds, it completely faded out of sight.  My impression was not that it moved rapidly away, although that might be possible.  Rather it seemed to get fuzzy, misty and dimmer, until it just faded out of sight.  Much like a cloaking device was going into effect.  It was an amazing sight.  The highway curved, and I kept looking ou! t in tha t direction.  Maybe 25 seconds later I saw it again, but now it was a whitish color that very much blended in with the sky and made seeing it difficult.  By now it appeared to be even farther southwest, and was maybe half or one-third the size as it was when I first saw it.  After another 10 seconds or so, the highway turned again.  I lost sight of the object and never saw it again.  For comparison, I did observe airplanes in the sky immediately afterward, as they are very common in the area, and they were clearly visible as airplanes, bright silvery-white, not at all black, and very clearly not rectangular.  Living in the Chicago area all my life, I’ve seen thousands and thousands and thousands of airplanes, helicopters, blimps, birds and balloons.  This object was certainly none of these.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,42.05010904159132,-88.09256772151899

About an hour ago right before it got totally dark, I saw a light go to the southwest from where I am in East Texas. It looked like a spot light from a helicopter or something. But it was too high to be a helicopter. The speed was steady and not too fast. It just caught my eye and I followed it for about a minute before it went over the tree line. I could see planes very high in the air and of course stars. But this was a bright white light. No red lights. No flashing. I was outside by myself and then my girlfriend came out and I was telling her about it. Then within about 10 minutes, we both saw in the same general area, a bright white light. It did not move. And then it faded. I was pretty big. It did not streak. It did not blink. It just went out or if anything, it's like it went up. I was much lower than the airpalnes flying at night, which I could see them. I don't know if I believe in UFOs. I always sort of believed in them. But this was not an airplane, helicopter, or anything man made. It was not a meteor. It was kind of like the international space station flying over, but this was pretty low. Any ideas?

She was sitting eating breakfast and happened to notice a strange light out the back window. She said she watched it, got her sister (15), and witnessed three distinct groups of lights hovering over the rooftops in the distance. They said they could see a dark object in the center of one, but two were just hovering as changing colored lights (at different heights),  That's when they woke me. I ran outside to see and confirmed two of these objects. At an arms length I'd say they were about the size of an aspirin or peanut.  Fairly large and distinct with 4 or 5 lights making up a cross or diamond shape.  The lights were pulsating and changing colors: red, green, blue, white, turquoise.  They were hovering at different heights above the rooftops of the next neighborhood.  One was very low, just barely over the rooftops, the other about twice the height of the homes below. I went in to get my astronomical telescope to see if I could zero in on it. While I was trying to sight it, the one I was watching reduced in size, turned orange and began to move to my right. I followed it around to the front of my house and watched it slowly move parallel to the ground just above the rooftops until it disappeared behind homes. The other light was gone when I looked back. My daughter tried to film it, but could not get it focused due to palm fronds interfering with autofocus. However, you can see the two objects and the colors that they were cycling through. We don't know, of course, what it was, but the two objects I saw were silent.

I manage clinical drug studies for pharmaceutical and biotech firms.  I have a degree in life sciences.  My career involves frequent air travel.  As a frequent flier for twelve years, I have never really seen any strange sights or possible UFOs until yesterday, March 5, 2008. I was on an American Airlines 4:50 PM flight from Tucson to Dallas.  The flight left Tucson at 5:00 PM (Mountain Time).  The flight flew approximately in a east-northeasterly route and the skies were generally cloudy and the ground below was not visible.  About thirty minutes into the flight, the skies cleared and the ground became visible.  There was no haze or dust obscuring the view from my seat.   As I was looking out the plane’s window at the ground below, I spotted a (chrome) metallic, saucer-shaped disc hovering above the ground.   As we were flying about 30, 000 feet, the object was below and I got a good view of the top and sides of it.  It appeared to be metallic as I could see the setting sun reflected on it’s surface.  The surface was smooth as well.   I noticed that it was nearly stationary, hovering over the same spot.  It wobbled and pitched a little but remained stationary.   The ground below looked like typical desert and was devoid of any trees or grasses.  There was a dry creek bed to the left (east) of the object and the nearest indication of human activity in the area was a circular crop field about a mile or two east of the creek bed. I did not see any buildings or roads anywhere nearby to where the object was hovering.  I estimated that the object must have been about 1000-1500 feet above the ground.   At first I wondered if I was seeing a water tower but I did not see any type of supporting structure. I watched the object for as long as I could.  I estimate that I watched it for a good four to five minutes.  I looked at my watch after I could not see it any longer and noted the time at 5:35 PM.   I also estimated that this area was about 250 miles east-northeast of Tucson, AZ.   I was expecting the object to fly off but it appeared not to notice my plane flying above it.  It stayed stationary the whole time I viewed it.   I was able to view it on three sides- west facing  to top to east facing.  It was perfectly symmetric except the top did seem to have conical shape.  I am not sure of the diameter of the object but I would guess that it might have been around 40-60 feet.

We could not hear them at all, they did not go in one straight path like an airplane but moved sporadically. We drove into a parking lot and saw more of the same kind of behavior for about thirty minutes. We would see a few a yellowish lights just above the trees, stagnant and then it would start moving up ward, and then proceed to move about the western part of the sky oddly. At one point there was eight or ten in the sky at once, all in the western part of the sky. None of them crossed the sky like a plane does. I saw one fall straight down extremely fast, appearing almost like a meteor. My dad thinks they must have been near Dulles airport, but we are both absolutely certain these could not have been airplanes, or even helicopters. On the 6th, after explaining to my friend earlier in the day about my experiences, i continued to see suspicious blinking and hovering lights throughout the night. But around 10:15 we went out on his driveway to smoke a cigarette. And immediately upon looking at the sky we could already see strange blinking lights at different heights in the sky. This time it appeared they were directly above Woodbridge. A few seemed to cross directly above us. The yellow lights would again hover at a distance above the treetops, and then rise, start blinking white, red and blue lights and then move at a very fast speed, all without making any noise at all. One did cross above us particularly low in the sky. When it was above us it appeared to look like a triangle with a light in each corner, but we could not see the outline of the plane. Again, we felt odd that it didn't make any noise at all. We saw about ten of these, all throughout the sky, and on the drive home we saw one low in the sky, with many more lights then the others. It had white lights all lined up on it's side on one single craft. We took some pictures of several of these lights, I'm not sure about the quality as I haven't seen them on a computer yet, but my friend can send then to me and if you want I can send these to you.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,38.64662271428572,-77.31406

I was driving west on the Fairfax County Parkway into Springfield where my parents live when I noticed an unusually bright air plane about 35 degrees from the horizon in the west/north-west region of the sky. Living in Springfield I am located between two major airports; Washington International, and Dulles.  Seeing many air planes in the Northern Virginia sky is extremely common, air traffic is quite busy in this area. However, at night air planes have a distinct brightness and have flashing lights on the wings to identify commercial air craft, and are not hard to determine. The craft I saw was about four to five times brighter than the other air planes in the sky and had a golden white light emitting from all sides. I did not see any blinking lights that resembled the lights on regular air planes. There were commercial airplanes flying in other parts of the sky during the sighting so I could tell that this craft appeared quite different.  Continuing my route home, I noticed that I was getting much closer to the object. It appeared to have been flying close to the Fairfax County Parkway. I also remember that I couldn’t take my eyes off it, it seemed too bright and was moving way to slow and just seemed out of place. It was approximately 5 minutes after initially spotting it that I got close enough to it that I could see that it was not a helicopter. It was also silent; I couldn’t hear any engine sounds of any kind. It seemed to have been flying over the neighborhood near Hunt Valley elementary school before I saw it slowly cross over the Fairfax County Parkway.  I drove right underneath the craft as it crossed over the road right by the Sunoco gas station located on the Gambrill road exit ramp. When I was approaching the craft just before driving directly underneath it I could tell that this object was about 250-300 feet off the ground and was moving at maybe 50-100 mph. I remember stretching my neck out of my window to get a closer look at it when it silently floated across the parkway, and over the neighborhood on the other side. While looking at the craft from underneath, it looked like a diamond shape but with an elongated front point. I could not see any wings, granted it was dark out, but I was able to see that the whole craft had a white-ish yellow glow with two yellow point lights close together that did not blink on the underside. I would estimate from the distance it looked in the air, that the size of this object was anywhere between 70 to 90 feet long and about 20 feet wide. After it crossed over the parkway, I kept turning my head back and saw it fly barely over the tree line bordering that neighborhood. I tried to keep my eye on it as I was just about home. When I turned off the parkway onto the Hooes road exit I could still see it barely above the trees, and still so bright. I lost sight of it as I turned into my neighborhood across the bridge from the fire station. I would say that I lost sight of it as it was somewhere above the Newington Forest area. This object seemed to be flying too low and too slow to be passenger airliner or single passenger plane.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,38.769132704402516,-77.22377421383648

It was just a fast descending kind of white light seemingly coming from north downward in an southerly direction as if it were heading downward somewhere east of Kirkland.  Seemed to close to the ground to have been a shooting star and it did not appear to dissipate and it was somewhat larger anyway.  It was silent.  A few nights earlier also 2 witnesses observing a very high level very bright white object moving from south to north over Kirkland, Washington, at a very high altitude on a clear, cloudless night. The object suddenly dimmed by a factor of perhaps ten to twenty and kept moving northerly in the upper atmosphere as if it were a normal satellite although perhaps slightly faster (as have observed numerous satellites over the years.)It did not dissipate or ""burn up"" and just kept proceeding onward.  One speculation is that during its very bright phase right overhead the object may have been experiencing some kind of reentry (or entry) glow/burn while descending through the upper atmosphere although cannot claim to have seen have seen that before so do not know. In fact first impression was that it was already in the upper atmosphere and for some reason unclear, the object may have been intentionally many magnitudes brighter and thusly largely then suddenly dimming to (distant observer size) of a slightly faster moving satellite (similar in observation size to most stars observable on a clear night (cloudless.)  It definitely dimmed down practically went overhead of both witnesses.  The earlier reported light descending over Kirkland was mentioned to a taxi driver who said that she had seen something similar earlier over the freeway in the Kirkland vicinity.  Also would like to report (which uncannily had forgotten until reminded) about a year or so before, a daylight sighting at 3:55pm over Volunteer Park, Seattle, on a clear sunny day a bright star like object stationed directly over head above Fifteenth Avenue East and East Republican (observed by several passers by and small business owner.   The object remained overhead for it seemed like maybe a dozen minutes. Most said it appeared unusual but soon lost interest and thought it may have been a daytime bright planet sighting and went about their way.  However (this observer) witnessed the bright silvery object eventually proceed to move slowly in a southerly direction and therefore walked several blocks in order to track the object as it passed above Fifteenth Avenue East, directly over the Aquarian Foundation Spiritualist Medium Church and the Safeway store next to it.  Did not report this to the members there fixing their church wall and as they were bust on ladders (although in retrospect maybe should have as they profess an interest in non terrestrial entities themselves).  The silvery slow moving bright sphere carried on slowly southwards toward South Seattle seemingly in no hurry whatsoever and making no effort to cloak itself in any way and was very clear from a third floor veranda until it was eventually to far gone over south Seattle to continue to maintain observation of the bright silvery (perhaps a very slight blue tint) object which remained silent.  Have speculated that if these were indeed human experimental vehicles, they are beyond current understanding of the general population.  If heretofore vessels were of a non terrestrial intelligent nature then they were making no attempt to cloak or stealth themselves) possibly wishing to be observed at that moment in time. Also have considered that if they are of say a ""galactic park ranger"" or scientific observer mission, they may be scanning the area with advanced technology to determine possible near future earthquake or volcanic activity in the Pacific Northwest region.  Another possible speculation is that such objects may have some form of mind link ability and may make themselves known to certain individuals and groups for some unknown reason.  Oh, almost forgot to mention about a week ago while riding on a bus across 520 bridge from Seattle to Kirkland, two spherical ! dark obj ects hovering over the exclusive beach front area, one above the other perhaps hundreds of feet, possibly over the Medina area.  No one on the bus seemed to say or not anything and did not raise alarm by asking others what they might be.  They just seemed to be hanging in the air only hundreds of feet above the area (possibly close to where a well known soft ware developer may reside.)  Thought they could have been some promotional balloons for some event although they did not appear tethered.  They were spherical and a darkish color, one perhaps a hundred feet above the other and maybe a few hundred feet above the ground, seemingly stationary and silent, perhaps as large as a house, they seemed a couple of miles away. Definitely could not say what they were.  Definitely could say they were not a conventional aircraft or helicopter.

My house is on a hill facing West with a view of the Pacific Ocean.  It was a cloudless night with a waning moon.  I witnessed a craft that was a large orange glowing orb object traveling just above the horizon come out of the North, headed south, with a smaller white glowing orb following it.  At first I believed it to be an airplane or helicopter traveling very quickly and very low over the water, only a few hundred feet at most.  Then I witnessed the white object move closer to the larger orange object and then disappear as it came right to it.  I then noticed that there was no sound at all coming from them.  The orange orb stopped in mid flight and disappeared into what I assume was the ocean, leaving behind a faint white glow out in the water that lasted for a couple minutes. On July 18, 2007, a series of loud rumblings were heard on the Central Coast.  At 14:12 I heard a faint boom, then, approximately 10 seconds later heard a rumble and felt my house vibrate just like an earthquake had hit it.  The rumble lasted about 3 to 4 seconds.  I have lived in an area where military jets do maneuvers all my life, and have heard and felt sonic booms many times.

It first appeared to be a planet like object similar to Venus in the night sky; however, much larger and brighter. I stood starring for about 5 minutes until I realized it was moving away from me as it began to drop below the tree top level.  I ran inside to get my binoculars and returned. It had moved only slightly. Viewing it through 6 X 30 binoculars proved it was not an aircraft (I see small aircraft with their red and green running lights every day & night since the Venice Airport is home to many private craft including jet aircraft).  Although in the direction of the airport I could easily determine that it was well beyond since I could see small craft landing during the event. I then decided to take a picture and ran back in the house a second time for the digital camera. By this time the object had moved some distance from the original sighting position so the pictures were barely discernible. I ran the pictured through my graphics software enhancing the object. It was circular in shape and emitted a bright glowing light as if it were a glowing white ball and appeared to be much larger than the small craft flying in the area. The event lasted approximately 15 minutes.  Over the years I have seen many of these kinds of object including bright orange circular craft as well as black triangular craft beginning in 1955 to present.

We thought it was strange because it was really close to the moon. 	I called out to my mom to come see the object because I thought she would know what it was. My mom didn’t know what it was, so she got the binoculars so we could see it up close. Then, it appeared to move. But not like an airplane, it was slower; but yet even slower than a helicopter. 	By the time my dad came outside to see it, it was moving, at about the speed of a helicopter, towards us. Then an airplane passed by it, but from my point of view, it looked as if it went right under it. I looked at it through the binoculars; I saw a triangular shape with rounded corners. The triangular part was black but not shiny. It almost looked like black plastic. It also had a translucent stripe through the middle. When it got closer you could see some tentacle-looking claws from the left and right sides. They were silver but shiny, as if made from metal. Then we noticed it moving southeast towards the mountains. But then I started speeding up and going up towards the sky. Soon we couldn’t see it as well because it sped up and was going in random directions. Then we just saw it disappear into the sky. The whole ordeal lasted about 20 minutes. That night I got on the internet to look for triangular UFOs but I only found one that has lights in the corners and a beam in the middle.

Today, I finally realized that what I have always wanted to beleive is actually true.  My experience is plain and simple.  I was visiting my sister in Modesto, California.  My neices kept bugging me to take them out to the back yard where they have a swing set.  As I walked out, I saw to jets going by to the Northwest skies above the city.  I normally dont stop and stare at passing planes or jets, but this time I did.  As I saw these to jets criss cross each other at different altitudes of course, I stared at the contrails they left behind, when suddenly, to my amazement and out of nowhere, in the vicinity of approximately where these jets were going by, I focused my vision as best i could to this area of the sky because I noticed something strange.  At first, I thought it may have been some high flying birds but to my incredible amazement, I stared and focused my eyes as much as I could and clearly what my eyes saw was without mistake 5 spherical objects doing some kind of what I will call a dance in the sky.  These objects seemed grey in color and at times seemed to have a metalic shine to them.  They moved in a strange pattern, one in which I don have the words to explain. As I stared at the objects, without removing my eyes off of them, I yelled at my neice to call my sister, at the time, my sister had a call and was not able to get to where I was on time.  By the time she did step out to see what I was yelling about, just as suddenly as these spheres(for lack of better terms) appeared, they dissappeared from the sky.  I dont know what else to say or to write, but now, finally, I can relate to the thousands of people who see strange things in the sky, yet feel so alone with their experience, that they rather just keep it to themselves and go on with life as if nothing happened.  I stand before my God, who is my only witness of what I experience! d today, that what i have written here is the truth.  I dont know whats going on, or why, but something is going on in the skies above us.  We need to pay more attention to the sky, thats a lesson I learned today.  This is what I experienced today, and its funny, but its really all I have to say and share with all of you.  Thanks for providing me the opportunity to share my sighting with the rest of the world.

I was outside shooting a line of showers just to the south of me and moving west to see how much detail showed up. I'm always testing the limits of my camera. I took a few shots of this same area and saw nothing but clouds and showers during the shoot. It wasn't until I transferred the photos to the computer and looked at them that I saw a thin dark line in one shot. I cropped the image to 100% and cleaned up the image noise almost entirely but couldn't identify the object. I posted the photo and crops of the photo to the astronomy forum I'm registered with online (Cloudynights.com)but no one there has identified it yet. I figured someone would recognize it as a plane or something but it still remains un-named.  I am approx 12 miles NW of FLL airport and planes on final approach usually fly west right over my house or a few miles to the south prior to circling south and finally east towards the airport. I see what might be a hint of front landing gear to the lower right of the object but it could be remaining image noise. It's possible that this is a plane heading west prior to circling south for final. It's odd that theres no hint of a tail but it could be hidden by the clouds. The entire bottom of the object is dark but it could be a plane painted dark blue on the bottom and viewed directly from the side. I do take photos of passing jets sometimes and there are a few with dark painted bottoms.  Either way...I can't identify it for certain or get any more detail from the image. In all probability it is a plane. I'm sure your organization has access to flight plans and approximate location of planes at certain times...and the exact time of the photo is embedded in my EXIF data. Image was taken with a SONY DSC-H1 at 5mp (also in EXIF DATA). Please advise whatever you find out. Thanks for you time. ((name deleted) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

Location: 87.6 West, 34.2 North (name deleted residence on Dilashaw Road, Haleyville, AL 35565). Conditions: Moon waxing gibbous, 96% visible, time of transit 10:46 p.m., moon distance 228,156 miles.  Weather conditions: Temperature 210F, DP 70F, RH 55%, wind 3.5-7.5 SSW. Sky very clear with visibility excellent.  Witnesses view of sky is unobstructed. Lunar disk very bright and crisp with barely perceptible atmospheric edge glow. Witnesses: **names deleted** dinner guests and main witness **name deleted**.  I had left his dinner party early, around 9:00 p.m. and was not a witness. All witnesses are  professional, informed and responsible people between the ages of 30 - 45 with good eyesight. For example, **name deleted** is a journalist and an associate newspaper editor, **name deleted** is an attorney at law and as a hobby is a professional-level portrait artist. He has a very acute eye for detail. Just after 10: p.m., as his guests were leaving, **name deleted** noticed that a small section in the lower right quadrant (between the 4 to 5 o'clock position) of the lunar disk was ""missing"" and called it to the attention of the others. Someone asked if there was an eclipse expected. Sam answered ""no"" but called me at home at 10:13 p.m. to confirm that there was no eclipse (I dabble in astronomy and the next eclipse visible here is a total, February 20, 2008), and asked me to take a look at the moon. My wife and I immediately went outside and checked the moon unaided and with 10 x 50 binoculars. Nothing abnormal was visible on the lunar disk from our location approximately 2.75  miles south of the **name deleted** residence. Upon closer observation **name deleted** determined the black area's shape was actually triangular with a slightly rounded apex rather than the eclipse-disk-shape they originally assumed. It was oriented with the apex pointed toward and slightly below center of the lunar disk. He noticed that the object was very slowly withdrawing from the lunar disk. By the time he retrieved his camera, a smaller portion was visible due to the withdrawal motion, and this combined with the brilliance of the moon, completely washed out the object when he attempted to photograph it approximately 4 to 5 minutes later with an automatic Sony 6 megapixel camera. He also noticed, when he changed his position 30-40 feet, the object's position seemed to change slightly in relation to the lunar background. This slight but detectable parallax would indicate  that they were viewing a very large, nearly stationary object closer to earth than the moon, in silhouette, between his position and the lunar disk. There was no penumbral shadowing noted as would be evident in a shadow cast by a large object between the sun and moon. He estimated the sighting lasted about 8-10  minutes. During the time of observation the object completely withdrew from the lunar disk. As it withdrew,  nothing of the object could be seen outside the lunar disk which seems to indicate a very dark, non reflecting, large object at a considerable distance. By approximately 10:19 p.m. the object was no longer visible. Size / Distance Estimates   Lunar disc circumference = 6790 miles  -:- 360 degrees = 18.86 miles per degree at periphery of lunar disk. Witnesses agree that the illustration accurately represents what they saw. Measuring the illustration, the widest point of the object subtends an angle of about 18 degrees of the lunar disk, which equals 339.48 miles. (180 X 18.86) For calculation purposes object width is rounded to 340 miles and  the sighting-date moon distance of 228,156 miles is rounded 228,000 miles.. The easiest way to get some feel for the size/distance question was to set the distance and size figures as two legs of a right triangle. Using a right triangle with leg A of 228,000 miles and leg B of 340 miles, chart below was created by halving A and B dimensions then halving the results repeatedly.  At minimum, I feel that the distance/object size ratio data after the seventh iteration (inside the box - below 1781 X 2.6 miles ), could not produce the observed phenomena.  Witnesses feel that a small object of 100 - 200 feet and close enough to produce observed effect would have been detected by them due to the brightness of the moonlight. Distance       Object  Size (Miles)    (Feet) 	       (Miles)	  Feet)  			228,000				340 			114,000				170 		         57,000		                 85 			  28,500			 42.5 			  14,250	                 21.2 			    7,125		         10.6 			    3,562			  5.3 			    1,781			  2.6 			      890			  1.3		 			      445			   .65 	3,432 			      222			          990 			      111			          495 			       55				  248 			       28	148,000			  124 			       14	74,000			   62					7	37,000				   31 				3.5	18,500			   15 			 	If object was a triangle there is no way to know if its silhouette was seen in its entirety or if only a portion of it —or which apex it might have been.  It could also have been a square or rectangular configuration with only a corner of the object occulting the disk. Obviously the exercise above cannot give any accurate clues as to the actual shape, size, or orientation of the object in relation to the observers, other than it was probably very large and quite distant. The viewing opportunity-window probably was limited to a small area around the viewing position.  Illustration Caption  View looking south. Motion of moon is to the right. Object slowly withdrew from the lunar disk as indicated by the arrow. The object's withdrawal motion could be caused by the movement of the object descending, reversing or changing its orientation relative to the observer.  Also possible considering the estimated 8 to10 minutes of time elapsed, the apparent withdrawal motion of the object, if stationary, could have been due to the moon's normal track toward the SSW. although the observer did not notice any radial movement along the disk that would have been evident.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,34.2371,-87.5876

I was on SR-417 when I happened to glace out and up out of the drivers side window. I saw two objects flying in formation, one slightly behind and to the left of the lead craft. It was clear with scattered cumulous clouds. What struck me most was the brightness of the craft, brighter and whiter than the clouds they flew in front of. At first I thought it was two jetliners, but I know that commercial liners do not fly in formation and also because there were no visible vertical stabilizers on these two craft. Plus their shape appeared to be like a 2x4 board. They were flying north to south, but could not estimate the altitude, although they seemed quit big and close. About this time there was a Southwest Airliner heading north out of Orlando International Airport. The objects were bigger than the commercial jet. They seemed to pass over the airliner, but I can't say if they were actually over the plane, it just looked like it from my perspective. As the airliner passed, the trailing object did a 90 degree turn to the right although I couldn't actually see it turn, it just went from going south to going west without any sign of deceleration, but it did seem to pick up speed and move rapidly away. By the time I got my vehicle pulled over to the side of the road the objects were gone.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,28.81493,-81.33946476190476

It appeared to be at a very high altitude.  I assumed it to be a weather balloon as it seemed to move in the same direction as the clouds.  These clouds are the wispy type usually found at high altitudes.  After thought not too much about it until I saw another object in the same general vicinity.  By the way, I am looking to the southwest at about a 75 to 80 degree angle.  This other object is moving from Northeast to southwest at a much slower rate than the first object.  I no longer see the first object so get my digital camera and start taking pictures. I am taking pictures because this is now quite unusual.  They do not seem to be aircraft as they are not shaped like one.   I am a former Air Traffic Controller who used to work at Lambert.  I am familiar with aircraft and their flight characteristics.  I continue to take pictures hoping that the clouds can give some reference to size and altitude of this object when I notice another object in the same vicinity.  It seems to be higher than the second object.  Both these object are either stationary or moving very slowly because the clouds are now obscuring them.  The clouds eventually became a little thicker and I could no longer distinguish the objects. I will attempt to send the pictures.

It was, at first I thought it was a helicopter or something and went back to watching some tv. What caught my attention again was the bright light was still there, this time it was a little closer and it seemed to 'hover' in place. I then got up, my curiousity grown, to inspect it. When I went upon our back porch. It was in the Northwest of the sky of our backyard. It wasnt cloudy, stars and the moon was out. You could see it through our full grown green ash tree. I also noticed that some of the lights from the other 5 houses were out, when usually you can see then on. Come to think about it, there was no stars, moon or any other light showing but just that one. Also this 'light' or UFO made no noise at all. I saw the light move really slow to the right bout a quarter of a inch.  Then it stopped and hovered. I stayed staring at it, thinking what in the heck is it? I called my mom out to c this after it just stayed for over 5 mintues in its spot. She came out, asking 'what?'. I pointed to the white light and she said it was probably a plane or helicopter. ""Mom, its just been hovering there"" She kept saying it was just one of the two until a couple mintues passed and the white light turned from white to a blue, green then back to white. We waited until it moved a bit and then stopped once again. By that time I ran inside and got my parents digital camcorder, my digital camera and my bioniclars. I brought them out and managed to film the white light. For some reason, my digital camera refused to work but the camcorder did, although at 1st it didnt want to, It even had a full battery.  While I was doing that, my mom watched and noticed it dart to the right really fast then stopped. I felt really excited cing this. I stopped filming and handed over the camcorder and picked my bioniclars up. I couldnt at first see any good image just that strange really bright white light. I brought the bioniclars down and stared as my mother and I spoke softly while keeping a eye on the light. When I put the bioniclars up once again the lights flashed from white, blue, green, yellow and white again. Althought this time, I managed to see a small shape with the white light. It looked like a trianglar shape to me 3 lights. The other two seemed like it was under more than the one we were seeing. Soon my dad, brother and his girlfriend came out and also saw the white light but couldnt see the shape I did.  After a while we just went inside but I called KOLR10 News to see if they knew anything and got told they would look into it. I hope we can find out what that strange light was.  I could still see it hovering for a hour and the last time I went to spy on it, the white light had completely vanished. After it left, all the lights came on and the stars and moon came right back out, like nothing happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

From my perspective these lights were slightly above the tree line. As the aircraft got closer I observed what appeared to be a large, light blue lamp on the bottom. This lamp blinked slowly, unlike strobes on other aircraft that I have observed. At this time, I estimated the altitude of the aircraft to be to be 4,000 to 5,000 feet and it was slightly to my left. This is when I was able to see that the aircraft had a distinct triangular shape. The surface was dark compared to the sky above, which was a lighter shade of gray. The fuselage and the wing were one in the same. From this perspective, almost below the aircraft, there was one white light at each corner of the triangle.

As I walked up to the Pickup I noticed an Airplane flying from west to east.  This was nothing out of the ordinary in my area since we live under several Transcontinental Air-lanes between Chicago, Omaha, and Lincoln, going to Denver or LA Etc.  I was tracking the Plane going to the east when I noticed a very bright light in the sky further towards Zenith from the Plane.  As I was standing facing North, I checked the sky to orient myself with the Constellations and I attempted to triangulate on the position of the bright light.  I found Cassiopeia and then Camelopardalis and found the bright light was between North star (last star in the little dipper's handle) and the Brightest Star of Auriga about half way between these two stars, but was not as distant. I would estimate this Light was in orbit, but holding stationary position.  Doing a quick inventory of the sky I concluded it was not Venus Saturn or Jupiter because it was too far north and in a totally wrong place to be these planets.  To judge the size of this light it would be four times the size of Venus when seen in the South-western Sky at, or shortly after Sunset.  The Brightness was twice the Magnatude of Venus in the Morning Just before Dawn. But as I said this was not Venus.  After observing this light for 15-20 seconds it just winked out, not moving in any direction.  What I noticed was while the object’s light intensity was dissipating, I could see a round ball in the center, kind of like when a light bulb is turned off, you can still see the glow if the plasma formed around the element for a brief second.  But this was round.  I also thought I could hear something like the sound of what old flash bulbs made in the Camera’s of the 50’s up to the 70’s, that crunching boiling sound as the blue coating fried from the heat of the bulb burning out.  I stood there for a few minutes waiting to see if this was all or if it would come back and I didn’t see anything else.  I came back in my home and checked the time which was 22:34.  I’d estimate I had seen the object no more than five minutes before.  I then made this report.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,41.1675,-101.0104

He said he was walking the dog and she suddenly saw something and got scared.  He looked up and saw a rectangular object with rounded sides in the air (I found out later he meant the sides were convex).  It was white with a wide blue stripe and was partially hidden by trees in our yard, but was in front of trees further away in our yard.  He described it as waving back and forth, then moving off to the right of his view further behind the trees where he could not see it anymore.  He said it seemed to be about 4 to 6 inches wide and about 18 inches long.  It was at an angle, not perfectly vertical.  He said it made no sound.  It did not give off light.  He insisted it was not a balloon, nor a piece of windblown trash or a kite.  There was a very light breeze, but that area of the yard is shielded from wind by trees.  I inspected the area a few minutes later.  There was no sign of any debris or trash (which would have likely been snagged in some pines trees, based upon the direction of the breeze).

I would estimate its altitude at about 3,000 to 5,000 feet. The speed seemed to be about that of a commercial passenger jet. The lights on this craft are non-typical. There is a blinking blue-white light at the front. Then there a bar with several lights that are slightly orange (maybe about the color of tungsten lights), just past the center of the craft, that go laterally, and look like cubes placed side by side. They shine towards the front and back of the craft. There are no lights on this craft that are typical of normal aircraft navigational lights. It appears that the craft is black with a tan colored “X” painted on the bottom side. The ends of the X shape are at the front and back of the craft. This craft makes no sound that I can detect.  All five times I have seen the craft it has been moving from North to South, and at different altitudes. My sighting of it have all been at night, shortly after the sun has set and it is complete dark outside.  The first time I saw this craft was in late May or early June, and I have seen it four times, about once a month, since then. The first time I saw it, I happened to look up, and it had passed right over the top of where I was standing. It was moving fairly slowly, and made no sound that I could hear. I have not been able to see the actual outline shape of the craft against the night sky, but it appears to be either flat on the bottom, or possibly slightly concave. It is many times wider than a normal airplane or jet.  In hindsight I should have recorded the times and dates of the previous sightings of this craft, or made reports on them.

I was walking up the stairwell in my dorm, and noticed a strange bright white light between two of the tall identicle apartment buildings on the riverfront of downtown Portlad. At first I thought it was a bright star, but there are very few stars visible in Portland, and it was far too bright. I then though that it was maybe just a plane, since the flight pattern goes that way, but the light wasn't moving. Slowly I noticed it move. It took about three minutes for it to slowly move behind the left apartment building. I then decided to walk up a floor or two, to see if I could see it since it hid high up on the building. I caught a glimpse of it again, and yet again it hid. I did this a couple more times and it kept hiding. It . Finally, It dissapeared or went behind the  building and I wasn't able to catch a glimpse of it anymore. I ran and grabbed two of my friends. I returned with them, about two minutes after losing sight, and there it was back where it originally was not even  moving. My friends and I sat and watched it for about two minutes. It sat there motionless for about a minute. Then slowly started moving and gaining little speed as it traveled to the left again. It then began to dim. It dimmed completely before being blocked by the building. I had this sort of weird feeling that what ever it was knew it was being watched, so it kept hiding. I think bringing the two other friends convinced it to vanish. The apartment buildings are about a half a mile from my dorm, so we decided to walk over there, but saw nothing.  While the bright light was going on, I also noticed a pulsating red light flying in a circle over and over to the right of the it, but didn't think too much about it.  While walking back from checking out the apartment area, I spotted a red lighted craft, maybe a plane or satelight flying above. Whatever it was it was fast, and high in the air.

December 30, 2007  My family had just returned home from trip to Anza Borrego desert, myself driving, arriving in our home's driveway in Vista, California about 8:30 pm Sunday night.  Sky conditions were dark, clear and starry.  No cloud cover.  I did not notice any wind.  My wife pointed to a point above my neighbor's house, one to the north of ours, and said something like ""look at that.""  There, at some height was a pale, whitish object, with two distinct lights hanging down a distance greater than the length of the object's body, and a third light right at the object's tail end. The object's body was about the same apparent field-of-view as the length of my finger held up at arms length.  The object made no discernible noise, yet moved in a forward sense, and turned slowly, such that the ""tail light"" was always to the rear.  At this time I took three photos with my digital camera (that I had been wearing on a hip pouch, therefore was immediately at hand), with flash disabled so as not to wash out the picture.  The object seemed to be above the tree-line of a eucalyptus grove behind our house, so it was probably between 100 ~ 400 feet above us.  10 X Nikon Binoculars were at hand within our family vehicle and I grabbed those, and saw the object clearly and in some detail.  The body looked to me like a sack or bag, and I could see texture to the bag's surface, like the material had some kind of ""lay"" to it as if it had been made from layers.  It got weird when I saw the two front lights up close--though there was no apparent swinging motion of the lights at all, the lights themselves were actually swivelling independently and looked like miniature searchlights, scanning the area beneath the object.  The lights were intense as they projected from their mount position, such that I could clearly make out the narrow ""light cones"" just beyond their source.  My recollection is the light had an orange-ish hue to them, and when the object had moved directly overhead I could see the light ""flare"" as it passed directly over me, and then one light seemed to train on me directly for a few seconds (evidently as I was looking at it, it looked at me looking up at it).  But the light was not blindingly bright as it did not even leave a ""blind spot"" of persistence of vision when I looked away, though I had been watching through binoculars.  At this time I ran inside and grabbed my videocamera and came outside.  My wife pointed to where the object had moved, which was now a few houses down to the south, apparently along the same course that the houses on our side of the street took.  I then shot twenty seconds of video of it as it made a 180 degree turn, allowing me to make out the shape of the craft, seeing it from below and to the side, and as it turned head-on.  A striking feature to me was that in as much as it was always moving around up there, it followed a pretty much straight-line course that took it over our houses.  My understanding is that that is an exceptional engineering feat to get any kind of balloon or blimp to manuever like that and keep to a course.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,33.201433333333334,-117.2317373015873

I scanned the sky a few times and then looked straight ahead and noticed a strange craft that was glowing orange that was situated just above the trees moving a slow rate of speed. I raced to the room next door to the lounge and grabbed my video camera. I made my way back to the lounge as swiftly as possible as I reached the window I turned the camera on and was able to get a short 15 second recording of the orange craft that was no longer glowing. When I further analysed the video I noticed that the craft seems to be two circles attached together which startled me. I am positive that this was not a plane because the object has no wings also it is definitely not a helicopter and to add to that I am sure this object is not a balloon, satellite or flare. I have no idea what I have videotaped but I can say for sure that at this time it is a UFO. What I really find odd is the fact this object looks like two circular shaped UFO's combined together.

It was about 10:45 pm and I had just passed the Rosedale shopping mall when I glanced out the side window of my car.  I saw a craft emitting pale green light moving very quickly through the low clouds.  It was flying from east to west, toward downtown Minneapolis.  I watched it glide through the sky for a moment, but then I had to look back at the road to make a curve.  When I tried again to look for the light, it was gone.  Because of the low clouds, I could not fully make out what the object was.  At first I thought it was a small plane, but it instantly struck me as different because it did not behave like a plane.  Its pale green light was steady, not blinking.  And it was moving at a low altitude so quickly and steadily, in an impossibly-perfect straight line.  I have never seen any plane do like this.  And about 30 seconds after I saw this, my 17 year old nephew called me from St Paul MN on my cellular phone to tell me that he had just seen a UFO.  He described exactly what I had just seen--only he had gotten a better look at it.  He was sitting outside on his front step in St Paul, and the craft crossed the sky at low altitude, from east to west.  He saw the same pale green light passing in and out of the low clouds.  But he got a good look at the craft -- it was triangular shaped, like an arrowhead.  And the pale green light was coming from lights along the edges that were long, more like fluorescent light tubes than like bulbs that you would see on a plane.  And the craft was perfectly silent.  I believe my nephew and I saw the same craft, from vantage points about 10 miles apart, as it crossed the Twin Cities from St Paul to Minneapolis at low altitude.

While driving home on Wednesday 05/09/07 at approximately 9:15 PM a white streak of light caught my eye. At first, I thought it was a shooting star, but as it fell, the image grew larger and brighter, and changed to orange on one side and yellow on the other. My next thought was a small craft like a Cessna was diving downward. I thought it was descending too fast to be a small aircraft.  Suddenly the glowing colors disappeared, leaving what I thought was a faint trail of smoke. I then thought it must have been a meteor, so close its point of contact would be somewhere on the foothills above, near my home. As I drove 4 miles up my hill, I was looking for smoke or any evidence of impact. I saw none, but was positive what I had seen was too vivid to have been a shooting star or a reflection from my car windows. Upon arriving home my first question to my family was if they had felt anything like an earthquake or sensation of an impact. They had not. Convinced what I had seen was something of unusual significance I went out to my deck to look for a glow in the sky or smoke rising from the horizon. Through a few trees across part of our homes lakefront, I saw a burning pile of embers on the ground. Rationalizing it as burning pile of timber, a coincidence, I was unable to dismiss the possibility that I was observing the site of a meteor landing. I looked up your phone number and called to ask if you had received other reports of this sighting. The contact informed that there was one other dramatic report from West Seattle. I called a neighbor who agreed to search the area, and they excitedly told me that a Canadian radio station they were listening to reported a call from Vancouver of a Green glowing mass seen shooting across the sky. To my embarrassment, our search resulted in the discovery of the smoldering embers of a neighbors timber burn pile. It was a disappointing coincidence, but did not change the impression that what I saw was of greater significance that for now would remain unexplained. I am a homeowner and Father of two sons. I have mid level college education, a Manager with 20 years of experience in my field, no history of  mental illness or indications of instability, respected by family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, and have never experienced nor reported any event of this type.

There was no sound except the sound of the commercial airliners coming across the mountains. The light did not resemble a meteor at all.

I could not make out the shapes of the objects due to distance (or maybe because they may not have been very large), but through binoculars I could defintely see the activity of the described lights.  At first, there was only one object (as described above.) That was at 21:45.  By 0100 a.m. on May 10, there had appeared four more objects, each quite stationary and flashing/strobing red, with steady green and white lights while the objects were collectively quite stationary.  All five objects were in a triangulated pattern covering about a 5-mile area in the sky.  These objects were defintely NOT aircraft of any known type.  Even though there was air traffic coming and going from Charoltte-Douglas Airport (some 30 miles away; I live under an existing flight pattern), it was impossible to mistake these five objects as being normal aircraft.  The main aspect of these objects was that they did not move!  At whatever altitude they were at, they did not move!!  But, again, there was no mistaking these objects for normal aircraft.  The sky was clear, with minimal interference from earlier rain clouds that had passed through.  Normal air traffic was discernable from these objects.  Stars were clearly visible.  Temperature was about 60 degrees.  (As an aside - while I was looking at the first red/green/white object, at around 22:15 through binoculars, I distinctly saw and visually tracked [for about 5 seconds] a greyish rectangular object passing through the heavens. I say ""the heavens"" because that object was definitely outside our atmosphere and passing at maybe 200 miles up. I have seen the space shuttle three times [and even once when it was connected to the space station] as it passed over my area and I knew that the altitude of the shuttle was 200+ miles above me.  When watching this sixth object [just by chance] I had the disctinct feeling that it was at least as high as the shuttle would have been. And that means that this sixth object, to have been visible to me even through binoculars, had to have been a VERY large object.  Rate of speed of this sixth object was half again faster than that of what the shuttle's speed normally is when in orbit (meaning, this sixth object was moving at 17,500++ mph.) There was NO mistaking this sixth object for space junk, a satellite, the space station or anything other than a VERY large rectangular machine moving from West-to-East at a high speed.

She also saw the light.It was still and very low,so much that she commented it that it is a tower light !

By erratic I mean they were tracing lines back and forth linearly as well as parabolically.  I recently purchased a BMW M3 and, as a matter of driving pleasure, wanted to stretch its legs a bit in an area devoid of traffic hazards. I pointed my car’s compass point directly west along Bell Rd and drove until I converged with 219th avenue, at which time I stopped and played with my satellite radio module.  What captured my attention was a ‘star’ like object that jerked from left to right (south to north, from my vantage point) instantaneously. It covered a distance 8-10 thumb widths at arm’s length and stopped immediately. I cannot articulate the geometry of its flight for the 11 minutes I watched it, though I will say it completed this manuever a few times in addition to sinuous ascents/descents interposed by intervals of no perceptible lateral/superior/inferior movement.  Another ‘star’ like object appeared in the black of the sky accompanied theretofore by no flight trajectory; it simply appeared as if it just materialized into the temporal sequence. It too moved linearly quite fast stopping on a dime and remaining in a fixed position for a little while.  Moreover, I perceived splashes of light emanating from this second light to an area both above and below it. These splashes were dimmer in luminosity than the object, by comparison. Then it traced circuitous patterns in a small area of the sky gradually departing behind White Tank Mountain, as did the third object (It is called a mountain but is really a large hill).  I do not know if there are military bases in that direction. Luke Air Force Base is near but in the opposite direction. Yet, even if these objects were borne of man, how could they move in the fashion I observed? The night sky is apt to deceive; therefore I make no conclusions and offer only my perceptions of what I saw.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,33.63271552511416,-112.37252283105023

The disk appears to be approximately 5 feet in diameter, and has the shape of a classic 1950’s style flying saucer.   The upper portion of the craft is outlined with a row of very bright and highly visible (white) LED lights. The disk appears to be powered by some form of electrically generated propulsion system, as it emits a steady and distinct “humming “ sound as it passes overhead.  The disk is able to ascend and descend vertically with startling speed, and is very agile and maneuverable in flight, performing banks and maneuvers not associated with conventional craft. For these reasons (and of course, due to the small size of the object) it is clear that the disk is unoccupied, operating under the remote control of an individual, or individuals located nearby.  It is quite shocking and disturbing to witness this object in flight.  It resembles neither aircraft nor helicopter in appearance or operation, and clearly demonstrates its superiority to both in terms of maneuverability and its prowess in rapid acceleration and deceleration.  One is not accustomed to seeing such an unusual object passing above what is otherwise a typical California beach town.  I most recently witnessed the object hovering in the sky just west of Newport Center (an outdoor shopping plaza flanked by a ring of office parks) on the 10th of May at approximately 9:30 in the evening.  I grabbed my Mini DV video camera from the house and drove over to a neighborhood park to get some footage of the object before it left the area.  I shot several minutes of the object in flight, and then watched it land on an expanse of grass adjacent to the Newport Center signage pylons.   Soon after the craft landed, its lights were powered down and its operator (presumably) retrieved it in the dark.  I quickly left my discreet vantage point in the nearby park, returned home, and began viewing the footage – highlights of which I am forwarding to your organization via email.  I think you will find the resulting video to be very interesting, as the camera’s 40x zoom lens allowed me to zoom in close on the disk at times, and also to pull back far enough to include recognizable objects such as buildings, traffic lights, and the signage pylons in the frame.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,33.6023,-117.8648

I work a varying shift pattern so I am around all hours. I had just completed the feed and was closing the door to my shed, when my attention was drawn to a bright, light orange coloured, fluorescent type globe moving in what I describe as a relatively slow zigzag movement. It was travelling from the south west to the north east. It was probably no more than 200 feet high and approximately 100 foot north to my location, travelling over the roof tops. The globe from where I was standing only appeared to be about two foot in diameter. The light from the globe was constant and bright, at this point I was not aware of any other lights. I could not see any other features. There were no noises of aircraft or ground vehicles at the time. Having passed near to my location, the globe appeared to move into a straight flight path, continuing north east. Once the object had passed, I immediately ran upstairs and looked out of the bedroom window. I could still see the object, however it was by now quite some distance away, and it appeared to be moving faster than when I had initially observed it. I located my binoculars and used them to view the object but I could not identify anything further other than I could now see a steady red light on what I would describe as its left side. I was unable to keep the image steady. Weather conditions at the time were fine with a light wind. There was a small amount of cloud about. Visibility was very good. I had a clear and unobstructed view of the globe, initially for about two minutes and then through my binoculars again for about one minute. I have thought about all of the logical things that this could be and I cannot think of anything that would give me an answer. There are several things that I had to take into consideration. I have had a long experience of being in and around aircraft, both military and civilian. I have served for 10 years in the Royal Air Force, working in and around various types of military aircraft. I am currently a Police Officer stationed near to the Air Support Unit from where the police and ambulance service fly their helicopters. I have a very keen interest in all aircraft and as such I have a flight simulator. Firstly, I live in a military zone. However, the main military aircraft flying is helicopters, mainly Chinook and Puma. It is highly unusual to have military jets flying in the area. However, it is rare for the military in this area to engage in night time flying. At the height that I witnessed the globe, there would have been engine noise. Secondly, because of my experience of the police and ambulance helicopters I was able to discount them from my observations. There was no aircraft noise. I have worked with both aircraft on many occasions. I live relatively near to Stansted Airport (35miles) and the sky is littered with civil aircraft, however, they never fly this low or so close to the houses. I considered that it may have been the landing lights for the aircraft which are sometimes on, but these obviously go out of sight as the aircraft passes. At the time of this incident I did not see any civil aircraft flying. The globe light remained in view for sometime. I was unfortunate not to have any photographs and there are no other witnesses that I am aware of. I have given full and logical thought to all options and I do not consider that this was a low flying aircraft of any description. As such I have no explanation as to what the flying object was. I am a sceptic when it comes to UFO’s, however, this was and to me an unexplainable and surreal experience and having discussed the matter with my wife I thought that I would report the matter.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,,

Object appeared stationery in sky I was having trouble sleeping during the early morning hours of June 22, 2008.  I had the TV on, and after the cable had gone out for the second time, I opened up the curtains to look out at the night sky through the sliding glass doors that are in my bedroom.  It was around 3:00 am. I saw what at first appeared to be a bright star.  It was in the west, at about 45 degrees elevation.  After looking at it for a bit longer, I saw that the light seemed to be pulsating much more intently than from a flickering star.  As I continued to look, I was able to perceive that the light was also changing colors…..going from a yellow-white, to red to green.  And the pulsating effect seemed very strong.  At this time I thought it might be a plane far off in the distance, so I waited to see if I could detect any movement, by seeing if it was coming closer to me, or moving laterally to my position. After viewing it for about 2-3 minutes, it was apparent that it was not moving towards me, away from me, or to either side.  It was in the exact same position relative to me, that I had first seen it in.  The very strong, strange pulsating was continuing, so I decided to get a pair of binoculars that I had in the other room. When I trained the binoculars on the light, I was now able to more clearly see the pulsating and changing colors of light.  With the aid of the binoculars, it now appeared to me that the lights were extended outward in a somewhat circular or oval pattern.  I could not detect an object within the perimeter of these lights.  But the lights seemed to almost be dancing in a strobe like fashion.  It gave off a very strong electrical effect. By now about 6-7 minutes had passed by, and I realized that the object was slowly dropping, much like the sun setting over the horizon.   There was a large hill in my line of sight, so in the next minute or so, the object dropped out of view behind the hill, whose apex was at about 25 degrees. I’ve never reported any kind of sighting before this, but felt compelled to do so, as I have never seen anything like this before.   It was clearly not a star, planet or a meteorite.  As I stated, I was able to rule out a conventional airplane.  I was also able to rule out satellites and the International Space Station, after going to several websites and reading what the visual characteristics of such a sighting would be. The only other thing that I could think of would be some kind of helicopter, but the nature and shape of the intense pulsating and changing colored lights, seems to make this likelihood remote, in my opinion.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,34.126770289855074,-118.76487028985508

As we watched it was traveling south to north and was on a parallel path with the earth.  As it got closer, we were able to see that is was actually a ball of fire, orange in color with red center traveling at a rapid speed (guess of 40 mph) at about the height of a helicopter flying, but with absolutely no sound or smoke trail.  As it passed our position we noticed another bright object following behind, on the exact same path as the first.  This also appeared to be a ball of fire, except it was not as contained as the first one.  When it got even with us, we noticed that the object was looser in form and we could actually see embers falling from the object.  I was concerned of possible fire since it was over a hay field.  They both continued on north northeast until out of site.  I would say the object appeared to be the size of a mid-size car, and it was about 50 yards from us.

I am reporting this for my girlfriend. This is the second sighting she has witnessed in the Newtown Square area. She is an excellent observer. I was on the phone with her during the time it happened. It was around 9:30 pm to be exact. Looking due south she observed the thin cloud layer being parted at a high rate of speed. She tells me that the object itself looks football shaped from her vantage point and it was translucent like a frosted glass. She could make out the dark sky through it but could see enough of the object to see it was there. It was moving twice the speed of a commercial jet liner. It was cutting the clouds until she could no longer see it.  For the record, her first sighting was much more dramatic than this one. I was at work and she called me very scared from inside our parked car behind the apartment complex (same area from which she saw this recent one). She told me she just saw a UFO. The object was literally in town. Newtown Square is about a 40 minute drive from Philly's edge. Pike's (or major streets) run away from the metropolitan area in a grid (somewhat). West Chester Pike links outside Philly to West Chester, PA. So it's a pretty well travelled road even early in the morning. This is why it's a wonder that this craft would make itself so apparent. The obect was seen (my guess) about a football field away from where she was. Nothing blocked her sight of it. It was about 3 am and she was watching the dog in the back yard. The back yard consists of a parking lot for tenants and a grass area that runs up to a fence. Standing on the egde of the grass looking towards the south the lights of the object caught her eye. She said it may have come from overhead, it was travelling east and slowed down over the town and descended perhaps half of a football field and hovered over the top of a bank that sits on an intersection in town. The underside of the object was lit up from the sulphur street lights but since cloud coverage was so low, the street light bounced back down and slightly lit the top of the craft up as well. It was egg shaped and possibly a white to off-white color because of the way the light lit it up. There were two sets of rotating lights that were possibly around the entire vehicle. One set(row) was on the bottom and one(row) was towards the top. She says that from what she could see of the craft there were four lights visible in each row, whether the lights went all the way around the craft, she didn't know. The lights looked as if they were pulsing in patterns counterclockwise around the object? That's assuming the lights went all the way around it. She says the object hovered there for 15 to 20 seconds then moved behind ! some tre es. At that point she jumped into our car with the dog and locked the doors until she could calm down (which took some time) and then fled back into the apartment. That's when she called me to report her sighting. This happened last February '07.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,39.9853,-75.4367

An interesting point though was that we had observed a small white form in close proximity (remembering this is from the ground) to the large orange/amber orb & only once the orange orb seemed to  instantly vanish did it then begin  to move ,red & green flashing lights appeared & to our surprise we realized that it was a plane. .. What we cannot understand is that while we observed this white object upon our arrival to Lake Ontario it remained motionless ,it was only after the disappearance of the large orb did it begin to move .It was almost as if they were secretly observing in the sky what we were observing from ground level.Makes me wonder if the military knows more than they inform the public of.

I only observed it for about one to one and a half seconds max. The object appeared to stop, or rapidly slow down, at one point in midflight, (for a mille second) and continue its flight at the same rate of speed, maybe around 100,000mph.  I observed it flying at an altitude of 400-500 ft., moving silently, no noise at all , traveling in a straight path from the SSE towards the NNW.  I estimated its size to be about 250ft across.

Coming out of the front door of my unit at an apartment-converted-condominium building, the lawn was surrounded by the building in a box-like fashion, with an exception of the south side fully open where the parking lot was.  I walked toward the parking lot, into the opening, and to my right, I spotted a bright red light in the sky, above the trees.  I looked directly at it, and the red light softly throbbed, like a beacon light.  From my vantage point, to the left of the red light were three bright white lights flashing in a rapid succession.  The red light would lit up and fade, then three rapid white flashes from right to left, then back to the red light lighting up.  It’d repeat the process.  I could tell that they were lights on an object, but I could not see the shape of the object.  At first, I thought it must be an airplane or a helicopter, so I waited for it to come closer in hope of a better inspection of what it was. Then I realized that it wasn’t either flying towards me or going the opposite direction.  It just remained stationary with the lights throbbing and flashing.  I also realized that the lights were unusually bright: the red light was just too noticeable and the white flashes were sparkling bright – similar to a camera flash.  If it was moving, it was done at a barely noticeable pace.  So slow that I was unsure if it was moving or remaining stationary.  For the most part, it remained stationary.  It remained virtually motionless for 10 good long minutes.  Finally, it moved further from me until I could no longer see it due to the trees being in the way.  The way it moved, it moved very smoothly; in a gliding motion.  There was no sign of the object turning as it moved away; the lights remaining in their same positions.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I would like to find whether that was an UFO or something else that can be explained.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,38.798958214042266,-77.09513265167007

I was helping my nine year old get ready for bed this evening, at approximately 8:50 p.m.  I went into our 2nd story loft to open a window, and due to the pretty view, I peeked out through one of the windows.  I noticed a strange flashing object hovering over what seemed to be roughly over the Promenade Mall in Temecula, or maybe south a mile or two, over the power lines off of Route 79 south.  The object was not moving, and I watched it for at least 10 minutes to see if would reveal itself to be a helicopter, or plane.  It just stayed in the area. It was barely moving around, except for the spinning motion, going clockwise.  It could easily see white spinning lights, turning blue, then back to white, and then red and then to white again.  It seemed to wobble a few times, but remained over the area without moving away.  I had to step away to tuck my daughter into bed, and when I got back it was still there.  I grabbed my telescope and ran downstairs, but when I went to the front door, the house across the street was blocking my view.  I ran to the garage and tried to find it, but the same house blocked the view.  I went back upstairs, frustrated, and found it in the sky, but it had moved about 2 inches to the right, from my viewpoint.  Then, it flashed like a camera flash, and then I saw a yellow streak fly across the sky, moving upwards at an angle of about 45 degrees.  I remember thinking it looked like a comet in reverse.

At around 10pm, one of our friends noticed a bright light moving rapidly from southeast to northwest.  There was no sound at all.  The light was not blinking and there was only one light.  It was about 3 – 4mm at arms length with a slight yellowish ness to it.  I thought it looked a little oval in shape.  It was much too big to be a satellite (I don’t think they have lights anyway - ?).  Its path was straight as an arrow and its speed was constant.  My 16 year old son thought he could see it wavering very slightly.  If it was an airplane or a helicopter there would be definite sound and blinking lights.  As it reached the horizon there were some clouds silhouetted in the sky, I could see the light go through or above them, it was hard to tell.  Either way, there were clouds between us and the light.  So I estimated its altitude as being quite high. At about 10:20pm, one of our party noticed a bright flash to the south, about the size of three or four average size stars combined.  No one else saw it at that time.  We don’t know if the lights had anything to do with each other or not. At around 10:30pm, we saw another light exactly like the first.  Size, brightness, speed, direction, apparent altitude, everything was just like the first, except this one was a little more to the South.  This light also disappeared over the horizon to the Northwest. Some time after, about 11:15 or so, we were all glancing up at the stars.  I then saw a flash as well, which was about the size of three or four stars combined.  It looked almost like a camera flash.  It came from the same Southerly direction as the first flash at about 30 degrees in the sky.  Once again we don’t know if the two incidents are connected in any way. As a footnote, two of our car batteries died and had to get jump started.  One died just as it arrived at the campsite and one the morning after we arrived.

At approximately 22:55, three teardrop shaped objects, each appearing about three times the size of Mizar & Alcor through the binoculars flew from West to East through my field of view.  They were in a triangle pattern, very similar to a flock of birds.  I lowered the binoculars to view with my naked eye, but the objects were not visible at that point.  I viewed again through the binoculars, and was able to re-find the objects, still moving along the same trajectory, and with the same velocity, this time just further East of Ursa Major. I went back to observing stars of Ursa Major, and approximately one minute later saw a single teardrop shaped object, exactly like the previous three, traveling in the same West to East trajectory as the ones described previously, only this one seemed to be traveling at about three times the speed of the others. At that point I went in to explain to my wife, and then came back out for another five minutes or so, but saw no more objects of that nature. I live near a private air field, and I am very aware of how a small plane appears in the night sky.  These objects were just solid white, with no blinking whatsoever, and appeared to be traveling much faster than any plane I have ever witnessed, including jets.

Curious I drove out to his location and he then pointed out what he was seeing. The object in the sky was bright and blinking many different colors. When it was not blinking it blended into the sky like a star. After about 3 min. of watching this object it now had started moving up, down, right, left and diagonal. He had told me it was moving earlier also. After looking at it for 10 min. I stoped looking at it so my eyes would adjust and I would know it was not just an optical elusion. We then looked around in the sky to see if there was others. There was 3 total. They would light up very bright then get dim. They would move in all sorts of directions. They also had something in common with each other, they all blinked many different colors, they moved in weird ways and 2 of them stayed inbetween 2 stars. The other was the most active and got very bright then dim. The object also moved in every direction and fast. The object started out about 50 degrees up from the ground. It would then drop to about 25-30 degrees then back up. That's not it. After awhile I had though my eyes were playing tricks on me until a plane that was flying at the same altitude and directly towards the object came about. It seemed to effect the object. The plane stayed at the same speed and altitude. As the plane got closer the object started lighting up like a strobe light of colors and shot straight at the plane. It then bobbed up and down. After the plane passed it then moved up to about 60 degrees in the sky. The objects went on lighting up for about 2 and a half hours till' we needed to go home.

On closer inspection with binoculars it is seen to have 3 lights, (a red, blue and white) which blink on and off, but not like airplane lights. It makes no sound and acts as if it knows it is being observed, which is one of the creepiest aspects of this. Then it begins to move ever so slightly as if it is hovering and has no noise. It remains stationary and then begins to change shape, getting less bright but the colors remain. It will stay like this for about 30 minutes longer before disappearing quickly.

I thought it was odd because the sky was totally clear but the lights looked like they were subdued by some sort of fog or haze.   From my point of view the lights appeared to be either on the same vehicle or in perfect formation.  They looked like they were no more than 200 yards away from me at the most.  But it was moving so fast that it should have been making a whole bunch of noise.  Instead, it was absolutely silent.

On my right side is a sliding glass door and a balcony, my home is situated on top of a hill in Antioch with a very wide view of the Delta and Valley below.  My area of view was towards Rio Vista/Fairfield/Travis AFB. Anyways, I was lying there, and noticed that out in the distance (maybe a few miles) was this huge ball of blazing red light hovering - probably at like 5,000 feet altitude approx?  At the same time I heard a helicopter flying over my home (there is a hospital trauma center nearby and the emergency helicopters fly over sometimes)..... I thought that was the helicopter, then the helicopter passed right above me and I realized the red light was not the helicopter.....the red light object I saw was not making that noise.....  I got out of bed and walked out to the balcony.  It was a very clear night and I swear that it looked like a bright light, steady, very bright, just staying in one spot over the hills..... probably for about 2 minutes.  At first I thought it might be a space shuttle landing or possibly a plane that had exploded, but it was stationary and didn't move....so I knew it wasn't either of those. I stood there and all of a sudden it became a tiny white light (like a star) and dissapeared up and away towards the night sky until it was gone, almost instantly.

My initial thought was that it was an airplane over McChord AFB.  We have constant overhead flights from the base.  After watching this object move slowly in a southeast direction towards or over McChord AFB I realized that it was not a normal craft.  This is what it looked like. Since it was dark and overcast I was not able to discern an actual outline.  The object was probably 7 or more miles away on the horizon but it was pretty good size.  There were dozens of white lights that were constantly flashing (twinkling) in rapid and non-uniform fashion.  It almost appeared like the lights were moving rapidly in a circular motion but I cannot say for sure.  All of the lights were white.  Every aircraft I have watched fly anywhere in the area would have no more than 7 or 8 lights (multi-colored) on it at any time and if they flashed it was in a constant rhythm. I watched this craft come to a stop and hover for about 30 seconds when every light shut off completely and it appeared to disappear.  I figured then that it was just something that could probably be easily explained and was turning to go back to bed.  After about 15 seconds of darkness the lights came back in the same position and the craft started to slowly move off in a southwesterly direction towards Ft. Lewis.

At this point, I assumed I was looking at a couple Cessnas doing night training, but I wanted to call my friend and tell him what I was seeing just for fun. While I was on the phone with him, my Fiancée pointed out that there was a 7th light now in the sky next to them- and much to my surprise, I looked up to see the 7th light duplicate to reveal an 8th light, which instantly glided into position, turning the “check” into a “V.”  Two minutes into the event, as we neared the small airport, it became evident that the lights were not tiny Cessna aircrafts. We could now also make out that each ball of light was in fact three large white lights, as if a commercial airliner had a large spherical light on the bottom-front of the plane and one large spherical light on each wing tip. About another 30 seconds passed and the “V” shape broke up and each aircraft began to pass over head. At a stop light, I opened my car door and stepped out to get a better look at these “planes.” It was when one was right over head that I noticed a tiny red beacon in the very center of the aircraft that was blinking. There were no stars in the sky, and I cannot 100% fully verify that the triangle shaped craft was connected all the way around- but for whatever reason, despite never seeing a photo of one, I just assumed it was triangle shaped. It’s like I could make out the darker matter. I couldn’t make out wings or anything, but my mind saw it as a triangle.  My fiancée asked me what was going on, and I told my friend I would call him back. I told her I thought the planes were actually “UFO’s” because at that point I had no idea what they were and I wanted to scare her. They were large, triangular shaped crafts who made no noise as they passed overhead. I’ll reiterate that it was midnight on a deserted street and literally no noise could be heard. I turned into an apartment complex and physically got out of my car and attempted to take a picture with my phone. My hand couldn’t stay still and with the VGA resolution I snapped a blurred picture that looked more like headlights than anything else. I deleted it when I got home (before I realized the significance of our encounter.)  Because I couldn’t bring myself to fathom alien crafts, and my fiancée didn't appreciate me trying to freak her out, I just assumed I was witnessing some new airliner which I’d never seen before and began to drive home. I took I-69 south and noticed one of the aircrafts following the highway. This struck me as extremely odd because I’ve lived in Indy for quite a while and never before had I seen a low flying airliner simply “follow” the highway. It passed overhead and I saw a few more off in the distance. It was actually really eerie. I’d never felt like that before.  I got home and Googled whether or not Indianapolis International had any delays or runways out, explaining why so many aircrafts were simply cruising around the city at low altitudes at midnight. Literally every flight was on time. That’s the last I thought about this event until today when I stumbled upon a website describing these triangle shaped UFO’s with three white lights and a center red beacon. I noticed how they mentioned these crafts fly low over populated areas, and even follow highways. When I read that line I literally got chills. I’m not going on record saying I witnessed alien crafts, but I will stand by my report that I saw exactly what all of these websites are describing as “triangle shaped UFOs.” The physical description and behaviors mimic exactly as what I witnessed. I felt that I had an obligation to tell somebody or some organization that I witnessed a number of these crafts. I’d sure like to know what they were. I’d draw you a picture but it would look exactly like the dozens out on the web right now, except the center red light was about a quarter of the size as the three white lights. Well, that’s that.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,39.80764884833982,-86.14221402931499

I went outside to smoke my morning cigarette this morning (Thursday 3/6/2008, @ 7:28 AM exactly) when I noticed something out-of-the-ordinary flying in the sky to the east of me.  At first I thought it was a bird, but when no wings were moving I focused in on it with my eyes and figured that it had to be a loose 'weather' balloon, or any type of balloon for that matter, ascending into the sky with the help of the wind.  Then I realized that there was no way it could be a balloon either.  As it continued to travel toward me (to the west) and further North, I was staring at it as its path advanced very quickly throughout the sky.  I could see it moving like no other 'balloon in the wind' would ever move.  It was completely black and its shape was changing as it traveled through the air to the north before disappearing in the light layer of clouds that was layering the sky over the valley this morning.  It was clearly a thin (relative to my perspective), perfectly round disk of some sort, and while it flew, it spiraled and twisted like a flat Frisbee, a CD, or a flat rock would spiral if you were to throw one into the air.  It was twisting on it's axis while flying through the air (could not tell if it was spinning or not) very gently and softly but moving very fast though the sky.  The sighting lasted for about 2 minutes...from the moment I spotted it directly East of where I was standing, until the time it disappeared due North from my position.  I could see that it had a perfectly round shape when the angle was right, and I could also see its flatness when it shifted just enough on its side in the middle of its flight.  Its flight pattern was just like that of a bent Frisbee when thrown upside down...you know, it spiraled, sort of rotating on its lengthwise axis, as it flew, kind of twisting as its path advanced.  If you've ever thrown a CD into the air, it was flying almost exactly like that, but proportionately, probably not as fast as a CD flung in the air.  It had very slow, smooth, ! almost f loating dynamics that made it seems like it was hovering almost...but it seemed like it was moving at a constant rate throughout the sky.  I could see its round profile and its flat profile as it spun/spiraled, depending on its position in flight relative to my point-of-view.  Its color was black, but it may have been that it was being silhouetted or shadowed or the like.  It was a flat, round disk, twisting and spiraling through the sky about as fast as it would take a small airplane to fly across that much airspace.  If one side was the ""top"" of the disk, and one side ""the bottom,” I must have seen the top and the bottom about 6 to 8 times each.  That is about how many rotations it made on its axis.  Its size was not determinable, and the altitude at which it was flying was also not determinable, so I cannot make any postulation as to any of those details.  I have never in my life believed in any sort of inexplicable flying objects of any sort.  I always thought that people that believed they saw UFO either had overactive imaginations or were just ignorant in terms of existing aircraft, or a combination of many other factors.  I do not wear glasses and I have perfect 20/20 eyesight in each eye. This was my first time ever seeing what in my mind, I guess, HAS to be a 'UFO', meaning there is no way I can explain what I saw based on my own first-hand experiences.  I have never believed in ""UFO's"" simply because I have never witnessed, first-hand, anything that I would qualify as such...there always seems to be an explanation (and there probably is one in my case, with my sighting this morning too!...I just don't have one right now!).  I always said that unless I see one myself (or a Sasquatch for that matter) I can't logically claim to believe in them.  This is my first ever 'UFO' sighting.  I even caught about 30 seconds of what I thought would be good footage using my cellular phone's video application...to no avail.  Immediately upon recording the sky, I could tell that there was nothing visible showing up on my phone's screen.  Nothing showed up during the recording process and there is nothing at all on the footage I have saved on my phone...just the hazy morning sky...no black spot, no nothing!....the object must have been too far away to register on my phone (a 2 Mega-pixel camera-phone).  That is all I have to report.  Conveniently, I am making this report here because I happened to see your website on TV; a History channel special on ""the grays"" which ran last night, and that is how I knew that this is the place to come if I ever needed to make a report.  Well, wouldn't you know it...the day after that is the day I have my first UFO sighting.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,44.039544983277594,-123.12515735785954

Thursday, March 6th 2008,  I was sitting on my computer and I kept hearing continuous jet aircrafts flying over my small town of Altoona, Iowa, enough to make my house shake. At first i didn't take to much care into it but, it was happening about every couple minutes another jet or some kind of fighter aircraft that was very loud would fly over. This lasted for about an hour or so. Finally i got up to let my cat out on my back porch & I saw a blood-red object that was very high in the air and was not pulsating this was around 9pm. It was very bright blood red and moving in 90- degree angels very quickly much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.  Two jets were chasing it, well were trying to keep up with it anyways. I was in awe standing on my deck with my cat. I ran inside and called a close friend who was about 5-10 miles away in a town called Pleasant hill. I explained to him what i was seeing and he didn’t really believe me. I stood on my back porch and there were about 20 to 30 different aircrafts spread out every flashing in the night sky. I thought it was very unusual for that many aircrafts to be flying around our small town because were no where near the Airport. I decided to go grab something to eat down the street & drive around and investigate shortly after, there were more and more aircrafts flying around our town and i lost sight of the red orb like object. Shortly after I came inside i got a call from my friend that i called previously. He said that he was outside with two of our friends getting ready to get in there car in Pleasant hill and saw the same blood red object and there were the same jet aircrafts chasing it. But they heard a very silent hovering sound from the red object. They got in there car and turned on the radio but none of the stations would come in on FM they were all static same with the AM, Making odd fuzzy sounds throughout the car ride to my house. They arrived at my house and we all discussed and went over what we all saw.  We all had seen the same object; we concluded that the object was chased by the jet aircrafts from Altoona in the direction of Pleasant hill. We all were standing on my back porch discussing what happened while Aircrafts were still lingering all over our skies. As we were talking i realized about a month pervious on the night of February 16th i saw a similar blood-red object over Pleasant hill on my way home to Altoona coming home from a friends house. I didn’t think much of it at the time but it was the same solid-color blood red orb like object. I looked around the internet for sightings of UfOs in Altoona Iowa and found an abundance of similar UFO sightings throughout the months of February and January and march.  I was positive that the object I saw racing through the sky was not any sort of friendly air craft, seeing how it was a bright red orb of no familiarity. The jets that were chasing it were pulsating a very very bright white light in some kind of pattern so I’m not exactly sure if they were also ufo's or jets. They kept flying around in a pattern with the Red orb like object all over my town.  So it is very possible that the white strobe like lights that were following it a bit slower could have been UFO's as well or some type of military aircrafts. But there were 20-30 aircrafts circling Altoona for about 2 hours after the incident. There was also a very low altitude stealth looking silent aircraft flew over my neighborhood. Not sure the exact type of stealth aircraft it was but im positive it was a stealth aircraft by the triangular lights on the bottom of the craft and it was also V-shaped. Im positive what we all saw was a ufo on account of military crafts chasing it and military crafts lingering around for two hours in the area My backyard is also a casino resort called prairie meadows which the Red object was hovering over to begin with. I hope to find as many others who have witnessed this encounter this is no joke or hoax.

According to their first hand reports, my mother called and told me that she could see a white strobing light in the woods just above and behind their home.  As she was speaking, she told me that the light was changing colors from white to red.  She was actually quite frightened over the situation. I next spoke with my brother who is a former deputy sheriff, EMT, and firefighter / rescue squad member.  He thought that it might possibly be the light from an aircraft that had went down in the woods, so he along with their neighbor (the chief of the area fire department) went to see what the situation was.  They could not tell exactly how far the light could actually be into the woods.  Some thought that it was close, while others thought the light might be larger, and farther away. As they went to examine the situation, the light (after changing colors, multiplying, and performing unusual movements) disappeared.  They eventually found an area that they all thought was the location of the lights.  There was an area of approximately four feet around that included broken limbs on trees, and the leaves and ground clutter was cleared. He got pictures of the light anomaly, but not of the possible landing sight.  I asked him to get photos of the possible landing sight for me, but there was a snow storm coming, which has now arrived.  I asked him to still get photos if he possibly could, to see if there was any reaction to the snow from the sight.  Either way, I told him to get photos of the area as quickly as possible.  I also told him to retrieve ground samples and samples from the bark of the affected trees in the area, and any other possible samples for future testing.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,37.141,-83.7372

We were laughing and singing along with the radio. I looked up into the sky and I saw a strange orange light. I felt almost hypnotized by it, then it disappeared. Immediately I told myself that it was only a glare from a passing vehicle. As I was turning to ask my girlfriend if she saw anything. She was actually turning to ask me the same thing. so was a loud, simultaneous, ""Did you see that!!?""  Now skeptical, but still thinking logical, I assumed it was a cloud passing over a bright star. Or even a planet. That's when I looked and about 3/4 mile northwest of the initial observation. I saw another one and then another right next to it. Each time one appeared... one disappeared in a timed sequence, and in a perfect, counter clockwise circular motion. Like a domino effect. Now intrigued, I frantically rolled down my window despite the cold winter air. Just when I thought it was gone another sequence would appear. Each time it appeared to multiply or pulsate, and always in a perfect sequence. There were never more than three lights in each one. I saw a total of three individual sequences on the way home, (like a 5 minute time period). When we got back to the house my girlfriend was trying to convince me that it was probably a helicopter or something. It wasn’t. So now we're standing in the driveway waiting on these things to show up again. It didn’t take long for them to appear. This time there are 2 sequences in the sky at once about a mile apart from each other, (she no longer thinks its a helicopter), and we can barely see super small twinkling lights in between each pulse. I also noticed that there were suddenly several of the small twinkling lights all over the western sky, moving in random directions. some fast some slow. some times disappearing/appearing. I noticed a low distant rumbling during the sequences. Like an engine, or explosion, or breaking barrier. Every dog in the neighborhood was barking. Just as fast as the show started, it ended. I personally cant think of a logical explanation. Fireworks? In the winter, with no sound, and in 2 different parts of the western sky... doubt it. Maybe a flare? Why? and how so timed in 2 different areas? Could be a hoax... but someone would have to have a lot of time on there hands because I did some research on this today.

The evening of the 6th, as a promotion the theater had numerous search lights (I would say five to seven) scanning the skies to attract attention of the event.  The weather that evening was probably 1000 foot layer of broken to overcast clouds.  Earlier that evening my girlfriend and I were watching the searchlights scan the clouds and watched the lights dance through the clouds for several minutes, as they lit the undercast.  Later that evening, about 9:45pm we once again went outside before going to bed.  I looked up at the searchlights still scanning the skies, when I noticed as the lights crossed a certain point in the clouds, there was a bright reflection coming from within the clouds.  The reflection was not like anything I had seen before, a very distinct long narrow reflection.   It remained in the same place, not moving with the clouds, changing shape or intensity as the lights randomly past the same place.  I have been a commercial airline pilot for over 20 years and know the effects lights or lighting can have on the clouds.  This was NOT light reflecting of different layers or shear lines of the overcast.   We watched the object for about 15 minutes, until the searchlights were extinguished for the night.  The object appeared to be in the cloud deck itself, and we were only able to see the light refracting off the object.  It would not have been balloons or other promotional material such as a banner, sign, etc for the theater as it would have been tethered almost on the centerline of the Tacoma Industrial Airport (TIW) and in the decent path, less than 1 mile for the runway.  That would have caused serious FAA fines to pull such a stunt. At several times, as the lights passed the object there appeared to be two reflections. I would be hard to estimate the size, due to it being in the clouds, but I would guestimate due to the height of the cloud deck I would say 30 to 40 feet in length, and 10 feet in width.

This had been quite an unsettling experience, however, we are each educated and not one a believer in, I guess others.   However, shortly the aura borealis spanned the northern sky in a manner I have not seen since childhood (can someone confirm this? and is there any association?) and there was an amber light at an in determinant distance which was impossibly of terrestrial origin.

This storm was announced in the morning news to be headed into the coastal regions from the pacific ocean and perhaps would reach Portland in the evening. Me and my boyfriend had just finished watching a movie and we decided to go outside and watch the lighting for a moment. Thunder was also heard after the lighting. As we watched the lighting our attention became focused to the southeastern sky where we could view the brightest lighting strikes. To right of these strikes was what we believed to be a bright star, however while viewing this lighting we noticed that this bright star began to bob up and down,move quickly to the right of the lighting away from the eastern sky and towards the southern. We live in close proximity of the flight path of commercial airliners heading for landing at the pdx airport. Suddenly many planes headed for landing,these planes were only about 5 to 8 minutes apart. Thinking this was due to the storm we continued to watch the sky for more incoming planes. We however not only viewed more planes, but more smaller lights we had previously supposed as fixed stars dart around the night sky. We kept our attention focused on the first bright object. My boyfriend said that he could see the smaller objects heading in collision with the bright object, i could not see this because my eyes are not as sharp, however upon looking through some binoculars i viewed smaller objects flying eradically around the larger one and then quickly disappearing as if going inside the large one. The large Object remained the same size while this continued. Alarmed, but curious we continued to observe this unsual sight, the lighting and quickly descending commercial aircraft. After about half an hour the sky became clear of aircraft. The lighting continued to flash all around, but its main focus point was still in the southeast and close to the object, it was very bright l! ighting seeming to be concentrated in this area. There were no sounds of thunder with this lighting in the southeast and it seemed to hit the same spot over and over, i realized this because it was in between two trees of our neighborhood each time. This seemed very strange to me because i've never seen lighting crash over and over again in almost exactly the same spot. The behavior of the smaller objects continued on their path towards the brighter one. The brighter object remained stationary in the south. Clear of aircraft we witnessed a military fighter jet appear from the east where the commercial aircraft came from. I am not sure the exact model of the jet but i know the difference between planes and jets. this jet turned towards the south and flew under the bright object. The ufo did not move what so ever and we got the impression that it was much to high for the jet to even come close to reaching. The jet flew under the ufo and then turned northwestern towards the airport or north of it. We viewed another jet plane a couple minutes after this come from the northwestern sky and do a similar flight pattern under the ufo in the south, i dont believe this was the same jet turning around but i can't be sure. Clouds began to block our view of the ufo for several minutes, but between the breaks of cloud cover we viewed it continuing to do the same behavior of assimulating these smaller objects. I don't know the number of these smaller ufos but the night sky seemed to be teeming with them. Neither me nor my boyfriend have ever witnessed a sight so marveling and transfixing. He used to work at the pdx airport and said he never seen anything even remotely close to the way this object behaved. The sky after about an hour was still void of commercial aircraft. The clouds blocked our view for some time and the lighting died away. After about another 30 minutes the sky began to clear in the south and the object was gone. Still the sky was quiet of aircraft. After about 10 to 15 minutes we finally viewed a plane in the ! sky comi ng from the south turning east and then west towards pdx, and then another from the east. They were in no hurry like the previous ones, and soon the flight path resumed to normal with planes. Id just like our report to be known and documented to see if anyone else in Oregon witnessed this in the sky while watching this thunder and lighting storm. We've never seen anything like this ever before in our skies. ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet?  PD))",2007-08-07T00:00:00,45.49032888888889,-122.40389111111111

I was looking at my father who was standing to my left when I noticed what looked like “shooting stars” traveling northbound in the sky.  I started to watch and when I realized that it was three sharp bright lights traveling in formation swiftly I said “what the ---- is that?” my husband turned just as I watched them traveling behind his head.  We both said ‘oh my god’ and then at that moment the lights seemed to just disappear. The formation of lights in the sky where shaped like a triangle on its side.  Each of the three lights where the points of the triangle.  They stayed completely uniformed and traveled in a straight path from south to north as if following the coastline.  There where no sounds and the lights where sharp.  I watched the lights for about 10 seconds but I have never seen anything like that in my life!   I am so glad that my husband saw too but he only was watching for about half of the time I did.  It was breathtaking and scary and amazing all at the same time.

Further, I had inadvertently photographed an object that looks identical last August in this same location.  These objects are so close in color and brightness to the background sky that they would go unnoticed. I noticed them because I used the Clarify option on PaintShop Pro which increases the contrast on low contrast large areas like sky.  It's nice to bring out the features of clouds but it also makes these objects more noticeable.  The object was to the north of Richmond Beach and the that I had photographed last August was to the north of Edmonds.  Either the object is intentionally matching the sky color and brightness to be stealthy or it's semi-transparent or translucent.  It's not merely reflective or it would reflect the dark water underneath.  I have these photos online in my blog but since I'm not allowed to give identifying information I guess you'll have to use your imagination.  An interesting aspect is that they appear unfocused even though objects occupying fewer pixels in the same photograph are focused.  The most recent object did appear that it may have left a faint trail.  It is so close to the limits of resolution though it is hard to tell. You can contact me if you'd like to see the images. I would like to make them available for others to see as well as how I discovered them because I think it's possible these things may be more common than we know but go unnoticed because they are so close to sky color and brightness.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,,

I live in Howell NJ, and I  was at home watching T.V. around midnight in my family room when some flashing lights caught my eye out of the window facing a local farm off of Faifield Rd. The area in my view, was a local sod farm and as such, it is slightly wooded around the edges of the property, but mostly a large clear field along both sides of Fairfield Rd, near the junction of Rt. 33 and Brickyard road. The night was bright due to a full moon, and clear. The flashing lights caught my eye a second time, because unlike the many airplanes that pass overhead in the area, they hovered in one spot as they moved from left to right in sequence. I got up off the couch for a closer look, and began to realize that this craft was flying very low and hovering just above the tree line. It hadn't moved like a plane would have out of my view; in fact, it didn't follow any of the many flight patterns I have come accustomed to seeing with aircraft. The lights were very bright and flashing in sequence, beginning with white or yellowish lights, a bright red light in the center and again towards the other end the same white or yellowish lights. As the lights appeared and disappeared in sequence,they seemed to be rectangular in shape(almost like a row of teeth). Realizing this was not a typical aircraft, I frantically ran to get my husband out of the basement, and he came upstairs quickly! At this time we both stared at the object in amazement, not really sure what we were seeing. He ran outside to get a better view fom our deck. Noticing that it was definately a different type of object, he grabbed the car keys and took off in the direction of Rt.9. I stayed home with the children (alseep in their beds), continuing to look out the window at the object. The object hovered a bit longer, and then began to disappear under the tree line out of my view within a few minutes. I checked the time starting to panic a bit- it was 12:18 am. Before my husband returned,another interesting phenomenon occured. I had been watching a pre-recorded DVR event at the time of the sighting and it seems that for some reason- when I tried to switch to live tv mode, thinking the news may be picking up on the sighting ,it stopped working temporarily (the DVR function was on and it stopped responding). In fact, I had to shut it off and re-start the system to acquire a new satellite signal. My husband returned a little after 12:30. He said, he traveled east towards Rt. 9 in the vicinity of T.G. I. Friday's, but lost sight of it. Having been curious to see if anyone else reported this sighting, I googled  Howell NJ and UFO sightings this morning and was shocked that there were two sightings described on NUFORC.com that detalied to the letter, the same exact vicinity we had seen the aircraft!!! I then was convinced I needed to report our sighting. My husband and I both having seen it, and being educated rational adults, we concluded that we can't say for certain what it is we saw, but whatever it was, we agreed that it was : a low flying craft, the lights were many more and quite larger than on a regular airplane or helicopter, and amazingly it hovered (seeming to float) in one spot much like a helicopter would but silently!! Intestingly enough, speaking to my aunt this morning  (on an unrelated topic), who lives a few towns over in Monroe NJ, she commented that last evening the whole area lost cable t.v. power and it had not yet been restored today.  After she told me about the outage, I looked online for a connection between sightings and power outages, and found quite a few interesting instances. There was also an interesting connection between sightings and military installations and or nulear weapons satations. I didn't mention what we saw to her or to anyone else, because it is difficult to describe such an event to people since most are skeptics (including myself, until last night and more so after reading those other two entries describing the same spot!!!). It was definately an interesting experience, one I will never forget! I know now, that I will no longer hold the skeptics viewpoint, but can with confidence believe that something other than what is known to us publically, can hover over an area silently and more or less fly without a known flight path. Perhaps our technology is evolving. We live near a few military installations and this could be an aircraft that is under the classified testing phase and has yet to be revealed! Who knows- however, as I mentioned earlier, my husband and I both witnessed the event and we can state with confidence that the object followed no known flight pattern, and was hovering, or moving slowly and much lower than any other known aircraft, and what we saw- we had never seen before!",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

The light didn't vary in intensity nor color, it was a pinpoint to my naked eye but very bright, it was pure white and brighter than any star or even Jupiter.  I am located in Cuenca, Ecuador which is in the southern third of the country about 7 degrees south of the Equator in the Andes.  The sky was 3/4 cloudy but with breaks sufficient to track the light visually as it was well above the cloud ceiling.  I first noticed it while standing in my back yard simply looking up at the stars through the cloud breaks. The air was clear however.  I first saw the light about 30 degrees off the Southern horizon and was able to track it intermittently through cloud breaks until about dead overhead, 90 degrees off the Western horizon. The sun had set about an hour before so it was not sun reflecting off a plane and it was going faster than any plane again with no sound at all.  It travelled at a steady speed.  It was not a satellite as satellites go much slower than the light I just saw.  The light I saw went about 2.5 to 3 times faster than a satellite. I am an ameteur astronomer and know satellite an standard 100 mile low orbit speeds very well ever since the Russians first sent up Sputnik. I have never seen a satellite even close to the brightness of the object this evening.  I have never seen aircraft lights resembling this light. I'm age 61 and have lived in major airport cities all my life and I have excellent vision (corrected with slight prescription glasses).  I didn't have time to rush in and grab my binoculars it was proceeding so fast so I simply observed it.  It took about 60 seconds estimated time to pass from 30 degrees off the Southern horizon to where I lost it due to solid clouds about 90 degrees perpendicular and slightly to the East of where I was standing. There was no wind nor interfering noise to blot out any noise form the light source.  Cuenca has an airport but I know the standard approach and exit flight paths and since there was no wind there would be no reason for planes to deviate from the standard flight approaches and exits.

We arrived at Borrego around 5 pm, and decided to backpack at Culp Valley Campground.  Culp Valley is approximately 3500 feet in elevation overlooking the Borrego Desert.  We backpacked about 1/2 mile from the trailhead and set up our tent about 20 feet north of the trail.  Nightfall began and I couldn't sleep.  At around 3 am I heard a male voice conversing with someone or something.  I was startled by this realization and sitting in the tent I looked into the direction (about 50 yards from my tent) of the chatter and witnessed a green light moving back and forth.  I noticed the green light was coming closer and closer to the trail near where my tent was located.  I immediately ducked down in my tent and peered out in the front portion of my tent.  I noticed a mass gathering of people (12-15) or beings following the leader holding the green light.  I was terrified asking myself why people were hiking the trail at 3am in the desert.  I quickly took a glance of the party of beings walking past my tent.  I witnessed really tall beings and really short beings wearing white robes holding metal rods with light emitting from the rods.  These beings had bald heads wearing white robes walking very very quietly and slow....with their heads looking left to right with each footstep.  The little beings had robes on and I noticed their long arms swaying back and forth in unison with their feet.  The thing that surprised me was the minimal noise I heard during their walk past my tent.  I've backpacked far too often to hear footsteps of people walking near or around my tent.  It didn't happen in this instance.  The beings reluctantly continued on the trail and the bright lights slowly faded away.  I was panicking during the whole episode and waited 10 minutes to wake my girlfriend up to inform her of my observations.  The next morning I ran down to the trail to gather any form of evidence.  Unfortunately I didn't find anything that was peculiar.  The next day I made a call to the park ranger giving him my account of what happened.  He came up with two theories.  Night scientists or a religious cult.  I personally think it was a ranger guiding extraterrestrials into our natural habitat.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

After about five seconds it started to move across the sky in an erratic zig zag motion. After viewing this for about two seconds I told the other person camping with me to come look at the light. He walked over with the flashlight  hanging off the zipper of his shirt still on illuminating his front as well as the ground in front of him. This flashlight is made by mountain equipment co-op and is intended for use on pedal bikes. Note: it is a very small light powered by two watch batteries, yet a very small amount of light coming directly from the bulb would have been visible from the UFO’s position at that time.  We saw the UFO’s light move up and down and diagonally up and across as well as down and across, sometimes pausing briefly before moving again.  After watching this for about one minute I shined a rather small flashlight directly at the UFO. The flashlight has the name Reactor on it, one L.E.D. Bulb, is powered by four double"" A"" batteries and a reflective surface measuring one and three quarter inches across. As soon as I shone the light at the UFO it continued zig zaging to the edge of the forest across the bay approximately one hundred fifty feet away from us. At this point it paused and it appeared to me that the UFO’s light became brighter and somewhat larger.The UFO light was about 1' across. It then started to descend at a forty five degree angle across to the edge of the bay about forty feet in front of our campsite.As This descent took about ten seconds.At a distance of about one hundred feet I could distinguish what appeared to be an aura around two objects at the top of the UFO light. The bottom of the light was round and solid light.The UFO had a slightly oval shape. When the UFO was about fifty feet from us I said “I think we better turn the lights off. I turned my light off at this point and my friend turned the light in his hand off a second later. I started to turn my attention back toward the UFO again but decided to double check that all the lights were off. At this point the UFO was aware of the light near my friend’s neck. He was not very familiar with the on/off switch and it was a tense moment.  But one of us finally turned it off. My friend saw UFO come to the same altitude as us and proceeded to move directly toward us. As soon as the last light was turned off it went back to its previous agenda of flying erratically above the forest. It reached a distance of about five to seven kilometres away and after about one minute.  Not wanting to lose sight of it I picked up a large “million candle watt” flashlight and shone it at the UFO.  Not the smartest move, but I felt relatively safe since it had approached so slowly the first time. This time it made about three zig zags to the same spot at the far edge of the bay in approximately two seconds.  At this point it slowed briefly. I turned the light off, and turned to run as soon as I saw the UFO go in front of the tree line. However my friend grabbed me as he didn’t want me to be injured running through the woods. I soon turned around and never saw the UFO again. Although I did try to get it to come back after a couple minutes.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

A few of my friends and I were walking home from a party about 3 blocks away from my house. We were goofing around and having fun as we walked home. at around 11:40 I looked up at the sky and looked at an object that I had thought was the moon and I thought to myself ""Hmm... The moon is awfully small tonight"" and laughed to myself. So we got to the corner of my block and walked down the hill to my house when I looked up again and I noticed the ""moon"" was kind of following us. I asked my friend to look up and she said the same exact thing I was thinking ""Wow the moon looks awfully small doesnt it?"". It was emitting this sort of yellowish glow, and was really eluminated. I thought I was going crazy, and it really creeped me out. My other friends then looked up as well and were like ""what the hell is that thing in the sky?"" and about 12 seconds after they said that it sped away through the night sky, and as soon as it dissappeared it started to rain. I dont know what that thing was or if it was even the reason for it to start raining but I know it creeped me out, I searched google to see if I could find any sphere shaped objects in the sky and it lead me to UFO'S so I searched UFO's and found this site and thought it was worthy to report my case. This is really uncommon in such an  urban place (or so i thought), I never seen or heard anything like this happening over here, and especially in the Bronx. I thought things like this happened in kentucky or tenessee to backwoods insest-ial cousin families, but when I saw this sphere, this thing move across the sky it creeped me out so much I'm afraid to even set foot outside my door. My mother thinks I've gone crazy and the other friends I was with during this night have gone into denial, with the exception of my one friend who is pretty creeped out as well.

I studied the objects with binoculars, comparing their distance to landmarks, and determined by their orientation to those landmarks, as well as compass readings, that they were not aircraft in the landing path.

For the past few years, I have read about the reports of red lights being seen over the city of San Diego during both the 4th of July and New Year’s Eve. I believed that due to a vast number of reports over the years, coming from all over town, that this must be a legitimate sighting. I believed that something really was being spotted by people in the skies over San Diego.  The reports usually involved at least two red lights appearing high above the city at night. They appear to hover or drift slowly, lasting a few minutes, and then the red lights either flicker or fade out. It sounded like flares to me. The behavior seemed to mimic what they do.  However, I wanted to hold my opinion until I saw it with my own eyes. Last night, I finally did.  I brought a friend with me to Cowles Mountain, located near San Carlos and the Mission Trails Regional Park area. The summit has an elevation of 1591 feet. I figured this was the perfect location to see anything that might appear above San Diego’s skies because I could see so many communities in and around the San Diego area, while still high above the city, close to everything. The majority of sightings seemed to occur around the Le Mesa area which we would also be very close to. There would be no missing it should the red lights appear in the same skies. We just hoped the weather would be clear, which luckily for us, it was.  We arrived by the mountain side at 10:15pm. After grabbing our gear and locking up the truck, my friend and I started walking towards the entrance to the trail. We didn’t get too far before I stopped and stared at a light directly above us. We hadn’t even left the neighborhood street yet and there it was! Sure enough, I was staring at a single red light just hanging in the sky. My friend turned, wondering why I stopped and followed my gaze. He saw it too. We couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t even midnight yet. We hadn’t even started our climb yet.  We watched it, expecting to see it turn or flash some other lights that might identify it as a normal aircraft. The red light was clear and crisp in the sky. It didn’t glow or appear fiery. It looked electronic to me. It was sharp. We watched it very slowly move to our right. Had this been a normal aircraft, only seeing a red light, it should have been going the opposite direction. The light should have been going left as on a normal aircraft. The left side light navigation light is red and the right side light is green. Seeing nothing but a red light, It should have flown to our left. The red light was instead drifting right. That was the other thing. It was drifting. It was traveling way too slow for a normal aircraft as well. It moved so slow in the sky that a normal plane would have stalled. It seemed to hesitate and bob in the sky as well. It flew a certain direction, but it wasn’t a perfectly straight line. I thought it might be a trick of my eyes at first, so as I watched it, I compared it’s movement to the stars behind it and a palm tree that rose up into the sky near it. It really did appear to be inconsistent in it’s forward movement. There was no sound.  Even watching it, I was thinking, “Balloon. That’s gotta be something attached to a balloon.”  We watched it move to our right, directly overhead, towards the mountain. This was flying in a NW direction. More specifically, I would have to say the object was directly over Navajo RD and just past Boulder Lane Ave flying towards the northwest. Quickly, I swung the backpack off my back and set on the trunk of a parked car. I fumbled for the video camera I had packed. I wasn’t ready. I was expecting to climb the mountain, have time to settle in, and break the camera out when I was ready nearing midnight. I didn’t expect that I would see it so soon! I fumbled in the dark for the zipper, but I didn’t want to take my eyes off it either, so I wasn’t able to get my camera right away.  While I did this, the light dimmed. My friend commented that, “It’s going up.” It appeared to be the case, but I wasn’t sure if it was going upwards or if the light had a direction to it and now was turning away from us, so that it appeared to dim. Watching a fainter light now, it did appear to raise up higher into the sky for me too. Before I could hit record and zoom in, it faded away completely. The light was gone.  The two of us stood there and kept our eyes on the same general spot in the sky. We couldn’t see anything there any more. There was nothing was moving. There was no light, no silhouette of an aircraft with it’s lights off. Nothing. There was only the stars of a clear night sky with nothing to be seen in the air at all.  We began out trek up Cowles Mountain. As we walked up the long fire road, we occasionally looked back up into the sky, hoping to see something like that again, and we discussed what we had seen.  I was certain that the light was actually lower than it seemed. The very first thing I tried to gauge was how close the object may have been to us. A lot of people say that the lights are really high up in the sky. I actually got the impression that the light we saw was a lot lower to the ground than it may have seemed. I thought the object was only as high as the mountain itself, of maybe a little bit higher but not by much. So, I would say it was under 3000 feet. Saying that, that would also mean the object was really small. I thought the object could not have been any larger than the size of a tire. I also thought that I could see a vague shape behind it, like it was attached to something. However, it didn’t expand beyond the light much so it was very hard to see. I thought I saw a dark enough shadow behind it to be something attached to it and I’ll be honest, it did look triangular shaped. The red light was on one point, towards the back of the direction it was moving. I will not report this as a triangular sighting, however, as the light is the only thing I'm sure about.  My friend disagreed on a few points. He didn't see anything behind the light. To him, the light also appeared to be much higher. He did think that it was high up in the sky, above 3000 feet. He thought it was high enough for other planes to possibly see and be up near. I asked him about the size and he thought it had to be something closer to the size of a car, maybe 6 feet wide. We pretty much agreed on everything else, though, including movement and speed.  I told my friend that I was sure it was a prank, still. The light didn’t do anything “out of this world.” I thought there was still possible explanations for it. I told my friend that, in my opinion, someone somehow attached a red light to a balloon and released it into the air. The wind that night was blowing in the same general direction the light was going.  However, there are some things I wonder, like how the light went out. We watched the sky for a while. If the light was simply on a string, it should have turned to face us again. It never reappeared. I also find it hard to believe that it would simply go out after being released into the sky.  It wasn’t a flare because we were close enough to it, we should have been able to see smoke, a flickering of light, or some fiery effect. It wasn’t a glow stick because it didn’t “glow.” There was nothing vague about the light. It was sharp and clear, like a bright bulb, unwavering in it’s brightness. It only dimmed before fading out. We watched flares later that night. I pointed out to my friend how flares were different. We were given plenty of examples as people near and far fired flared into the sky for new years. The flares were much brighter. The red light would be suddenly real bright in the sky, burn with a fiery effect, even have a hot pink fluorescent glow to it as it drifts back down towards the ground. This object was definitely not a flare. We ruled that out.  We’re pretty sure it’s a prank, we just couldn’t explain how it simply vanished right over us.  To add more weirdness to the night, the very next time I checked my watch to check the time, the light inside it died. That could have been a coincidence. It is an older digital watch, but some people like to know about electronic things failing during UFO sights.  That actually did happen, so I’m reporting it, but I think it’s just an odd coincidence there too.  Nothing else was seen by us for the rest of the night, to our disappointment. We did get to see fireworks all over the city. It was cool spending New Year’s up there. It’s an amazing view, but no other unexplained lights appeared anywhere over the city that we could see. I was hoping that if it was a prank, that what we had seen was a test, perhaps planned before they would release more lights into the sky right at midnight, but that never happened. It was just that weird red light at 10:15pm over San Carlos.  My friend and I are in our mid-to-late twenties. I have investigated UFOs for a short while and was in the Navy as a trained observer for close to 6 years. I extended and got out with an honorable discharge.

(This information included in the main body for further clarification.)  Object glowing seen out of the corner of my eye as I looked behind me to make sure there was no one stalking me. (I had heard there were drunkards out that night.) I then turned around and looked directly at it. I lasted over five seconds after that . it was roughly half to three-quarters the size of the full moon in size and glowed white and had a wavy tail almost like a shooting star except it was fluid and almost like it were made of a fluid light. The object dimmed and then vanished after traveling across the sky and was facing diagonally downward-right from my perspective. There was no obstruction in the way that could have blocked it to make it vanish a the point in the sky it did. May not be an aircraft at all...may be paranormal in nature though this is not provable.  It made no sound as it was moving through the sky but was most certainly low altitude due to it's relative size and clarity in comparison to an airplane that was passing at the time. It was not low enough to make a glow on the landscape below it. No sound of a crash was heard and from it's general size if it had crashed into the ground something should have been heard. It did not look like any form of aircraft or living thing that exists to my knowledge.It was not really a fireball so much as it was a hito-dama shaped light.  I was not tired, emotional, under any  great  amount of stress and have never had any form of drug or any sort of hallucination.

Very bright round objects in a group of 10, then 2 very different shapes,and 1 stationary object, Seen in the skies of Centerville, Ohio on Oct. 6, 2006.  It was around 6pm, the weather was beautiful, completely blue, clear skies.  My 2 sons, ages 10 and almost 12 came running inside to tell me (their mom) to come outside and see these strange objects in the sky. The objects made no sound. My sons told me they saw a group of 10 very bright circular shapes, then 5 of them darted off. My 10 yr old was visibly shaking and very scared.  When I came outside I kept saying, ""where boys""?  I looked up above my apt. and I saw 2 very different BRIGHT objects!  These 2 objects were very CLOSE!  It was not like a jet in the sky, this was CLOSE. On the left was a bright pulsating round object, on the right was a completely different shape.  The second had a circle shape on top, in the middle was oval shaped and the bottom was triangular. Both shapes were pulsating a VERY bright light. It lasted maybe 10 seconds.  Then they vanished.  I was so astonished and amazed, that I called the non-emergency number at our local police station.  They took my information and had an officer come out.  The officer came and briefly talked to me about what me and my kids saw.  She said there were no other reports.  Then, maybe a few minutes later, my friend came over.  She is around 40 yrs of age, like me.  I told her what happened and maybe 10 to 15 minutes later, there was ANOTHER strange, very bright shape off in the distance,in the sky.  Now, this object was stationary, not moving.  But, we noticed there were 5 aircraft circling the skies, obviously checking this object out!  This was NOT normal to have planes just circling around a object.  WE then walked over to 3 other neighbors who also witnessed this!  They made jokes, but could not explain what it was.  Then, my friend, her son, and my 2 sons (we ALL saw this), got into her car and drove at least 1 to 2 miles down the road.  This object was heading west.  The entire time she was driving, I could see this stationary object, while airplanes were obviously ! circling around.  At one time, I believe it looked like a straight line,and also like a crescent shape.  As it got darker, the object seemed to be getting lower and lower and we could no longer see it.  Also, the stationary object had a red tint to it, but we think it was because of the sunset. Before it was just like a star, but obviously NOT a star. When I returned home, I even called the TV station.  But, they too said no calls were made about any such sightings.  My kids are very honest people, as I am.  We saw something that was not ordinary or easily explained.  I have no idea what it was, but the 3 objects I personally saw have me astonished.  The 2 objects that I initially saw (above my apt.) were the most amazing to me. Especially because of the pulsating light and shape of the 2nd object.  My kids were the only ones to see the group of 10 bright objects, and I saw the 2 different shaped objects vanish before my eyes. I can not explain what it could be, but I have been feeling very frustrated because I want to know the explanation. I want to know why there were at least 5 US aircraft circling the skies around this stationary object!! I will probably never find out why. This experience has me totally in awe of our universe, even more so now. One last bit of information.  My youngest son told me that when he got off the school bus, he saw 1 bright circular object, but it vanished.  He said he didn't say anything at the time, because he thought his mind was playing tricks on him.  This happened 3 hours before we began seeing these objects.  Very strange indeed.

Upon further inspection, we noticed that the ""planes"" were connected to eachother by a beam of light, and that what we had thought to be the triad pattern of lights often seen on planes at night was acutally a part of this strange object. The best possible description of its appearence is that it was one larger triangular shape lined with red and blue lights connected to a similar but smaller triangular shape. It moved very fast and sparatically making no noise at all. It was able to turn very sharply. The larger and smaller triangular components of the object always moved relative to eachother, maintaining a perfect connection.  After aproximatley two minutes of what appeared to be random motion, the object suddenly flew away into the distance until it was no longer visible. At this point, my friends and I were positive that what we saw was not a plane/helicopter/weather ballon due to the apparent high velocity the object was able to reach in such a short amount of time, and the complexity of its movement. My emotions at this time were shock, excitement, and amazement of what I had just seen. After the object had been gone for about 6 minutes, it suddenly reappeared very close to us, approximatly 50 yards above our car. After flying around the area for for about a minute, the object came to an abrupt stop above a residential area, about four blocks away from our car. At this point, we stopped the car and I was able to get a better look at the object. The ""light beam"" connection was actually a very well lit solid connection and dark window shapes could be made out on the smaller of the two triangles. I glanced down the street and noticed that several other cars had stopped to observe the object as well. After it hovered for a few seconds, it began to descend and landed on the ground. We immediatley tried to drive to where ! it had l anded, but could not find anything. The object had apparently dissapeared or become invisible upon landing. We searced the area where it appeared to have landed intensly for about a half and hour but could find nothing. Three helicopters arrived and appeared to be activley searching during the this time, and for the remainder of the night we could see/hear helicopters near the area of the sighting.

Above my house, there were several (over 100), star-like objects extrememly high in the atmosphere. The objects were moving much slower than conventional aircraft. This information is based on observations of comercial crafts in the PHX flight path. The objects were of varying sizes or at different altitudes making their size appear to be ether larger of smaller. The objects did not appear to change their formation. There were several clusters or groups with the balance seameing to be at predetermined distances. The objects moved from the North heading South over Luke airforce then turned sligtly South/East.

The first incident was the same day in November 2006 when the sightings were reported at O’Hare airport in Chicago, IL, although I didn’t realize this at the time. It was approximately 9:30 pm. I went outside to bring my dogs in for the night and saw an extremely bright yellow/orange light in the Southern sky over a corn field behind our property. We live in a rural area and there are very few lights at night, so it is very, very dark. Any light at all will stand out in our area. I had never seen a light in the sky like this before and thought for a minute that it might be a new street light that had been installed. However, it was too high in the sky to be a street light. I stared at the light for a minute or two and realized that it was moving closer to me and getting larger as it moved. I then realized that this was some sort of UFO. I actually could not tell what shape this object was, it just appeared to be the brightest light I had ever witnessed. It stopped moving and hovered approximately 200 feet in the air, maybe 100 yards from me. I had the distinct feeling that whatever this was, it knew that I was looking at it, and I felt it was looking at me. This object made no noise whatsoever. I kept listening for some sort of sound, thinking maybe it was a helicopter or something, but no sound at all. It hovered at this point for approximately 4-5 minutes then just disappeared into thin air. It did not move up, down, sideways or back. It just disappeared completely. Two days later I heard about the sightings at the Chicago airport and wondered if this could have been one of the objects that were seen there.  The second sighting was in April, 2007. I saw the same bright yellow/orange light at approximately 10:00 pm. It moved from West to Northeast. Again, I could not discern any detail of this object, only that it was very similar to the light I had witnessed in November, 2006. It moved at a very high rate of speed. This time, it did not hover but just continually moved across the sky. I have no other detail for this sighting.  The last sighting was approximately May 10, 2007. I was lying in bed looking out the window at 11:15 pm. I suddenly noticed the same bright, yellow/orange light in the Southern sky, again at the same spot I spotted the light in November. It hovered at approximately 100 feet or so for approximately 5 minutes. I then called my boyfriend into the room and he witnessed the same object. It hovered at the same spot for a while and we could see that the lights would dim to almost nothing, and then get bright again. From the angle I was seeing the object; it appeared to have 3 lights across the front. It appeared at this time to be round or cylinder shaped and I was seeing the front arc of the object. The object continued from bright to dim for approximately 5 minutes then began to move to the Northeast. When it reached the point that it was over the tree in our backyard, we could see that it wasn’t round at all, but triangular in shape. It didn’t seem to be moving all that fast and we ran to our front door and went out on the porch to watch the object continue moving to the Northeast. Up to this point, we heard nothing from this object. It made no sound at all. But, once it passed us to the Northeast we did hear a noise coming from the object. Something like the sound that comes from an airplane in the sky, however it wasn’t that loud. It was almost a swishing sound, not a rumbling sound. It continued to blink off and on and disappeared into the Northeast sky. The entire incident lasted maybe 15 minutes.  After witnessing this last object, I began to think about the first sighting I had. I wondered if the object I first encountered didn’t actually disappear into thin air, but simply turned its lights off as the last object had.  I have asked at our local gas station if anyone has ever reported seeing UFO’s in this area. I was told that occasionally people do report sightings. I have only lived in this area less than a year and do not know anyone personally to ask about sightings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was sitting in the car waiting for him to finish the interviews and take the pictures. I was staring at the sky and while doing so noticed an extremely bright light compared to the surrounding stars. We both decided that the light looked to be about 10,000 feet from the ground. This is merely an approximation and could be completely skewed. 	As I was looking at the light I noticed that it didn’t appear to be moving, and for how close it seemed to be, this was unusual to me. I watched it with growing interest and saw it slightly waver side to side, but only very slightly. It just looked like it was hovering. It was very bright, almost appearing to be a flood light. It then started to dim, and almost looked like it disappeared. I looked longer and realized that it was illuminating a cloud. I therefore decided that a cloud had passed in front of it. After about two minutes the object started to reappear, only it was a brick red color and very dull. It appeared to be the same size of the stars when it was not so brightly illuminated. Within thirty seconds the light had turned from red back to the previous white bright light. 	My fiancée had  returned to the car at this point and I told him about the object I had been looking at. We then decided to watch it longer, and moved locations to a darker parking lot. The object was in the North-west part of the sky towards the lower half. We watched it for another five minutes or so. I decided to call my mom in hope that she could find it and attempt to look at it with binoculars. Less than a minute after I called her and told her to go outside the light dimmed and then disappeared. It was 10:39 when the light disappeared. We watched it a little longer to see if it would reappear as it had done previously, but it didn’t appear to be doing anything.

The object in question was a spherical light, which started off a bit dull and muted, and quickly brightened. At its brightest it looked as though it were spinning, or had spinning lights.  It then turned an orange-red color and disappeared. A few minutes later it reappeared in a different spot. It started off dull and then brightened just like the first time.

I was riding my bicycle south on Treasure Island Road at 15:50 when I noticed a large cylindicral craft in the sky somewhat ahead of me. From my angle of view I estimate it was over the James River and aligned towards the SSE. Visibility was a little hazy, but otherwise conditions were very good ( I was wearing prescription,  polarized sunglasses and they allow me to see through haze quite well). There were a few high, scattered clouds and I could tell the craft was below the clouds. At first I thought it was a jet airliner. This is a common enough sight in our area, so I really didn't give it much thought at first. But the longer I looked at it, the more I realized that it wasn't behaving the way an airliner would. For one thing, it was barely moving. An airliner would have traversed a good piece of sky in the time I watched it. The other odd thing is that I didn't see any wings or a tail section. It was a long cylineder, dull gray color and the body seemed to be marked by four, equidistant black lines. I stopped my bike to get a better look at it. Because this is the 400th anniversary of the Jamestowne settlement my next thought was that it was some kind of military aircraft (the POTUS is due to be here on Sunday and security is very high). But it was not a fighter craft, or a helicopter, or a dirigible, or anything else I could recognize. Off to my right I did see a low-flying miliatry helicopter near Jamestown Island, but it was moving away from my position. It was probably part of the security arrangements for the weekend's festivities. I kept my eye on the cylinder for another minute or so and then it just vanished! One moment it was there and the next it was gone. I scanned the sky for another couple of minutes, but there was nothing there.  I don't know if it moved off faster than my eyes could track it, or whether it had indeed disappeared. It was quite extraordinary.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,37.305810900473936,-76.73795308056873

It was a very clear day with blue skies and little to no clouds, in the middle of the afternoon.  My 7-year old daughter and I had just finished shooting a model rocket several times and had no more engines left, so we sat down under some trees to relax before making the walk back to our car. My daughter joked that perhaps we would see a UFO since I had spotted some unknown object(s) in the sky at the same place, roughly two years ago, when we'd been flying kites. It, unfortunately, has become a family joke.  As we sat under the trees, she joked about some flying insects being UFOs and pointed to a passing jet or two. After a minute or so, she pointed and said, ""What is that white ball following that jet?"" I looked at the commercial jet that was flying overhead, and there was what appeared to be a ball of white vapor alongside the jet's vapor trail.  This ball of what appeared to be white smoke or vapor was about the same width as the jet itself, or perhaps a little wider.  The odd thing was that this ball appeared to be following the jet. It did not stay stationary in the sky as if it were just part of the vapor trail. Instead, it followed alongside the vapor trail behind the jet, traveling at what appeared to be the same speed as the jet, maintaining a constant distance.

This was not a huge surprise as I was the only one facing north. The sky was still quite light to the northwest and there were small scattered high clouds in the sky. From what I remember the light appeared to be well in front of the clouds, so I do not think it was a meteor. I have never seen a meteor at dusk. If it was a meteor, it was perhaps the brightest one that I have ever seen and it had a greenish tint to it. I would say it had a magnitude of brightness perhaps 5 times as bright as Mars when it is the closest to earth. I watch the Seattle skyline when I go out for walks in the evenings and am familiar with the flight patterns and the lights on the helicopters and airplanes flying above Seattle. I actually scan the skyline for any unusual moving lights or objects. The normal lights move at a snails pace compared to this light. This light just showed up out of nowhere, then disappeared. I have never seen a light moving like this above Seattle or any sky anywhere.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

Usually the airplanes I see leave some lead time between their flight path but these two lights were one directly behind the other. It seemed impossible. After we noticed them they appeared stop for a second and then the one in front started moving while the second one didnt seem to move. I remember that my boyfriend looked at me and  said - is it not moving or is it me? As we continued to watch and the second light started to move but now in a totally different flight path. I continued to watch and thought my eyes were playing tricks on me because I thought I saw was sparks coming from the tail of the plane. I kept blinking my eyes to try to focus on what I was seeing. I watched until I didnt see them any more. A couple things to note are there was absolutely no sound which is unusual for planes we usually see/hear in our area and the lights were blinking white, red and green which to me looked like airplane lights.

The noise was obviously a helicopter and I confirmed this when I looked at it with binoculars. The helicopter was a pitch black color against the dark bluish/black sky. The helicopter flashed white lights non-stop, repeatedly. It moved around in circles for about 15 minutes making less than 20 revolutions, over my neighborhood and the surrounding neighborhood. I'm guessing other people were looking out and wondering why a helicopter was flying about and making so much noise at this time of the night and especially in a huge area of land that is mostly residential zone (off of the Bothell Everett Highway/164th St). The helicopter finally flew away after 15 minutes towards the direction of where the Bothell Everett Highway would be. Now, there is a FEMA/Army Reserve base near Bothell. My first thought was troops doing training exercises with helicopters. However, why over a residential area and why circle a specific area for ~15 minutes? What did the repeating flash of the white light mean? My next thought was the traffic or weatherman or something. The 11 o'clock news was almost finished though and in my opinion I don't think you could've seen I-5 or I-405 from where the helicopter was. Probably nothing?

At first glance I wrote it off as a star or a planet, and then I noticed two more bright objects. I have always been into astronomy and this was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I was deeply excited so I raced home and ran outback and the object that was in the upper left had disappeared but the middle and the bottom right one was still there. At this point I ran in and got my Step Sister and her friend to confirm that this was not a star by just showing them what I was looking at and they too were struck with a since of confusion as to what it was. The one that was in the bottom right hand corner had moved up above the center one and started to move towards the north. While the center object appeared to stand almost still in the sky, moving only slightly but in such a way to suggest that it was not just moving due to the rotation of the earth. They appeared as bright objects and looked like they had a triangle shape to them similar to a stealth bomber. I know that there is a bombing range and an urban training center just about twenty or so miles in the direction that they where in which is east relative to Seymour. But I am certain that they were not because I have observed the flight habits of them at air shows and my stepsister grew up in an air force family and she was convinced that it was unlike anything she had ever seen. Short list of details... During the observation we saw many aircraft pass through the sky (aprox. 4-7). There was a blur around the objects. I went in to get my telescope and it is when I came out that the second one had started to move away. I was only able to get a quick glimpse of the middle object because it seemed to move every time I would get it in my sighting scope before I looked through the scope.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,38.9385,-85.8896

It has red and white blinking lights, possibly on opposite sides of the object, so it makes it a little difficult to tell in which direction it's travelling at ny one point.  After watching carefully this evening, however, the object, which appeared to the south and west of Holt, very high in the sky, was moving in such a jerky and erratic fashion that it drew my attention.  It wasn't moving straight at all, but seemed to be moving from side to side in a zig zag pattern, like someone crossing over stepping stones to cross a creek.  It moved from SE to NW, then veered off E, then N.  Like I said, I've seen something like this several times before.  I usually sit on my back porch in the evening to smoke a cigarette (have a grandbaby in the house, so I don't smoke around her).  And NO, I wasn't smoking anything else:-).  Anyway, this has begun to puzzle me, so I looked up several key words on the internet, and am surprised there don't seem to be any regular explanations to them.  Couldn't it be like a satellite or a surveillance vehicle (not that THAT would be a comfort...)?  At one time, I could have sworn I saw one of these blinking red and white light things do a U-turn in the sky, but don't think that's possible, going at that velocity!  I see these at least several times a week, so I'm inclined to believe there's a good explanation--I just don't have a clue what it might be.  It's so high in the sky, and must be moving so fast to proceed across as it does--I just can't explain how something moving that fast could change course so quickly.

That was my first impression, given that the illumination from the object appeared to flare up, and then begin to subside, much the way an Iridium satellite is seen to do.  Then, however, perhaps 2-3 seconds after the flare subsided, the reflection flared up a second time, such that the second flare was brighter than the first.  This surprised me, since I had never seen an Iridium satellite flare more than once.  Not knowing what the object was, I recorded the time, and then immediately checked the www.Heavens-Above.com website for Iridium flares, and discovered that it had, indeed, been the International Space Station that I had observed.  Perhaps there are more items attached to the ISS framework that create a “double flare” effect, but in the dozens, or hundreds, of times that I have witnessed an overflight of the ISS, I have never observed that effect.  In fact, I have never witnessed the reflection albedo from the ISS to fluctuate, at all, until it has flown into the Earth’s shadow.  The sky was crystal clear, at the time of the sighting, so variable light overcast probably was not the cause of the variation in illumination.  I will observe the ISS on subsequent nights, in order to determine whether this is a normal phenomenon.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,47.42069999999999,-118.3997

It appeared to either be a silver object very far away relecting the sunlight, or perhaps a plane with its landing light strongly shining in my direction.  The object appeared from my perspective to be stationary in the sky at about 20 degrees above the horizon.  I assumed is was a plan eith traveling toward me (explaining the landing/running lights shining brightly) or it was traveling away from me.  Either way, it appeared to be still in the sky from my vantage.  I watched it between races at the meet for 3 - 4 minutes, just thinking about what it could be.  (Some track meets are boring.)  When the next 100 meter ruace began, I watched the race, then looked back at the spot in the sky where I had seen the reflection just 30 seconds before.  Nothing was there.  No relection, no lights, nothing.  I continued to search above the spot, below, right and left.  Nothing.  No trees were obstructing my view; I was looking across the spur of the track marking the spot of the object above some natural landmarks on the horizon.

Then suddenly a star (my perception) come to the partition of the sky I was looking at and then it was moving horizontally, parallel to the ground. It looked bright somewhat like an extra star with a bit more of brightness. It moved straight, parallel and horizontal if the partition is considered as a view plane.

At first I thought it to be a star or planet but then realized it was much too early.  The sun, albeit low on the horizon, was still up. While laying on my back with a small pair of binoculars I watched for some 10 more minutes.  The object still appeared as a point of a bright white/blue light.  I couldn't hold the binoculars steady enough to make out a shape. At times it appeared slightly circular but I can't be certain of that point. I briefly pulled the binoculars away to watch with the naked eye.  All this while the object was ever so slowly drifitng toward the northwest.  After perhaps a minute the object winked out.  I quickly resumed the observation with the binoculars and found that the single point of light had seperated into two points of light. These two points were moving away from one another.  Within the next 30 seconds I lost the visuals altogether. I thought this might be a high altitude weather balloon so I started a search on the San Francisco/Monterey National Weather Service.  By chance I checked the the Short Range Composite Radar Loop and noted that there were 4 very strange echoes detected at frames 16:27 (PST), 16:37, 16:46, and 16:56 on the MUX radar.  The echoes were detected to the west and had a generally northern movement.  I couldn't save the radar images but I did manage a screen print of the 16:27 image. I then checked the winds aloft on the NWS website and found that the winds from the surface up to 42,000 feet were all generally blowing NW to SE.  So if this was a balloon it had to be much, much higher in the atmosphere where the wind was blowing in the opposite direction.  I then sent an email to the Answers@NOAA describing the situation and if they might think it to be a very high altitude balloon. They had no idea. So I'm sending this along to you.  Later that same evening when Orion rose over the horizon I tried using the stars Rigel and Aldeberan to estimate the approximate positions of this light and it's motion through the sky.  By this rough estimation I concluded that the object was first seen at about +5 degrees declination (above the ecliptic). It then drifted roughly -1 hour of right acension to about +15 degrees declination over the course of 15 minutes. Sorry that's the best I can do, and moreover I was home alone.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,37.1615,-122.1514

It continued into what appeared to be a north to south path.  It was a horizontal trajectory, low to the ground. No higher then the small Mountains to the west.  It appeared to be almost over the neighbor’s house approximately 200 yards to the west (I will contact them tomorrow to see if they saw it as well.)   If I held out my arm fully extended with an old silver dollar that would be close to the size.  It did not travel at an approaching angle like a shooting star does. No vapor trail.   I would say I saw it for about 4 seconds, I then ran into the house and shouted at my mother,  ""Look out the window, look out the window, look out the window!""  She was on the phone with her friend And said, ""I have to go Doug does thinks there is a UFO.""   I didn’t even say there is a UFO she could just read my body language and my concern.   She hung up and turned around to look through the window, and  ""of course"" by that time there was no sign off it.  However there were some obstructions such as an old vine and some trees in the path.  All I know is I have never seen a shooting star that big (and blue) and fly across the sky so horizontally to the ground.  I mean it was super close to the ground flying from north to south (I live 20 miles west of Portland Oregon). I usually see a shooting star leaving a trail, and this did not.  I mean it was HUGE!  I know the world is going nuts over what happened at O’Hare and I am not jumping on the bandwagon, but OMG I have never seen something like that.  It was also silent, therefore, it could not be some conventional jet. Interestingly, I know two people involved with the disclosure Project (I am not a UFO nut btw, well at least not till now). I call this a UFO Because I cannot identify it.  In addition, I was completely sober, just having a nice warm cup of green tea.  I am skeptical of just about everything, and I like to believe that nearly everything can be explained by science, and reason  this I cannot.

I  am a non drinker, nor drug user.  I work for a church and have never seen what I considered a UFO, though I do believe such phenomena exist.   On Jan 6, 2007 at approximately 11:25 PM, I was standing in my backyard when I looked directly southward into the sky and noticed what appeared to be brighter than normal airplane or helicopter lights. It was approximately 4 miles south and about 800-1000 feet off the ground.  At first, I thought maybe it might be a blimp coming in my direction so the display would be on its eastern facing side. But as I watched the lights I saw that it was moving faster than a blimp would and it seemed to turn to the west and sit stationary with 6-8 white lights in a circular to square configuration. The lights alternated from all white to red.   Having seen numerous airplanes being situated in the airplane flight path to Sky Harbor Airport, I observe that most aircrafts have 2 flight lights in the center with one red and one green light on the end of the wings.  These lights I witnessed seemed more brilliant than normal and the manner in which it flew was unlike any aircraft I had ever seen.  It seemed to float in a circular pattern and also moved directionally slightly to the east and then west and up and then down before it turned and headed west.   At this point I went inside to tell my friend to see this.  Her report has been sent in also.   We immediately came out and as I was describing to her what I saw, we both saw in the south west sky approximately 1-2 miles off, a glowing object seemingly hanging in the sky about 40-60 feet in width.  I don’t know if this was the same object or a second one as I had gone in the house for about 30 seconds to get my friend.  It didn’t appear to be a helicopter or airplane.  It appeared to turn on its left side and I saw a bright singular light and 4-6 smaller lights surrounding it in a ring shape pattern.  Although dark in the sky, I could see that it was an aircraft with a shape unlike an airplane.  It moved without any engine sound or propeller sound.

BR did maintenance on all radar on the Albany including SPS30, SPS43, SPS39, SPS10, TACAN, and airborne early warning (AEW).

Not sure if it was 8pm to Midnight or Midnight to 4am watch. Russian Bear aircraft had recently been seen in the area and the 6th fleet was on lookout for maneuvers involving Russian aircraft and trawlers (electronic spy boats disguised as fishing boats). ((initials deleted--witness)) and air traffic controllers were watching 3 bogies on radar, but had no visual contact.  Bogies did not respond to any communication.  They were following fleet at distance of 40-50 miles for over an hour at approximately the speed of the fleet. Decision was made to scramble three jets, possibly F4 phantoms (BR is not sure).  Jet pilots radioed back jet speed on the order of 1350 KTS.  Jet pilots did not get visual on bogies.  ((initials deleted)) could see bogies on SPS30 in height finding radar. It was not normal to have air traffic controllers in CIC (Combat Information Center) at night.  They were officers and would normally be asleep, but controllers did arrive due to unusual occurrence this night. The Albany used SPA33 Plan Position Indicator display units for multiple radar systems on the Albany but this system did not link into other ships in the fleet.  The important point being that a malfunction of the Albany’s radar system would not affect other ships. The task force mission was to protect the air craft carrier.  They were protecting from sub attacks. ((initials deleted--witness)) does not remember the aircraft carrier name. The aircraft carrier also reported three bogies on their independent on-board radar. Albany’s radars were set on sector scan to focus on bogies. The jets reported over the radio that they had radar contact with bogies. Jets never got closer than 20 miles (thus no visual?). Jets move about 1/4 inch per radar sweep at 1350 knots.  The bogies began to move away in approximately 3/4 inch jumps per sweep.  Bogies maintained triangular formation.  Bogies disappeared from radar within 7 sweeps. Jets were still visible on radar. Officer of the watch was present talking the Albany’s air traffic controllers. Jets still in flight broke off pursuit and turned back to the air craft carrier. Radar went back to full 360 scan.  Radar operators were to keep a lookout for similar aircraft/bogies. The two air controllers (lieutenant two bars) smiled at each other and one turned to BR and said, ""this incident never happened.""

This small cloud had a straight lightening bolt from its center going to the ground.  When the lightening bolt ended, the television static and the starting noise ended.  This bolt of lightening reappeared 3 times and lasted for about 5 to 10 seconds each time with a 15 seconds delay between them.

The sky was clear that night with no other clouds in the sky but this very low strangely illuminated cloud.  It was very eerie!  A couple of months later in November, during our Thanksgiving holiday school break, my brother and I decided to venture into the National Forrest and look for some kind of clue to what this could have done to the ground or the trees in the forest. We found an approximate three foot diameter by twenty foot deep hole in the ground.  The edges were straight as if a plug had been removed from the earth.  There was no loose dirt or rocks in or around the hole.  No sign of the dirt that was removed.  There were three triangle shaped pad prints, approximately one foot in size embedded into the ground around the hole at equal spaces.  This hole in the ground was among the trees where a vehicle could not get into and at that time there was no road access into that part of the forest. My Dad informed the local Forest Ranger, who was another neighbor, to find out if this hole in the ground was some project the Forest Service had going.  He went to investigate because he had no knowledge of any kind of operation going on in the forest.  When he went to investigate, he put a fence up around the hole to keep game animals from falling into the hole becoming trapped as he found had already happened.  He was amazed of this and called the Sheriff.  No one ever came up with an explanation or figured out what had taken place there. I was only 10 years old at the time and I can still remember this as if it happened yesterday.  My Dad, the neighbor, and the Forest Ranger have all since passed away.  I am sure this hole still remains in the forest with no explanation of how it got there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Multiple following sightings. Returning home to Yakima winding up I-82 south of Ellensburg, WA, I noticed many lights in the sky moving below the low cloud cover to the west of me. I-82 climbs a large ridge a few miles south of Ellensburg. It was a very dark night so the many various color light stood out. When they first caught my attention they were a few miles away from my position. The clouds cover was solid and low over the Umtanum Hills. I watched them with interest as I continued winding up the highway which goes over this ridge. My memory is of alternate red, yellow, green, and white lights in a circle with no specific pattern of appearance or distance between. At first I thought it might be helicopters from the US Army Firing Center but the lights had no familiar pattern that I could identify. My curiosity caused me to stop my car on the shoulder so I could study the object. At first I just rolled down my window expecting I might hear the familiar sound of the helicopters (which is what I tried to convince myself it must be). Hearing no sound, I then shut off the ignition, turned out my lights and then eventually stepped out of my car. I do not remember seeing another car on the highway going in either direction. There was a light wind blowing from the direction of the lights and I strained to hear any sounds. There was none except that of the wind. The UFO moved slowly on a level plane north of the ridge. Now as the lights got closer I could see it was large and I got more frightened as it got closer. now I knew I was seeing my first UFO.It was approaching slowly but steadily in my direction. There was no decernable sound at all coming from the UFO. I wanted to get back in my car and speed away but I didn't want to draw attention to myself. I now shivered in the wind but was afraid to open the car door to show any lights. The object seemed to stop directly above me for a few moments. The sky was black with clouds.  It did not appear to be a perfect circle but neither could I say it was eliptical. Size of the UFO would only be a guess because I really didn't know how high above me it hovered but its size as I saw it there would have more than spanned the 1/2 of the freeway I was traveling, maybe 300 feet end to end as I saw it. I strained to see more but all I could make out were the lights which I guessed was the perimeter of the UFO. The lights were constant and not flickering. Soon it proceeded its tract to my east and eventually moved over the ridge south where I lost sight of it. As soon as it was out of sight I got in my car and raced up the highway wanting to get over the ridge and get another look at it. As I drove I couldn't help but wonder what the hell I saw, and then began to wonder how long this experience had taken. I hadn't thought to check the time. I got to the top and started down the other side of the ridge. As soon as I got to an open area where I could scan the area, I stopped my car and scanned the sky. About 1 mile further down the road from this point is a military parking and staging area. The UFO was not visible but I noticed what looked like the 2 red tail light bars of an older Ford T-Bird in the sage brush beyond the parking area. I thought it odd that a car would be where it was when the two lights suddenly seperated and in an instant went different directions over the hill away from me (a distance I guessed at being about 2 miles away). Struck in awe at this second sighting, I sat there a while longer. A couple minutes later I saw two lights going through the brush in the same approximate location as the previous lights had disappeared. These lights looked like they were the lights of 2 motorcycles, like 2 riders were racing each other through the brush, except that 1 light disappeared down out of sight and the other shot straight up and dissappeared in the night sky. I sat here for maybe 15-20 minutes wondering if I might see something more before I proceeded south toward home in Yakima. As I was going down a slow grade toward a bridge which spans what I think is called Indian Creek I couldn't help but notice the area was well lighted. I stopped just short of the bridge. Up the creek to the west, hidden from my direct view I could see the area was well lighted, almost like Las Vegas was just around the bend. I was tempted to jump over the fence and climb the hill to see what was happening. This is government property well posted and part of the Firing Center so I decided it had to be a military operation. I proceeded home it was now about 2:30. I called the Army Base, asked for the duty officer and reported the lights and activities up Indian Creek, asking if there were any military exersizes going on. He said there were none. I left out the UFO part afraid they might figure I was a nut. The duty officer said he would send someone to investigate and promissed to get back to me. The following day I called and asked for the same officer and was told there was no such person ever on that base. There was no record of my report and no investigation was noted. In retrospect, it is about 35 miles between Ellenburg and Yakima on that highway. What would have normally been a 1/2 hour drive took me about 2 - 2 1/2 hours. It didn't seem like I was there that long but I can't honestly tell you how long I watched the first UFO or how long it stood over me. I went from curiousity to awe to fear and then finally relief.

One evening we were entertaining several people and happened to look out over the city and saw a huge fireball coming directly toward the city from the mountains across the valley.  It was travelling slowly, in a straight line and appeared to hang over Bogota for quite a while.  We noticed on either side of the city, coming up just over the lip of the mountains, a craft which would travel vertically up and down as if checking on the ball.  The ball travelled backwards towards the far end of the valley, began to descend and changed from red to white while descending.  For a two week period after that, at the same time every evening, we would see three craft come up over the lip of the mountains and one would come in and hang over the city.  It would be there one minute, then blink out as if you had turned off a light switch, then come on again. It would do all kinds of crazy loops and turns.   It would always travel back to the mountains in a straight line, and when it would descend behind the mountain ridge, would start to change color.  I watched this for 2 weeks and never forgot it.  The fireball was so big is seemed to be right over the city and you could see the heat emanating from it.  We checked the papers the next day but there was no story.  We think we saw this because we happened to be living in a tall apartment building.  I have never forgotten it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As I was cooking some sausages on the barbeque I noticed a very small but slow moving object directly above us. It was moving in the East direction. It appeared just as a light. I thought at the time that it would be a satelite as aeroplanes have both red and white lights blinking while flying. As it dissapeared in the East direction. I noticed another object moving at the same speed heading in the North direction. This object was moving at the slow same speed but was brighter. I told my friend to look up and check it out. As we were watching it, the object sped up and dissappeared. My friend didn't know what it was and neither did I at that moment. As we were speaking about the idea that it could be a spaceship or UFO, my friend just had is eyes pealed to the sky.  As I was finished with the cooking, my friend noticed something brighter directly above the house. It was very bright of white light, like lightening light during a storm. As the object seemed to get lower and lower above his house we noticed that the light that was coming from this UFO was reflecting its light off the street and houses. The UFO made no sound, unlike helicopters or aeroplanes do. My friend grabbed his video comera and filmed as much as he could. I was amazed too. It would of been about 3-4hundred metres away and shining brightly over us. I thought it was an angel of light but my friend was convinced that it was a UFO. It moved very slowly and headed in a Northerly direction. It was brighter than a night of a full moon on a clear night. We watched the object move north slowly and watched it dissappear over the horizon. Since then my friend always carries his video camera at night and believes that we were visited by UFO's. I told him that even though they may seem like they come from another planet that they could come from Earth. To this very day, my friend and eye meet up regulary and watch the footage he filmed over a case of beer, wondering if something like that would ever happen again.

I even called a friend on the phone who lives a few doors down, but he didn't hear anything because of the volume of his TV.  I have heard something exactly like this several times before over the years in the Santa Clara Valley, and surmised that it could have been the NASA Ames wind tunnel that was producing it. That's what I had read in the newspaper and saw reported on TV previously when I had heard this same kind of sound in years past.  Also, there is/was? a rocket motor test facility south of San Jose that could also be capable of producing this same kind of noise.  I'm not sure if either the wind tunnel or this rocket test facility are still currently in operation, but they both could be possible explanations for these sounds. Also, I thought it might possibly a loud jet engine at the airport, not following anti-noise procedures.

At first I didn't think anything of it then I began thinking; when I see airplanes at night flying overhead there are only two lights flashing, one on each wing, and both are colored white.  Well the lights on the aircraft where of different colors, and where flashing rapidly, faster than I have ever seen an  airplane lights flash.  Also, the where flashing in different orders; such like the red would flash, then the blue, then yellow, then white; all at random choice it seemed.

(on Highway 71), an unusually bright single light appeared 50 degrees up from my line of sight, near the top of a cluster of clouds. As it became the total focus of my attention, another light of the same type appeared at its right hand side, and then another, and then finally a fourth, creating a perfect straight line. The four lights were the exact same size, same distance from each other (each void space was equivalent to 5 diameters of one light), and had a delay time of two seconds between new illuminations, and moved in unison, as though attached to each other.  At this time, my mind flashed back to images of the ""Phoenix Lights"" witnessed a couple years ago. This grouping looked the suspiciously the same.  The lights did not illuminate in an ""instant on"" fashion. They came into view more like high pressure gas lights -- it was a sudden, almost gaseous, burst of light that took a half second or so to evolve to a 100% brightness. The plane of these lights was diagonally tilted with the left hand side lower, and slowly dipped into the clouds as I drove toward it. Because of the cloud's interference, I couldn't determine if there was second side suggesting a shaped outline, a la the Phoenix Lights.  I figured the only way I was going to see the configuration as a whole was to race past the cloud bank and hope it would still be there. I misjudged. After driving for several minutes, I realized that the clouds were much farther away than I had estimated. The bar of lights eventually moved completely behind them and disappeared. In retrospect, I should have stopped and exited my vehicle for observation.  The cloud bank distance made me consider how huge these lights must have been for they seemed so large at my viewing distance. Each was several hundred times larger in diameter than the brightest star in the sky. Though much distant commercial flight activity could be seen, there appeared to be no military aircraft in the vicinity.  Was it a craft? Were they military flares? Who knows. But it was nice to have witnessed such a well known Arizona-style configuration as my first sighting...",2006-12-07T00:00:00,34.63572068965517,-112.5686275862069

As I was reading in bed I saw a speck of white light going across the sky through the mirror, so I put my book down and looked out the window to watch it, and sure enough, it wasn't an airplane like I originally thought it was. As I watched, it flew west at about the speed of an airplane and then it started going in the opposite direction. It didn't stop or turn, it just all of a sudden started going east instead of west. Then, after it was behind the tree in my neighbor's backyard it stopped. I was still able to see it through the branches and after it hovered there for a couple minutes I ran and woke my parents up so they could see it, too. The three of us watched it for about twenty minutes, and it was moving very slowly east. Its speed was almost unnoticeable, east. After about twenty minutes the clouds came and covered the UFO so we couldn't see it anymore. My parents went back to sleep but I stayed up watching to see if the clouds would thin out enough to see it again. After I'd waited ten minutes the UFO turned red and continued on its eastward journey at its original speed. It seemed to have grown about twice its original size, but that might just be because it changed color and became brighter. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.

Okay, it all started when I was on my rooftop.  I had my binoculars with me (if it weren’t for the binoculars, I wouldn’t have seen this object.)  I was viewing a large plane with them that was high in the sky (either a Boeing 767 or 777).  As I was following it, then it happened.  The time was approx. 2:50 PM. I spotted this weird looking circle craft in the sky (it looked like it was supposed to be a disk) but it was changing because the outline of the craft had wrinkles in it.  It continued to make these weird outlines by wrinkling the outline of the craft.  The craft had no sound (that’s the common thing for all UFOs).  The color looked like a silver color.  The size, well, if it was on the edge of space, then it must have been something pretty massive for me to only see with my binoculars.  I checked the binoculars for debris, but none was present.  It wasn’t a reflection because this “craft” entered my binoculars.  I am familiar with the way weather balloons look in the sky (perfectly circle, white, going up pretty fast).  But this was no weather balloon.  It wasn’t a perfect circle or completely white.  It was what I said up there.  I also know it was not a shopping bag because even a slight bit of wind could not carry it that high or keep it hovering like that.  It was way up there because when the plane passed by it, then the object was behind the plane.  It came from behind the plane (not by itself, but by the plane moving).  I took the binoculars off my eyes, and I couldn’t see the object with my naked eye.  I tried to find it again, but I lost the object.  It wasn’t a balloon because later, for another 10 seconds, I saw it.  A balloon wouldn’t stay for another 15 minutes (I had come outside later). Later, at approx. 3:15PM (25 minutes later), I went back outside and looked in the sky with my binoculars at another, smaller airliner.  The smaller airliner was just as high as the other plane was earlier.  The object came into the screen again, only this time, much higher.  It was in the same spot as it was earlier.  It was doing pretty much the same things as it was earlier.  It looked like it was slowly but surely going up.  The sighting ended after that.  	I never thought that I would see anything like this.  I have heard many things on the news, but I didn’t believe some of them.  I did, however, see the Stephenville, Texas sightings in January on the news.  I believed it.  The only thing that made it hard to believe was when the object returned, they reported 2 noisy fighter jets chasing the noiseless, triangular craft at high speeds.  I don’t know if that part is true.  I have believed in UFOs ever since I was younger.  What made me believe in them was when I heard about a case on the news or something.  I believe that some of them are either ET, angels, or something like that.  I don’t know why they are here.  If this was a real craft, then this is amazing.  This is all that I have to say about this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was just staring at Orion, when off to the left, East, I noted a star with 2 very bright companions.  At first I did a double take - there had been no pair of bright stars there all night, as I had been out since 6:30pm and it was now after 8pm EST.  The lights were separated consistently by the same distance, to an observer, it would be about 200 or 300 ft in length, if it were one object, with a light in the 'front' and one in the 'back'.  These two lights were separated like stairs, one slightly above the other, but they moved very very slowly, and in tandem, making me think it was one object but its edges were not quite visible to complete its form.  The issue for me, that made me sit up and really stare hard, was the fact that at first, I thought it was a constellation.  I wasn't even sure it was moving, or they were moving.  Then the distance between the two lights moving together away from a near by star made it apparent.  But the distance between the lights did not alter, nor the -----   ___  stair like separation.  There was no sound, but it was not that close, I would say 10,000 ft up and quite a way off.  There was no blinking or other colors other than white, with a very faint hint of blue on the outside of the white lights.  They moved slowly, much too slowly for a plane, and the lights were about double the size of the nearby star, but brighter by a degree or so than any of the stars in the sky or in nearby Orion.  It moved very slowly from North To South for approximately 8 seconds and then seemed to dematerialize, or slowly dim and shut off.  It did NOT travel far enough to dim due to distance.  Not at all.  And for the last two weeks there has been persistent small aircraft, general aviation Cessna, circling and circling West Lake and points right around my house, like never before, and I am a flight sim buff and can recognize most aircraft.  I don't know if that has any connection to the lights, but o! ne thing did change.  The aircraft for the last two weeks circled DIRECTLY over my lake, in about a 5 sq. mile circle, approximately 5,000 ft of altitude, unusual for my area, because most general aviation aircraft, A.) are lower, ready to land, or having just taken off from North Perry Airport, 2.5 miles to the southeast of the lake, and B.) traffic slows to the airport after sunset, and after 9pm, I believe only has its facility operating with the tower unmanned.  It is unusual to see a Cessna type aircraft circling for so many hours, sometimes up to 4 hours, and ONLY after sunset.  I thought perhaps it was nighttime IFR training for student Pilots, but I am not sure, because tonight, that plane was about 2 miles further west, and cirlcing.  It circles clockwise for about an hour or so, and then reverses for a couple hours.  Tonight, right after the lights I saw, the craft switched its circular pattern, from Clockwise to Counter-Clockwise, AND it shifted directly over my house, and where I was laying, on a blanket, out in the yard, much closer to where the lights I had seen, had appeared.  The plane directly shifted, right after the lights.  And it stayed in this pattern for another hour or so.  It also shifted in the middle of that time, to the opposite heading, clockwise again.  I have no idea what to think of the plane, other than the lessons theory.  Unless it is an observer flight, or something?  I do not know what I saw, but it had no lights like a plane (no wings, nose, rudder shape), and was so slow, no plane could have stayed up in the sky, it would have stalled.  Furthermore there were no flashing lights and no colored lights.  The light was about twice the size of the star near it, but several times more bright.  And it was silent and moved in tandem, or was one body, with 2 lights.  And it evaporated, dimmed rapidly and was no more.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,26.0032,-80.2239

At that time we both walked out the front door and noticed the orange glow of a hovering craft in the SE sky.  The light did not flicker like a plan or helicopter.  From the glow you could see the shape of the craft that almost looked cross shaped.  The craft hovered in the same position for a few minutes and then disappeared into the sky in the SE direction. My mom then informed me the news from what she saw.  When she was in the backyard is when she saw the object appear from the horizon in the SW, soundless she thought this was odd. The craft lifted up she said and then accelerated to the East.  At that point the craft shot through the sky at an unimaginable rate she said, like firework speed, but from a distance.  When we both saw the object from the front yard she thought it was impossible that something could start and stop in mid flight. Again, I only saw the craft hovering, however this was not a star, helicopter, balloon, or airplane.  I have never seen anything like this and I am sure there has to be other reports.

It was a triangle shaped craft with lights on the tips of the triangle. The lights were a mix of these colors, red, maroon, orange and yellow. The body of the craft was black. It came from the west and was moving east. It was large, it was bigger than any airplane or I had ever seen and it made a small humming noise. The size of the craft would have been he size of a baseball field. The craft was able to distort radio waves and cell phone frequencies. It caused a lot of static on radios and on my cell phone. There were chirping noises coming from my radio in the static. My cell phone had a lot of static. I was on the phone with a family member telling him about it and he may have seen it. It was able to mess with any electrical appliances that were left on. It had my watch on my hand going off the fritz. The second hand kept spinning forward and eventually stopped after it left. My camera even had static on it. I am mailing what I saw on the camera lcd screen. It looked like they were hailing me on my camera like on the show star trek.

The cats circled me as I was gazing at the object. The object was slowly moving over my house and there was another flying object behind it and it was much smaller like a manmade aircraft chasing it. That aircraft did not make any sound and when it came close to the UFO it left for approximately one hour. I had sent in an earlier report and I mixed up the times by three hours.

The objects were appoximately egg-shaped, although it was hard to tell because of their speed, and their brightness was approximately one-third of the moon.  They were about a third of the size of the moon, and the four were in a paralellogram formation, with the long ends facing east to west.  They resembled fighter planes flying in formation because of the relative movement to each other when they traveled, but the accelerated so quickly that no plane could ever go this fast.  The formation was about two times as long as the moon, and about one moon or less wide.  The objects were silent and appeared to be at a very high altitude, yet they accelerated very quickly and uniformly.  As soon as I looked up they began accelerating and in about 2 seconds they went from directly overhead to close to the horizon and out of sight.  A second later the other object to the north followed with the same acceleration and speed.  This other object seemed to take off from kind of a small curve, and then it followed a straight line.  The sky was completely clear so I know these couldn't have been reflections.  I know what meteors look like and I am certain these were not them.  Also, I have seen some of the fastest planes in the world flying overhead at low altitudes, and they were nowhere near as fast as the objects I saw on this night.

It was a very clear, starry night with a great deal of air traffic.  We were looking to the south, above the houses, at the stars.  We thought we were looking at a constellation, but upon closer observation, these two stars were moving in unison from east to west, approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon. They did not appear to be moving fast.  They appeared to be moving about the same as the other air traffic in the sky.  It took them 2 to 3 minutes to move across the sky, east to west.  They also appeared to be moving in the air corridor for take offs and landings from metro airport.  The two points of light were approximately 2 inches apart in the sky from our point-of-view and were arranged one above the other, with the top point of light lagging slightly behind the other.  They were points of light that both pulsed from white to red to purple to white again (the colors were not distinct and the light was not strong from our distance). There were no other lights or flashes associated with them like on a plane.  We watched these two points travel across the sky without their formation ever varying in the slightest.

I was looking towards McGregor range, a missle range north of El Paso.    There I saw what I thought was a large plane flying rather high over that airspace.  It was extremely bright in the pre-twilight evening. This is a flight area for planes landing at the internation airport in El Paso so I really did not think much about it.  I saw another jet fly below it.  The second jet was definitely coming towards the airport and even though it was approaching twilight, I could not see the landing lights. It was still too light outside.   I could see the form of the plane as a shadow. The second jet left a vapor trail.  This caused me to ponder and wonder how the plane flying higher did not leave any trail. I watched the  first craft and its glistening shape changed slightly to crescent as if it had turned to reveal its profile.  It seemed to have pivoted at the spot it was at.  It made no motion in relation to objects on the ground.  From my observation point - several miles from McGregor range - and having seen a commerial aircraft look like fly specks below this craft, I suddenly was aware I was looking at something extraordinary.  This thing seemed to be about 1/4 inch wide now from my front yard - but if it were higher than commerical airliners and further away, it had to simply be huge. A speck of light sudden flew up from the ground east of the crescent and appeared slammed into the crescent at an extremely high rate of speed. I've been involve in missles and I've never seen one as fast as this one.  The crescent seemed to absorb the speck.  I thought at first that it might have been a missle from McGreor, but having just seen a commerical plane in that airspace, that did not make any sense. McGreor would have closed off its airspace before any test firings.  Commerical traffic was still using this airspace.  There did not appear to be any materials falling away from the crescent shaped object as one might expect if it were hit with a missle. From my point of view, it appeared another speck of light came from just below the crescent and also slammed into the crescent. It was not as fast as the first, but still far beyond convential craft speeds.  I realized there was no vapor trail from the smaller speck. About that time, on the horizon appeared three vapor trails in formation that were rapidly approaching the area. I suspect they were from the near by airforce base, but that is nearly 100 miles from here.  They might have been from White Sands - a little closer.

Next we thought it was fireworks from one of the many nearby beach bars when my friend pointed out that the lights were moving far too quick to be fireworks.  As time went on the lights changed into fireballs with the one at the front flashing/burning brightly which made me think that maybe it's an aeroplane on fire and about to crash, leaving trail of burning fireballs behind it, some smaller, some bigger, in different colours.   By this time the entire port was looking at the sky (1000's of people).  There was no sound coming off these objects.

I just spoke with you (Peter Davenport) on the phone and you you seemed very busy and asked me to report what I saw online. So here is what happened. I live on the 1st floor of a 2 story house. I was in my bedroom with my girlfriend and my dog at around 3:45-4:00 a.m watching t.v. I am always up late . I was lying in bed with my girlfriend and my dog was acting really weird making all sorts of noise and barking and she is always very quiet at night. I figured she had to go outside to go to the bathroom. So, I took my dog outside my front door with my girlfriend to have a cigarette and let my dog out . My dog is very well trained like I said and was acting sort of strange and as soon as I opened the door my dog ran into my neighbor’s yard which is very unlike her. She usually stays in our yard and does her business in our yard. So, I ran off the porch to go get my dog and when I got her I noticed a light above my head about 2 streets down. When I looked up I saw a saucer shaped craft in the sky. It looked like it was about a football field and a half to two football fields high up in the sky. At first I thought it was a meteor coming down  until it just came to a complete stop. Also, how low it was to the ground it just seemed strange to me. Also, it was a strange color. Almost a color I have never seen before just lit up in the sky like a strange colored saucer lightbulb. I would describe the color as purplish orangish yellowish green, I know that sounds strange but it was glowing of all those colors and that’s the only way I can describe it . Anyway, as I said I thought it was a meteror until I really looked at it. It was very low to the earth and it was traveling in a strait line and then it just stoped and hovered in the sky . That’s when I got a very bad feeling and called my girlfriend over. This disk in the sky was going in a straight line and then it just stopped for like 10 seconds and hovered. Then it moved in a way I have never seen a plane or anything of that matter on this earth. After the craft went in the strait line then stopped it was moving almost at like 90 degree angles. It would move one way and then turn and go another way and th! en turn and go another way like it was on a street taking turns or something. for example it would turn right then move up in the sky and then turn left then move down. I have never seen any kind of plane or helicopter do this so i removed that explanation immeditly. So from the beginning, the craft went in a straight line like it was a meteor and then it just came to a complete stop, it hovered for around 10 seconds and then starting moving again in a hovering fashion and was hovering and taking strange turns. The craft  looked like it was one big light switching to different illuminating colors and after about 1 minute of watching it the light just turned off like it had a switch to appear and disappear and then it never re-appeared. It didn’t take off real fast like in the movies or anything or as one would think; it just turned off like a lightbulb. I went back into my house with my girlfriend and my dog and just had the creepiest strangest feeling. I was so creeped out I woke my roommate up but of corse just like my mother he didn’t believe me, even though he could see me and my girlfriend were so worked up. I wasn’t on any drugs or anything and I know I wasn’t hallucinating because my girlfriend saw it to along with my dog.  I have never believed in anything like this until I saw the craft this one night. I have not shared this and did not report it to the police because I didn’t want anyone to think I was crazy. Then I saw your show and saw all those other people with cases like mine and it jsut made me want you to know what i saw and know more about it. I  decided to call you and when you called me back I knew this was serious and thought i would write you a description of this ""craft"". I know there is something out there. Can you share with me what you think this is. I dont live close to any airports and i just know it was something not of this world.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,42.3533,-71.1883

After about 5 minutes one of the objects starting moving East and towards us. It was going semi-slow but it moved past us and we saw a disk shaped object with a yellow haze around it (maybe a forcefield?). It had red blinking lights with green non-blinking lights. That one went off into the darkness. We then started watching the other 2 lights, and one of them started to go northeast really fast and away from us. All of a sudden it turned blue and stopped and started to blink. We then paid attention to the other one that was not moving.

As this light got closer I realized that it was a yellow light and there were no flashing red, green or strobe lights visible.  Upon further observation as this object got closer I realized that this object was flying in a vertical position with yellow lights down the center and on vertical arms on both sides of the main body. The object changed directions slightly to the South West onto a heading of approx 210 degrees heading towards Orlando. Further to viewing this craft I observed that there was absolutely NO sound emitting from it.  This craft disappeared into the South West without appearing to speed up. Approximately a minute or so later I observed two more similar craft coming from the North.  These two craft followed the same flight path and were traveling at the same altitude and speed as the first one that I reported.  The only difference was that the second craft was not lit up near as much as the first one.  The third craft was lit up more than the second one but not as much as the first one. I have been observing commercial aircraft on a regular basis here in Florida and they fly overhead and continue south to Miami or Fort Lauderdale.  The three unidentified craft I observed last evening turned to the South West which was not the normal flight pattern for commercial aircraft.

The light was a yellow light.  The light started to flash slowly in and out.  Then the light went out and 2 amber lights came on.  They flashed for 20 seconds then the big yellow light came back on.  This figure was moving very slow in the sky.  Now its a very clear night with a full moon and absolutely no wind.  I ruled out that its not a plane because of how slowly its moving.  I figured it might be the coast guard or some sort of helicopter. The figure is over the water and moving in land.  I seen it move alittle to the right, then move back on its track.  I was on the phone with my girlfriend and telling her what I was seeing.  I told her to hang on a second.  I decided to go outside to see if I could hear what kind of craft it was.

So, its a full moon so I waited until it passed over the moons light, and noticed that it was the same size as a jet but there was no sound at all.  Also it was moving really slow!!  Theres no way it could be a jet.  It was kinda like a diamond shape.  Skinny looking front that got really wide.  It was flying extremely low.  My question is, Why was this figure flying so low, was very well lit up, and why didn't it make any noise??  I mentioned it to drivers in the area approximately the same time period, and they didn't see a thing.  It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen!  Seeing it didn't really scare me.

The lights stayed in our vision hovering over the water for almost ten minutes, at a time appearing to move closer to us. The reflection of the lights could be seen in the water, so it was apparently very close to the lake. The lights began to slowly fade, and then came back bright for an instant. Immediately afterwards right by the white lights two smaller bright red lights flashed, out of no where, disappeared, and then everything was gone. Also the whole incident was completely silent and no noise from the craft or anywhere else for that matter could be heard.  It may also be important to note that before the sighting, the friend I was with and I both watched on YouTube the ABC News report of a man called “Prophet Yahweh” who demonstrated or at least seemed to demonstrate the ability to summon UFOs. I know how this may sound but whether the clip was a complete hoax or not, the two of us went outside by the lake for the sole reason of wanting to spot a UFO, we did all the kind of believing and makeshift praying we could and after about 45 minutes and having somewhat given up, witnessed what was previously described.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,26.58139708890637,-81.84065302911094

Streaking object appears to stop and hover for several minutes,Bodega Bay,CA,2007-09-17T19:17:00,cigar,15 minutes,"Occurred : 9/17/2007 19:17  (Entered as : 09/17/07 19:17) Reported: 9/26/2007 7:39:56 PM 19:39 Posted: 10/8/2007 Location: Bodega Bay, CA Shape: Cigar Duration:15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58953.html,"Streaking object appears to stop and hover for several minutes My husband, my brother, my sister-in-law and I were vacationing at a coastal house in Bodega Bay, CA (about two hours north of San Francisco).  We were watching the sun set over the ocean and preparing to watch the clear night sky, so we had big binoculars (16X70) set up on a tripod on the west-facing patio.  Moments after sunset (which occurred at 7:15 p.m., [see photo]), while the sky at the horizon was still orangey, we noticed a very bright orange/gold streak moving at a slightly upward angle in a north-to-south direction [see photos].  At arm’s length and measuring between thumb and forefinger, the streak early on was about an inch above the horizon.  We then looked at it through the binoculars and we saw not only the streak, but a dark, somewhat elongated object that was rounded at the leading edge of what we then called a “trail”. The object took up about 1/4 inch of the streak.  Over the next minute or so, the trail got to be about four inches long (as measured above).  A minute or two after we first saw the trail, the object/trail appeared to stop and hover in place for another 10 minutes or so, but the trail did not dissipate at all like a vapor trail would.  (Since we were facing west, it's also possible the object was not hovering but rather moving west to east or east to west after it appeared to stop.) We could see the trail and the ""unmoving"" object for a total of 10 minutes or so until it got too dark to see through the binoculars.  The pictures we took do not even begin to show the brightness of the trail.  Based on the ""distance to horizon"" calculator on the Internet, we estimated the distance to the object was about 15.5 nautical or 17.9 statute miles.  (We did a Google Earth calculation that showed our rental house was 172 feet above sea level and, adding the five-foot height of the tripod, resulted in a ""height of eye"" of 177 feet.)  If the object was almost 18 miles away, the object would have to be quite large to appear as big as it did, even though it required binoculars to see it. Our collective conclusion was that the object was too big to be any kind of airplane and that the trail was not a vapor trail.  The way the object appeared to stop and hover, and the fact that the trail did not dissipate, were also very strange.  Maybe it was some kind of missile, but we sure can’t figure it out.  None of us had ever seen such a thing.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,38.3558,-123.0629

This possible fighter moved accross same area of sky as the unidentified light, however this took about 12 seconds to cover same distance.  Could this be a fighter on Intercept?  If light was Plane then there was no sound, and a comercial plane would not travel that fast, if it was a plane at great height i.e no sound than light sorce maybe to big, distance covered meant object moved very fast.

Star-like object  horizontally traversing low and slow in the morning sky.,Pensacola,FL,2006-06-12T07:45:00,light,30 seconds,"Occurred : 6/12/2006 07:45  (Entered as : 06-12-2006 7:45) Reported: 6/21/2006 6:43:46 PM 18:43 Posted: 7/16/2006 Location: Pensacola, FL Shape: Light Duration:30 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51054.html,"Star-like object  horizontally traversing low and slow in the morning sky. This may be nothing special to make a report about, but it was just a little queer and unexpected  to see in the wee  hours of the early morning what appeared to be something very similar to a large star that was bright and glittering like the sparkles of a disco ball traversing horizontally within the patchy clouds on an Eastern heading at a speed comparable to a small plane traveling low in the sky.  But then again, it may have been simply nothing more than a plane traveling East.  On June 12, 2006 at 6:45AM in the city of Pensacola, I was at work and looking out through the building's tinted windows watching the tropical storm Alberta's clouds moving parallel along the Gulf coast.  I find it interesting to watch these clouds traveling along in bands staying somewhat together as it rotates around the storm's center.  While watching these clouds, I noticed a big, bright object within the clouds   When I first saw this object, I thought it was a bright star that has yet to dim away as the sun slowly rises higher up in sky.  But that couldn't be because the sun was already up too high in the sky for any stars to be showing.  The estimated distant from my observation location to the star-like object was no more than a half a mile at the most.  I also noticed that the star-like object was moving at the speed of a small plane, and it was traveling at about the same low altitude as other planes I had seen flying though the area in the past.  In the beginning when I first spotted this star-like object,  it was hard to tell that the star-like object was moving because it was traveling East directly in the path  that the clouds were traveling West.  The intensity of the light stayed mostly the same throughout the viewing as the star-like object traveled away from me except for one moment in it's travel; it appeared to shine brighter for a few seconds as though some sunlight has reflected off it.  After observing it for a about 10 seconds, I begin to think that it might be a meteorite traveling horizontally, so I calmly shouted to my coworker, ""Look guys... there's a meteorite!""  Everybody rushed to the window and saw what I was seeing.  Then my supervisor said, ""It's probably just a plane.""  Then another coworkers said jokingly, ""It might be a UFO."" Then I said to my supervisor, ""Yea...  Your probably right.  It could be a plane."" Then my boss told everyone to go to work.  I was disappointed at hearing that because I wanted to continue watching this object until it went out of view. I was only able to view it for about 30 seconds. The only time I seen a plane light up somewhat like a bright star is when it's windows reflected the sunlight for a brief moment, but still, that doesn't even come close to comparison to the star-like object's light intensity which was similar in light intensity as to arc-welding type of light. This star-like object stayed lighted up like a bright star throughout the viewing.  It could have been possible that a plane that was not painted and made of bare, shiny metal flew through the area, and the sunlight  reflected off the plane's body, and then when the plane reached a certain area in the sky, more sunlight could have momentarily reflected off the plane's window thus giving it the appearance of becoming brighter for a brief moment then returning back to it's normal brightness.  The object, in my opinion, was close enough to my observation point that I should have, at the least, been able to see a shape similar to a plane if was a plane flying in the air.  Since I could not see any details that could identify it as a plane, my assumption is it could have been anything traversing the sky.  I don't think it was a meteorite because it didn't have any flaring tail. If the object I saw was a plane, this would make it the first time I ever saw a plane stayed lit up like a star at close range while traversing the sky.  I seen planes flying through the area in the past at about the same hour,  but they never lit up like a star.  It would usually light up as to something bright white.  Whatever, I saw it, so I'm reporting it.  I'll let those who are reading this determine what I saw. It may be simply nothing to continue conversing about it.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,30.462935377358487,-87.26545408805032

Within a few seconds three went to the east, two went to the west away from each other...they dissapeared. Then within a few minutes the came back and did the same thing again. Then within 10 minutes later, close to the horizon, much further out in the gulf, the red lights appeared again then vanished.

On Tuesday, June 13, 2006 at approximately 5 a.m. I was traveling southbound on I-71 through Ohio near mile marker 70 (30 miles south of Columbus) when I noticed a bright white light off to the left (East) side of the road.  At first I thought it was an airplane because I saw a center white light with two smaller lights on either side of the object, like landing lights on wings.  Also, I could tell there was at least one blinking light on the bottom, which appeared red.  As I got closer I could tell the object was stationary at an altitude of approximately 300 feet and a distance of perhaps a ¼ mile off of the highway.  When parallel to the object I could tell this was definitely not an airplane, due to being stationary, and definitely not a helicopter, due to several bright white lights being on top of the object as well.  At this distance I could still not determine the exact shape of the object, but could tell that it had very intense white lights on all surfaces, a red blinking light on the bottom and perhaps a blue blinking light on the bottom.  Due to the blinking lights I was not very suspicious since blinking lights usually signal to me that it is some type of known aircraft.  As I continued south I saw 11 more of these objects, all between mile marker 70 and 50, for a total of 12.  All had the same description as the one above and all were stationary between 200 and 400 feet off the ground and from ¼ to 1 mile off to the left the road.  Most were somewhat equally spaced in distance as I traveled down the road, but I saw one occurrence of 3 in a triangular pattern with a distance of maybe a ¼ mile in between each.  This area of Ohio is mostly flat open farmland with small gatherings of houses and buildings (maybe 4 or 5 in a group).  All of these objects seemed to be above these groups of houses.  When I approached mile marker 50, I hadn't seen one of these objects in perhaps 5 miles when I suddenly noticed one off to the left again but this one was moving parallel to I-71.  After a mile or so the object turned southeast and left the area very quickly, followed closely by 3 more of these objects.  They finally faded out of side just before mile marker 50.  I believe these to be objects that I had previously seen so I did not add them to my count.  This was the last I saw of these objects that morning.  I was heading out of state at the time and returned at the end of the week.  While out of town I thought about what I had seen and came upon the idea that these may have been the tops of radio or other communications towers and I would look for these the next time I traveled through the area.  I was skeptical of this idea however since I looked for frames under the lights but could not see anything.  On Friday, June 16, 2006 I traveled back through the area at approximately 10 p.m. going northbound.  I began watching the skies around mile marker 50 to see if any of these objects remained.  I saw several radio towers, but all of these had blinking red lights along their frames and these frames were easily visible in the dark.  I approached mile marker 60 near Jeffersonville and still had not seen anything when I noticed 2 lights on the left side (west this time) of I-71 and they looked very similar to what I had seen earlier in the week.  These lights were still about 5 miles ahead of me perhaps around mile marker 65.  As I got closer I could see the lights better and they were on the west side of 71 approximately ¼ mile apart and much to my surprise, one was slowly moving out overtop 71.  Even more to my surprise I knew I was going to be driving directly under the object.  The object was a very pronounced ((??)), with large circular blue lights running along the entire bottom of the shape, perhaps 6 or 7 on each length of the ""V"".  On the tip of the object, there was a flashing red light on the bottom.  The leading edges of the object were covered with bright white lights as well as the top.  I was not the only person to see this object, since I noticed several truckers and motorists looking up.  Realizing that I was now going only 40 MPH as well as a few people around me, I became aware that this object could perhaps cause an accident.  Because of this fact, and the fact that I now needed a new pair of pants, I called the State Police and talked to the sergeant on duty at the Wilmington branch.  He was very professional and said he would have a trooper report to the area immediately.  I do not know if anything was ever reported by the State Police, or if anything else ever came of the situation, I left the area very quickly and have only been back through during the day.  If anyone doubts my thoughts and views on this matter, please let me give you a bit of my background so perhaps you can understand my reasoning.  I am a mechanical engineering student at the University of Cincinnati, so I understand the basics of what is and isn't possible with aircraft.  I grew up near the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida where my father was stationed with the Marines in the air wing.  Over the years I have seen my share of aircraft fly ranging from biplanes, WWII era prop fighters and bombers, to modern day fighters and bombers including the F-117 Stealth fighter, B-1 and B-2 bombers, and specialty aircraft such as the SR-71 Blackbird and UAVs such as the Predator.  Besides fixed wing vehicles, I have also seen several examples of helicopters from Loaches, Hueys, Blackhawks, Apaches, Cobras, and Chinooks, to private crafts like Medivacs, and other Search and Rescue craft.  Being from East Central Ohio I have had my encounters with blimps (Goodyear) and with hot-air balloons too.  I know that this area that I was traveling through is in the approach and exit patterns for Wright-Patt Air Force base and Port Columbus International, but I have never seen any fixed wing aircraft that can hover or move as slowly as these objects did, or any other aircraft with this distinct shape and light pattern.  Hopefully someone else saw these events too.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,,

My mother and aunt were looking out the window during the fireworks and asked if there was a plane out there. I looked out to see what they were talking about, and what we saw was a slow-moving, bright orange fireball looking object. It was going straight South towards the next village over, Akula, Alaska.  My sisters and brother and a few others were outside and saw the exact same thing. I ran outside with my aunt to take a better look, and it was still moving south in a steady pace. It looked almost exactly like a meteor, except it was moving very slowly. There were about 3 points behind the head of it, like it was burning up, but there were no tails that are usually associated with meteors. There were no sounds whatsoever.  While it was getting further away, it was getting dimmer, and the more it seemed to go away from us, rather than passing by, it started disappearing. It slowed down for a few seconds, changed direction, and turned again, and resumed at the same speed it was going in the beginning of the sighting.  I don't know what that was, but everyone where we were saw it. One of the witnesses is a police officer and is very knowledgeable about things in the night sky and the surrounding areas, having been in night shifts a lot the past few years.  It was at least a mile away, and at most 2 miles away. Still it was huge and bright.  I live in a village where planes pass a lot, and I know what they look like during the day and at night. The lights and the shape looked nothing like a plane. Planes that low and close are usually loud. Especially on a night as calm as tonight. After observing the object as it passed for a few minutes, everyone here agrees that it wasn't a plane either.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,,

It now appeared to have rays emanating from it--sort of like a really close helicopter searchlight.  I was actually squinting.  At this point it was by far the brightest object I'd ever seen in the night sky.  Probably 3-5 times brighter than Venus at it's best.  By the time I'd acquired it with binocs, the object had already begun to rapidly fade, and in a few seconds all I could see was what appeared to be an ordinary satellite--traveling from slightly NW to the SE.  Fastest satellite I've ever seen, and as I watched, it kept going faster!  Lost it in 4-6 seconds.  I don't think it's acceleration was due to that effect you see as an orbital object approaches the horizon and appears to speed up before winking out. This was quite different. And I'm very sure that the initial blaze was NOT reflected sunlight.  That effect wouldn't account for 10% of the light emitted. Besides, sunset was 1.5 hours before sighting.  I have seen the Space Station several times; twice I saw the shuttle streak over CA before sunrise.  This object was the strangest (and brightest) thing I've ever seen in the sky.

I will try to articulate what I saw but honestly, I don’t know if I can find the right words to describe exactly what I witnessed.  This sighting happened south of Hernando, MS around 23:22 and the object moved in a northern direction across the sky, slightly west of Hernando towards the eastern Tunica, MS area, then very likely on to west of West Memphis, then to the southern part of Arkansas. This was a light, bright as a star but it did have a strange rhythmic flash that corresponded with its bazaar flight path. This object was moving so fast that I lost sight of it after about 3 seconds. It was very high in the sky and seemed to rapidly drop altitude multiple times before disappearing in a lateral direction. The light would stay on then, as it would disappear. The next thing I would see was the light again at a different altitude and in a different place in the sky…a flight path incompatible with any aircraft. It was like the object was stair stepping across the sky and on the downward movements, the light would disappear. While moving laterally, the light would disappear again and then come back on…only to reappear in a position that would totally exclude any aircraft movement. I can’t articulate how fast this thing was going!  What I saw tonight was neither an aircraft nor a meteorite. This was not space junk falling from the sky. I am not sure of what it was exactly, but I do know that it moved rapidly and in a fashion that was deliberate. This object was so fast that I can see how it would be missed on radar. I can only say that I got the feeling that whatever this was, it did not want to be spotted or observed.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,34.8033,-89.9895

On the evening of May 12, 2007 at approximately 23:50 hours, my wife and I were sitting on the front stoop of our house smoking a cigarette. Our house faces a westerly direction and is in a residential area of a small town.  	I frequently look into the night sky to watch the jets as they travel overhead. This night was a particularly clear, cloudless night with many stars visible. As I looked upward and towards the western horizon, I noted in my peripheral vision, two (2) lights moving from the south towards the north. As they passed behind a treetop, I thought to myself that this was a particularly long plane with a different type of lighting.  	When the objects passed into clear vision, past the treetop, I noticed that the coloration of the light was a bluish or greenish, fluorescence, unlike the color of a star or airplane light. The objects had a very smooth movement and a much quicker speed than that of an airplane. There was no audible sound associated with the appearance or movement of the lights. They appeared to be irregular in shape and were comparable in size to that of a large star, i.e. with their distance away being unknown; their size rivaled that of a large star.  	As I watched the lights move in a straight line in a northerly direction past the treetop, the one in front suddenly moved to a position overtop of the other, i.e. they assumed a vertical position to one another. The one in front flew backwards over the one in the rear.  	After this action took place both objects then began a wobbly pattern of movement. The wobbling was in an upward/downward pattern and was in unison. These lights then abruptly stopped the wobbling and proceeded onward in their northerly direction. They passed beyond my vision behind the canopy of a larger tree which blocked their visibility and I watched for several minutes to see if they emerged from this position, however, they never reappeared.  	After this display was over, my wife said to me, “did you see those lights?”.  	I do note that several minutes after this appearance and disappearance, I was still looking upwards about the sky and I observed what appeared to be a “shooting star” which moved in an east to west direction across the sky and disappeared while halfway to the horizon. It’s color and shape were normal for a shooting star, however, it seemed like it was larger than the average. Another thing which seemed unusual was that we do not normally see shooting stars in the middle of May.  Sincerely,",2007-06-12T00:00:00,38.7915,-82.9217

Event Description: During Casual gazing at the stars on 13th May 2007 night (Time  around 9:40pm) (while lying on the flat terrace (third floor) and looking at the sky upwards), i suddenly noticed a set of faint light moving uniformly in one direction, from south direction to north direction. The view was pretty faint, and had i observed it alone, i would have definitely ignored it as my illusion. However, i immediately asked my wife to look at by pointing the direction, and she too spotted it. We both agreed it cannot be a illusion, but however slightly differed in its description: I felt it was two lights moving side-by-side in that direction and with the gaps between narrowing down while my wife's described it rather as an v-shaped line (of lights!). We were wondering about it for some time, and then ignored it and were talking on some other topic. After maybe 2-3 minutes, we once again noticed a similar movement of lights, in the same direction. This time, we noticed at the fag end of its transition across the sky, and atleast i could not remember clearly its features, felt it to be haphazard collection of moving lights. Again, we had a disagreement on its features: i noted it be a haphazard set of may be 10 white tiny lights (like a star constellation) while my wife once again described it as an V-line formation. Actually, its movement was steady, going straight from south direction passing very nearly to the sky centre line and towards north direction. The entire crossing, i guess would have happened in 3-4 seconds. The object, or the thing could be sighted only over the center portion of the sky, and seems to be fading in the background over the horizon, as the sky was brighter (probably due to city lights) at (about less than 30 degree) horizon compared to the centre. I was casually mentioning what we are seeing could be similar to the many mysterious UFO's reported but not proven kind of stuff discussed in the science/science fiction TV programmes and other media. Once again, we! spotted for third time after maybe about 2-3 minutes, a similar moving object (by now, it become befitting to be called an object!), again moving in the same direction and in a similar way. After the 3rd sighting, we become alert and probed for the sky for any more such sighting. i was wondering whether it is the same object passing through the sky again and again, or if these were separate objects travelling one after the other. i told myself that i would be alert enough to focus on the movement and get a good glimpse of its features, if i see it next time. And yes, we witnessed the flying object for the fourth time, again may be after 2-3 minutes, a similar moving set of steady lights. This time, i agreed with my wife on its features. It was a V-formation of lights. My rough estimate for the angle between lines of the V would be 140 degrees!. The V-pattern was moving with its centre pivot at the front and V arrow itself pointing towards the direction of its movement. The angular distance of the object, i would put it to be around 3 degrees. We were thrilled at these sightings and hoped would to see fee more. I stargazed for another 30 minutes before giving up and we left to go to sleep. I was conviced that it was indeed an unusual event and said to myself to mark this day as memorable day of my life, lest i ignore and forget it just like those fading movement of light objects. I decided to check websites on UFO's and report my sightings, for a general benefit. As a responsible person, i thought i should inform and record this event, so that if any/more persons sighted this like us, it would become befitting enough to do investigation and get some meaningful explanation. But, onething is for sure: If somebody else observed it and tells me what he/she saw, i would not have taken it seriously and most definitely ignored it, thinking that person has made somehow misjudged a simple plane as an UFO; And that people have enough personal problems to worry about, than these bizarre movements in the sky. That's why i d! id not w ant to make a big fuss about what i saw to all the people i meet, and getting branded as an paranoid/cracknut. Instead, i have just put down all my (sincere) observations on the event in this UFO observation site, due to my own curiosity to know what i saw, and probably aid the concerned person/investigator/other UFO viewers, to make sense of these UFO's. I sincerely hope that myself and my wife were not the only one who witnessed this, and somehow a good number of people have also watched this particular event, so that it is not discounted as an not-strong enough, isolated, ignorable event.  I am not a big advocator of UFO sightings or theories on it. I am not a person who collects information about UFO's reproted by people, but rather know it as only among one of the many interesting news/documentary reported in the TV channel like discovery. Infact, i never got curious enough to know about it by searching/browing the websites. I do not know if what i saw is qualified to be called as an UFO. But all the same, i am listing down, what is so unusual about what i saw that makes it un-ignorable (atleast to me) and curious:  * The object could not be a Plane: I have never seen a plane to be shaped like array of lights lined a arrow shape. But, for my fourth sighting, i would not even consider as and line of lights, but rather a haphazard collection of of lights, in which case would definitely not fit as the lights from the some human-plane. There was no sound heard, but still flew past pretty swiftly. Thus, it could not be just an conventional plane travelling too on ground making it seem to be flying fast(as in which case some sound should have been definitely heard for such low heights). I believe that it could not be a high flying plane (whose sound could not be heard), as i intuitively feel the plane would have to travel at indeed a unbelievably high speed for it transcend the sky in 3-4 seconds.  * It could not be a meteorite: My first observation as two tiny lights moving together could have probably taken as just a meteorite or shooting stars. Okay, even my second view as a collection of lights like a star constellation, again could have discounted simply as travelling of multiple number of meteorite rocks. But, i cannot definitelty take my final sighting of an well arranged V-array of lights simply as falling meteorites. And also, will meteorites travel in such a periodic manner (every 2-3 minutes) and also in exactly same direction and followint the same path int he sky!!? And also, the lights were not accelerating, were tending to move straight with a steady speed, and no brightening or burning out kind of movement. And the lights were uniformly light (can it be parallel set of uniformlly lit shooting stars??, very unlikely.).  * Array Movement: Based on the pattern of lights alone, the closest thing that i can associate it is an beautiful V-shaped arrangement formed by a  flock of migratory birds. But again, what is disturbing with this description is: The pattern was too geometrically spaced and uniformly moving for it be considered as an natural phenomena; and how come these birds are flying so fast, and why are they carrying tiny lights with them?  My only logical deduction of what i observed based on my own personal experience (ignoring all about UFO reported by others), would be, that it is either a specially designed human made flying object, possibly a secretive (military or otherwise) vehicle, concealed from the purview of general public. Or, it is an mysterious flying object unproved and unknown to humans.  Or it could be just chance of a chance of a chance occurence of simultaneous hallucination of myself and my wife, and that too for concurrently 4 times, and sharing more or less the similar hallucination of moving lights in the same path!!!  And now thinking about it, may be it possible to give a even simpler explanation. It is simply an low flying kids plane toy or similar such stuff, moving with no sound, with its faint tiny lights. Or, could it by flying light emitting insect, but then again flying so uniformly arranged, hmmmm hard to believe.  So, this is an sighting whose origin is not known to me now, and possibly i may never be able to know for sure.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,,

Since it was over the ocean at night, it was difficult to judge distance, but I know it was closer than the two boats out at sea.  At first I thought it was a flare and that a boat was in trouble.  Or, possibly a firework - but it never exploded the way fireworks do.  Then, another gold light lit up to the right of the first.  It was the same size and brightness.  Then a third lit up and it was the same brightness and all three were in a perfectly straight line and perfectly evenly spaced.  The first dimmed and went out and a fourth lit up to the right of the third.  Again, evenly spaced, same brightness, and all in a perfectly straight line.  The second light dimmed and went out and a fifth lit up.  The third dimmed and went out and then the remaining two dimmed and went out one at a time.  All of this happened evenly spaced out in timing. I don't know if they made any sound since it was over the ocean, and the waves were so loud, that was all I could hear.  About a minute or two later, to the left of where we saw the first lights, another light appeared.  It seemed slightly less bright than the first group.  Then a second lit up.  At this point, I can't be clear on what I saw because I was trying to get my camera to cooperate to get a picture.  I only saw two lights this time, but there could have been more.

We looked at each other and said, “What the hell is that?” And both agreed that we had no idea, but we knew it wasn’t an airplane or a helicopter because it was too low and it was just sort of hovering there.  He said to me, “Get out your cell phone and take a picture!”  So, I proceeded to get out my phone and I was starting to shake because it wasn’t very far above the trees and who knows what might happen— all I could envision was this thing changing direction and pointing its lights at our vehicle.   I rolled down the electric window on our vehicle, but before I could point my camera phone and get the picture, it lifted into what looked like either a very, very low cloud or a type of haze or dry ice looking puff.  There wasn’t any sound coming from this object at all, it was like dead silence. We could see the light within this cloud formation sort of glowing, but we kept on driving because he knew that I was scared and I think he was too.   I kept trying to look back at the location as we hit the main highway and headed home driving south on Mehaffey Bridge Road, but I couldn’t see anything from that point on, not even the glow. (We both agreed that we would take a lie detector test if nobody believed us.  It was very bizarre.)",2008-06-12T00:00:00,41.7941,-91.4771

We continued to drive along the road which follows the river until the river turned the bend and was gone. I have pitures on my cell phone and my friend has video capabilty on her cell phone and took an ongoing video. We are at a loss to explain what the lights were. I do not know of any airplane or airborn vehicle that could hover and move that slow at a consistant speed, this vehicle was about 50 ft off the surface of the river.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,35.9743,-84.28936000000002

I was scared so I didn't bother to stop and didn't even think to take a picture. I just wanted out of there. As I drove up the road, they didn't appear to move at all. Total time I saw the objects was for nearly 1 minute.  My guess is that they were directly over RT. 119 or at about 40°06'48.94""N   &   79°33'20.79""W and were probably 1700 to 2500 feet high  I am 100% sure they were not 2 helicopters with searchlights but don't know what they could have been.

This morning around 9am, in overcast weather I was waiting to dragged the infield of Glenden Park's rookie ball diamond because my partner in the other trackter was air-rating it.  I was parked in the outfield and I noticed a very fast moving red dot in the sky, I followed it for about 90 degrees of travel and the red light grew bigger and changed into a blue flicker/flame.  I ran to alert my partner about this fire in the sky but was unable to take my eyes of it or get their attention over their vechile.  The light turned and began swirling the clouds in opposite directions and then two wings appeared with bright yellow slits.  It may not be wings because the clouds were moving so intensely, unlike anything I have ever seen and thus were blocking the middle of the UFO.  However,  the object moved closer and I observed the yellow slits to be vents sucking in the clouds, or atleast the cause of the cloud distruption.  It moved through the sky towards me unlike any thing possible, did not make a sound, moved downward slightly then dissapeared.  I ran and stopped my co-worker's progress and as they disembarked their trackter, the UFO appeared seemingly above us, very large for only brief second or two before dissapearing.  I drew it's picture and wrote down what occured immediatley on the back of my vechile checklist for daily inspections.  I radio-ed my boss to tell him what conspired and all 45 city employees think I am lying, or saw something that wasn't what I described.  It was a brief enouncter but it was the most interesting, intense, and scariest moment of my life.  To give the exact description the blue flame / flickering light was on top in the middle of the oval craft, and I could only see the bright yellow vents sucking up or pushing away all the clouds.  The turbelance from the vents made it impossible to distingu! ish the what the middle and majority of the craft looked like.  I believe that the two wings are not two wings but one long line of bright yellow vents, and like I said earlier the clouds were moving in a way I thought not possible.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,46.3834,-82.6332
