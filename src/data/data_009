It resembled the brightness of a planet on a clear night but slightly brighter and larger than venus. Its light appeared to pulse a bit more than i have seen in stars or planets in varing atmospheric conditions so i stared at it for just over a minute. As i was looking at it, it shot off into space leaving a blaze trail (sparkle trail) as if leaving the upper atmosphere. As the trail ceased the brightness of the object faded the object appeared much smaller but continued on into space until i no longer could see it, not beyond the horizon just due to its distance. At the point of vanishing it was still high in the east but ENE of my perspective.

There was no sound and, for that matter, I didn't expect any as it appeared quite distant even though it was moving across the sky fairly rapidly. We watched it for 2 to 3 minute during which time it progressed steadily moving approximately eastward. The direction and speed seemed to remain constant. The color and intensity of the light remained stead as well. Then, while we were watching, there appeared to be 3 or four streaks of light, very much tracer-like, extend out ahead of the light. The streaks were fainter than the light of object and extended directly in the direction of travel a distance corresponding to a distance that the object would have traversed in several seconds travel time. This occured twice. Both my wife and I were looking at the object and both of us saw the streaks. The two bursts of streaks occurred approximately 2-3 seconds apart. Shortly after the second burst, the object vanished as though the light were extinguished. The area of the sky that we were watching at that time had no obstructions or other fixed elements that could have come between the object and our line of sight. We watched the area closely for another minute or two, trying to see the object again or anything else, but nothing appeared. We saw nothing more that was out of the ordinary that evening.

My daughter and I were watching this and originally thought it was a large bird. When it stopped and hovered in the same spot for several minutes I ran and got my glasses for a better look. What I saw appeared to be a black non reflective object shaped like 4 cubes connected to form a tri-pod rotating on an x/y and z axis. At approximately 19:15 hrs it seperated into two (2) smaller black objects of apparently equal size and or mass. Neither of the smaller objects appeared to have a definitive shape and moved fairly fluidly in what I can only describe as elliptical orbits around eachother and appearing to come into contact with eachother every few orbits. At approximately 19:20 hrs the objects rejoined in the original shape and started to ascend straight up very slowly. The sighting continued until 19:32 hrs when it passed out of my visibilty range.

I returned inside to get my cup of coffee, and coat, thinking everything would be OK leaving it running on it's own.  Well, everything did go OK, I returned and continued to let the camcorder do it's thing. 	Soon the colors began to fade and I stopped recording, removed the camcorder from the tripod and took everything back inside.  Wanting to see if the camcorder had captured the colors, I connected it to the VCR and began replaying the tape.  I was a little put off at first because the recording wasn't quite as good as I expected.  That's when ""it"" appeared and my eyes about popped out of my head.  Something came into the frame, then it appeared to change direction sharply and shot off out of the frame at a high rate of speed. A friend of ours who has knowledge of videos and computers did a video capture of that sequence of the tape.  He then made two still images from that sequence which we are sending to you.  The ""avi"", (the video capture sequence), is rather large, but if you would like us to send it we can.  Just e-mail us at the address provided below.

At this distance, an airplane would appear to the eye to be traveling relatively slow in perspective. However the object was moving at a fairly rapid rate.

They did not appear to be flying toward a certain destination.  The objects were located throughout the sky, widely separated from each other and doing their own  maneuvers. They were not in sinc with eachother. On Ocober 25, 1999 I observed from my car some moving lights in the sky that sometimes flashed red and white and didn't think much of it. I saw approximately five.  I saw the objects in the southeastern sky. I was located approximately 3 miles north of Moravia,NY just to the south of Owasco Lake. It was approximately 7:05 pm.  On October 26, 1999 my fiance was the one to spot the lights at approximately the same time, 7:05.  He had been in a tree stand hunting deer when he first noticed.  He did not know that I had seen them the previous night. I always pick him up on the side of the road when he is done hunting just as it gets dark. On this night, he was already out of the woods when I arrived and was looking up at the sky.  I knew at that moment he was seeing what I saw the night before.  As I pulled over, he waved for me to get out of the car.  We both saw approximately 20 lights, some flashing red and white throughout the southeastern sky.  The azimuth was anywhere from 90 degrees to 180 degrees.  The altitudes of the lights were anywhere from 15 degrees to 60 degrees approximately.  When we looked at any one specific light, you could tell it was moving compared to the stars.  It would flash and appear to stop and then move straight upward from its stopping point.  Then it would disappear (the light) and reappear very close to where it disappeared a second or two ago.  Eventually in a minute or two, another light, a different one would catch the corner of our eyes and we would focus on that.  At one time, you could see approximately five lights without turning your head to a different azimuth.  The five lights would be at different altitudes, but all of them flashed either red or white.  They did not flicker like stars, they flashed. When an object flashed, it did not flash in a certain time interval.  It flashed randomly.  When the objects moved, they would only move in their own section of the sky.  I did not see an object streak across the whole southeastern part of the sky.  When it moved, it e! ither mo ved straight up from where it was stopped (about two or three finger widths at one time). Some of them would then disappear from view completely.  Many of the objects moved in circular or curved paths. The total distance of the paths of any objects I could see for long enough without disappearing was about five to ten fingerwidths.  None of them were going in a straight path parallel to the horizon. As we traveled back home, approximately six miles away from that area, we could still see the objects, but not as many. I called someone that lived in Moravia to view the objects. They saw them too.  I also called someone in Locke, which is just south of Moravia a few miles to view the objects.  They saw them too.  It was approximately 8:30 pm when we could no longer see them. ((NUFORC Note:  Under most circumstances, in a case in which objects are allegedly witnessed for 90 minutes, we would first address the possibility that the witness was observing celestial bodies.

Within it were diamond aquamarine shapes which fluctuated in color and position. There had been clouds in the sky prior to the event. The sky was completely clear. There was a noisy fountain behind us. Throughout the entire event we heard nothing. All sound stopped. The obeject slowly flew over us about 500 feet up in relation to tree tops. Both myself and the witness felt completely at peace. We both had an out of body experience. As it flew over the object stayed a perfect circle. It did not elipse. In total the event seemed to take about five minutes. Later we discovered it had been about 20 minutes. The object came to the tree line and disapeared. It never sped up. We rushed to look around the trees and saw nothing. It was gone instantaneously. It wasn't as if the light had blinked out. It was simply no longer there.We rushed inside to tell two other friends. They did not witness the light. They came outside with us and we all looked around. The four of us saw two planes flying by. There are no commercial flight paths over this area.

It came from the US went directly over our heads and rounded down toward Isle of Palms and faded out. We both thought were going to see some type of explosion or something. It was extremely close to Earth.  Looked like it was going to land. The sphere was about the size of a basketball. the sphere glowed yellow and had a red glow around it. It also had a very long tail about ten times the size of the ball.  The tail was red where it met the ball and faded out to blue toward the end of the tail. From the red it turned to orange to yellow to green to blue at the point, or end of the tail. This was the first time I had ever seen anything like it. I didn't know to report it.

It was a clear night, and I had my exterior flood lights on as well as the rest of my neighbors usually do at this time of night.  Looking to the west, just over the treetops, I noticed a white ball with a tinge of yellow and red.  This light's flight pattern was basically perpendicular to me in a north to south direction.  As it travelled, it produced a large, long illuminated trail.  The characteristic of it was incredible.  The trail did not dissipate and appeared to move along with the front being the ball of light.  I can't tell you what the trailing was . . . if it was flying on a beam of light . . . if the trail was actually part of it's structure . . . or if its hull was superheated from atmospheric braking. I'm guessing that it turned from a north-south direction to an ENE direction.  The reason why I say that is that it went from an elongated shape to a round ball shape with no trail.  I called my friend out to observe this.  It seemed to have stabalized which leads me to believe that it was traveling quite a distance directly toward me.  The brightness started to fade like turning out a camping lantern.  At that time regular red, green, and white aircraft strobes appeared to turn on. I cannot be sure that the ball of light and the stobes were from the same vehicle, but the vehicle proceeded toward me and over me at a leisurely speed similar to other aircraft I would watch leave the local airport.

She told us they had even shut the drive-in down to watch the craft!  (By the way, there was a game playing at Crosley Field that night.) The craft looked like a saucer, the windows were rectangular with rounded corners and located around the perimeter.  The light was a ""strange"" color, sort of a blue-ish white, and we could see silhouettes in some of the ""windows"". I know this sounds a little crazy, my husband still asks me what we were drinking that night at the baby shower we had been to! (The answer is NOTHING) But we all know what we saw. The craft made no sound at all.....totaly silent as it moved. What I really would like to know is this, are there any other reports concerning this particular sighting?  If so, what are they?  Could I have access to this information?",,39.17450311744155,-84.48136299381886

The summer of 1971, I was working the night shift for Conoco Oil Co. at an open pit uranium mine west of Karnes City Tx.   I was one of 6 people operating Caterpillar 657B earth movers. We were down to about 210 feet deep when this incident happened.   It was about 11:10 PM , just after shift change we were getting ready to crank our machines, when the 85 acre pit lit up as if it was daylight.  The light was so bright that I had to squint because it hurt my eyes.  I remember hearing a high pitched hissing noise and the hair on my arms stood on end.  I was so scared, I fell to the ground and started praying.  I remember trying to look up, but the light was so bright I couldn't.  After about 2 minutes, the light started getting dimmer and I could finally look up at it. What I saw amazed me.  The object was round and the bright light was coming from the center of the bottom of the UFO.  Around the perimeter of the craft was hundreds of penlight size light beams that alternated in all colors of the spectrum.  Now I know they were laser beams.  The UFO was rising up slowly at first and then went straight up out of sight in about 10 seconds.  I was crying and shaking and so was everyone else.  The other shift workers thought we were crazy when we told them what had happened.  But we got the last laugh.  This is how we proved it actually happened. There is a vein of uranium ore that runs from George West Texas to almost Texarkana Texas.  When determining where to place a mine, the following steps are accomplished:  (1) A geologist with a geiger counter flies over the area and finds the highest radiation reading.  (2) Drilling trucks are sent out and core samples are drilled to determine the highest concentration of uranium ore. These core samples are drilled in a grid pattern and every core sample is given a tracking number and logged in showing the concentration and amount of uranium present. (3) The open pit mine is then laid out according to these core samples. When this UFO incident happened, we were about 2 feet away from a layer of hard rock called the ""tap rock"" that laid directly on top of the uranium ore.   The uranium ore varied in depth from 6 to 18 inches and had about the same brown color as low grade coal.    Two days after this incident, the tap rock was removed to expose the uranium ore.  We were astounded to find that the uranium ore was now a chalky white substance that had NO radioactivity at all!  There was a 250 foot diameter circle of this chalky material in the center of the pit. Outside of the circle, the uranium ore was still as potent as before the incident.  Core samples don't lie.  This chalky material was uranium before this incident. Many a night I have laid in my bed thinking about what happened.  I think the UFO needed the uranium for some reason.",1999-06-23T00:00:00,,

They approached from the north. They came directly towards me until at one point they were virtually overhead. They were all three flying in a very close formation in a line three abreast. They were just below cloud level. When they were almost directly above me you could make out the shape of them quite easily. They were completly silent with no visible sign of propulsion. No lights on them at all. They matched the over cast sky almost pefecly. They were in my sight for I would say about three to four minutes. One of the objects on the outside of the three then made a perfect right angle turn away from the other two objects. At that point they were lost from my view because of near by buildings. The exact year I saw the three objects over the town I was living in at the time was 1971. It as taken me all these years to talk about the sighting because at the time of the sightings I did not wish to make my sighting too public because I did not want certain types of people knocking on my door. Plus all those years ago there was no such thing as the internet where you could talk about these things to people and still reatain a certain amount of anonymity. So that is why I waited all these years to tell my story. At the time of my sighting I was interested in astronomy and was building my own 6"" Newtonian reflector telescope. So as you can appreciate at that time I used to spend quite a lot of time looking at the sky. On this particular evening I had just gone outside to put the milk bottles out for the milk man to collect the following day. The year was 1971 it was a Friday night but I have to be honest I'm not sure now what month of the year it was. To carry on with the story as I was out side in the back garden of the house I happened to glance up at the sky. The night was fine and dry but the sky was very overcast with cloud. What I saw then I can hardly beleive I saw even today sometimes. What I saw were three objects heading in my direction. They were well below the level of the clouds and were very easily seen by the naked eye. The three objects were in a perfect formation three abreast. They were also very close together. Far closer to each other than coventional would fly under normal conditions. They approached me in complete silence until they were almost directly above my head. I would guess there speed, but it is only a rough guess, at no more than 15miles per hours if that. When the objects were almost overhead there shape could be easily defined without the aid of binoculars. I have yet to see after all these years of seeing pictures of UFO's still to see an object with the same shape as the three I saw. I would best describe it as Like a football cut exactly in half, but with the bottom edge slightly rounded. Viewed from above or below as I saw the object it would appear perfectly round. The colour of the three objects was almost a perfect match with the night sky. I would describe the colour as a dull brownish grey. All three were perfectly silent with no visible signs of propulsion. Which would easily been seen from the distance they were from me by this time. There were no lights on them at all. They just seemed to be gliding across the night sky. Just before the objects went from my view because of the surrounding one of the objects made a perfect 90 degree turn away fro the other two. But unlike conventional aircraft it did not turn in a radius. One minute it was flying in a forward direction the in an instant it changed direction The other two objects continued to fly in a southerly. The objects had approached me from the north. The single obect I would say headed west. At that point I lost sight of the three objects over the roofs of the nearby houses. I mentioned my sighting to my work colleagues the very next day at work but I think they were a bit sceptical about what I had seen the previous night. I can't say I blame them. I think I would be too if someone told me about such a thing. Other than telling a few people at work at the time I did not make the sighting too public. I still tell peole about my sighting even today when I get into conversations about UFO's and the like. But I think they take what I tell them with a pinch of salt. All I would like to had to my story is the fact that in my oppinion the three object I saw that Friday night in 1971 were definitly not manufactured on this planet.",1999-06-23T00:00:00,,

Early November I witnessed an object gliding across the night sky moving SE across Mesa, AZ. It appeared to be a yellow orange fireball with a medium tail trailing behind moving faster than an aircraft going away from me.  The angle from horizon to overhead was 70 degrees when I spotted it. As it moved towards the horizon and got farther away, what appeared to be another very small round fireball was ejected straight down beneath this object and appeared to burn up and tnen disappeared as it separated a distance below the larger object.  The larger object continued on its path for a few minutes until at about 20 degrees from the horizon it suddenly disappeared.  It instantly vanished as quick as you could snap your fingers.  The object made no movements other than a straight glide across the sky and was bright making it clearly visible.  As I am involved with astronomy I am certain it was not a meteor, comet or a satellite burning up in the atmosphere because those objects move rapidly through it and the burn rate is quite quick.  A comet that close would have caused destruction as this object was in the lower level of the atmosphere.  Since the object made no sound at all which it would have that close it was not a meteor. Additionally the object moved too slow for a meteor or comet or satellite. It was not an aircraft in trouble because the object moved too fast with no sound. The shape was definitely a compact ball! I have checked various professional astronomy resources and have received no explanations as yet. The object appeared to be too low to have skipped off or grazed the atmosphere and then back out into space.

I always wanted to discuss this with Dr.Schumacher but his untimly demise saddened us all. I have had three other sightings but I have no frame of reference in currently accepted reality to explain them as I can with the lunar impact. Immediatly prior to the moon entering its peach orange phase preceding the full lunar eclipse, I saw an explosion on the moon that briefly extended from the 11 o'clock postion outward into space to a distance of .20 lunar diameters. It dissipated quickly followed by an after shock less than a third the size of the first impact. Note I could only see the explosion from the edge of the moon outward into space. Only the black background of space allowed me to see this event which lasted an entire 4 seconds and fading to nothing in 6 seconds. While in Rochester I witnessed an inexplicable passage of two globes of soft nebulus lights six to eight inches in diameter. One followed two feet behind the first in the same trajectory. THEY WOULD NOT INTERACT WITH SOLID MATTER , PASSING THROUGH BRICK WALLS WITH ABSOLUTLY NO IMPEDENCE I tried to touch one of the globes. It had no discernable surface and with some trepidation I hesitated to penetrate its outer haze and it continued to pass through an inner wall about a foot below the ceiling.

Stood and watched it for 15-20min. until it sped away. Sped acroos the horizon at lightening speed. It happened about 12 miles from Belzoni,MS on a local road named Broad Lake Rd. The road runs east to west. Our house was located on the north side of the road. We had been attending church that evening and got to the house about 10:30pm. As we got out of the car, my mother and I spotted it at the same time. We both uttered to the others to take a look into the south to southwestern sky about 1/2 mile out where some woods were located. As we stood looking at the object it seemed to be hubbering not more that 50 feet off the top of the trees, spinning around omitting serveral bright colors. Red, Green, Blue, and White. But to me the white light seemed different. It seemed to be reaching out to us, like maybe a scan of some sort. The light was not affected by our appearance. But after about 6-8 minutes the light turned off. We were amazed at what we had seen so we stood there to see if we could see it again. After being turned off for 60 or so, seconds. The light came back on. It continued to hubber and spin in the very same position that we had first seen it, for another 5 to 8 minutes. After that, it moved towards the west at a rate of speed that I have never seen before or again since. During the duration of our expirience, we all agreed that the craft had not made a sound at all. Not even when it left. It has been a number of years since it happened and some of us have departed since. Some of us have a veige memory and some of us dont remember it at all. But, I remember it as if it happened yesterday. We never made a report of our sighting due to the fact that it was a small town and noone would believe us. And some of us didn't want that type of publicity. At this point in my life, I dont want the publicity either. But maybe someone else in the area had seen it too, and this story will help them some how. Neither me, nor any of my family members were abducted during the sighting.

One craft approached and observed the group shined lights on us, windows appeared and we were able to see two creatures gazing at us. A group of five people were star gazing on a beautiful clear Minnisota night, after 15-20 minutes of sky watching, we noticed a cloud cover converging over the lake from the left and the right (simultaniously) we thought this strange since clouds seem to usually come from one direction We were sitting lake level at a friends farm (away from it all,out of town on dirt roads the farm house itself was about 50 yards away), we were at the boat landing area and talking and visiting. Earlier we had commented on the sounds of the night, crickits, frogs, dogs night birds etc. As the clouds closed up the entire view of the sky, we noticed a dim light which appeared to be about 20 yards out on the lake. The only thing I could think of that this might be was someone night fishing with a lantern or some kind of light source in a rowboat with that source being below the rim of the boat, thus giving of a weird glow.We could make no lines out so we had no idea of shape or distance, out in the country on a lake it gets very very dark. It was myself and 4 lady friends there that night,heres where it gets strange. From the lenght of the light and the size of a row boat I figured it must be about 20 yards out, I called out,..hey are you catching anything? No response ..I repeated myself again.. no response. While listening for a response I noticed that all of the night sounds had vanisher and there was no sounds at all, except.... the sound of a finely tuned engine ,barely detectable, but every thing else seemed oddly still. Since there was no response and knowing a person would usually respond to a call out, I picked up my flashlight a shinned it toward the light...it illuminated nothing, thats strange, I decided to walk up the hill towards the farm and get an elevated view. Walking up the incline with the 4 girls close behind.(inches) I got a veiw of a good portion of this good sized lake, to my surprise ai saw 4 other light buzzing around the lake also at a foot or two above the water it seemed. I turned to the girls and asked them if they saw what I saw and they said what do you see? Anyway we all saw these lights moving around on the lake. By this time the hair on the back of my neck was standing on end.We ruled out all possibilities except UFO'S. As we stood there with our jaws dropped the light that we had first thought to be a fishing boat, began to levitate to our eye level,about 30 feet above water level. Now I always said if I had an encounter, I would make friends, forget it, as the light followed us up the hill to the stairs of the farmhouse I along with the girls were fearful of the light. My friends family was sleeping in the house(father and grandmother)we noticed that the trusty dog that lives on the front steps that was there earlier was gone, we were there to camp by the lake and were set up there. I didn't want to go into the farmhouse out of respect, and I still was in a state of disbelief over all this trying to convince myself it wasn't happining. So I told the girls , lets just sit on the steps for a moment and see what happens. The length of yard was about 35 feet before a small 20 foot incline down to the shore, we sat down, the light now out over the water directly in front of us glowing like a light with a dimmer on it at a very low level. We sat in disbelief as the light at once became brighter, we could now make out some kind of shape, it was like a coffee saucer was upside down, wider at the bottom than top,there appeared to be a pattern within that light(window)and that was like those iron grates you see on sidewalk accesses for sewer systems, kind of honey combed. Behind the grate and in front of the light source were two silhouett figures. I was unable to make out any features since it seemed the light source was behind them. They had triangular type bodies with the shoulders being the wide point, same with their heads shaped like drawings of Greys. These two seemed to be observing us, moving side to side, we were mesmerized. After a few minutes the light once again dimmed, this scared us enough to get inside the house. I decided it was time to wake up  my friends father, I went into his bedroom and woke him saying that there were flying saucers outside, he'd been drinking and mumbled we must be on drugs and drifted back to sleep, I then tried Grandma ..same thing. I grabbed a shotgun out of the closet and went back to the kitchen with the girls who immediatley convinced me to put the gun away, that it would only make things worse if they felt provoked...I listened.   We then not knowing what else we could do and driven be fear as well as curiosity we went back to the steps sat down and watched the low glowing light in front of us. We werent sure how big this thing was because as I stated it was dark out there and it was just a light and we couldn't see the whole thing,anyway after a minute the light got a bit brighter and from underneath three laser type lights popped on and started scanning very quickly the house the trees,us etc. The lights were straight beams about 6inchis acroos that were very strong and as I said in a laser type beam, it scanned everything in a very deliberate fasion this went on for mayby 15 seconds then the lights went out and the saucer lights also got very weak and we heard about 6 very loud splashes in the lake, I imagined that beings were jumping into the water(like frog men)and would be comming up over the hill any second, we all got very scared at the thought of this and ran back in the house to the upstaires, where the family had some extra beds for company. The upstairs was unfinnished, the farmhouse was over 100 years old and didn'y have a ceiling just the roof then a few wooden cross beams or rafters. this was a summer getaway and was not insulated upstairs. On the center beam going accross the ceiling there was an old ceramic light fixture with a bulb and a string to turn it on and off, there was an open window with a screen on it on one wall. We were all very frightened so told every one to pair up and take one of the three beds. This put  us two to a bed all staring at the window. I said mayby it will just go away, we sat there for maybe 2 minutes which seemed like forever, then suddenly it got very bright above the house it seemed as if the sun were shinning we could see dust particles and light comming through cracks and nailholes and it was like daytime outside the window, then suddenly two little balls of light the size of say handballs came through the screen without making a hole! These things were circling around each other at a very fast rate, they zoomed around us and the room and went to the hanging light bulb fixture on the ceiling beam they seemed drawn to it for 5 seconds or so then thew swooshed back out the screen as fast as they had come. Two seconds later it was dark again. We all sat there virtually paralized! Soon I guess our senses came back and we could hear in the distance the sound of a car comming down the dirt road, the sound got closer and closer we heard the car pull into the long driveway and a car door slam ( we realized it was my friend whos farm we were at that we had split up from earlier in the evening finally returning home ) I ran to the window and saw it was our friend, I then shouted to him to stay there!! We all ran outside to save him! As we ran up the driveway to warn him we must have seemed histerical, trying to explain we looked around, the sky was clear , the night sounds back, the old trusty dog was back and it seemed like every thing was back to normal. The local town paper reported several people seeing funny lights and passed them off as meteors. NO WAY The next thing is I looked at my watch and noticed it was about 12:15 am, this started around 10:pm it didn't seem possible that 2 hours could have passed...maybe 21-30 minutes.",1999-04-26T00:00:00,45.8427,-92.90770000000002

It looked to me like one of those racks you use for playing billiards. It was silent, moving south to north. I asked my girlfriend to look at it, she didn't know what to make of it. It had no lights. I tried to calculate its size by comparing it to the distance to the bottom of the low rolling clouds. The reason I say ""rolling"" is that I could see the bottom of the clouds in detail, they were moving pretty fast. It was kind of windy that night.

I took a look down the lake to the east towards the marina some 3 miles away. I noticed two lights low in the sky which seem to be moving my direction, so I stopped and parked on the side of the road to watch. My thought was that it was an airplane heading to the airport to the west of my position. But as I watched, the two lights seperated to travel one on each side of the lake, both objects stayed at a very low altitude, possibly less than a 100 feet above the ground. This was really getting interesting. As they got within several hundred yards maybe further, the one on the right shore line moved across the lake to fall in behind the other and they passed my position one following the other, some 200 yard from me. The interesting traites where that these objects made no noise at all and as they passed, the objects stayed a ball of light no matter what angle they were to me, never did there appear to be any frame or structure to them. They may have been the size of possibly a truck tire, it is hard to figure the size and they did not have the halo glow like a street light, I don't recall them eluminating things. I watched as they passed and can't really remember how they left my vision. I had no missing time and have had no later memories of anything else happening other than the wonderful unexplainable sighting. Being a student of metaphysics, my interpertation of what I saw, was that these were energy beings checking on the state of the ecology here. Interesting to this was that a couple of weeks later, riding as a passenger in my sister's car, returning from visiting these friend again, crossing the same point, I looked out across the lake to the west and saw what appeared to be a UFO hovering and at that instance it appeared that a blue beam of light flashed from the object to the ground. Having recently read about abductions and that a lot of the people abducted stated that they were moved from the ground to the ship on a beam of blue light, I would guess an abduction may have been in process. This second encounter now adds the possible purpose of the first sighting as that maybe they were locating this abductee. I was unable to watch the second sighting unfold, being that may sister had no intention of stopping that close to what could be a UFO. I feel extemely fortunate to have had this experience as it has helped to open my mind to the fact that there is more going on around us than we can ever imagine.",1999-04-26T00:00:00,36.0769630261661,-79.81581387940841

It was about 20'-30' from the ground.  We were standing on his front porch.  It came in our direction and then stopped above a fruit tree directly across the driveway from where we were.  It was about the size of a VW Beetle, perfectly circular, with a triangular projection at the ""back.  My aunt had locked the front door to prevent us kids from running through the house.  I pounded on the door to get the adults to come out and see this thing.  My cousin said that when I started pounding and yelling, the object took off and streaked up over the mountain in the direction of the mountain (Rattlesnake mtn.), in the direction of Seattle.  Our parents brought us into the house and put us into different rooms and had us draw a picture of what we had seen.  Our pictures matched, and I remember that our par! ents believed that we had seen something.  The next day (as I remember it) my father told my mother that ""something "" was reported in the Seattle paper, streaking across the sky at about the right time for it to have been the thing we saw.  I was 9yo at the time as was my cousin.  We had both lived in Alaska and had watched airplanes and heliocopters landing near our home and knew that this was nothing like conventional aircraft.  It was perfectly silent; if we hadn't been looking we would never have known it was there.   It was completely featureless also. I remember people asking if there were windows or portholes or doors but we were firm that there were not.  We were very close to this object, no more than 50' at the most.  It excited me and frightened me a little bit.  I thought that it stopped opposite us because it ""saw"" us.  I have never heard any other report of an object which looked like the one we saw.  It looked to me as though it had been manufactured, did not lo! ok like a natural object, was definitely not gaseous.  Anyone else out there ever see anything like this?  I am not sure of the date.  It is most likely that it was 1953 because I was still living in the Snoqualmie/North Bend area at the time and my family was visiting my cousin's family.  Interestingly and dissapointingly, my cousin does not remember the object as looking the way I describe it.  He now says it was silver and saucer-shaped.  It was not, and we agreed at the time on how it looked.  I remember being frustrated at not being able to really draw the way it looked.  I realize now that I couldn't replicate the geometrical precision of the thing. We were children of the same age, and had no background as such.  We knew nothing about ""flying saucers"" except that we must have heard talk about them because I remember explaining that it was not a ""flying saucer"", it was round and had a tail.  My father was an employee of Seattle City Light and my mother did not work outside the home.  I was an only child at the time.  My cousin was one of 4 children,  His father was a logger and his mother was employed but I don't remember at what at that time.  We were semi-sophisticated kids in that we had traveled to Alaska by stemship with our families several times and had had the experience of living on the fringes of civilization as well as in the Seattle area.  Perhaps because I was an only child, I have an excellent memory and clear early memories. I realize that this is OLD information and not at all scientific but I don't know anyone else who has seen something like this so ""Up close and personal"".  If I hadn't seen this thing! , I would never believe the reports I've read about the objects other people have seen.  I empathize with the skeptics, it's just too fantastic.  But, since I have seen it, I can no longer doubt that there is something more to this world than we now ""know"". ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,47.4793,-121.543

This light seemed to be coming from behind a red diamond shape pattern.The dome doors would open periaudicly It seemed that since we could see the red diamond shape pattern that the dome wasn't spinning yet the rest of the disk was.Anyway it wasa great sighting and i've been looking ever since.Till the sighting i submitted today over Ridgecrest Ca.    17 years later!",1999-04-26T00:00:00,35.7339,-117.3672

It was the summer of '85, we all had finished our season as a tender in Alaska, our ship was a 300' Vessel we were on our way to Seattle, there were four on board me (deleted) my brother (deleted) and our father (deleted) and our chief enginnier.

My brother (deleted) is a first-mate and we share shift's together, ours is from 12 midnight to 6am,  were all up in bridge when I saw a Bright light under our ship, it lite up the whole ship under water we were in motion about 9 knots or so, can't go too fast in the passage, then it moved towards the bow of the vessel...within seconds it was gone? My father the Captain said I was a whale that was moving under us and the (phosferus) in the water was making the light...? mabe he was right but I remembered the jet that flew over head that woke us up earlier, it buzzed us a few times and was gone...we were very glad that we were on our way back home to Seattle! so nothing more about it...as our father said, are we ready to take over...warned us about going fast in here, we said don't worry we'll be fine, about this time I ask my brother if he was hungry, I said I'll go to the galley and make us something to eat...he said ok...I waited for a moment or two he said, what about the food?, I said ok then I traveled down the stairs to the galley, I was looking in the cooler to see what I can make... I think I started cooking on the grill or making sandwitches...I was looking out the porthole I saw the trees....wondering why I can see them so cleary? I was night time and It looked like daytime...so I heard my brother on the intercom yelling at me to come up to the pilot house!!!! so I ran up the stairs...as I got outside It was daylight! all around the ship! everywhere I looked I saw light it was bright at first, but my eyes were trying to get used to the light, I got upstairs finale and my brother is talking loud!!! can you see that? I said yeah I can...we opened the side door to the bridge and we could come out but I was stopped by him grabbing me saying Tony don't go!!!! as soon as we did stop or talk the light was gone...back to darkness...it was werid cause our or my eyes had to adjust back to the night....in silence for a long time my brother asked me did I see that? What Happened?....I turned on the light's and noticed that his face was burned, mine was alittle my right hand, had a werid burn on it, as I look on my hand now it's gone, I thought I would have that burn forever....my brother face cleared up the next day, mabe a few days...we told everyone we knew,  all thought we were crazy....by the way our trip back home? as soon as you leave the inside passage, you enter the outside Ocean,  it was to be bad weather....it was flat calm...not even a ripple...no wind...sunny skies all the way back to Seattle....that was very unusal for this time of year....I'll never forget what happened to me and my brother (deleted)!. I remember this as if it happened yesterday!....to be more detailed the lights did change from white to yellow, very bright colors, there was no sound...the night was black so fast as if someone turned out the light's? I know the object was round the shape was very huge much bigger and closer than I ever thought of to be, as the UFO left I did hear the engines again so mabe there was a sound?, there was not a loud sound that I remember? but we noticed that this did take time to do all this, It felt like seconds or a few minutes..but not 2 hours I notice that it was later than, it was alittle after 2am I believed it started around 12 ish...I guess the ufo went straight up or behind us cause there were light colored particles in the air, as if it sped away in a half a second, extermely fast, gone.…",1999-04-26T00:00:00,58.53633908045977,-134.71346206896553

I looked out my front windshield and approx. 100' ahead of me and 100' high I saw what appeared to be '3' rows of stadium type lighting.  The lights were all white, but not bright enough that you couldn't look at it.  At first glance I thought nothing of it.  I blew it off as stadium lighting or some kind of neighborhood lighting.  I then turned back to listen to what my girlfriend was saying.  Suddenly, it hit me...There is no lighting in that area.  The only thing in that area is a vacant field. (approx. 1 square acre). So I quickly turned my head back toward the lights and said, ""What is that!?"".  Before my girlfriend could turn her head to observe it, the lights disappeared.  It was as if someone turned off the light switch.  I was frozen with disbelief.  I didn't say anything or take my eyes off of! the spot.  I didn't even say another word.  My girlfriend kept asking me ""what?"", ""What was it?"", ""Talk to me you're scaring me."". I didn't talk. I just slowly got out of my car, walked directly to the spot where I had seen the lights and looked up.  NOTHING was there I MEAN NOTHING! I was standing directly below where I had seen the lights and nothing was around me...no poles...no lights...nothing. I proceeded to tell my girlfriend what I had seen and she blew it off as some sort of stress related hallucination....However, a couple of nights later we were in her driveway and I was giving her a hug.  I had my back to the ""SITE AREA"" and she was facing it.  Suddenly she says, ""Did it look like that!?"".  I turned quickly, but just as the last time it was gone.  Before I could turn my head.  She reacted the same way I did.  She was frozen and couldn't speak.  She walked over to the same spot as I did and looked up in awe. She said, ""I saw it."" ""I saw what you told me about the o! ther day and just when I asked you about it, it disappeared as if someone had flipped the light switch.""........What did we see??  Was it listening to us??  Was it trying to monitor our behavior?? For years I have been telling people about what I had seen.  To this day, noone has been able to explain it.

After a few moments the glow got more clear and about a dozen red lights in no noticable arrangment dropped through the clouds and then quickly shot upward. While driving south on Interstate 15 about 20 miles North of St. George Utah I noticed a red glow lighting up a small area of the low lying cloud bank.  I could tell that it was being lite up from above and not below (as city lights would do) and it was also not a very bright light or it would have lite up a larger area. The area that was lite up was about the size of a very large house. I was driving a loaded semi, so it took me a about a minute or two to come to a safe stop. I got out and observed it for about a minute or so. The spot of glow never moved in any direction for the few minutes I watched it. I say this because the glow never moved even up or down because the lighting did not get brighter or dimmer. Then it became clear that the object was lowering itself straight down. The glow became brighter and clearer until it completely dropped below the clouds for about 2 seconds, then quickly went straight up until I could no longer see even a hint of red glow. It moved up about the speed of a helicopter on a quick take off. The clouds were so low that I could have easily seen if the clouds were being disturbed by the wind that a helicopter would have produced but the clouds were not disturbed at all. Leaving me most curious about what propulsion system could produce no push or pull wind. A hot air baloon could have done what I saw if it wasn't for the lights. This had about a dozen red lights about the brightness of marker lights on planes and seem to be placed in no particular order. I could not see any of the object that the lights were on because it was dark except for the clouds and the glow. The craft ( as I assume it had to be ) was not flat, round, tubular, or anything else that would have a uniform surface around it. The lights were as if they were mounted on something with various surface levels. Like lights would look if mounted on an engine. My personal opinion of the movement of the craft was as if it was peeking below the clouds or suddenly realized it was below the clouds and didn't w! ant to be. Then took off like a child who has been caught.",1998-09-26T00:00:00,37.2262,-113.485

The sighting took place on or about April 5, 1997 in Fairhope, Alabama (Baldwin County) at 2:00 pm (central time). The witness reported this sighting to the Fairhope Courier and to Clompton Jones of MUFON. The details reported to those sources varies from those reported to this writer. This investigator cannot account for those variances. The witness stated he was walking his dog on the streets of Fairhope on a Saturday afternoon, although the witness, when pressed, could not remember the exact date. He believes April 5 to be the approximate date. The witness reported the weather as ""sunny and clear,"" with a breeze. The witness stated he was walking west toward Mobile Bay. As he was about to cross the street, the witness observed the object west of his position (in front of the witness), at an elevation of approximately 30 . The object was reported to be ""the length of the Fairhope pier"" from the witness, and was drifting very slowly to the north. After viewing the object for 30 seconds to one minute, the object continued to move north and disappeared behind foliage. No sound was reported. There was no reaction from his dog. The object was described as ""generally tire-shaped,"" round, light greyish-beige in color, with a row of 8 to 10 square black windows with a blue frame around them. The apparent size of the object was reported to be the same as an object one inch long held at arm's length. No other external details, appendages, etc. were reported. This case was initially investigated by Ross VonVolkenburg (MUFON).

Hmmmm- perhaps you can help clear up an incident that has been nagging at me.  I was attending the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas starting 4/5/97- I believe it was Tuesday the 8th, about 8pm, I looked out the window of the Flamingo Hilton and saw what looked to like a dark piece of paper caught in an updraft. It shifted erratically in a descending pattern and at times almost disappeared from view when it was ""on edge"". As the object moved lower and it became framed by the backdrop of mountains I came to the conclusion that it was much farther away than I had initially thought and well outside of the city.  I tried to reassess the scale of the object, but found it difficult. At a guess I would say the object was 15 or more miles from the city and looked like a windblown piece of construction paper at 100 feet. The scale of horizontal and vertical shifts in trajectory also took on the appearance of a much greater distance and considerable implied ! speed. The object dissappeared from view perhaps 10-15 seconds after initial siting. Perhaps 2 or 3 minutes later 2 sets of dual vapor trails emmerged along the horizon and as they reached the point where the object appeared to have descended the planes (these were obviously planes and what looked to be military planes) forked out in opposite directions. I mentioned it to a couple of colleagues in the airport the next day on the return to Seattle, a woman in line overheard me and suggested that it could have been a Stealth aircraft.

I still watch aircraft flying high over the Sacramento/Elk Grove area.  I can usually identify the model of aircraft (747s, DC10s, 727s, 737s, DC-9/80s, B-52s, KC-135s, KC-10s, etc.).

The space inside the perimeter of the object was almost transparent.  I could see the blue sky through it.  The white edge around the craft looked like a slow spinning gear.  It moved north in a straight line.  The craft was flying at a high altitude.  It had no wings and it did not emit smoke.  There was no contrail.  No lights.  No sound.  At high altitude, it was longer than, and much wider than, a high flying B-52.  At least two times as wide.  It was not moving across the sky as fast as a large jet aircraft.  Because it was transparent, I can't estimate how tall it was.  I have never seen anything like this object.  It was not a large helicopter.  It was not a hot air balloon.  It did not look capable of flight. I tried to show my son the object, but I lost sight of it twice when I momentarily looked away.

In the nort-eastern sky, I noticed that the entire sky was flashing quickly and regularly, like a strobe light, only slower.  The flashes were bright enough to have been lightening, but I doubt they were, because they were too frequent, and too regular in frequency.  I would estimate the frequency of the flashes to be around 4-5 flashes per second, evenly spaced in time. The entire duration of my sighting was approximately 10 seconds.  The entire portion of the sky that I could see was lighting up, but it definitely appeared as though the source of the flashing lights was in the north-eastern sky, which happens to be the approximate direction of the Mount Hamilton observatory (I think that's the name of it -- during the day, the telescope is visible on the mountain top).

Last night, Feb. 20, 1999, my wife and I were sitting in our sunroom at 11:40 PM.  We sit out there quite often to watch the animals in our yard, three and a half acres in rural Rhode Island.  We were watching a fox feed on bread we had put out when the craft appeared heading in a southerly direction.  We stepped out to the porch for a better look.   The craft passed over us silently, slowly, steadily.  The underside of it was dimly lighted by a hazy white light, thus making it possible to see the logo.  The logo was a triangle edged in yellow containing the Earth being struck by two red lightning bolts with a number ""1"" in the right hand corner all on a black background.  As it approached, a feeling of serenity and calm came over us making it a wonderful feeling to watch as it passed overhead.  I estimate the speed of the craft at approximately five to ten miles per hour.   The size approximately forty feet in length and forty feet wide at the rear of the craft with the nose of the craft forming a point. The craft looked very similar to the Stealth fighter, however, it was much larger than the plane.  The altitude of the craft was approximately one hundred feet.  I repeat, there was not a sound from the craft and it did not even create a breeze.  I will email you a copy of the logo we made.

They were in the southern hemisphere, about 30 degrees from horizontal.  They were very far away.  They looked similar to 2 airplanes flying directly towards me.  I could not see any distinguishing features. The sky was clear, but since I couldn't see as many stars as usual, there may have been a thin layer of clouds. The clouds were thick enough to block out all but the brightest stars.  Very few stars were visible. The 3 stars on Orion's belt were visible but dim.  I was able to watch the 2 objects on my way home from work. I drive south on the Hutchinson River Parkway in Westchester.  They were in my field of view the entire time. I stopped at a golf driving range on weaver street because I had a clear view from there.  I saw several very small and faint objects moving in the general vicinity.  These objects had blinking lights.  They also seemed to be moving faster than they should have been for the distance they were from me.  When I arrived home, the 2 lights were still in the same exact relationship to each other and appeared to not move in the 30 min it took for me to get home. Once home, I observed their position for about 10 more minutes.  I could not detect any movement.  I left the room for about 30 minutes and when I went to check up on the 2 lights, they were gone.

Since it looked like from my vantage point that they were over Manhattan, someone suggested it was 2 blimps. But their distance between each other never changed for the hour I observed it. I would like to know if anyone else has reported this and if you know what I was seeing. thank you ((name deleted))",1999-04-02T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518
Two lights similar to planets but with unusual coloration and slow but discernable motion.

The fact that the observer does not cite the other bright objects in the western, or southwestern, sky, in addition to the objects he observed, suggest to us that he may well have been looking at the conjunction of four planets.)) Two lights similar to planets but with unusual coloration and slow but discernable motion. Each eventually faded from sight. Approximateley 20:00 local time, approximately due West, approximately 30 degrees above the (distant) horizon: I observed two fairly bright lights separated nearly vertically by about the width of two full moons. The lower was considerably brighter than the upper. They looked exactly like two planets and I assumed that is what they were. About 10 minutes later I noticed them again but perhaps 20 degrees above and slightly further north on the horizon. The spacing appeared to be exactly the same. I realized planets would not be moving this fast so I grabbed my 10 power binoculars for a better look. Through the binoculars the upper light had a pronouced orange coloration similar to a sodium vapor lamp. The lower light appeared to be an almost bluish white, then on longer inspection it seemed to be cycling through several colors. It was considerably brighter than the upper. At this point I called my wife, Debby, who has low vision but with her monocular observed the two lights. She describes one as brighter and possibly changing color. I steadied my binoculars on a porch railing. I was now able to just barely make out that the lower light was composed of either two white lights one above the other or a verically elongated white light. Between the two lights (or at the center of the elongated one) and barely to the left (south) was a red light flashing once every second or two. Apparently this is what I mistook for changing colors. I now called my uncle Tom, to grab his binoculars and look. No more than a minute can have passed but when I got back outside, the lower and previously brighter light had faded to near invisibilty (it was no longer visible to me without my binoculars). While I watched, it continued to fade until it was no longer visible (about 30 more seconds). So Uncle Tom only observed the upper light, but he also felt it was moving very slowly. I now concentrated on the upper light. The color and brightness were unchanged but as I watched, it appeared to slowly elongated vertically to a length that was still a small fraction of the width of the moon (maybe 5%). This may have taken half a minute. It then began to fade. Over perhaps another 30 seconds it faded to near invisibility and I lowered my binoculars. Maybe 15 seconds later I raised the binoculars for one more look and it was again visible but at only about half its original brighness. It then slowly faded away. Through all this its color never changed. Occasionally during this period I swung my binoculars to various stars. They all were clearly point sources of light, unlike the unknown objects that appeared to be slightly elongated. Yet the elongation of the upper object was so slight I kept wondering if it could have been caused by a trembling of the binoculars. Still I did not see it on stars. Still I repeat, although the lower light was tiny, even through binoculars, I could clearly distinquish an elongated white light with a flashing red light slightly to the left and centered vertically. There were no stars clearly visible as near the horizon as the objects but toward the zenith the stars were clear and bright. I am familiar with the sight of airplanes at night. I am 60 miles south of Pittsburgh PA and there are almost always one or two visible in the night sky. The unknown objects moved far two slowly to be airplanes and the lights were simply not the same. And although I obsereved airplanes elsewhere in the sky during this period, I never saw any near the objects. They were not LEO satellites. They moved far two slowly and they were much too bright. I am absolutely certain they were not celestial objects. The colors, the motion and the fading demonstrate that. I have seen many objects in the sky that were unusual at first glance but that I was eventually able to identify. Prolonged observation proved these objects to be more and more strange. I have no idea what it was that I saw.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,39.7572,-79.9022

I observed the above-mentioned object which was about the size of a dime held at arm's length.  It sped much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen, appearing from the southwest and racing in ascending path toward the north (it appeared at approximately 30-35 degrees off the horizon, and climbed to approximately 50-55 degrees).  Then, about two seconds later, it simply vanished.  It didn't diminish in size, or fade, or slow down.  It was just gone, leaving no trace behind.  In terms of how close it was to me, I can only estimate.  I am five miles from Dulles Airport, in a flight path for that airport, and this object was between me and Dulles.  I'd say it was no more than a mile from where I stood, probably closer than that, and no more than 5000 feet in altitude, and probably less than that.  Its actual size I estimate to be about that of a passenger jet (a Boeing 727 or thereabouts). The sky was crystal clear that night.  In fact, it was probably the clearest sky we've had here all year.  Many stars were visible that are not, usually.  I was on my balcony at the time of the sighting, and I spend a lot of time there, sky-watching.  I'm very familiar  with the kinds of aircraft that usually swarm about this area, and watch them all, in order to become familiar enough with them that I won't be fooled by one into thinking I've seen a genuine UFO when it is, in fact, an airplane.  The object I saw on this night went incomprehensibly fast, and was absolutely without sound, and I know it was not any kind of conventional aircraft.  The fact that it was ascending indicates it was not a meteorite, and I learned later that an Iridium flare traveled the same route as my object, but three minutes AFTER I saw the object.  Having gotten the URL to a website which gives times of Iridium flare flyovers, I went out to see one the next night, and I did see one, and can say with certainty that what I saw on June 22nd was NOT an Iridium flare.  I just do not know what it was. One other detail about the object: it was the brightest white light I have ever seen, and it had a pale blue rim that blended into the white light.  The overall effect was of a ""bluish-white"" light.",1999-08-10T00:00:00,38.93909303435114,-77.34533272900764

Driving to CA for vacation on I-40 westbound near Alb. NM at 10:30 p.m.Thursday night, June 10th.  I was in passenger seat looking at millions of stars.  Noticed two intensely bright stars in the northern sky, about 20-25 degrees above the horizon, and asked my fiancee to pull over so I could look at them.  They were, at that time, parallel to the car.  Watched them for about a minute then got out the binoculars to see if we could see what they were.  All we saw were just intensely blue light with what seemed to be an aura around them, which could have been atmospheric interference.  They were still and looked just like really bright stars but they were just too bright and too big.  Very suddenly, the light on the left took off at an amazingly fast speed to the west, dipped down a bit, then up and just STOPPED in the sky again.  The object on the right just started to ""mosey"" through the sky toward the east.  We continued to drive west on I-40 trying to get to where it was, to put it parallel to the car again and see what the heck it was.  The road was straight, we were driving like crazy to catch up to ""it"" when another light just ""blinked"" on in the sky right in front of us.  (That was a real shocker!)  It started moving slowly in the direction of the light which had moved so quickly to the west, then just went away, perhaps behind a mountain.  We never could catch up to the westbound light.  We watched it for about 30 minutes or so, got to a little town and lost it. The light on the ""right"" had what seemed to be a blinking light of somekind...no noise but it must have been pretty high.  We had turned the car off and were in the middle of nowhere. The light which ""blinked"" on in front of us appeared to have a light, as well but I really don't think either of them was a plane or hellicopter.  I could be wrong.  But the light which darted off to the left was amazing!  We were driving at 75/80 mph for at least half an hour and never did get it parallel to the car again...not even close.  The sudden movement to the west was instantaneous...maybe two seconds to go, which must have been, better than 50 miles. My fiancee is 54, director of an arts organization.

Two Days apart. First. Line of red lights rising from behind mountain range, hover and descend. Second. Greenish glowing ball with thick red-orange tail shoot out of clouds then disappear. On or about June 19, 1999 I was camping in southeast Oregon in the Alvord Dry Lake area which is near the Nevada Idaho border, just north of a little town call Fields. The dry lake is a huge area that is bordered on either side by mountain ranges  We were camped on Pike Creek, about 35 minutes up the dirt and gravel road, which is on the western side of the Lake.  The sun had gone down, the night was relatively clear. Sighting 1:We were sitting facing east toward the opposite end of the lake looking at the mountain range.  We suddenly saw a line of red lights about the length of an index finger held horizontally against the horizon rise from behind the mountain range.  The color of the lights were the same as taillights to a car except that there were many of these lights in a row, seemingly connected.  The lights rose, hovered about an inch or so, relative to us, above the mountain range for several seconds and then sank back below the mountains.  Because it was so far away and all we saw were lights we could not determine the shape of the object.  What we saw was a horizontal line.  The lights had a moving glowing quality.  Perhaps the object could have been round like a saucer ringed with red lights.  Because the distance from us to the other side of the lake was several miles I can only assume that this object must have been huge.  Both my friend and I said at the same time ""Did you see that?"" So I know I was not imagining it.  A few days later we happened to take a drive to the other side of the mountains, about a two hour drive, and there is absolutely nothing over there.  Just more desert, more wilderness. Sighting 2: Then two nights later, on or about July 21, we were sitting again looking out across the expanse.  The night was cloudy and seemed to threaten rain.  Out of the clouds at our eye level we saw a green/pale green glowing orb about the size of a golf ball held at arm's length streak from out of the clouds.  The orb had a short thick reddish/orange tail and just as quickly as we had seen it disappeared behind a cloud.  We saw this more to the north of the previous sighting and it seemed to be inside the dry lake area as opposed to the previous sighting which appeared to be on the other side of the mountain range.  This could be a natural phenomenon, some kind of huge static ball maybe although I have never heard of anything like this before.  There was no sound and it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.  But it lasted long enough to leave a lasting impression on my mind.  The object was very clear.  I think what's important is that the object was not up in the sky like an asteroid but right at eye level just a little bit above the mountain range.  We both saw it and both said simultaneously,""What was that?"" Again, because of the distance from where we were to the other side of the dry lake area this object must have been huge.  I can't even begin to calculate the size of it.",1999-08-30T00:00:00,,

My brother distinctly recalls it being the day after the July 4th celebrations.  Here are more details of the sighting:  I am a UFO investigator in the Yukon Territory and am submitting this  report on the behalf of my brother who had a UFO sighting near Chicago.  I interviewed him on July 22nd. He is on the road a lot so if you need  further information from him just contact myself.  The map attached shows the witness was driving along I-90 south  eastbound. The witness first observed the object at point A and last  observed it at point B.  Arrows indicate the approximate direction of  the UFO at both points; A and B. The curve in the road allows for a nice  triangulation if the object was stationary. It appeared to be stationary  to the witness. He initially thought it might be a blimp or a tethered  balloon, perhaps something to do with the July 4th celebrations.  However, the cylindrical and slightly tapered shape perplexed him.  Didn't match the shape of a blimp or balloon (See attached drawing).  The object looked fairly large and was just above the horizon and an  estimated few thousand feet up. It was gray in color  He observed the object for an estimated 5 to 10 minutes while driving  between points A and B and lost it due to the right-hand curve in the  freeway at point B. The turn caused his vehicle to face away from the  object. The time was roughly 3 in the afternoon. The sun was shining but  the overall sky had a whitish-greyish cast, it wasn't a clear blue sky.  Hope this is of use. It may be possible to inquire in the area if there  was some sort strange shaped blimp/ballon in the area the day after July  4th holiday.

Of the four vehicles only 2 appeared as almost 200% larger than the other two.  The smaller vehicles seems to tags the 2 larger vehicles in a almost regular formation or line of the larger vehicles.  The night was cool and crystal clear with what was unlimited visability, so clear and dark that I could see the gas in the milky way very distictivly, planet colors, etc. I was sitting on the front steps at my home looking at the sky, no moon out, 3200 ft. elev. in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  As I looked over the topsof the trees at some distance maybe 5 to 10 miles out I noticed 4 circular vehicles.  As I watched for the 5+ minutes they appeared to move in quick trangular steps, almost as in a pattern.  I believe the position they moved was in the South Southwestern skies as my view was a southern exposure, always just hugging the tree tops so they would have must have been at an altitude that varied from maybe as low as -2k ft. to maybe +10K ft.  At a noticable lowere left corner these vehicles, not necessarily together, the larger circles (more of a whiteish/blue with occasions of amber in color) would go from this position to a position through my center vision (assuming tht is 3200 ft.) to almost twice that height moving up and right at say 40 to 50 degrees to their top altitude so this is where I beleive they had moved to maybe 10K ft.  Each of the larger disc's would have a trailing smaller disk.  Comparativly looking around -2x smaller than the large disk (they had a more reddish color but at time appeared to stobe and the color became more of a flashy silver or shiney electric blue arcing color) and the smaller vehicles alway followed the larger disc without exchanging from one larger to the other, always staying in an almost direct pattern following the larger disc.  I as watched I thought of what this may be, certainly not aircraft as the speed of the position changes, ratio and excess of position movement was way to complex.  Testing my thoughts on this I watched the larger disc move from )using the lower triangular position above left slightly below the trees but visable throught the tree tops, it would (using the old one-thosand & one, etc. method of counting seconds) move from this position to the top position of the triangle before I could get to to one-thousand...  Accounting for the estimated distance of 5 to maybe 15 miles the fact it would have travelle! d from maybe 2000 or less feet to easily 10000 feet in that time, coverning my visual horizion of say 1/10th these objects were booking some MPH. I heard no noise, no booms, nothing except wind in the trees.  As each disc continued to do this I sat and watch the larger discs move at different points no mirroring no pattern copy but very simular triangular moves, each being followed by the smaller dot as compared to the larger disc the smaller vehicles actually looked like dots, but circular with diamaters.  The smaller dots would at time mirror the larger disc but as a rule they would appear to stray a minor fraction of the larger disc course change and as a rule they appeared to keep varied distances from the larger disc.  No real rules that I could see where the smaller disc would stay exactly in position like a trailer may in the wind, but more like if a rubber band was attached slinging behind.  The smaller dots stayed the larger disc with mainly the same move but at a varied speed, sometime as if to pass it (but never did) and other times as if it was being bungeed in reverse to leave it (but never did) only to follow at diffrent rates back to the larger disc.  As I watched for almost 5 minutes this dance between the 2 larger discs and 2 smaller dots for each larger disc the rate of my counting off the timing was almost always consistant until the very end of the sighting.  As I watched the patterns (triangles) near the end the motions by both started to flatten out this pattern until one large disc trailed off to the right at about 10 to 15 degrees from my horizon, from a dead stop and as I thought of these seconds counting in my head, the departure off and up into the horizon was so fast my count was like one...and it was gone with the dot.  The second large disc and dot stayed around for about another 30 to 45 secs. and it appeared to dash off straight in my direction, it was not quite as fast of a departure more like the pattern timing but I expected to see it get maybe a bit larger as it came str! aight towards me but it didn't and if it did I am certain because of the speed my eyes and mind probably couldn't determine a size change.  In closing the only other comment is that the larger disc kept the almost bluish/white with an occasional amber coloring, but the dots were always in flux and only seems to go electric blue in color as they reached the apex of that bundged thrust either in reverse or in a forward return motion (like on a bunge cord down the up) as you reach the thrusting end motion.  I sat for may 20 more minutes looking to see if there was any further action and I saw nothing unusual, a few obvious planes, a satellite a shooting star or two, but nothing else that evening.

I had earlier in the morning called attention to chemtrail activity over Kansas City Missouri to my 18 year old daughter who was a passenger in the car with me. The incident I am reporting however is a gray line that appeared to emerge from the distant horizon.  This gray, translucent line appeared to be about two inches wide when measured against my outstretched fist. I had a sense this may have been electrical in nature. The line extended from the horizon to directly overhead.  I opened the sunroof of the car so my daughter could determine how far the line ran above and behind the car. Overhead, however, we saw a high altitude plane leaving a contrail behind it and the plane was precisely following the gray line.  The gray line gradually faded and disappeared completely approximately seven minutes after we first noticed it. The plane continued ahead of us leaving its contrail. I have just recently become aware of chemtrails but in my reading about them thus far I've not heard anyone mention the gray line coming up out of the horizon.  Has this previously been reported?  Is there a known significance?

I actually live in Central Washington State, but I was in California at the time visiting my Mother.  The date was specifically October 5th, 1998 and it was in the evening, about 8:00 PM California time, and it was dark. I was in the parking lot at my girlfriend saying good night when her little boy of 10 years old said ""Look at that!"" I turned and viewed one of the most elegant things I've ever seen! With my wide span view between the trees I saw very long streak in the sky moving on a horizenal plane. It was moving similar to a shooting star, with an extremely long tail, and it was the most brilliant ""Green"" color I've ever seen. The front was much larger and brighter than the trailing edge, and I noticed that it was moving slower that a shooting star, but still a a great speed. Surprisingly, it appeared very low in the sky. (About 20 to 30 degrees above the horizen.) It had a ""flat"" trajectory (no movement up or down) and the sight lasted at least more than 10 seconds in clear view. Along the trailing end, which I repeat was very long, there were tiny (but fine) speckles of white ""glitter"" like from the a ferry's wand. The actual tail of this thing appeared to be over 20 miles long. It was identical to the one the lady described when you played her voice recording on the radio show. I had a 90 degree clear view horizonally of this thing and it was simply remarkable. As my back was facing the ocean, I viewed this as it was moving from my left to my right side. This means I was facing a easterly direction. (with a little North added) I was actually in ""Dana Point"" California one block from the ocean, facing towards the approximate direction of San Antinio Peak which is located about 20 miles NE of Ontairo. (I've done a lot of flying in this area.)  So this thing was coming from... a Northly direction, and going to a Southerly direction. Almost the opposite direction of the Lady's sighting. Now this lady I dicribed above just had her sighting tonight 12/18/98, while my ""identical"" sighting in California was on 10/5/98 . Over 2,000 miles of seperation!

One object shot off at extreme speed. I am filing this report in behalf of my family as follows; Four white completely silent objects were seen northeast of 64th. St and Peak View Rd. Cave Creek, Az. at 6:40 P.M.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 20 minutes and was witnessed by 4 people ages 20,  (daughter)48(wife), 71(mother in law), and 72(father in law). The objects appeared approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and were initially spaced approximately 1 foot apart at arms length as they   moved about randomly in the same general area. The objects were at different altitudes initially then one object began to descend slowly. During descent the object became very bright (appeared to become larger).  The objects seemed to take turns descending and rising. While observing one object, another instantly appeared appeared next to it (seemed to come from knowhere). There were no other lights associated with each object (only one light source). One observer stated that when the objects lowered the light changed it shape to become somewhat pointed on the top and bottom and thicker in the middle. The same observer indicated that the size of the objects were about the same size as a standard household lightbulb at about 150 ft. distance. Another characteristic of the objects is that they would become dimmer when moving but becomming noticeably brighter when hovering or descending. Two of the observers reported that one of the objects shot off at an extreme speed almost too fast to follow at an approximate 30 degree angle upward and disappeared. No aircraft were in the area at the time of the sighting. All observers are of sound mind and have stated that they have never seen anything as bizzare as this.  We all frequently see aircraft landing lights for all types of aircraft since we are north of Scottsdale airport, Deer Valley Airport, and Phoenix Sky Harbor airport but these objects were distinctly different not only in appearance but movement. This writer is a company Vice President, Aerospace Engineer, and licensed pilot and very experienced with many different types of military and commercial aircraft and aviation technology in general.

At one point it seemed to change into a mist like form, but was still illuminated and visible. While on a fishing trip at Heron lake in Northern New Mexico, I witnessed a strange light rise very quickly above what appeared to be the Taos area, in the East from where we were. The light was constantly changing colors from green to red to white to blue. I thought it was a military helicopter because they are always up in that part of the wood, but then it shot straight towards us, real fast like. We're talking 100 miles of ground between Taos and Heron, and that thing zipped it in thousands of a second. It stopped like almost over the lake, but must have been up around 8,000 feet or so. It continued to hover in place and change color for approx. 10 minutes or so. At this point I woke my daughter to see the UFO, cause it was almost 3am by this time and my fishing party was all bedded down for the night. We sat and watched and even tried to wake the others, but they dismissed me as being drunk or tired or something, which I was not. I continued to fish and to watch this THING, and we began to talk about it, when it started to change. It slowly seemed to vaporize. It turned into a cloud, but was still illuminated and was quite visible. It stayed in this form for about 5 minutes or so and then became one solid light again. At this point my daughter got scared and went back inside the camper, she's only 8yrs old, and this was something that really struck her as odd. I reeled in my fishing line and just sat there letting the fire die and watching alone when the thing started bouncing up and down at a very fast rate. It resembled a rubber ball, just bouncing up and down for at least 4 or 5 minutes and then stopped. Then it started to go from side to side, back and forth, at what seemed the same distance of travel each time for about the same duration of time as before. Now I was becoming scared, and was putting my gear away, when it stopped and then split into three separate lights, and formed a triangle and remained motionless for what seemed 15 minutes. I smothered the fire and sat in the door way of the camper and watched as it re-shaped into one solid light again. Now it was close to 3:30 am or so and when I got up to go inside, it shot off towards the West towards Dulce New Mexico, about another 40 miles or so. That was the last I saw of it, when it positioned over Taos before I went to bed.

I, in turn, became intrigued. Within the next hour, I saw five more of these objects. They appeared in the South-East part of the sky, and traveled soundlessly to the North-West, where they dissappeared out of my view.

At 22:29, I went out onto the back porch of my apartment which borders a heavily forrested area and stretched, looking up towards the Northwestern sky.  I was looking between two very tall cedar trees at the stars when I observed a glowing, greenish object moving steadily from approximately the Southeastern horizon to the Northwestern horizon.  I may very well have my directions a bit off center but I immediately thought that it was not a comet or meteorite because it was moving perfectly horizontally and not in a downward manner like an object entering the atmosphere.  It was definately not a private or commercial jet landing at Paine field and the object did not appear to be a missile because at an arms length of distance between thumb and forefinger, it measured at about8-10 millimeters in circumference.  I couldn't tell you how fast it was moving but it would be similar to watching a vehicle at maybe 20-25 miles an hour pass by you.  It was completely silent and a discernable glowing, greenish tail followed it.  I then went inside looking for the hotline number but couldn't find it so I decided to wait until I came to work tonight.  Then, at approximately 22:33 on the same night, I heard the most awful noise RESONATE from the forrested area behind our building.  It sounded like a cross between a coyote and a cow.  I'm not trying to speculate at any animal mutilations, but I began to freak out at that moment and brought my cats inside.  These howl-like noises continued for about six minutes at an interval of about a sound every thirty seconds, becoming more frequent towards the end.  Nothing else happened after that and the two incidents may or may not be related but on a side note, I work on the waterfront in downtown Seattle and have observed some interesting things floating about in the sky.  I listen to Art Bell on occasions when I can and I know that there are numerous sightings these days, so I hope this is useful information to you. Also, I just remembered that I noted that there were NO jets coming into or out of Paine Field for about three hours after this incident on the 14th.

Looking west, at about 20-30 degrees up from the horizon, saw strange light that appeared to be moving very slowly or hovering. Lights did not look like aircraft through binoculars. Had horizontal line of white lights, distinguishable through binoculars, and red lights above and below white row of lights, that seemed to throb brighter and dimmer, not blinking totally on and off. Watched the light in relation to other aircraft moving by. And, by the way, there seemed to be much more air traffic in that direction than usual. The night sky was very clear.  No clouds seen.  The object was barely distinguishable with out the assistance of binoculars for me, but my wife who is farsighted, could see without binoculars. I would say that it could have been a large plane going away from us, except that the event took about 6 to 7 minutes. The object moved from about 30 degrees up from the horizon down to the tree level and out of sight, which would be about 10 degrees above the horizon. The object, if moving away from us, would have been going east to west. However, over the 6 to 7 minutes, the object didn't move far, and it didn't appear to grow smaller as it would have had it been moving away. Also, I did not notice in colored lights on what would be the wing tips if looking at an aircraft from behind. One more thing about the object. we had been looking straight up and out toward the west for 5 to 10 minutes prior to it's ""arrival"". It was suddenly ""there"", and we had not seen it what so ever before our first visual sighting of it. Both my wife and I had been ""scanning"" the sky as we do almost nightly over the last two months. The other air traffic over our area, while looking west from the front of our house, was very heavy in the western sky.  One aircraft went over us from West to East, fairly low.  It also didn't appear to resemble what we typically see when regular airline passenger jets go over. It was also fairly quiet. Could have been military, but I can not verify that. Tonight has not been the first night we have seen ""unusual events"" in the sky.  In august, (I know it was a Sunday evening, and I believe it was 8/13/99) during the ""meteor storm"", we happened to see the very, VERY bright light in the west sky. It lasted long enough that my wife saw it first and said ""look at that"" - I saw the tail end of it, and it seemed to last for a good second or two. There was NO TAIL. It came, ""out of nowhere, without a tail like other falling stars"", according to my wife. I have never seen a falling star like that before. We have also seen a very dimly lit light going quickly across the sky, from NW to SE, directly overhead. About the size of a star. Round, no blinking lights. Looked like a headlight in fog, or a flashlight shining through a sheet of white paper. Small, even with binoculars. Since I didn't write down the dates and times or report those incidents, I won't submit seperate reports for those incidents. However, I wanted to include this information, as my wife and I feel like many things are happening that don't quite fit the norm, and it is the reason why I took the time to write about the event we saw tonight so that it can be recorded... just in case... and so I can remember the date and time (I lose track of time more and more)...

The craft made absolutely no noise. During the week of August 30, 1999, my friend Laura and I were visiting Matthews, NC, a suburb ten miles south east of Charlotte NC. (We’re from Spartanburg, SC, approximately 60 miles south. I (36 year old white male) have worked in law enforcement for fifteen years and Laura (30 year old while female) has been a school teacher for eight years.) On Tuesday August 31, we attended an outdoor concert in a park located approximately three miles east of Matthews. As the concert ended, around 2330 hours, Laura and I headed toward the parking lot with approximately thirty other people. We were between the park and parking lot, in a wooded walkway area, when all the lights – in the park, wooded area, and parking lot – went out. Everyone stopped in their place to let our eyes adjust to the darkness and someone said something about a power failure. I then noticed something – like a shadow – over my shoulder. (The sky was clear with a quarter moon. The moon, however, was not high in the sky yet.) I turned and looked directly up. Floating above us, approximately 150 feet up, was a huge, black craft. The two front sides of the craft were triangular, but the back side was wing shaped. The craft was at least 100 yards wide (wing tip to wing tip) and 50 to 60 yards long (front to back). (All of these measurements are based upon the height of the trees and light poles we saw the craft pass over). I said loudly enough to make sure everyone heard me, ""Look up.” As everyone looked up, there was a group gasp. This craft FLOATED above us (from east to west) and out over the parking lot. The craft made absolutely NO sound. There were no lights on or around the craft – it was completely black. A man standing in front of us had a video camera. He attempted to video the craft but his battery had died. I grabbed Laura’s hand and moved quickly into the parking lot to get a better look and the others followed us. The craft traveled over the lot and then turned north, away from Matthews and Charlotte. As the craft moved away, all ! the ligh ts in the lot came back on and we could no longer see the craft. (The craft was visible for approximately 15 minutes). I grabbed Laura’s hand again and pulled her toward the car. She did not want to moved and I then realized she was crying. She asked where we were going and I said I wanted to follow the craft. I finally got her into the car. As I looked back to the other people, I saw that most of them seemed to be very upset. Some, including men, were also crying. I attempted to follow the craft in the car, but not being familiar with the area, quickly became lost. We never saw the craft again. I found my way back to the parking lot. Now there were 70 to 80 people in the lot. (Some of the others had been elsewhere in the park when the craft went over and had followed it’s direction to the lot.) Everyone seemed calm again. The man with the video camera now found it working again. Another man called two radio stations and reported what had happened. The radio people listened politely but didn’t seem too concerned. The man then called a local television station. When the television person heard what the call was about, she hung up. A group of us stayed around and talked for a while and then went our own ways. I asked Laura if the craft had scared her enough to make her cry. She stated she wasn’t scared but felt very emotional. She also couldn’t understand why I wanted to chase the “thing.” This was the first time either Laura or I had seen any sort of strange craft. She was never interested in UFOs before but I always have been. The next morning we checked the news – television, radio, and newspapers – but there was no mention whatsoever of this event.",1999-09-12T00:00:00,35.09774178082192,-80.70260068493151

Looking into the eyepiece revealed 2 orange balls of light, one slightly larger than the other. Then all of a sudden, while I'm looking at these lights through the telescope, they 'turn off'!

I assumed one on each wing tip, one at the center where the leading edge of the wings would intersect (if they did),and a golden yellow light on the nose. The speed seemed so slow that I wondered how it could remain aloft. The object traveled left to right (south to north). As it came directly in front of me, it seemed to make a 90 degree bank and stop. I could only see what would be the center light and one wing tip light(now vertical). The lights also changed color from red to golden yellow. The vertical wing tip light was now strobing. It remained stationary and very stable. I could only guess as to the distance, possibly 100-150 yards. I watched the lights for roughly 30 minutes, then the objected rolled back 90 degrees to a straight and level orientation. The lights changed back to red. The object then accelerated, banked left and diappeared over the western horizon. At this point I was certian of what I saw.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,41.4675,-73.2406

As I followed it to the horizen I expected there to be a flash or explosion as it hit the ground but there was none. I can only guess as to where the location of where it came down at. It looked like somewhere near the center of the city or East of there. I have seen metiors and planes before, this was not either of those. It was very unusual. When it came into my field of view I would say it was somewhere between a thousand to five hundred feet up in the air. And it also did not look like any kind of fireworks either. It had weight and moved to fast for that. And there were no sparks. I can't add much more except perhaps to say that it was coming down so fast that it startled me.

Also, remember I told you 2 years' ago, I heard a voice upon awakening say ""Soon this planet shall not be as you remember it""..well, 3 weeks ago, 3 days in a row, upon awakening, a voice said  ""Stay where God can find you"".  I have to repeat that I believe in God, but am no means fanatic and do not attend church at all regularly, not for years... Just want to add to the strange happenings that are occurring.

I dropped them of and went back home I immediately told my husband to come out on the back porch to see if he could tell me what it was that I saw. He looked and he said it is a cloud , but it was not moving like the oter clouds. I told him that at first I thought it was a meteorite. We then decided it was some sort of contrail but there was no aircraft in sight. We continued to watch and he saw a nikel colored object fly out of it. I did'nt see it at first then I kept watching and I saw it fly back into it , then a few seconds later it shot back out and flew all around this contrail or what ever it was. Then it disappeared for a few minutes. We kept watching and it flew back out and disappeared . We never saw it again. I was scared by this . I don't know what it was, neither did my husband . It started out as some sort of weird contrail and then it became stationary, then this nikel colored object flew all around and in and out of it for about 15 minutes. Very weird. When this object was flying you could hear no sound or see any contrail coming out of it. I don't know what it was I have never seen anything like it. My husband is a floor covering installer and I own my own cleaning service. I can assure you we are not a couple of ufo nuts . Until now my husband has been a skeptic.

But I also feel that as a tax paying citizen that I have a right to know what it is. Also about an hour after we saw this we heard jets flying, we looked out and they were headed in the same direction as to where we saw the ""thing"" for lack of a better word.

Weather was calm, clear, temperature very mild, moon- less sky & dark except for lights of Taft and Bakersfield (30 miles away).  While sitting in front of our trailer enjoying the serenity of the Spring evening at approx. 10:30 pm, I noticed a white light approaching from the NW in the direction of Taft Airport.  The light was fairly un- spectacular in appearance, not nearly as bright as an aircraft landing light and rather indistinct. The light, however, kept my attention due to its very high speed and relatively low altitude of approx. 5,000 ft. Once the light was directly over the town of Taft it began to slow down considerably to what I would say was a normal lightplane cruising speed. At that moment, the object ""blinked"" on an enormous conical shaped beam of yellowish light straight down. The beam at its widest & lowest point was at least five times the size of the object itself.  I grabbed a pair of 8x50 binoculars out of my flight box and observed the object and the beam for only a very few seconds. The object was a very hazy, indistinct ball of white light with no apparent anti-collision or navigation lights like an airplane.  The beam was very well defined against the night sky and did not reach the hill tops below it. As quickly as the beam ""blinked"" on it turned off and the object started to accelerate very rapidly as it resumed its southeasterly course paralleling the Diablo Range & heading over the Tehachapis towards Los Angeles. My wife saw the object too, and remained fairly unimpressed by the spectacle, dismissing it as nothing more than an experimental military aircraft from Edwards AFB.  The craft followed the same course as the airliners that were flying high above it since this is on the main flight corridor between L.A. and the S.F. Bay Area following the Coast Range. The object was in sight approx. 15 seconds and made no sound even though it travelled at jet fighter-like speed.",1999-06-23T00:00:00,35.1723,-119.3621

At this time, i asked my boyfriend to take a look into the sky to look at these lights.  The lights started out as a straight line, but as they got closer they looked as if they were trying to form a circle formation.  The whole time this was occurring, they seemed to be getting closer.  This formation also seemed as though it were floating downwards.  At this point, the lights hovered there at least 8 minutes.  After this...they just seemed to take off.....they reached such a high alttitude that you could see them disappear within mimutes.  In other word`s....they didn`t faze out like a flare would.

At Riley Cove on the western shore of Saratoga Lake I saw a silent craft hovering over Saratoga Lake.It was emitting a steady, brilliant, warm light, far brighter than an airplane or helicopter.I'd say its altitude was less than 200 feet, and it was about half a mile out over the lake, definitely close enough to hear an aircraft engine, but the craft was completely silent. I stopped my car and started my videocamera,and filmed it hovering there. I zoomed in as tight as I could, then panned back, and as after I did, I saw a black streak shoot up out of the lake, there was just enough twilight left to see it against the sky. It shot up like a bullet. It happened in an instant, but I remember thinking that someone must be shooting something at this craft. But as it reached the altitude of the first craft it began to light up, and suddenly it was a second brilliantly lit craft hovering in the sky, about one hundred yards to the right of the first craft and a little bit higher. I was really shocked, it happened so quickly, I've never seen anything move like that, in less than one second it went from the water to hovering in a fixed position in the sky. I kept the camera fixed on the two craft as I undid my seatbelt and got out of the car,and they hovered there for several more minutes. Then the first craft seemed to change, it turned into what appeared to be a flat triangle, which began to pulse and fly slowly past the second object, then slowly looped back around again, remaining nearby the second craft.

If it were an airplane or helicopter I'd have seen the tail lights, strobing lights, or individual lights, but this craft remained a single, large, solid warm light. The southern end of Saratoga Lake is ringed by a heavily wooded hillside, and the craft was travelling just at the hill's treeline in a bobbing up-and-down sort of motion, dipping below the treeline, then floating back up from behind the hill's dark pine trees, eventually going down like a setting sun behind the trees.

That fireball was clearly visible about 30 degrees above the horizon and large enough to see it's head and tail destinctively. Interestingly the tail flared out and was wider farther from the head of the fireball and much thiner near the head. However the last green fireball which I saw on the Dec. 28, 1998 could not be made out clearly because of a dark rainy sky. But I could see a large glowing green light falling in or just behind the clouds above and in front of me as I drove west on 50 outside of Orlando.

They changed shape rapidly to what looked like a giant black triangle. The first craft emitted a beam that lifted a 40 foot cactus out of the ground and fix the sand so the earth looked untouched. We then heard a deafening roar which we both assumed was the craft communicating with each other, they then both exploded into a brilliant display of colored light, and in the same way they came they were gone. My friend got up, lit another smoke, and said ""Well Rick, this is really one for the books"". I have since moved to New York because I just got to thinking that too many of these UFO sightings take place in the desert.

About 15 years ago, I lived in a small country town Called ""Rosedale"" which is just north of Bundaberg in central Queensland Australia.  I was still at school in those days, my best mate and I used to find any excuse to get out of a night time and go up behind his place (It was a nature reserve.)  We just sat in a cleariing and smoked a packet of cigaretes, shining our high powered torches all over the place.  The whole idea was just to have a smoke, (as if our parents couldn't smell it on us when we went home)  any how, this one night, we were smoking, and talking about nothing when we looked up to see what looked like a few satalites moving across the ""milky way"".  This was nothing out of the ordinary as it is very clear at night.  All of a sudden, the satalites changed direction and went shooting all over the place at high speed.  Big tough 15 year old boys that we were, we both said something to the effect of ""It would be great if it were UFO's and we got to meet an alien.""  So wee started shining our torches in the direction of these lights in the sky.  It was at this time, we realised the lights were getting larger, and the sound of the night crickets and other sounds were gone.  At the same time, We saw a very bright light come out from the right side above the trees, it took up most of the sky.  The only noise to be heard was a hum .  It was more felt than heard though.  Like a big sub woofer for the Hi Fi systme.  This light went over tthe trees and as it went out of sight over to the left of the clearing the light and sound were gone aswell.  Like big tough men, we turned to each other and said something less than pleasant.  Turned again and ran a good mile in what seemed like only seconds.  As we got tho the house, we saw the dog jumping over the fence to go the way we came.  We called it to stop but it never took direction very well and ignored us completely.  Within a few minutes, we heard the dog yelp in pain, we thought about going to see if it was OK but chickened out.  The next day, th! e dog came home but was sluggish for a couple of days before it came back to its old self.  It had no visable marks or anything and wee can only guess as to why it yelped. I don't know if anyone else has experienced anything similar, but this is the first time I have told this story to anyone other than Family in almost 15 years, It is as clear today as it was then.

In the developing twilight, we missed a trail marker and had to finish our descent in the dark.  Fortunately, the weather station has a red beacon over it, so we were able to home in on it.  Less fortunate was that we had to hike over about a mile or two of what Hawaiians call ""ah ah,"" the very loose, jagged clinkly lava.  This required a great deal of effort on our parts as we held hands and snaked our way across the lava field towards the beacon at the weather station.  One of us would get a firm footing to support the other while the other would then move forward.  Not fast progress, but we were able to keep our feet for the most part. It was during one of our many rests that I noticed these little whitish lights dancing around Mauna Kea.  It was clear, beautiful night with a few small clouds around the summit of Mauna Kea and one very large cloud directly above the summit.  The moon had not yet risen. I was suffering a bit of altitude sickness and was wondering if these dancing lights around Mauna Kea were a manifestation of that.  After watching these lights dart about the top of the mountain across the island for a while, I turned to my wife who it turns out was watching them, too. We tried to figure out what they might be.  There is an observatory atop Mauna Kea and we thought the lights might be a reflection in the clouds of descending vehicle headlights.  That didn't make sense as the lights would zip and dart very fast not only across the face of the mountain, but beyond its extents as well.  Then the lights would just as suddenly stop and hover.  Vehicle lights would behave in a more consistant pattern. We wondered if they were some kind of laser projection as we could see occasional beams of light from the moving lights to the large cloud above the summit of Mauna Kea.  Since the beams would initiate at either the lights or in the cloud and then terminate at the other, not going beyond, we reasoned we were watching some type of transmission. We listened closely, as it is very quiet on a large mountain at night, and could detect no sound which ruled out helicopters.  We would have heard them loud and clear.  Besides, the lights could move much faster than I have ever seen any aircraft move.  They were a most unique phenomenon in that they would dart swiftly from place to place about the mountain and then hover. We continued our descent of Mauna Loa and would stop to watch the dancing lights when we took our rests for the next 3 - 4 hours.  At one point I suggested to my wife that we attempt to signal the craft to see if we could get a ride down to our car.  Needless to say, whe was not particularly enthusiastic about this idea, so we continued snaking our way down the mountain. When we arrived at our car at about 02:00, the lights were still there darting about and hovering.  We drove down the mountain to Hilo and fell exhaustedly into bed.  The next day we both got massages and related the story to our masseuses.  They both commented that many people have had strange sightings up on the mountain.",1999-04-26T00:00:00,19.69938031496063,-155.13851102362204

It was round and metallic gray in color (dark grey)with a smokey glass dome shape in the center bottom of the craft.

They were pulsing and growing dimmer. I was approx. 40 feet away from the object, and we watched it until the lights dimmed out completely.

Shortly after arriving he reclined the seat to nap but noticed a bright light over the city of Jacksonville.This he passed off as a bright star or the planet Venus. That is until the ""star"" started to move. He passed this off as a helicopter training flight from Ft. McClellan which lay just to the south of Jacksonville  in the Anniston glow of lights.  His assumption of a training flight was suddenly changed when this light darted at a humanly impossible speed to the north toward Piedmont. In less than a second the light hovered in the glow of Piedmont's lights having covered a distance of about 15 miles almost instantaneously.  After a few minutes the craft darted back so that it was again over Jacksonville.  This time he witnessed a beam flash downward. By now he had raised the seat from its reclining position astounded by what he was seeing. He observed the movements of this light for quite some time and in fact became bored and eventually drifted off to sleep.  After dozing for and an hour or so he awoke to the same activity in the skies to the west  This soon after changed when the light was approached by a larger and brighter one which came from the west.  The smaller began  moving around it in a way that is most easily compared to insects flitting around a light. This seemed to have served to convey some type of message because at that point the smaller light headed straight in my husband's direction. The larger light faded backwar! d in the direction from which it had come (that of Sand Mtn. approx. 4o miles WNWof Jacksonville.)  As the craft continued in his direction my husband chambered a shell  into his deer rifle.  This done the light almost instantly began backing away in the same direction taken by the larger as if it sensed danger. My macho husband who had for years treated my early 1970's sighting as a joke waited until daylight then raced home afraid that his headlights may allow the crafts to pinpoint where to get him in the future. He woke me as soon as he came in saying ""I won't ever laugh at you again"".  He then related the story insisting that we report the incident. We called the local airports at both Weaver and Anniston.  They in turn referred us to the Airport in Birmingham who had no record of Military training flights that night.  My husband was able to tell them approximate times for commercial flights from Atlanta to Memphis  and from Birmingham to Chattanooga that had passed over during these events.  We were able to get the number for the UFO hotline from the Birmingham facility and filed a report that morning before 8:00. These events happened in the very early morning hours of Sunday, January 31,1996. Unknown to us at the time there had been numerous reports during the previous night and early morning. Similar sightings were associated with reports of cattle mutilations carried out with surgical precision in the Sand Mtn. area over the course of the next several weeks. Reports were filed by law enforcement officials, city council representatives and other such reliable figures.  The area was visited by  UFOlogists and there was quite a bit of press coverage. I believe this event had a profound impact on my husband. I noticed distinct changes in his personality almost immediately. He was better able to express his feelings and demonstrated increased patience and anger control. He also seemed more sensitive to the feelings of others. He seemed to sense when I did not feel well. I also noticed that he seemed m! ore protective of the children and me.  Although I have questioned the fact that maybe one of those beams got him he insists that it is not possible. He insists that he went to sleep during these events which I feel would have been impossible given his level of excitement upon returning home.",1999-04-26T00:00:00,33.5809,-85.5437

I believe that it was the 15 of July, a day before my friend's birthday, although I'm not completely sure. My friend was talking to me on her stomach, so she didn't see anything, but I was on my back looking at the stars. I was randomly looking around, when all of sudden this fiercly bright light appeared at a high altitude (I assume), and it sat still for a second. Then, it began to move in a tight zig-zaggish pattern, with extremely straight lines, at about the speed that you see a plane going at, or a sattelite. It paused for a bit after each movement, and then it changed direction. I then noticed that it stopped and began to grow insanely bright. Not bigger, but just brighter. Then, it sped off extremely quickly... it was like a blur of light, and left with a flash, disappearing from sight at one point in the sky.

The object was as bright as a welder's arc, and remained stationary for almost half an hour. Occasionally the object would disappear, and reappear in the exact spot. The clouds surrounding the object had dozens of lights ""swimming"" through them.  The lights looked like the end of a Hollywood searchlight, were not coming from the ground, and seemed to be inside the clouds.  The lights followed the boundaries of the clouds, and when they would travel from one cloud to the next, the would disappear until they reached the next cloud. These lights darted about like fish in water, and seemed to have some sort of repetitive pattern to their movement. We called the St. Louis Police Department and several news stations, but the incident was brushed off as ""probably just lights coming from the airport"". Well, the airport is 25 miles from the location at which we observed the object and lights, and we could not imagine how the airport could have been ""beaming"" lights of this nature to this location.  Nor would it explain the triangular shaped object, which appeared and disappeared in the same spot in the sky several times in the half hour we watched it.

The ""Light"" was seen coming from the southwest directly over a 600' peak just in front of us.  It was bright white and seemed to have mass, but no structure was perceived by the two witnesses.  It was approximately a half mile in width and moving at a ""very high speed"" ... I had been asked to build a ""walking meditation garden maze"" for a large resort in the Peruvian Andes.  Upon completion of the maze I invited the owners and a friend for a small ceremony to dedicate the Classical 7-Path Labyrinth to the healing and well being of our planet Earth.  It was the last few days of late May around 9pm in the evening on a star lit clear night, no moon.  Following the short dedication ceremony the four of us stood watching the heavens, Maria del Carmen and I faced the sacred mountain ""Yawar Maki"" which juts up from the Urubamba river a few feet from where we stood.  She and I were looking up over the peak at the Southern Cross when suddenly a ""large body"" of fast moving light sped directly over our heads.  In fact both of us almost fell backwards as we followed the light with our heads craning backwards.  Across the sky overhead it moved and then just disappeared into thin air.  The two men were looking in the other direction and by the time they hea! rd our squeals and looked in our direction, the body of light has completely disappeared.  The entire event took not more than a matter of seconds.  This was neither airplane or lightning, this we know, what is was through is still to be known.  The creation of this particular Labyrinth is as a healing center for tourists and pilgrims visiting the ancient sacred sites in this area of the Andes.  In myth and folklore, the Labyrinth traditions tell of many unusual stories such as that of Scandinavian sailors who would use the labyrinth in a form of sympathetic magic to control the weather.  It is also energetically linked with the seven major energy centers in the bodies auric field, the tones on the scale, and the 7 primary colors in the rainbow.  Unusual phenomena has been recounted in relation to the labyrinth for the past 3,500 years and in fact the act of walking a labyrinth still seems to draw transformative events to the practitioner.  I and maria del Carman both feel thi! s ususal ""event"" and our walking and dedication somehow are united.  I have never seen a UFO but I came away from this experience feeling like I had seen something I could not explain by conventional terms.  Both Maria del Carmen and her husband, a famous British journalist recounted several sightings during the past year and a half they've owned the hotel and lived in this part of the Andes.  They tell me these type stories are common and knowledge of ""craft"" is widespread and seen by many.  In fact, a lake just over the peak we had stood in front of  called ""Chequerec"" is known locally as the ""UFO Lake"" and for the past l00 years (and probably more) stories have been told of craft coming and going from the lake and tales of ""little green men"" etc.  After this experience I asked around to the native people, the Quechua.  Everyone had a story which was usually told in a matter of fact demeanor as something as natural as the sun coming up each day. Another Indian friend that I ! would describe as being educated, soft-spoken and extremely low profile, and who'd lived many years at the ancient site of Machu Picchu recounted a story.  He claims to have seen up to l7 ""ships"" on one night last November 1996.  As he told it, he was guiding an American woman into the sacred ruins late after midnight (which is allowed with special permission) when they both witnessed a litany of unusual ""lights"" above and around the old city.  He said he's not seen anything of this nature in the past  seven years, and believed that they'd (the star people) returned.  This site has been known in local lore to be a place of intense UFO phenomena throughout the ages.",1998-09-26T00:00:00,,

WALLACE NEWS-PRESS STAFF WRITER After more than a month of delays and 10 scrubbed launch attempts, the first satellites built by Denmark and South Africa were boosted into orbit Tuesday from Vandenberg Air Force Base, with both nations gratefully heralding the start of their own space ages. On the 11th launch attempt, the Boeing Delta 2 rocket burst into a clear sky at 2:29 a.m. Tuesday. The rocket carried into orbit the Danes' Orsted satellite, the South African SUNSAT and the ARGOS, a global environmental and military space project that is the largest and most sophisticated research satellite ever taken into space for the United States. The rocket's fiery ascent through the stars could be seen by onlookers for more than three minutes, as the booster reached speeds of 10,000 mph. ""Thanks to the people of America, this is the first small step of ours into space,'' Garth Milne, SUNSAT project manager, said at a January press conference. It was a long road for the foreign satellites. The launch, originally scheduled for early January, was continually delayed because of bad weather and various mechanical problems. The launch was a highly anticipated international venture, but the more than 100 dignitaries, industry leaders and students from South Africa and Denmark who spent the first half of January on the Central Coast returned home weeks ago. South Africa's satellite quest began in 1991 at the University of Stellenbosch. Initially, 14 graduate engineering students were involved Ñ a number that grew to more than",1999-04-02T00:00:00,,

Classic very bright to golden-orange fireball On February 23, 1999, at 2:30 A.M., my friend Brenda and I were driving on the 10 freeway heading west towards Los Angeles, just east of the 215 freeway (see map of Pamona, California) when we noticed at approximately 8-12,000 feet at approximately 60-75 degrees above the horizon looking through the front windshield, a very bright golden orange fireball traveling from what appeared to be the North East heading in a South Westerly direction.  The very bright fireball appeared about as large as the end of one of my index finger. I was amazed because this supposed fireball or shooting star was moving very slowly and the tail was equally as bright at the circular shape of the object as it was bright at the very tip of the tail.  The tail was so finely pointed, as though it were as sharp as the tip of a needle.  The flared trail was clear and bright and did not flicker or have a smoke trail like a comet or shooting star does.  We both watched this in astonishment moving at what seemd like about the speed of a car on the freeway (70 MPH) although it was difficult to read speed.  This was very slow compared to a shooting star.  After about 20 seconds or so, the flared tail and the very bright golden-orange light cut out, as though a rocket or thruster engine was turned off.  Now the object appeared round or diamond shaped (and had the appearance of a solid structure) and had a few very small lights (2-3) on and coasted in a straight line in the same direction for about another minute or so before we lost sight of it on the horizon and behind a mountain. There were a number of airplanes in the sky not far from the object which must have seen it.  Because there were airplanes with their flashing lights on, you could clearly distinguish the vast difference in light and character of this extremely bright fireball/craft and an airplane. The airplane lights were not even comparable to the clear brightness of this fireball/craft.  There were a few drivers/cars on the road which we thought must have also seen the objec! t which was so striking in the night city sky. Additional information about my sighting. This is in addition to the report I just made.  I just received an e-mail from ((Name deleted))I, NASA's Head of Astrochemistry. While the orange fireball my friend Brenda and I saw moved across the sky for a minute or so, I estimated that it was traveling at a speed similar to our car (70 mph).  When you look at this letter from NASA, it is clear that meteors travel much faster than 70 mph.  It reads: ""Most meteors travel in prograde orbits near the ecliptic plane (this is up to + or - 23 degrees from the equator, depending on the season).  This means that any meteors that you see from outside earth should travel roughly parallel paths; most meteors have velocities greater than 20 km/s - some travel slower, most travel faster.  20 km/sec comes to 72,000 km per hour. As you can see, what I saw was traveling much slower than 72,000 kilometers per hour.  How then could it have been a meteor?",1999-04-02T00:00:00,,

There may have been two objects.  I noticed what appeared to be two planets VERY close together in the sky at about 25-30 degrees above the horizon, one directly above the other above the other, about a finger nail's width at arms length apart.  Top light was bright and white, bottom was less bright and orange. I noticed these objects from a second story bedroom window at approximately 1945 on Feb 23 1999.  I had a clear, unobstructed view, the sky was clear and the moon was about a quarter full, fairly high in the sky, with a large round but fairly dim halo around it, but the objects did not display this halo. I believed them to be a planetary conjunction at first, but was surprised that I had not heard about this occurrence ahead of time, because it was very unusual and dramatic, and hadn't noticed anything like this the night before.  The objects appeared to be stationary.  The top light was bright enough to cause a starburst pattern in my glasses, which frankly annoyed me because I wanted a better view and could not get one because of the distortion.  The bottom object appeared to be a planet, I assumed Mars due to the orange coloring, and the top object was what I thought might be Venus, except that it was substantially brighter than I recall seeing it.  Neither object flashed or twinkled in any way.  I watched for approximately five minutes and then returned to work on my computer. My wife arrived home at about 2015.  I asked her if she had seen these objects and she stated that she had, just prior to pulling into the driveway.  I went back to the window to get another look, and both objects were gone.  I went outside to see if they had somehow moved out of view, which seemed unlikely if they were planets, but could no longer see them.  While I was watching, I noticed what was probably an airliner with an unusually bright pattern of flashing lights traveling west to east.  Ordinarily, I am not able to see aircraft structure at night, but in this case there seemed to be a wide body visible even when the lights were not flashing.  I do not necessarily believe that this aircraft was related to the other two objects, but it was unusual enough to catch my attention. The following morning (today actually, 24 Feb 99) on my way to work, I turned on the radio expecting to hear about the objects of the previous night and was surprised to hear that at approximately 0630 there were wide spread reports of fireballs and bright lights seen in various locations in northern Michigan.

At first I thought it was a balloon, at some distance because balloons land / take off at a nearby airport. Then the object went up quickly and then changed elevation quickly. When it moved north, it did not move like an airplane or helicopter. It had a smooth but varied motion. Almost a looping type motion. Then it went west, coming directly overhead, with tremendous velocity and gaining altitude until out of site. My wife also saw the object. We were at the Stone Mountain laser show. Everybody was watching the show. I would be interested if you had any other reports. I'd like to emphasize this was not an airplane, a helicopter, balloon, or a stray light from the show.

I hope this information can be of use to you. Sorry for the delay in filing a report. I live in central NJ in Middlesex County. As I am an avid skywatcher, and we are on the flight path of Newark Airport, I see many airplanes at various levels of the sky. (Not to mention the chemtrails.) On Sunday July 11, 1999, in Sayreville, NJ, travelling south on a local road in my car I glanced at the wide open sky and saw slightly to my right, a light, obviously a plane. Scanning left, almost in front of me, I saw another light, again, obviously a plane. (Both were high in the sky.) I continued to look and slightly to my left (almost due south) when I saw the 'object'. It was like, plane, plane, ""Oh, my god, what is that??"" The 'object' was a large roundish oval. It was about the length of a bic lighter held at arm's length, maybe a little longer. It glowed with an orange glow. The glow sort of looked like the glow of a light bulb when there isn't enough power going to it. On the top of the oval was some sort of cabin-like structure that sat close to the top of the object and closely matched the curve of the oval. It could have been easily missed as it was the same glowing orange color. There were possibly windows or something on this 'cabin' but it was hard to see as it was so close to the main body of the object. There were three lights on the bottom, one at the 'front' one in the 'middle', and one at the 'end' that lit quickly in sequence, the first one on/off, the second one on/off, then the third one on/off. I remember red and green but I don't recall the middle light's color. I have seen many blimps fly over and it was not a blimp or any other type of flying vehicle I had ever seen before. Also there were no 'tail fins' and it had a smooth bottom with no cabin. I didn't notice any noise, but if it made any I was probably to far away to hear it anyway. It didn't have a distinct outline like a blimp, but you could see the roundish-oval shape clearly. It hovered and didn't seem to be moving. Unfortunately, I was moving. I glanced in my mirror and saw I couldn't pull over and the driver behind me didn't seem to be looking at it. I was alone at the time. It was about 6:30 or 7 pm and the sun was just starting to set. It would have been easy to miss the object, despite it's size I guess because of the dull glow and the color of the sky. I lost sight of it in a cluster of trees and couldn't see it again because of them. This is my first sighting despite many hours of skywatching and I hope you can use this.If you need to contact me e-mail me a number and I can call back during the day as I work nights.

This was such a vivid experience that felt compelled to report it in the hopes that someone else had a similar experience.  I noticed the object when I turned to walk back to our home (I was with our 2 cats; the object was too distant and noiseless, therefore they were not disturbed).  The object may have been in place longer than my observation.  The entire object was about the size of a dime, in total, in the night sky.  Center was large (about 5x the magnitude of Venus as it sets), bright, roundish to oblong object.  This central object was surrounded by a sharply defined spherical ""glow"".  This ""glow"" was extremely clear and distinctive against the dark sky.  It was as if there was a very fine line of bright light around the spherical glow, but it was more evident above the central object than below it.  The entire thing was a round shape like a ball with about 2/3 of it the ""glow"" (translucent) and 1/3 the extremely bright central object.  I got a really good look at the object for several seconds because it was not moving.  Then, it was as if it rotated in place and vanished (more like it ""folded"" into the sky).  I felt that I could see sort of an afterglow but it was more like the atmosphere was moving (perfectly cloudless night, so this motion seemd to be in the atmosphere itself; I am less clear about this portion of the siting).  Honestly, in all of my life I have never, ever seen anything like this.  I regret I had no witness (at least with me) since my husband, who usually accompanies me on our evening walks, was not present.  The entire experience was absolutely vivid (I can recall it as if on video-tape).  In other useful information: I am well educated in the natural sciences (biology/geology); final degree is Ph.D., social science; I was an airplane pilot for many years so am familiar with atmospheric phenomena.  I ! was perfectly alert, on no medication.  On April 11, I witnessed in roughly the same quadrant of the sky at about the same time in the evening an object that I would explain as a meteor, only at a much lower altitude and much larger in magnification than a typical meteor, so that it was unusual in that expect.  The ""meteor"" was low enough and large enough for me to clearly see an orange-red hot core and the cinder trail.  I noticed it from just about overhead in our driveway and watched as it moved steadily across the entire remainder of the sky down toward the northeastern horizon.  While this was also a vivid observation, and it has been on my mind, it is ""explainable"" and I do not believe that it biased my observation last evening in any way.  I do hope that if anyone else reports a similar experience to the one I had last evening in Texas that I will hear about it (checked box for return contact by investigator).  I would like to know how to obtain any information on events that may have been in my area (weather balloons, high altitude explosions, satellites, etc.).",1999-08-10T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

Turned away, looked again-object was gone.  Then appeared again moving East at high rate. I was getting into my car when I heard the sound of a low flying airplane. I looked up to see a single engine plane trailing a banner.  This plane was traveling out of the South to the North, and traveled directly over my head.  I looked away from the plane, unlocked by car, and then looked back up to the plane which was now turning West.  I also noticed another plane flying at an altitude higher than the first and traveling out of the Nortwest traveling Southeast, their paths intersecting momentarily.  At this time I noticed the object at an altitude between the two planes, at an approx. 30 degree angle behind the first plane and almost directly below the second.  I looked back toward the first plane which was now traveling directly West to try and read the banner it was trailing.  Thinking when I first noticed the object it was a reflection, I looked back toward it, the second plane having now traveled out of view.  The object was still in the same spot that I first noticed it or very close to it, and it appeared to be hovering but moving slightly to the West.  I looked away again, trying to process what I was seeing, and then again looked up.  The object was gone from the spot I had last seen it.  I gazed the skies to the West and as I was turning my gaze to the East, the object appeared coming out of the West going directly East, moving at a very high rate of speed and out of my view.  This object while traveling at such a rate of speed made no sound and produced no contrails. I know of no conventional aircraft capable of such speed and able to move off its original spot in one direction, then change direction, and then accelerate to the speed at which I saw it traveling, in the time that it took for this object to do so, and in the small area of space/sky I was able to see.

I'm not really good at distances so I don't know how high it was but like I said you could see it clearly.  It looked as if it was glowing from the inside out instead of being illuminated by an outside source.  It almost had a peachy glow to it but it did have some exterior white lights fore and aft.  I am guessing that it was circular in shape but it was like we were seeing it it profile which made it appear more cigar shaped with an extra small dome shape on the top.

Not only was it still their, but it appeared to be even closer than before, and I was given the impression that it was travling at an enourmous volacity.

This contrail appeared similar That of NASA's proposed Ion propolsion system, exept for one thing; their now appeard to be what resembled orange fireballs shooting out the back of this object, and through the contrail. This was very unsettling because I thought I was witnessing an airborne tragedy, A plane on fire, plummeting to the ground.

Not usual flight plan for local military or non military bases. Had gone outside just before 2am in hopes of seeing remnants of the Leonid meteor event of the 16th and 17th--and unable to see any. In searching the sky my first thot was seeing a flock of geese as moving objects in a V formation began to be visible... the 'objects were at fist visible as tho separate-but lighted --- obviously not geese, but in that type of formation.  As it approached slowly, keeping its shape I realized it was a craft of massive triangular size; the V-shaped forward moving sides were lighted--steady,spaced, white lights--almost like lightbulbs.The back side of the triangle was unlit--and the craft itself had an almost opaque shadow quality of color--even at night, that was more discernible as it passed beneath some brighter stars and away from the street lights.  It appeard to be flying at about the height of a low flying plane, but much more massive in size than a plane would be of the same height. It moved somewhat slowly, very steady and with absolutely no sound. Moving from northwesterly to a southeasterly direction.  This is not the usual flight path usually observed in this area for local military or non military bases.  An airplane traveling at a similar height observed three days later, at the normal size visible at that height, appeared much smaller and made tremendous sound.   It's an image that stays vividly in mind. I grew up in the air force, and lived on base much of that time -- and observed a lot of planes coming and going, and I am aware it could very well be a military craft, possibly not well publicised--but its size, lack of any sound and the pace at which it was moving were out of the norm usually visible in this area.  Is there currently a stealth-type craft that would fit this description?  And how would I find out if there actually was one in this area on that morning?",1999-02-16T00:00:00,34.802189999999996,-92.25475444444444

I assumed it was a meteor.  Then another light passed south to north within seconds and made a series of minor turns.  I don't believe that meteors follow curved paths.  My friend then came out and also observed a few of the lights many of which would disappear from our view overhead.  We went down to the beach and found the embers from a camp fire.

We covered the fire with sand and saw 2 more of the lights. I am an engineer and the other observer an insurance professional.  We have both been amateur astronomers. My perception was that the objects were quite small.  There paths reminded my of wind born objects yet they traveled in very different directions; no two followed the same path.

The object travelled from North to South in a direct path at a speed that I could not define, maybe over Mach 3.  The aircraft was out of sight within ten seconds from beginning to end.   It was orange  to orange white in color.  There were three other witnesses.  I witnessed a meteor shower only a few days before, an event created by  mother nature that I never thought could have been topped.  However, the event I witnessed tonight had no trailing particles and traveled as fast as I have ever seen  within our atmosphere.  The event seemed to be ""man made"", not a natural annomoly. At approximetaly 10:30 P.M. on November 23, 1998, myself and three other witnesses saw an unidentified flying object travelling in a direct path from North to South at a very high speed slightly to the West  of us.  We were standing outside behind the house at ((address deleted)) Street in Carbondale, Illinios.  The craft appeared to be glowing orange to orange/white in color, and had two distinct sources of light.  One light possitioned on the West side of the craft,  and the other on the East.  Both balls of light seemed to be connected to each other, but there was no distinct divider or connection between the two.  However, the two sources of light appeared to be illuminating from one distinct aircraft.  The incident from beginning to end lasted about ten seconds.  Also, from my point of view, the object was traveling at a height of between 20,000 and 40,000 feet.  I am a private pilot with almost 200 hours of flight time, and am working on my instrument rating.  I have been to the Oshkosh Air Show and have seen F-14 jets flying, as well as F-18s taking off from Springfield, Illinois, as well as one F-18 flying over Carbondale a short time ago.  However, I have never witnessed any aircraft traveling at the rate of the one seen tonight.   I am convinced by the speed and  peculiar light arrangement that the aircraft witnessed tonight was either military or totally unidentified.  I must also say that while almost directly over head the ball of light on the West side of the Craft changed positions with the ball of light on the east side of the craft.  That is,  two balls of light were connected to each by no divider.  The most miraculous thing that we saw, was the ball of light to the west pass infront of the ball of light to the east and change positions with it at full speed.  In essence, the aircraft spun horizontally 180 degrees while traveling in a straigjht line, as if the craft suddenly spun around backwards, but continued to fly in the original direction of flight  at the same speed.  The craft ! never altered directiion, and flew in the same flight path, but turned around directly above our position on earth as if it could fly forward and backwards with the same flight characteristics.  The lights of the craft were of one color which does not  satisfy Federal Aviation Regulations of having anti-collision lighting systems, stroble lighting systems, or landing light systems as required on normal civillian aircraft.  As a Private Pilot and an experienced person of the flight environment, I feel that what I have witnessed tonight could have either been a Military flight or an Unidentified Flying Object, but under no circumstances was it a civilian flight.  I called Collumbia Flight Service first to see if they had any knowledge of the aircraft that I had just witnessed, and they gave me a negative response.  However, they directed me to the number for the U.F.O. Reporting Center where I left a recorded message.  I also attempted to contact Scott Airforce Base and  Kansas City Flight Center to inquire about the incident.  There was no answer at either of these facilities, but shortly thereafter I came in contact with Peter Davenport, the Director of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Washington.  He returned my message.  I have three other witnesses who saw the incident and have there own account of the story, but I was the first one to notice the event.  I am fully willing to cooperate to the best of my capabilities regarding this matter, and can be reached at any time at my Carbondale address or telephone  number.   Please contact me for further details or specific information.  This has already been a fulfilling experience, one that I will never forget.  Thank you for your time and understaniding regarding this  matter.  Hopefully, everything we have encountered tonight will only serve to further the human race.

I also noticed a larger orangish light about three inches to the lower left of the planet.  I wasn't sure if it was moving at first, but as I slowed down to get a better look, it sped up. It was moving to the left at the same speed as an airplane would.  I pulled over to make sure it was blinking like an airplane, but it wasn't.

I had just gotten off at work at 6:00 AM near downtown Seattle where I work the graveyard shift and was driving home to my apartment in West Seattle. I had decided to drive the scenic route around Alki Beach and drive instead of the normal direct route since there was no traffic and that it was such a nice early morning. On the way I briefly stopped in several places to look at the sights. The eastern sky was pretty with the early morning skies and Venus shining brightly to the East. Later stopped near the Alki Beach proper and looked out and saw a brightly shining planet / star which I thought it was at first, shining out over the sound. It was from Alki Beach proper generally in a Northwest direction over the Puget Sound Waters. You could see the Olympic Mountains to the left of the object. The object was low in the sky NOT high up like directly overhead. The object appeared like a very bright planet or star or maybe a plane that was a long distance away. It remained stationary for maybe about 1 to 2 minutes while I observed it. Then I looked away only momentarily to observe two people walking with their pets nearby. Then I looked back to where this object had been and it had totally and completely disappeared without any trace of having been there. I then spent the next 5 minutes or so looking all over the sky anywhere out over the sound to see if I could see anything that had been this light and there was nothing to be seen. I concluded this could NOT have been a plane since if it was and it had turned there were usually several lights on a plane and if it had turned, you would have been able to see several of the other lights.

My friend turned out the patio lights and indoor lights near the deck so we could better observe the stars. It took about 15 minutes before my eyes adjusted to the darkness.  I was standing,  facing  east when something caught my eye up in the sky to the northeast.  I saw what looked like 3 moving clouds--I stared very closely and quickly observed that these WERE NOT CLOUDS.  They were moving objects that I could not identify or had ever seen before in my life.  I turned to my friend and asked her ""do you see what I see over there?""  She looked where I pointed in the sky and immediately replied ""YES YES--I see them too!""  We could NOT believe our eyes!  Thank God we were together when we observed these objects! We watched in silence until they disappeared from view.  Then we took turns describing to each other what we had just seen, and found that our sightings had been identical.  We both saw 3 white, cloudy, round/oval shaped objects with long, comet-type tails.  We both remarked at their ""exact synchronized movement"" travleling in the same direction.

We thought it was incredible that this was our first ever UFO sighting, andthat we had been together when we witnessed it!   We continued to scan the sky for several minutes but did not see them again.  I did see airplanes in the area both before and after the sighting.  I'm certain that the time was around 9:30 p.m. because when we went indoors to check the time, it was 9:35 p.m. On my drive home to Sonoma, I listened to Art Bell's ""Coast to Coast"" Radio show.  By coincidence (or synchronicity?), he had Peter Davenport on the air! They had received several calls from people on the west coast reporting mysterious sightings.  One caller was from Novato, CA -- which is just a few minutes/miles from where my friend lives!  I called the show and was surprised that I got on the air--where I gave Art a summary of my sighting! I would like to emphasize that I stargaze almost every night--from different locations.  I know a star from a planet from a meteor, comet, etc.  I am also very familiar with the flight paths of aircraft in these locations.  THIS WAS NO AIRPLANE!  THERE WERE NO FLASHING LIGHTS!

I am a commercial pilot and was flying, on a private flight over northern California this evening and witnessed the objects from the cockpit of my aircraft.  I was cruising at an altitude of 16,500 feet traveling over the northern sierra mountains at 9:20 to 9:30pm. (by the way, on landing, I heard a report on the local Reno radio station, KKOH, that all the electricity is out in the cities of Carson City, Minden and Gardnerville Nevada.) I was flying from San Diego to Quincy California level at 16,500 feet, in the dark.  I had just made a turn northward from over Beal Air force base, (where the SR-71 is based) on a magnetic heading of 356 degrees, or almost north.  I looked up and from about eleven o'clock above me I was surprised by a half a dozen objects coming toward me.  My first thought was that it was a huge meteor but there were multiple objects, they appeared to be traveling much more slowly than any meteor and they appeared to be in formation.  I then thought ""is this what a U F O sighting looks like?"" As the group of objects passed slowly, almost ""drifting"" past my windshield higher than my aircraft, I could see flames coming from each object and a comet-like tail behind each object.  My next thought was that it might be a huge aircraft breaking up, some objects were long like a wing or odd shapes. However, it was not descending, but rather was moving straight and slowly across the sky almost appearing to be level.  It had the appearance of flaming, huge objects, in formation, or in a group.  There was one large object following the group somewhat behind the others.  I thought it might be space debri but they all appeared too large and too many. The group moved slowly from front left to right over at least a minute to a minute and a half time.  I had time to turn down all the radio and instrument lights in my cockpit, watched the objects and turned right to attempt to follow them.  I followed them at 200 knots. They continued south-southeast bound, toward southern California. I have never seen anything like this in over thirty years of my flying career.

I have to guess their size to be approx. six feet across the wings and equal in length. The fuselage was round and pointed at both ends. The wings were narrow in relationship the the fuselage, located in the center and were pointed at the ends. The wing span was maybe just a little wider than the length of the fuselage. I heard the swooshing sound about two or three seconds before seeing the objects. They seemed to have flown down the ravine that I had just walked down and was flying just above the tree tops.

They flew to where the peninsula is, then the one on the left made a smooth turn to the left. The other three wobbled just a bit as if they were not aware that they were to turn left, then they too turned. They flew in front of the mountain where it was still dark. Because of the darkness they blended in with the mountain and I lost sight of them. I waited to see if they would reappear in the light of the sky to the left of the mountain, but they did not reappear. From the time I first heard the familiar sound to when they flew out of sight, was about 6 seconds. They flew in a southwesterly direction before they made their turn.

There is an airport East of there so the Commercial Jet, was just at an upwards climb, and low in the sky. Out by the closest white jet stream, actually below it to the right, was a round/saucer shaped object that was hovering in the sky at an angle. It reflected the sunlight underneath it and was dark on top. It hovered for a few seconds, but long enough that I got a good look at it. I kept looking and it reappeared in a different spot to the right and above where it was before in the sky. It acted the same way and disappeared again. It was definitely the same object. It reappeared a third time below the second spot and to the right sort of making a triangle of appearances. It acted the same way again and disappeared, and I had to turn the corner. It didnt act the exact same way each time, but hovered and was at a slant. I parked at the Easton Ice Rink where my brother plays hockey and went inside to give him his envelope. I went back outside and watched the sky for a few minutes. I didnt see the object again. I drove down the bottom of the hill and across to a newly built parking lot  and turned around and watched the sky for a moment. The two jet trails were still visible, well obviously because there were jets attached ot the trails. I was about to drive away, and saw the object again. There was a black helicopter flying above a neighborhood near there, and the object was farther out in the sky about the same distance it was before, and acted in the same manner and finally disappeared. It was probably not as far away as the jet trails in the sky, but it was close enough I could see it clearly. I had to get back to my store, so I after it disappeared the fourth time, I didnt see it for a few minutes, I left and drove back. This might have been one of the same objects or four different ones, but they were all the same, all four times. My opinion is it was one object.

On Thursday night, December 3, 1998, I was driving alone toward my home.  At approximately 11:30 pm, I turned right onto my street, heading south toward my house.  Just after going through the stop sign at the next intersection. I saw three large, bright, round headlights very low in the sky ahead of me.  Two were very bright, white.  The third, in between the white ones and slightly lower, was bright red.  All three were at least three times the size of a standard car headlight.  Two smaller white lights were to the rear.  In spite of the glowing brightness of the lights, the street was not brightly illuminated, considering that the lights appeared to be  just above the tree tops.  From my vantage point, they were behind and slightly to the left of the next intersection. I slowed down, turned off the radio and stopped the car, for the briefest moment, in order to have a better look at what was happening since I was heading in their direction.  Instantly,I realized that the lights weren't moving, there was no engine noise, the pattern of lights was not like an airplane and there were no blinking lights such as an airplane would have,  plus it was much too close to the ground-maybe 150 feet or so up.  This was something different. Since I had stopped just short of the driveway of the house before mine, my next thought was to hit the Genie button and head for my garage.  As I accelerated and drove toward my driveway, in the direction of the lights, I saw that the lights were moving toward me; very slowly and noiselessly, staying at the same height and now parallel to the road.  At this point I was very anxious to get into the garage.  As I turned left into my driveway, I saw that the garage door had not opened so I pressed the Genie button again and paused at the bottom of the drive in order to make sure that the door was opening. (My driveway is gravel, on an uphill slope. I can't stop halfway up because the wheels spin in the gravel and the car can't safely make it inside without swerving.)  I looked up to the right and saw that the lights were slowly approaching where I was stopped.  They were so close that I could see the under-belly of a triangular, wedge-shaped craft, somewhat like a Stealth Bomber.  It was a clear, windless night and the shape was a black sillouette against the night sky, but there was no noise.  At that point, the craft was at the far corner of my front yard, up above (approx.150 ft +-) the telephone pole which is about 80 ft from my driveway. I stepped on the accelerator and drove into the garage with just enough clearance to get under the door, which was still rising.  Immediately,  I hit the Genie button and remained rivited to my seat until the door closed. It was then I realized that the engine was still running.  Next, I shut off the engine, ran into the house, shut off the alarm, waited a moment so I could reset it and immediately ran to the nearest window.  The craft was gone.  For the next few minutes I ran around the darkened house looking through various windows but the only other thing I saw was a shooting light over Lake Washington at about Laurelhurst.

The colors of the tail that followed were bright neon blue at its core, and toward the yellow and red spectrum closer to the edges of the fire/""explosion"". The tail seemed to ignite after the object had passed through the same space, and remained glowing in the sky for about 1 to 1.5 seconds after the main object crashed all the way toward the ground. The object itself was glowing bright red. I estimate the brightness to be one large sized unit of exploding fireworks. Maybe even somewhat brighter. I heard no sound (contrary to what others witnessed two days later Sunday night with another fireball). There was no streetnoise otherwise in the area. SIZE: The size of the red glowing object was no larger than 1/16 of a full moon, and the streak was approx. 12 inches in length from the edge of my hand when outstreched in front of me.((Name deleted))",1999-01-28T00:00:00,33.808705515846256,-84.38988231962239

The sky was partially overcast but clear to the west. I first spotted what I thought was a comet just above one of the local mesas.  I don't know its name, but it forms the northern rim of the little valley just north of Thunderbird Park. The object had a rounded head similar to photos of comets and as it rose from behind the mesa its ""tail"" also appeared.  The tail flaired out slightly as a comet might and even appeared to have a stream of particles ""glittering"" inside it.

The captain did not keep us updated on our locations so I'm not sure exactly where we were? I was sitting on the right side of the plane with a view to the south. It was a very large city we were flying over maybe Kansas City but I'm not sure. The object was orange in color and appeared to be just hovering over the city. There were orange lights on each side that blinked several times and then pauses in a repeated sequence. This object and it's blinking lights were orange and not red like you see on an airplane and that caught my attention. As best as I could tell the object appeared to stay over the city as we flew away. I don't know what it was or where we were but I thought I would report it in case this may back up some other report.

I currently reside in Mira Mesa, which is located about 10 miles north of downtown San Diego.  The house was getting warm so my father and I went out into the back-yard to sit in the shade. My chair was facing northwest while my father was facing notheast.  As we talked, my father mentioned that he was watching an object in the sky that was apparently not moving. Getting curious, I shifted my chair and after a little searching located the object.  I estimate the object's position to be northeast and about 45 degrees above the horizon.  The sky was clear and bright with the point of light, looking to be a few miles away. I noted the time (10:45)and after a few minutes my father again remarked that the object still hadn't moved.  I relocated the object, using the peak of a neighbor's rooftop as a reference point.  Indeed, the object was still there and I went inside to get my 7X50 binoculars.  Using the same reference point, I relocated the object.  Bringing the binoculars into focus, revealed the small object to have an oval shape and glowing a bright orange.  It was now a few minutes after 11:00 and the object had still not noticibly moved.  I watched the object through the binoculars for a few more minutes and saw that featureless orange glow was not varying in brightness.  Asking my father to keep an eye on the object, I went inside to get some stronger optics.  After a few minutes, I came outside with video camera that has a 50X digital zoom. Unfortunately, without a tripod the camera shook too much to be of any use.  The time was by then 11:30 and while continuing to watch the object through my 7X50's, I noticed that it began moving slowly away. The object's heading was due east and in only a couple of minutes, it was gone from sight.  At no time during this sighting, did either myself or my father notice any sign of a contrail. I must note that my house is located less than two miles from the U.S.Marine Corps Air Station at Miramar.  I have seen and heard all manner of aircraft over the years and this object really made an impression me.  Because the object was apparently quite far away and high in the sky, I hope that there were other witnesses to this event.",1999-10-19T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

No engine noise and travelled slowly. Object emitted pale-white light. I am a biomedical scientist and my wife is a business owner. I noticed an egg-shaped object travelling slowly towards Southwest from Carmel Valley. The object was visible from 17:50 to about 17:59 PST (complete darkness) and had an approximate altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 ft above ground and 2 to 3 miles out. The object had two or three strobe-lights. Their apparent location was on top of the object and on the bottom of the object, and one at or near the tail region. The strobes flashed top-bottom--top-bottom--pause-tail-top-bottom ... the tail strob could have come from an object following the first at close distance. The object emitted a pale, white light and appeared to have dark, window-like areas. I was unable to hear any engine sound, which at that distance should rule out any conventional helicopter. It could have been a blimp, but the egg-shape and light emitted from the object would rule that out. I managed to alert my wife who can corroborate my observation and take several digital pictures of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness forwarded eight digital photos of object.  They are interesting in appearance, but unambiguous identification of the object is not possible from the photos.  Text of follow-up report included below.)) Classification: UNCLASSIFIED Dear Mr. Davenport, thank you for your interest. Here are more details: 1. Other witnesses: the ones I know are my wife and our 5 year old daughter. I noticed it when turning into our street while driving home. Given its size and the illumination, it should have been noticed by anybody in Carmel Valley at that time. My first thought was, why is a coast-guard helicopter hovering over our area, but after a closer look I noticed that the shape was too round to be such a helicopter, plus the object was illuminated, which would not be the case for helicopters, and also there was no red painting on the object. The object seemed to radiate a dim light all over the surface, ruling out a search light. My second thought was that it was a blimp, but the shape was more egg shaped than cylindrical, and again the illumination radiating from the object would make it unlikely. In addition, it did not appear to have any carriage attached underneath, and window like structures were on the body, which would not be the case for a blimp. Given the proximity to Miramar, it could have been some experimental aircraft (I did not see any wings attached). Also, sunset was much earlier, so I do not think I saw a reflection of the setting sun at a higher altitude in the object. 2. When I first saw the object, it appeared to be stationary, but after getting my camera and following it carefully, it seemed to move towards South/Southwest about 1 mm/ min at a meter's length from my eye. It moved in a straight line and appeared to head towards Miramar. It did not make any engine noise, which I should have definitely heard if it was a helicopter from the distance I was at. 3. I was facing SE and the object moved from left to right away from me. I will confirm this with a map and send it to you, since I never paid much attention to the direction our house is facing. 4. The apparent size when I first saw it compares to the moon in length and 3/4 of the moon in height. When I took the pictures, it was about 1/3 of the moon in size and when it disappeared behind a hill it was about 1/4 of the moon. It was much bigger than any star or planet. 5. The pictures were taken by hand - exposure was automatic (probably  in the range of 2 seconds) the light appeared whitish-gray by eye, but looks more yellow on the picture. You should have received one set of 8 images (DSCN0080 through 0087), they look pretty bad and you will have to correct for my movements because I did not have a stand to put the camera on. I did not have binoculars handy unfortunately. Let me know if you need exposure times for the images. Sincerely,",1999-11-02T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

(location viewed on two following nights, clear sky - Bright Moon and Venus)  The object sighted did not appear to be a celestial object - as there were 6 distinct lights (blue and red) that rotated in a fixed position around a central point.  At 2200hrs CST - Venus appears @ 40 degrees in the northwest sky relative to the position of my initial sighting out the back window of our house.  The object was about 20 degrees further north of Venus', and at 80 degrees height. My husband is a private pilot and he was UNABLE to see the object at his workplace that is 10 miles north of my position.  Given that the colors of the object were ""blue and red"" - my husbands initial thought was that these might be position lights as those found on aircraft.  During the sighting, he asked me to describe several things while I looked at the object; any stobe lights, rotating beacons, visible appendages, angular or velocity movements, the direction of rotation of the objects lights, whether a fuselage was visible, the depth of colored lights, their intensity, and whether I could hear a source of propulsion.  I talked with him on the phone as I watched the object along with my children.   I am certain that this was not a celestial body or swamp gas. There was an atmospheric event in the form of a severe thunderstorm with tops at flight level 55 about 30 miles to the north of Pflugerville at the time of the sighting.   (my husband,((name deleted)), is is writing this for me - again - asking me questions) By the way - on a light note.  My four year old daughter, ((name deleted)), is convinced that the object sighted was the ""magic school bus"" of PBS fame. She thinks that ""they"" were studying the stars. I am in Oregon for the next few days visiting family, having flown up here Thursay (5/27) morning. You can reach me at 541-((deleted)). If you call us there, you can speak with four witnesses - myself (34), my son ((deleted))(deleted), my son ((deleted)) (age deletdd), and my daughter ((name deleted)) (age deleted)).   You may want to get ((name deleted)) on tape.  It's very cute to hear her describe watching the ""magic school bus"" Thanks for your time and quick response. |",1999-06-23T00:00:00,,

I was setting in the driveway of my winter home in Miami on a clear day about 4PM.  The sky was a deep blue with a very few scattered white clouds. I noticed in the eastern part of the sky what appeared to be a white dot that was stationary. The white dot would disappear than re-appear but always stayed in the same spot. It was very high in the sky as an occasional cloud would pass in front of it. I looked at it through a pair of binuculars and the white dot seem to display a hint of a disk shape. Luckily, I had my telescope already set up in the garage as I planned to do some star gazing later that evening. I have been an amateur astromoner since I was 12 years old and am now 55 years of age. The scope I used was a 8"" Celestron with a 20mm wide angle lens. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This was a disk shaped craft with a definite dome. It was hovering perfictly still but then would occasionally tilt straight up revealing it's dome. While it was tilted this way, you could see it with your naked eye as it displayed it's total top surfice area. It would keep this angle for about 5 seconds than tilt back down to its vertical position. At this angle it displayed very little of it's surface hence it would become invisible to the naked eye but was still visible through my telescope. I called my wife and told her to grab the binoculars and look. As the disk was back to it's horizonal position it could not be seen with the naked eye. She grabbed the binoculars and started scanning the area of the sky where the scope was pointing. Suddenly, the disk took off to the south so fast that it just gave a hint of a slight streak in the field of view of my telescope. That was the last I saw of it. My wife never did see it as she didn't have enough time to scan that part of the sky before it streaked off. End of Story.",1999-06-23T00:00:00,,

Not very exciting, just odd. However, in 1970 in Eau Claire, WI, My sister and a friend were walking to my parents house from her friends house. The walk, at a leisurely pace, takes about twenty minutes. My sister noticed a large brightly lit saucer in the sky, as did her friend. They observed it for a couple minutes, then got scared and hurried home, running most of the way. Upon arriving home, my sister was grounded for being 2 1/2 hours late. She said that she couldn't be late, she ran home and it only took her about ten minutes. My mother didn't believe her, so the grounding stuck. For the following 15 years, my sister was afflicted with stange buzzing sounds in her head. She also remembers that when they started to run, the saucer was no longer there. Deputy Sherrifs in Eau Claire County obsreved a similar object over a hill near my parents about a month prior to that, but that one was a couple hundred yards in diameter. It scorched the tops of the trees on the hill, which was observable for about ten years after.

I pulled my car over and began videotaping. It was lit from underneath, an intense yellow-orange solid light, round or oval, and with a smaller light above sometimes visible revealing a dark unlit mass above the light.                                                   I drove a little further to get a view unobstructed by the bare tree branches,then drove again to get closer. I knew I was close to Flike Road where I had videotaped a dramatic sighting on December 18th,and it was a safer road to stop on,so I sped there.                            Just as I turned the corner we saw the craft heading slowly away from us,and loop directly over another similar craft. The higher craft's bright light showed more clearly an unlit upper section of the craft that passed beneath. This maneuver brought them dangerously close to each other,and the lower craft's altitude was less than fifty feet, the other not much higher. The one craft was so low, lower than the tops of trees it passed behind, I thought it may have been on the ground, or possibly coming up from the nearby Hudson River. I pulled a little closer. One craft seemed to change into a flat triangle with multiple warm lights and traveled more quickly, moving off to the west. I believe that these craft can sit upright to hover and move very slowly, like a rocket does when lifting off. Instead of a rocket engine it seems to be balanced over a glowing globe which could be its source of lift or propulsion. I think these craft can lower themselves from upright to a horizontal attitude, which reveals them to be triangular or near triangular with a slightly rounded back end. They travel faster in a more direct line in this position. However, it's the nose of the triangle that seems to be the bright round light, which leads me to think that when they sit upright (or at least at a 45 degree angle) t! hey may be sitting on the nose rather than the back end. As the one passed behind the trees there was a second smaller light visible above the main light but at an angle, resembling a tipped cone or party hat drifting slowly sideways. It could also be sitting upright on its nose but with the third point unlit or unseen from my vantage point. Then, a third craft rose up from the trees to the right, across a field. It seemed triangular, brightly lit underneath, casting a diffuse beam of light before it. It traveled east towards the remaining craft and as they got closer they, too, looped one over the other. It was a strange, silent aerobatic maneuver, but graceful. To see it performed twice, minutes apart, and involving three different craft, was startling. The craft were all drifting to the south, so I drove to follow, losing sight of them for a few minutes.I pause the tape. When I turned the corner onto George Thompson Road I saw one hovering over a cornfield and began filming again. As soon as I turned on my hazard lights and got out of the car it bagan to flare incredibly brightly, like a yellow-orange flame with an aura around it, like it was burning, on the videotape it seems more white than it did to the naked eye. It also seemed to get much bigger,as large as the moon, and totally round. It was larger and brighter than anything I've ever seen in the night sky besides a full moon. It may have come quite close to us, and I'm a little concerned about that, I've heard accounts of UFO witnesses being affected by radiation. To some that may sound a little far-fetched, but I guarantee you'd feel the same if you were there with us. After a minute it started to move away from us, and then was clearly a flat triangular craft. As I continued filming it travel west over Route 67, we saw a second tria! ngle come into view going east. They were on a collision course,one was higher than the other and they even adjusted their altitudes to head right for one another, nose to nose. I expected one to veer off as they got closer but they didn't,they came closer than the width of either craft, literally feet from colliding head-on. We both thought they had collided until they passed each other. It was unbelievable, and I was thrilled to have this, any of this really, on videotape.Then the east bound craft turned around to follow the other and they flew out of our sight.

Unusual shade of green.  Object below fairly high broken overcast. At 0631 Hrs PST today, as I was traveling south on I-5 (in the Shoreline area), I observed a single very bright light green colored object traverse about 40 degrees of the sky.  The object  became visible to me as it came out from behind the roof of my car and hence became visible through the windshield.  It was traveling southward at what appeared to be a straight, downward course.  A rough estimate would be 20-30 deg below the horizontal. This clear very bight object moved quite fast, but slower than meteors I've observed in the past.  neither have I seen anything quite this shade of green, although I have seen green fireballs or meteors before.  A fairly high broken overcast was made obvious by the Moon, and I believe this green object to have been below that overcast.  I did observe the normal air traffic in the sky such as airliners approaching Sea-Tac and traffic helicopter, etc.  These all were below the overcast.  When the green light from the object went out, it went out as often described: ""like a lightbulb being turned off."" The things that distinguish this sighting in my mind are the clarity and exceptional brightness of the light from this object, the fact that it did not appear as a 'streak' as other meteors I have seen did, but appeared as a clear, very bright object  (no discernable diameter), and that it seemingly was quite close tot he ground, - a couple of thousand feet at the most I would guess, (based on the cloud cover) and the sense was that it was quite lower than that.  And that it did not ""smear"" in my vision, but remained a clear single source of light with no trail, and that it moved at a speed that I preceived to be faster than aircraft, but slower than other meteors I've observed. While I expect that what I saw was a meteor, and believe what I saw to be within the normal range of behaviors for such objects, it was nonetheless an unusual sight.",1999-05-24T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

It had a large disc at the top much like the radar discs on military airplanes, but then under the disc was a long cylinder, approx. 20 feet long. That cylinder coned-out and was joined by several slim tubes to another cylinder below it, this one no more than 10 feet long. It had a non-blinking white light directly on top (i saw this because it was quite a bit in front of us when i first saw it), and then 3 purple lights; one on the first cylinder, one on the connecting tubes and one on the very bottom of the lower cylinder. it was all white in color and it was flying very low or so it seemed.

It was flying at a very slow pace and as we approached the point of intersection where we were to drive directly underneath the craft, while it passed over the freeway, it appeared to stop and hover just before crossing the freeway, and then out of nowhere it jetted off at a rate of about 80-90 mph.

It began on our way home from work, approximately 11:15-11:30. We noticed this bright object in the sky, looked much like Venus does, but for June 1987, Venus was in the W Elongation, what we saw was in the SouthWest sky(we were heading south)We were both just out of the AF after spending time in Europe. We were familiar with quite a few aircraft. This craft was much different though. We watched it as we drove home, we arrived at 11:40-11:50,we went inside and continued to watch it from a bedroom window, it appeared to be moving so we went back outside. It approached and went directly over our heads. Once it passed over, we realized that it was very quiet No dogs, no crickets  not a sound. This was in the country and there were always night noises....Not this time. As for the craft, it was boomerang shaped (Drawing on the way, in the mail)there were lights in the front and on the bottom, all different colors, the structure appeared to be a brushed chrome. The lights in the front were seperated to the point they almost looked like a car radiator. Judging size was quite difficult, but i know it was huge, it also looked close enough to hit with a stone, as it passed over, the lights on the rear appeared to pulsate, as smooth as a heartbeat, as one went off the other came on The craft itself was silent, not even the swishing of air, nothing.

No sound came from it, it stood in the sky before us revolving slowly.  We felt we were also being observed during the time it presented itself to us. Heading east one evening from Yuma on our way to Phoenix with our 2 young children, I sat in the back with my baby while my husband was at the wheel with my 2 yr. old daughter in front.  As I looked out the window to the south night sky, the sun had just set and the mountains were gentle shadows against the sky.  As dusk turned deeper into night my attention was drawn to a very bright round light which was brighter than a star, and not as high up.  I called my husbands attention to it, but he said it was probably the planet ""Venus"".  I watched for sometime, not able to look away, wondering what it could be.  When I did look away, then back, I didn't see it, it had gone.  I was more curious now wondering if it was indeed Venus, where had it just gone?  I told my husband it was gone.  He than suggested it was a Helicopter doing Military operations out there in the desert.  In Yuma we were currently stationed at the Air Station there, and operations were performed frequently in the night.  I continued searching the sky for the light.  Suddenly it appeared, only it was abit closer this time.  I excitedly told my husband, ""there it is!""  He was now becoming abit curious due to my persistance.  His next explanation after taking a glance from the road in the lights direction, was perhaps it was a flare.  I didn't take my eyes off the light this time, looking for the tail that a flare would have after being shot up or down, there was none.  Suddenly stunned as a second light pops on directly next to the first light.  Now I yelled at my husband that another light, the same bright color is shining brightly next to the first.  Continuing to drive he also began to lean forward and down, to peer out the window.  He saw the 2 lights, and then suddenly they were gone.  THe best way I can describe the way they became ""gone"" was they just blinked off.  One minute they're there, the next they're gone.  The same way you would flip the light switch turning the light off in a room.  Now my husband was as curious as me, and c! ontinues driving, and looking out the window.  With in moments, the single light appeared again, this time the closest it had been up to this point to our car.  It was approximately the heighth a power line would be to a car on the road.  Upward, slightly, but not directly above us, still to the side of us.  So the single light is on, the second light appears next to it, and then a third light pops on.  At this point as my husband says, ""That ain't no damn helicopter"", fear gripped me as this thing took shape before our eyes.  I realized what we were looking at, and it appeared to be looking at us.  After the third light appeared on, the light was so bright that we could see the shape of a round saucer, but it wasn't a flat structure.  It had a top shape to it, and under the lights we could see slightly up into the  center of the craft.  There was something there, but it was shadowy and hard to see what it was.  It stood there in the sky slowly revolving, allowing us to observe it, no noise coming from it.  My husband is now all over the road, while trying to drive and look at the same time.  I was more afraind than I've ever been in my life.  I felt myself bordering on pure panic, I couldn't believe my eyes, and yet there it was in front of me.  Unbelievable!!  But there it was.  My husband wanted to pull over, and I was screaming no!  Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the lights popped off again, and we couldn't see it.  Feeling abit safer only momentarily, but pressed for time I told my husband to pull over so that I could drive.  I had the intention of course not to stop once I was behind the wheel.  But I wasn't sure what he'd do if the craft appeared again, he might stop which terrified me.  We quickly pulled over to make our exchange.    I jumped out of the car, still panic stricken and jumped into the front seat screaming at him to come on!!  He hesitated looking up into the sky in the direction we had seen the craft in.  He was excited, exhilirated, but scared too, just not as scared as me.  He! 's much more of an adventurer than I.  Finally he got into the car at my insistance, and we took off.  Our conversation was filled with questions.  I remember my husband thinking out loud saying, ""I wonder if they can hear us in here (the car) like by the radio or something (which wasn't on at this time).  Just after he said that the craft appeared again.  We both felt as though it was their way of answering his question.  This time it was farther away again, but still within good eye shot.  This time the lights did somthing different.  Suddenly the 3 lights split off from each other into a triangular shape.  They shot off quick from each other, 1 light becoming 3 seperate lights.  As I've later learned this triangular shape  has been reported by others, and In spite of all the sightings that I think are bull shit, when I hear someone talk about the triangular significance I believe they've seen something.  Anyway, our trip continued and we could think of or speak of nothing else of course the rest of the way into Phoenix.  The lights continued to reappear to us, but at a greater distance over the desert mountains.  We watched them all the way into Gila Bend, and then saw them no more.  This trip is still vivid in my mind, and there were some peculiar things about the whole thing.  First thing was, after the experience we looked behind us, and ahead of us the highway was completely vacant.  We were the only ones there at that time.  This led us to feel as though we were chosen to be shown to.  I remember distinctly feeling that we were chosen.  We wondered why we'de be chosen, but couldn't come up with anything.  My husband was full of regret as though he'd missed an opportunity of a life time to be ""picked up"", and he talked about how he wished we had pulled over, maybe they'd have picked him up.  I was so terrified by the experience that I couldn't and still don't understand his thinking, but I do remember feeling very strongly as he expressed his ""missed opportunity"" that we would see it again. This imp! ression was so strong at that moment, and it was only there after he'd expressed his remorse at the thought of missing out on what could have been an abduction.  My children were unaffected by the whole thing.  My daughter now 14 has vague memory of the incident, and my son was still a baby at the time remembers nothing.  The night sky took on a whole new meaning to us after that.  And every trip we took from Yuma to Phoenix thereafter we had our camera with us with night film available to photograph anything should it appear again.  There were endless trips after that to visit our family  in Phoenix, but never again did we see what we'de seen that night in ""88"".  As all the UFO sightings became more reported, and numerous photo's and abduction storys surfaced I'd have to say many of them I feel are not legitimate.  There are always people who want to jump on the band wagon.  Personally I think some people that make their abduction stories available are simply full of shit.  They have wild imaginations, and they have discredited those of us who've truly had an experience with sightings ect.  I am as skeptical as the next person, and would welcome an explanation for what we saw.  The simple facts are, I know what we saw.  I don't know why we saw it, but I know something is out there, I don't believe it, I know it.  I don't know why certain people are chosen, maybe it's simply chance that these sightings occur, but I feel somehow that we're chosen.  The only significant thing that has happened to me since then are some very vivid dreams of large, colorful, UFO's bigger than ever seen before.  I also had a dream where I was picked up and taken to some terminal like location.  In the dream upon arriving at my destination I was taken into a room that was all red, walls and all.  I stood waiting in this room, and out from a partition came an alien child, I sensed she was female, and somehow we were connected.  I felt no fear as I stood looking at her, and she stood smiling at me.  Very strange dream, very vivid.! I awoke wondering what it meant.  I still look to the sky and wonder when another UFO will appear to me.  OF all the UFO photographs made public, I'd have to say the craft that I saw, looks most like photo's I've seen taken in Gulf Breeze Florida.  Ironically, I now live about 20 min. from Gulf Breeze, but have yet to see any UFO's.  We never reported our sighting, although I wish we had.  I wonder if there would have been some explanation, or maybe someone else who may have seen the same thing that night.  But my husband being a military member hesitated.  We know that a good deal of the public still doesn't believe in UFO's and discredits those of us who've seen one.  For now we continue watching and waiting for the proof to be shown to us all.",1999-07-05T00:00:00,32.7038626459144,-114.59088443579766

All of a sudden she wanted to know about ufos. I own 2 local businesses, my wifes a legal secratary. It wasnt a helecoptor, meteor or anything easily explained, and it definately was controlled by something. It flew off and got so far away we couldnt see it anymore, it just faded out. It was a crystal clear night, you could see every star in the sky. We arent nuts. There was a commercial aircraft flying with wing lights flying that was closer and lower then it, and it was going way slower then the ufo. It was silent.

At about that time, I happened to notice an object, moving at an extremely rapid rate through the sky, almost directly overhead. The duration of the event was so short that I thought that it might have been some kind of meteorite or something similar.  The object was bluish-green in color, like a streaking fireball in shape, and moving east to west at a speed much faster than any aircraft, flare, fireworks, or shooting star/meteorite I have ever seen before.  The light gave off no observable sound, nor was there some kind of sonic boom or anything of the sort. I commented on it to my friend who missed it and wasn't interested in my observation.

I thought it was a shooting star because of its speed, but realized once I was actually watching it that it wasn't. The object very faintly glowed a dull brown that would have been hard to see if the motion hadn't caught my eye. The length of the object was approximately the same as the apparent width of the full moon. It was wider than it was tall: probably a 3 or 4 to 1 ratio. I only caught a second of its east to west motion before my line of sight was blocked by the garage. I hurried down the porch and fell in the process. I was unable to see the object when I stood up -- it was moving pretty quick. I estimate that it covered approximately 20-30 degrees in about 1 second as I watched it. I looked in the direction that it had been traveling for about three or four minutes. A single flashing white light emanated from near Arcturus. It blinked 3 or 4 times, progressively getting brighter with each blink. After the final bright blink, which I estimated to be the same luminosity as a medium-bright Venus, it was no longer visible. There were no clouds in the sky, and I could ses faint stars in the location where it had been blinking. There was only a slight haze and the blinking was much brighter than the dim stars that I could see. Thios event lasted approximately 3-4 seconds. I watched for a few more minutes, but all I saw was a satellite traversing the sky in the east -- quite distant from the location of the other two objects. I have worked at this location for nearly two years and I spend considerable time outside at night smoking cigarettes and watching the skies. I have never seen a bird reflecting the street lamps at night -- that is the only the possible explanation for the first object that I can think of. If it was a bird, I probably would have seen the reflection changing as the bird flapped its wings, but the shape of the object and the glow remained consta! nt. The second object may have been an airplane, although it was quite high for the blinks to have been that bright. Usually when a plane turns you can make out different colored landing lights or something, and they usually don't just disappear as the second object did. I usually only see airplanes while watching the skies at work, but I have sighted a group of 2 UFOs on another occasion. Other than these two instances, the skies over my work are pretty boring. I am going to contact the Dane County Regional Airport to see if they received other calls or tracked anything unusual last night.

The sound then appeared to calm down for a portion of a minute.  Next the sound began to move rapidly in my direction and passed almost directly overhead.  Neither my son nor I could see anything, but I judged by the level of the noise that the source of the noise was either very low in altitude (500-1000 Ft.) or the object was very large and moving air like an object larger than several barns.  The sound continued in a SSW direction for about 30-40 seconds and then appeared to travel beyond audible range.  I estimate the distance traveled to be about 40 miles in under a minute.

As the passed overhead I realized they made no sound -- which was the eeriest part.  My neighborhood is quiet and my spa wasn't turned on.  I lost sight of them over Hollywood.   My wife said she saw the formation 'flip' as it reached the ocean and start heading back toward the East.  I didn't see it 'flip' but from the time she saw it to the time I lost sight of it towards Hollywood was only a matter of about 5 seconds.  It or they were moving very fast and appeared at one point to dip slightly and rise again in perfect unison.  It was like a giant kite with lights on the edges -- although I could never make out any shape and assumed at the time that the lights were independent elements.  I'm 34 and work in the entertainment industry as does my wife -- who was a little rattled by the whole thing.",1998-11-21T00:00:00,34.02342753378378,-118.48167652027027

My sister and I were watching TV. My mom was at the front door and window.  She was excited and claimed that there was a flying saucer outside.  Not wanting to be disturbed from watching a favorite TV show, at the time, I told mom to leave me alone.  Anyway, she got my sister's attention first and they both still claimed that there was really a UFO outside.  I looked in thier direction and could see that there were flashing lights through the windows.  I told them that it probably was the police with somebody pulled over on the side of the highway.  We lived right off State Rt. 42 South, just outside of Xenia, Ohio.  My mom said that it wasn't the state police it was in the air.  I told here it may be a police helicopter or something like that.  Then I noticed how quite it was outside.  Usually traffic was relatively constant until about eleven o'clock in the evening and it would die out to an occassional trickle.  The lack of sound is what first caught my interest.  My excplaination about the helicopter was shot down because of no sound.  That's when I got up to take a look.  I looked out the window and saw flashing lights that came from beyond my field of vision because of the front porch.  There wasn't any traffic and no sound, but the lights were there. I went out onto the porch and immediately looked to my left towards Xenia.  There were some cars stopped on the road.  I then looked to the right and saw the same thing.  There weren't may cars but there were definately other witnesses.  This all happened in a couple of seconds.  I looked up and above and beyond the tree in the front yard over the median of the highway was a very large (as big as our house) dark shape with lights flashing all over it.  The lights were several colors: white, red and green are the ones I remember most.  I can't quite remember the exact shape of the UFO but mom remembers it as an oval or cirular shape.  It remained stationary over the median for what seemed a minute or so, it's really hard to say exactly how long it was ! there.  Then it started moving to my right straight down the median until it was at the next house or slightly beyond.  It started to come down closer to the ground and the underside started to glow brightly.  Then just when we thought it was going to land it arched off away from us.  Whatever it was it was fast.  It went from a fairly shape to a spot of light in what seemed to be just a split second.  It darted around in the sky for a few minutes zigzagging back and forth then it disappeared.  We didn't report it then because I personnally didn't want to be referred as a kook.  I wished that I can talk to others who saw the UFO that night.  It was reported in the news of multiple sightings then things died down.  Someday I think I would like to be hypnotised to see if I could recall things better, like the exact day, the exact shape, etc.  Thank you.  Robert",,39.678,-83.9027

The dull orange light was only about 100ft from my car.  I kept driving, not really staring at the light, due to fear. I then made a right on Placentia. The light was now about a half a mile away and now moving north at a rising 30 degree angle. It was heading towards March AFB. I finally got home, told my parents and my sister to come and see the UFO. When they got out side the light was moving slowly up.  The light was, at the most, four miles from us. I did not see it move that distance in that short of time. The light then made a fast U-shaped turn in the sky and went out. The whole ordeal only lasted about three minutes.

No other sightings or occurences have happened since. It was a crisp clear calm starry fall night. We went outside taking the trash to the bins at the curb which face east. I lifted the lid with my right arm and started to put the bag in and I was frozen. I was able to move my eyes as I saw my watch on my left arm that I was holding the lid. It was stopped at 7:50 with the second hand also stopped at 50. I noticed the hairs on my arms standing up. I glanced to my side and saw my friend looking straight out and then I looked straight out and saw the object. It was still and bright, it looked like a smaller version of a bright moon. Then it darted diagonally to the north, so fast it really just appeared at it's new location about 45 degrees to the left from when it was directly in front of us. Then it darted back straight across back to the south and to the right of us about 45 degrees again. Then it shot back diagonally to the north and kept going out of sight, it vanished. We both were able to move again as the bag dropped into the bin, I threw the lid down and we both ran back up the stairs yelling as we went back into the house. We frantically told my parents what happened but we were both brushed off as two kids with overactive imaginations. Years later when I brought this up to my parents again, my father recalled that the TV set went to snow. He got up and changed the channel thinking that just that one station he was watching temporarilly went off the air. He turned the dial and just got snow on all of the channels. He said then they all came back on and he went back into his chair.

Sterling exits and were already past the Montgomery Clark County line. We turned back towards Mt. Sterling on I-64. At the next overpass we saw a large metallic saucer shaped craft hovering about twenty-five feet above the embankment to the right of the overpass. We left Morehead, where we lived before dark and headed towards Mt. Sterling on I-64, which is about 35 miles away. We were driving leisurely and talking, and stopped at the Owensville / Frenchburg exit in Bath County to get a soft drink. We got back on the interstate, still talking, at almost sunset. It was a warm fall day and we were riding with the windows down, having a great time just enjoying the ride. Somehow we must have driven right by both Mt. Sterling exits, but neither of us has ever had any memory of it. All we know for sure is it was dark outside and when we realized quite suddenly that the terrain didn't seem right and we started looking at the mile markers and figured out we were about fifteen miles past Mt. Sterling. We couldn't figure out how we had missed not one, but both exits...but had no choice except to turn around and go back. We were just inside Clark County at that point and got off at the next exit we saw, which is a rural exit on to U.S. 60, and turned around heading back into Montgomery County on I-64 towards Mt. Sterling once more. We were still perplexed about how we had gotten there when we came to the first overpass. There was a large metallic saucer with what I've always thought of as multi-colored ""running lights"" on it and portals visible. The saucer made no sound we were aware of and didn't disturb the surrounding treetops and other vegetation as it hovered in mid air about twenty-five feet above the embankment to the right of the overpass. We both stared and I slowed down and started pulling off the highway, coming almost to a full stop in front of the craft before my friend freaked out and yelled ""hit the gas"". That snapped me out of my stupor and I did as I was told, hit the gas and pulled back out onto the highway. We arrived in Mt. Sterling much later than we anticipated, even considering the fact we had gone fifteen miles out of our way, which accounts for an extra half hour traveling time, but we were never sure how much time, if any, we did loose. Since then ! I have realized if we hadn't been headed for Mt. Sterling and had been going on to Winchester or Lexington, we would never have taken note of the fact we didn't see the two Mt. Sterling exits and we also would not have turned around in Clark County to turn back towards Mt. Sterling, so we would not have seen the saucer hovering over that overpass because it would not have been visible from the other side of the interstate (we didn't notice it as we went by the first time as we traveled the other way ... and that must have been about where we were when we realized we missed Mt. Sterling). Neither of us have ever remembered much more than that and remained for the last 18 years afraid to tell anybody.",1999-07-14T00:00:00,,

We went outside and noticed that two neighbors were also observing the object.   They also thought, at first, that it was a plane in trouble.  Soon more neighbors came outside and joined us in viewing the object.  By this time, almost all of the golden balls had separated from the main object and were floating around the sky.  Remember, this sighting was in broad daylight on a rather sunny afternoon.  Some of the neighbors commented that we were merely looking at a cluster of balloons.  However that explanation was not possible since the spoke object flew in and out of the round golden balls like a 'mother hen', seemingly arranging them in patterns.  The whole group was moving slowily to the south.   While watching this, we saw a commercial airliner going from north to south and though high up, it was lower than the objects.  We counted the balls and came up with an approximate number of 34.  A strange mood came over all of us and the group broke up, returning to our homes without much comment.

The center third was a silvery metallic color and the two end thirds were white with a sharp edge between the areas.  There were no projections visible and no markings.  A rough estimate of observed length is based on a length of 4 inches at a distance of one arm length.  It appeared to be nearly stationary but wobbled or occilated from end to end.  My impression was that it was very large.  I could not observe any thickness to the object but it was directly overhead. Any sounds would have been obscured by the helicopter engine noise.  It appeared that it was moving slowly and was about to become obscured by a large tree next to our house so I moved to a better viewing position about 10 feet away looking away during this brief period.  When I looked up again the object had disappeared.  A commercial jet was also passing overhead going south at this time.  This object was lower than the jet and in a different part of the sky.  This sighting was very short probably not greater than 10 seconds or so.",1999-08-10T00:00:00,34.1359,-117.15529999999998

I was watching the night sky which was crystal clear, moon was a sliver, and low on the horizon. Stars were very clear and bright. I noticed that there was a extremely bright red non-flashing point-source of light that had 6 fast flashing (~6 flashes/sec.) red strobe-like lights on it's front and two slower flashing red lights on it's back end coming over the southern horizon and moving directly north at a modest rate of speed ( it took perhaps 2 minutes to traverse horizon to horizon). The flashing red lights were strobe like point-sources (not diffused at all)..similar to the light from a red LED wtih a clear cap. It was at approximately 10,000 ft. AS it cleared into the northern horizon, a second object, similar to the first but different, appeared on the southern horizon in the same place as the first one did. This one had two red non-flashing point sources of light, directly opposed from each other ( like a barbell with lights on it's ends), and 3 flashing red lights on it's front. It followed the same path as the first light, and as it passed by, the front lights disappeared behind the body of the craft..it was easy to see the shape when this happened. It looked to be a wing shape. AS this light cleared the northern horizon, another red non-flashing light similar to the first appeared at the southern horizon and followed the other two in the same path and altitude. THis one was the same as the first object in it's light configuration and speed of flashing.

The object appeared to be going in a straight line with a slight arc as it crossed from the south to the north. I thought for sure that it was a shooting star because it was moving at incredible speed, but then as it reached the half way point it looked like a slinky would look if you stretched it out.  The light became elongated, the compressed to a sigle dot, stopping for a split second, then speeding off again elongating itself once more. I don't know how else to describe what I saw.

My name is ((name deleted)). On the early morning of  07/18/99 at about 4:10am I was on a dark rural road very near my home when I noticed a lighted object from my drivers side window (See house.jpg).  My first thought was that someone was launching a hot air balloon from the back of a house. The object I saw was clearly very near to the ground because I could easily see the outline or black silhouette of the roof of the house in front of the object. The weather was warm and visibility was good. There was overcast and you could not see any stars nor the moon. I was heading North East on a street called North Iris Lane when I noticed this well lit orange circle of light from behind a house which was no more than 300 yards away from my vantage point. Again, my first thought was a hot air balloon and the glow from someone filling it with hot air. I kept looking out my drivers side window but as I drove I lost sight of the object as my sight was now obscured by homes and trees to my left. When I reached the stop sign about 150 yards from where I first noticed the object, I made a left turn and saw that the object was no longer at ground level but now was clearly in the sky and heading in a North West direction. I never leave the house without my digital camera and when I turned the corner I stopped my car and grabbed it. The camera I used was an Olympus D-400 Digital Zoom camera. It took a few seconds to open the lens cover, when I looked through the viewfinder I feared that the light from the street lamp in front of me would not allow for a good shot. I therefore waited till the object was just above the lamp post and took a picture (see pic1.jpg). I waited all of an additional 3 seconds and took another picture pointing in the same direction (see pic2.jpg). The object I saw was not bright, the best way to describe it was if you've seen Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the blue light that followed the space ships except that this light was a dull orange in color instead of blue. After I took two pictures I s! aw the object stop moving up and to the North and changed directions to up and South. It stopped about 3 seconds later then started to head back North and to the West. About 3 seconds later the object just starting heading straight up at a consistent rate of speed. Rather than just stand there I got back in truck made a right turn into our town home complex and stopped my car in front of my house. When I got out I could still see the object still heading up and getting farther away. I went inside grabbed my wife out of bed and insisted she come outside NOW! When we got outside I pointed to the sky and said ""look do you see that?"" she said yes and asked what it was. At this point it looked like a very bright star and was very far away. We both stood there for the next 5 to 10 seconds and watched as it passed through the overcast. It got smaller and smaller when finally we could no longer see it. We both looked around and you could not see any stars in the sky. I pulled my car into my driveway and immediately called the Escondido Police Department. The woman who answered the phone listened , chuckled and told me to call an 800 number. When I did, I got a recording for the TV show ""Unsolved Mystery's"". I called her back, gave her a sarcastic thanks and asked her to take my name and number in the event anyone else reported anything. I went out this morning during daylight and took a couple of pictures from the road where I first saw the object behind a house (house.jpg). Using PhotoShop I made a orange circle which represents the size and color of what I first thought was a hot air balloon (house-ufo.jpg). I also took a couple of pictures of where the object was just above the lamp post on the street adjacent to my home (see pic1-day.jpg).  Again using PhotoShop I made a circle to show you the size and color of the object prior to it moving South, then NW and up (pic1-day-ufo.jpg). On a side note my wife had mentioned that our neighbor had approached her only 2 or 3 days before and asked her if she had seen anything strange in the skies. I have given our neighbor your number and she said she would call you as apparently she claims to have seen a UFO as well. My apologies for such a long winded description but I get excited every time I think about what I saw. I am very open minded and would be stupid to think that we are alone in the universe. However I have never really believed in us being visited by something outside of our planet. In other words I was a true skeptic until last night. I have gone over the encounter many times in my head and cannot find any reasonable explanation for what I saw. Now man made object that I'm aware of could do what I saw this thing do. In the event you are wondering let me answer a few questions that others have asked me. There was no sound at all. This orange circle was consistent in color and did not change. There were no other colors present and there was no blinking. It was not a blinding bright but rather a dull fiery orange. I saw no background objects (no spaceships or anything like that) I do not do drugs. Thanks for allowing me to share this incident. I do not care what others think since I know what I saw and that is all that matters to me.

I went back inside a looked for it for another 30 minutes from the window but it did not reappear.  I just wanted to report it in case there were other sightings.  It was brief but spooky. It was not moving in a smooth fashion as I've seen traditional aircraft move....it moved quickly up and down and left and right. From my perspective it appeared to move only an inch or two in relation to the trees....and if it hadn't been moving, I'd say it was a star.  If it hadn't appeared so long, I'd say it was a meteorite.  It did not appear to be a satellite because it changed directions.  The light emited from it was not blinking.",1999-08-30T00:00:00,38.4004,-85.7725

The objects seen were three points of light in a triangular formation at an extreme altitude which appeared directly overhead and moved,Gold Canyon,AZ,1999-08-12T02:30:00,formation,35 sec.,"Occurred : 8/12/1999 02:30  (Entered as : 8/12/99 02:30) Reported: 8/20/1999 08:07 Posted: 8/30/1999 Location: Gold Canyon, AZ Shape: Formation Duration:35 sec.",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08721.html,"The objects seen were three points of light in a triangular formation at an extreme altitude which appeared directly overhead and moved in tight formation to the northeast at great speed. We were having an all night party for the perseid meteor shower when we saw these objects. There were 7 people total but 4 of them left before the event took place. We live just outside the Phoenix metro area near the Superstition Mountains. It is fairly dark at our location and is good for stargazing. I am an amateur astronomer and a professional musician. I very often observe several satellites crossing overhead during the early evening after sunset and have become familiar with their appearance in relation to the stars around them. At approx. 2:30 am I was lying down in a lounge chair looking at the sky directly overhead. My wife and a friend were inside the house. I then saw three points of light appear out of nowhere directly above me at what I believe to be the same altitude as the satellites I regularly observe. The lights were bluish white in color and steady with no flashing or flickering. They were in a precise triangular formation. It is difficult to estimate the size of the formation except to say that they would fit within the shape of a fist held at arms length. When they first appeared they were stationary for a few seconds but then started moving toward the northeast of my location at the same speed as some of the satellites which move very quickly across the sky. The triangle was equilateral in shape, all sides being the same length. After it started to move I immediateley checked to see if it was a solid object or three separate objects. Since I could see stars behind the formation as it moved, I have to assume that they were separate objects. The triangle was pointed in the direction in which it was moving and stayed in tight formation as it moved. About 20 sec. into the event my wife and a friend came back outside and I pointed out the formation to them. They also observed the formation and watched it as is moved to the northeast and disappeared over the horizon which took another 15 sec. or so. In my opinion, the two most significant things about this event were; >first< They appeared out of nowhere as if someone had clicked on a light switch. I have no doubt that this took place because I was looking directly at the position when they appeared. There was nothing there except the stars before they appeared. >second< They moved very quickly across the sky very similar to the satellites which I have observed. My wife thought it could be a formation of military jets in formation. But I have observed jets at high altitude in the past and they definitely do not move as fast as these objects did. After the event happened, I tried posting a report on the Skywatch Int'l discussion page but was unsuccessful due to the fact that I wasn't officially subscribed. I have since posted this report on the CSETI discussion page of which I am a member. It wasn't until this morning that I realized that I could report this to NUFORC. I should also like to mention that just prior to the event I was trying out some of the CSETI contact methods. I can't say for sure whether this initiated the event but thought that it should be mentioned. I am convinced that what I and my wife and friend observed was at the very least unusual and worthy of reporting. - ((name deleted))",1999-08-30T00:00:00,33.3715,-111.4369

Shortly after checking my email, I was turned to watch the movie when I caught a fast moving light passing through the branches of a tree in our front yard when I first took notice.  Thanks to my astronomy class I took in college, I can say that it was at about 75 degrees in the western sky travelling to the west, northwest and dissapeared at around 45 degrees(with of course 90 degrees being straight above my head).  I live in a small town of 3500 people and not far from our downtown area with pleanty of light polution to boot, more than you would think.

It had some depth.  I could not identify the color, but the spiral material was darker than the actual cylinder. The item did not appear to be hollow.  It appeared to have some kind of material spiraling around it, not in motion around the object, but being in complete contact with the cylinder.  At first, it appeared to be hovering but it was slowly moving west.  It was approximately 1500 feet high (max).  I watched the cylinder travel  west for about 5 seconds.

From this point, I believe it was the same object, a transparent, boomerang shaped object located about the same distance up, maybe 500 feet higher, began to travel south.  The boomerang shaped object appeared to have more of a rounded top while the bottom appeared to be more flat.  Maybe 2000 feet high.  The moon was south/southwest of the object and I could see the reflection of the moon on parts of the object.  However, I could not make out a definite outline of the object.  I could see it, I could make out its shape but I could not describe what color it was.  I could see right through the object.  When it passed stars, I could see the stars through the object but they were a little diffused like seeing them thru a tinted window.  Then, the definition of the curves in the object were a little more obvious as I watched the stars kind of curve a bit when they would pass the edges of the object.  The object was pointed south, but it was traveling at an angle where I could tell that it was boomerang shaped. As the object traveled more towards the moon, I blocked the light of the moon out with my hand and continued to track the object.  It continued to travel south but I lost it about an inch and a ! half (fr om where I was standing, it was an inch and a half from arms length) before it would have passed in front of the moon.

As I drove I kept watching the ball, it was very bright and stood out. Other craft could be seen, At lower altittude.   But after about 20-30 minutes I saw a jet approach a high speed, and the object went ballistic.  And was gone.   I spent several years in the service, and have seen just about every type of craft in the US inventory, both rotorary and fixed wing.  But I never saw a craft move so fast.  The jet did not have a chance.   PLEASE DO NOT release my information.  I DO NOT want my job to think I was a nut. That's a bad thing for a cop.

At exactly 1800 local (0400z) while warming up my car to go to work I was listening to the local AM talk show.  The topic was local politics, when a man called in & said ""Hey, there's a UFO out here! It's hovering over the water, there's all these lights.."" The show host cut him off saying ""does it say 'friends of Art Bell on it?'""  The man says ""Huh? I'm just past McQue Creek going to Girdwood, there's a UFO, I don't believe this...""  The host cut him off agian, making another crack about Art & disconnected him.  I left for work at this time, leaving Peters Creek heading southbound on Glenn Highway towards Anchorage.  As soon as I hit the highway my attention was drawn toward a very bright light, about the size of Venus (Venus was clearly visible to my left).  It was still for about 1 min then began to move slowly to the right (west).  At the same time I noticed 3 ""red flashes"" moving towards the UFO.  The red flashes were in a V shape the point closest to the UFO. The flashes came from the left (east), from Anchorage, while the UFO moved towards Elmendorf AFB.  The UFO accelerated swiftly, faster than the average aircraft, but not fast enough to leave tracers.  I easily left the flashes behind, then blinked out.  The flashes, now seemingly directly over the AFB, appeared to hover.  I got the impression the flashes were some kind of helicopters.  All this occured during a period of about 3 min.  I had been watching this while driving in the snow at 60 mph, almost going in the ditch several times.  After the UFO blinked out I intended to hurry to the next overpass & stop, to watch in safety.  Glancing to my left (east) to merge, I saw the/another UFO, very near to Venus.  Looking forward again I saw the red flashes heading towards it.  At this point I decided to just pull over, & noticed another car on the shoulder w/a man leaning out the open window watching the UFO.  By the time I had pulled over the UFO was gone, I didn't see what happened to it.  The man smiled at me & shrugged, & drove off.  I proce! eded to work.

We were looking straight up and a bit towards the North.  My son was pointing out the constellations to me as he likes to do.  We had just located Casseopia and the Pleades when right at that moment, from the West, we saw a marvelous shooting star with a long tail.  We both thought it must have made it to the earth intact.  We kept looking for satelites, but found none.  We did see alot of shooting stars however, just like the meteor showers.  As we were looking for moving objects my son finally said ""I found one.""  He was pointing it out to me and as I was turning to have a look, he yelled out ""No, it's three of them... together, they're moving together!!""  I turned and saw what he was looking at.  It was 3 satellites forming a perfect isosceles triangle and traveling in formation at exactly the same speed.  They never broke foramation or changed their speed which was slightly slower than most satellites we watch.  They looked like a small constellation traveling across the night sky.  They traveled from the NW to the SE and seemed to slowly veer more Southerly.  It took about 3-4 minutes for them to travel across the sky and we watched them travel until they faded out of our sight range.  My other son came out to watch them also.  We all remarked about how it could not be one big object because as it passed by other stars we could still see the stars through it... it was not solid.

Object was in a flat horizontal projectory. More information can be found in depth at the URL above. UFO Spotted on Mt. Baker, Washington (September 12, 1998) UFO Skywatchers from several parts of the United States gathered this year at Mt. Baker's ""Snowline Inn"". The group was gathered for the yearly rendevous at this location where organizer, Tom Sanger, of Arizona, had his UFO experience in 1988. He and a buddy were hiking near the US-Canadian border when they were closely approached by a UFO. Oddly, the ridge closest to the UFO's position is called the Pleiades. Since then, Tom has gotten a group together every year for the outing to Mt. Baker. This object was clearly seen by ten people that were in our party and 4 others that were set up farther away with telescopes. It initially approached from west to east traveling approximately 7,000 miles per hour, according to retired Air Force personnel in our party. Far too fast to see through binoculars or telescopes. It was clearly visible for 5-10 seconds before it faded out. Interestingly, it was on a horizontal trajectory and not arching as a meteor would. The UFO had an orange corona as something traveling very fast in the atmosphere. It was the size of a pencil eraser at arms length. Distance was difficult to judge in the darkness, but it was between Mt. Baker, and Mt. Shuksin and at about 15 degrees. Last year, several residents of the area reported bright green lights over Goat Mt. and what appeared to be a large round circular area ""cut out"" of the snow. The area is only accessible by air or walking. There are no logging roads to get up there. The ""cut"" was on the northern slope where there are no residents on the other side to see it. Local deer hunters ran across it. Shortly after, black helicopters were seen in the area flying over the area of the missing snow. No mention was ever made to anyone in the area as to what this might have been. After we observed the UFO, the moon rose and shone brightly. We could clearly see a dense fog rolling into the area making it impossible to see any further. We opted to leave. In the 8 minutes it took to get everyone going, the fog was so thick you could hardly see the one in front of you. The road was twenty miles of winding hairpins. That combined with fog was more than we wanted to chance. We took off down the road slowly at first. We passed only one car coming up. Our driver, a lady from Arizona named Tina, was sharp eyed and spotted Owls in the trees alongside the road. She stopped and we shone the flashlight on them. They stayed put. We saw about four of them on the way off the mountain. Were they really owls? One might wonder.... The following morning at breakfast, we spoke to the driver of the car that was coming up the mountain. She said there was no fog when they got to the top. Amazing, since it was only 20 miles, and they were almost to the top when we passed them. This fact and that our driver could spot owls in the trees on a treacherous road at night in the fog was just totally amazing. If Tom has this next year, it's a must go for me! You can't spot them if you don't look for them! If you want to take part in it, email me and I'll put you on the list. Your mind is like a parachute.

The sky was generally clear, but the four lights were in the area of one of the few clouds in the sky. The lights were all staying in the general area of the cloud, but would move into a gap in the cloud and sometimes out from behind the cloud completely. Even when behind the cloud, the lights were visible. The movement of the lights was very intriguing. Each would hover for a bit, then it might move in a sweeping manner upward. Sometimes one would streak horizontally and then would instantaneously reverse course or move at a radical angle. Each of the lights was moving independently of the others. This continued for several minutes. My wife then exclaimed, ""Look at that!"" and pointed just a little south of the cloud. I looked in time to see what I would call a gaseous light, greenish in hue, significantly larger than the round lights. It was like looking at an image through heat waves in the desert. I estimate it was three to four inches relative to my hand at arm's length. Within ten seconds or so the gaseous area resolved into more precise lights, jewel-like and muti-colored and the lights were in a formation that changed and within a few more seconds, appeared as a chevron shape, keeping the same overall size as the initial gaseous image. It then moved towards us, keeping a constant height and a smooth and steady course. I notice a round light, that looked like one of the first lights that we had observed, was flying just to my left of the chevron formation. Looking back into the cloud area at the first lights, I could now only find three of the round lights. They were still hovering and/or moving as before. The chevron/round light formation was continuing on its course and speed and slowly moved directly overhead and beyond until it was eventually obscurred by the Monte Carlo building. I strained to see if I could make out an object in the lights or hear any sound coming from the formation, but could not. Looking back to the area where the chevron first appeared, the ""gaseous image resolving to chevron"" event repeated. Again, the chevron was joined by a round light. I now could only see two round lights in the cloud area. The combo formation was, like the first, moving towards us. I looked from the sky to the area in which we were standing and noticed that there were now many more people watching the event. Most were exclaiming in amazement, myself included. When the first chevron appeared, I had heard many people shout as had my wife. There were a few cries of fear. It also looked like people on the other side of Las Vegas Boulevard in front of the MGM were also looking skyward and pointing. We crossed the street to the area in front of the New York, New York Casino. The second chevron had now disappeared from view over the Monte Carlo. I could now only see one of the original round lights. I pointed it out to a person coming out of the casino who said that he had seen this event before and that it was a bird, like a hawk, with ground lights reflecting off of it. He did not observe the chevron lights. A few other random observations: We observed the event for about fifteen minutes. I wanted to stay longer, but we had to leave to catch a flight at the airport. Early in the event, I noticed a small civilian aircraft in the general area, but it was lower and farther to the east. The event took place relatively close to the Las Vegas airport. Another friend that accompanied us never saw the round lights, but witnessed the chevrons. Although he is highly skeptical by nature, he had no explanation for what he saw. The MGM has large green lights that illuminate the building. The Luxor, farther south on the Strip, has a laser on top. I am not sure how high the clouds were and consequently have difficulty estimating the actual size or altitude of the formation. I have racked my brain trying to come up with an explanation for what we observed. I do not buy into the bird theory because of the relative speed in relation to the clouds, the radical flight patterns of the round lights, the visibility behind the clouds. Holographic images don't seen to fit either because of the great distance traveled by the chevrons. Also, at no time were the clouds themselves ever illuminated. We watched the paper for reports of the observation by others. My wife called the newspaper in Las Vegas. They said that they had not received any reports. They did not seem interested in her report. We recently learned of this site and decided to report our experience.",1999-06-23T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

These lights appeared to be interacting with each other, moving at high speeds, occasionally stopping and moving at extreme angles. The sky was fairly clear with some high clouds. These lights appeared to move behind and through the clouds on occasion. Within a few minutes, there were approx. 50 to 75 people witnessing the event. I could overhear several comments from the other people, and some were suggesting that perhaps they were high flying birds reflecting the lights from the strip. However, I thought that it was highly unlikely since the lights seemed to be very high and moving at extreme speeds. Approx. 5 minutes later, I began to see this long, thin vaporous line move across the sky in front of these 4 lights. It captured my interest because it appeared to move in a deliberate fashion. After observing this for several seconds, the gaseous line instantly materialized into 10 to 15 round, luminous objects that appeared to have all colors of the spectrum, and quite larger than the original 4 lights. They moved slowly high overhead in a chevron formation making no sound. One of the original 4 lights then joined with the objects as they continued high above. I had to bend my neck completely back; almost losing my balance to continue observing the phenomenon until it went over the Monte Carlo Casino and was obscured from my sight. Immediately, people began to shout with excitement. Some women were crying with fear, and some of the ""skeptics"" were stunned and annoyed that they could not explain it. I was absolutely blown away by what I saw. Perhaps, I could be persuaded to believe in some plausible explanation for the original 4 lights, but this phenomenon could not be explained away as birds, lasers, aircraft, satellites, or natural occurences, i.e., asteroids, meteorites, ball lightening or swamp gas. As we stood around in amazement, we continued to watch the remaining 3 lights in the sky. A minute or so later, I began to observe another vaporous line coming now from a point further south than the first, moving slowly, and instantly materializing again into 10 to 15 round, luminous objects moving in a chevron formation. Each time, it appeared that the objects were moving independently from each other but in formation. It did not appear to be one solid object. Unfortunately, approx. 15 minutes had gone by and the 4 of us had to get to the airport to make our flight back home to Seattle. The lights were still being observed as we walked away. The next day, I called the Las Vegas Journal to see if anything was reported. The Editor laughed and said there always was strange stuff going on in the sky and was not interested in getting my story. Background of Observers: 1.

This report appears to be submitted by a very reliable source.)) Someone in my bedroom, at least 3, and one touching me on the front where the crease of my neck is, my body tingling I went to bed early, 9:00 p.m., I thought I woke up but could have been asleep.  I felt that there was a person in my room.  I heard faint talking and then I realized that there were about 3 people, I thought men, in my room.  I was scared and my heart was beating fast.  I felt paralyzed and couldn't turn to look.  I was so scared I was afraid of looking.  I was sleeping on my right side with back towards the windows and they were standing behind me.  I felt hands come to the front of my neck, right where the crease is.  The hands or tips of the fingers touched there, resting on the crease.  I felt my torso tingling.  The phone rang and I completely woke up and was thankful.  I told the person on the phone what had happened.  I also told other people because it was so real to me.  One person mentioned that it sounded like an alien encounter.  Two weeks past the incident I went in for my annual check-up and the nurse left a message on my phone to contact them about my lab results.  I have always been in perfect health except for skin cancer and tooth problems.  I called and she said that my blood showed that I had a hyperthyroid and that I needed to come in for tests.  I was totally shocked.  However, the next day the occurrence of what happened two weeks prior came to my mind and the placement of the hands.  They were placed on my thyroid.  I go in for tests on May 11.  I still don't know for sure if it was a dream or reality but to me it seemed very real.  Not too many things frighten me but I was very scared and felt there was something going on behind my back (no puns intended).  I witnessed a UFO sighting in 1966 - saw the craft up close and thought that maybe they are tracking me.  I have never reported my sighting until now.  The person that saw the UFO with me is now dead but the last time I was with him we talked about it.  The craft we saw was huge with no sound and hovered above us and above the trees.",1999-05-24T00:00:00,47.6476,-122.53639999999999

Then as half-way as a joke, I went to get the most powerful flash-light I could find. Then I returned to the window, and then started flashing the light towards them. They seemed to respond, flashing back as flashed. I even flashed the light in a sequence,once every two seconds, and they repeated it back to me. Right after that, a large,oval-shaped,creamy-white light,with a haze of the same color all around it, flashed right behind a tree about twenty feet away from the window.It looked like it was hovering, didn't land, but just stayed there for a second.It only did this once. I was so scared, I put the light out, pulled down the shades, and tried to find a different way to get to sleep. The next night, I had a friend stay the night with me.

There were portholes where a ""hat band"" might be.  No noise, no movement.  I looked for people on the street so I could point it out.  No one was around.  I was waiting for a bus.  It arrived.  I got on and left. I walked to the corner of Wilshire Blvd. and Westgate Avenue in West Los Angeles to catch a bus.  It was about July 23, 1997, 12:30 pm.  While waiting, I looked up at the tall buildings to my left (east)and saw a craft hovering between two buildings.  It was shaped like a top hat, and had portholes where a hat band might be.  It did not move,it did not make noise.  There was a lot of automobile traffic on the blvd., but I saw no pedestrians on the street so I could point it out to them. I knew for sure that people in the high rises around would and could see it if they looked.  I gazed at it the whole time until the bus came. When the bus came, I got on the bus and left. What amazed me about the encounter was that I was not startled, not afraid, not shaken at all.  I felt a kind of communication as if they were saying, ""We see you.""  And I was saying, ""Yes, and I see you too."" In a way it was comforting.  Almost like being watched over. Several nights later I had a dream that I was caught up into a ""round room"" with windows all around.  I could see the skyline of West Los Angeles.  I was there with my sister and my two nieces.  Each of us had an instructor/guide/teacher.  Each of us were totally in thrall and occupied intensely with what each teacher was saying that we hardly acknowledged each other.  My teacher was beautiful.  He had shoulder- length blonde hair, about 32 years old, with a bare chest.  He was loving, gentle and kind.  As I sat mesmerized in his teaching, I found myself wanting to embrace him.  His skin was so beautiful.  It smelled wonderful too.  (I can still remember the fragrance)  He gently and laughingly distracted me from this lustful pursuit and refocused my attention on his teaching. I felt that this visit was a ""check-up"" to see how we were all doing. It was more a spiritual and mystical and metaphysical exam, not a physical one.  After each of us were through with our private lessons, my guide went to the front of the ""room"" and at a board or screen was teaching us all.  It was a lesson about time.  In essence what I remember him saying was that there was no such thing as time, but that it was a concept that we earthlings/encarnates agree upon believing in for the ""time being."" After all the lessons, the ""room"" started spinning and we lifted up and away, and I looked down and recognized Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, the Hollywood Hills and the San Bernardino mountains in the distance to the east.  I felt as though it was just a ""joy ride"" for us ""kids,"" as a ""reward."" I choose not to submit my name or any personal information.  I don't need any MIB's harassing me.

As it came out of the manuver, it continued in the same direction until out of my view. The speed never seemed to change and the moves were very smooth. All looked very unatural. No sounds were heard and no trails were seen even though other aircraft in the sky were leaving trails.",1999-04-26T00:00:00,,

This is the email I sent then: About 1:20 am tonight I was working here at my computer which has a whole wall of windows beside it.  We live on San Juan island in Washington BTW.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a very bright light in the sky. I looked over at it and saw it was very bright and looked unusual.  So I grabbed the binoculars I have here for ship watching. In looking through my binoculars I could see a triangular shaped thing in the sky, very bright with one side red lights and the other green.  It seemed to be just hovering motionlessly.  I thought it must be a helicopter but it just never seemed to move.  When I took down the binoculars I could see it was quite high in the sky near the off coast island of Chatham.  I watched it for about five minutes and it didn't move although sometimes it seemed to change angle or something as the lights got dimmer at times (as though it was being seen side on or something).  It then moved down a bit slowly, then stopped, then moved a bit etc.  The red and green lights were very bright at times and it was sometimes a distinct triangle shape and other times not clearly shaped (it seemed to move so that I was seeing it from different angles).  My husband was asleep so I didn't wake him up..until suddenly this object started moving *very fast* and very erratically..........just squiggles of light streaking and darting about in a very random way and very fast.  With that I called my husband and he came downstairs.  He came over to the window and I told him what I was still seeing and I said I know of nothing that moved that way and handed him the binoculars.  Unfortunately he was totally mistaken about where to look although I told him where (he wasted 2 or more minutes looking into the water!).  By the time he got that when I said ""I think I might be seeing a UFO"" it would be best to look at the bright object in the sky as I said, it had stopped moving.  I saw with my naked eye the object was now over the city of Victoria (this was about 1:40 am PST tonight Feb 14).  He looked through his binoculars and said yes it was red and green lights and he thought it was triangle shaped and it wasn't moving.  He watched it for about 7 minutes and then said it was getting fainter.  I looked through the binoculars and saw that indeed it was getting faint and it seemed to fade away (into the distance?). The lights were *not small blinking lights* as one normally sees on an airplane.  They were a *bank* of lights and did not blink.  The red was on the left and green on the right as I observed it.  My husband confirmed with me that he observed the same thing.  Also he confirmed with me that he watched this *unmoving* object for approximately 10 minutes.  Before I called him downstairs to see it, I watched it for about 15 minutes then as I was hesitant to awake him.  As I said earlier it did not move in that time period until its sudden darting movement which caused me to call my husband. Other than this one burst of sudden movement it always seemed to be stationary until it faded away.  I don't know of any airplane that moves that way or looks like that.  I have often seen planes in the sky and they did not look this way. As a test a few nights later (the night after I wrote the email) we both trying looking at everything we saw in the sky for over 1 hour both outside and through the windows.  Planes looked nothing like it. Stars looked nothing like it.  Planets (we could see Mars and probably Jupiter early in the evening) did not look like it.  I even tried to duplicate the darting type motion by moving my head as I watch through the binoculars and I had to move my head about a great deal to make the light I was looking at seem to *move*.  I assure you I was not moving my head when I watched the strange light on the 14th nor was I having any tremors in my hands.",1999-04-26T00:00:00,,

This became visable to us as we climbed in elevation so, by the time we noticed it it was very large, suggesting it was fairly close.  It was much larger than the moon would appear to be if in the same position. The very center of the ""ball"" had a green tint that was only noticable if viewed with peripheral vision.  Also, there was a red tail eminating from the green center that extended downward at about 45 degrees.  The object seemed to grow in diameter and lessen in intensity over the next five minutes until it disappeared. It was ""cloudlike"" and I would best describe it as an explosion of some sort.  As the light diminished we noticed two other objects, much smaller.  One looked to be heading south at a high rate of speed just over the horizon of the Seirra's, while the other appeared to be dropping from the ""explosion"".  This object moved erratically as if it were debris.  Both of these objects also looked like small comets, looking like small flashlights in the sky.  They may have been aircraft or helicopters?  One was definetly flying, but the other seemed to be ""floating"" downward and not in control.  Both were approximately the same size and had the same level of intensity.

I was driving north on the 101 freeway, 85 miles south of San Francisco, in a very wilderness area.  I was on top of a hill and had a clear view of the sky obstructed by very few trees.  I was momentary startled as a bright flash of light streaked from the top of my wind shield towards the nothern horizon.  It moved through the sky at incredible speed and flashed twice before disappearing beyond the horizon.  The streak of light was whitish-yellow in appearance and had significant thickness giving the perspective of something that was realitivly close to the ground, three or four miles would be my unfounded impression.  Also the light was very bright especially in the two instances when it flashed, the drama of the effect resembled a lightning flash close then resembled any meteor I've ever seen, with exception that the line traced in the sky was straight and there were no clouds in the sky. Also the object did not appear to burn our and fade away as meteors do, rather it just appeared to vanish at a point 20 degrees above the horizon, as if moving away from me a great speed. For some odd reason the second flash the object made, reminded me of the intro scenes to star trek the next generation where the enterprise makes a flash before going to warp. Nevertheless, in summary. The object had a large apparent size given the thickness of the trail. The object made two flashes as it streaked across the sky. The object traved from south to north. The object traversed at least 70 degrees of sky in 1/4th a second. The object was very bright, and had the effect of startling me.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,37.0692,-121.5567

I stared at it realized it was moving parallel to the freeway probably a mile or two away, it wasn't low to the ground probably about as high as a plane. At first I thought it was a satellite so I informed my friends who began to observe it as well. We quickly concluded it was moving to fast, was too bright, was way to low, and as its path started to change from a straight line to an arc we didn't know what to make of it. We observed it for another 15-20 seconds before it went above the clouds. Just as it dissapeared we saw a plane moving very fast from the opposite direction. It was on a direct path to possibly intersect the bright light some distance ahead but it too  went above the clouds. Their paths would have made an 'X' in the sky. We saw nothing after that, the cloud cover obscured the sky for the next half hour or so. I probably would have dismissed the incident but the fact that a plane was in the area too makes it weird.

(Pacific), a friend approached me in the hallway of the hotel and urged me to run outside immediately, stating that a UFO sighting was in process.  I was skeptical, but since I know the individual well, and know him to be a serious-minded person, I responded to his request.  I went out to the east side of the hotel, and found approximately 50-70 individuals looking to the east over the Colorado River, generally in the direction of Bullhead City, AZ, which is directly across the Colorado River from Laughlin, NV.   I looked in the direction that they appeared to be looking, approximately 80-90 degrees (azimuth; true), and quickly spotted 5 small, luminous objects, which at first appeared to be prominent stars, approximately the same magnitude and ""size"" of the stars that form the ""belt"" in the Orion constellation.  Three of the lights on the right, approximately 45-50 (est.) degrees above the horizontal plane, were in a formation that made me believe initially that I was looking at the Orion constellation, but the ""lights"" were in the eastern sky, and the Orion constellation is located in the southern sky at that time of night.  Approximately 2-5 degrees above the three lights, and approximately 5 degrees to their left, were two more similar, ""lights.""  Just a few seconds after I had begun looking at the two lights on the left, I observed that they were moving relative to one another.  They were turning, accelerating for a second or two, slowing suddenly, and then changing direction again.  Their movement seemed almost random, although they clearly were changing position, circling one another, etc..  At this point, I was intrigued by the display, given that it was profoundly bizarre and anomalous.  The display was like nothing I had seen in 51 years on this planet!   I then looked back at the three lights on the right, and was even more intrigued to note that they no longer formed a straight line, but they were moving, and within seconds they were beginning to orient themselves relative to one another in a triangular formation.  Within an estimated 5-10 seconds, they had formed into an isosceles triangle, and all of them were moving generally to the southwest, or south-southwest, at a very slow (angular) velocity, e.g. approx. 1 deg./sec..  That is, they had reversed their course from generally south to north, when I first observed them, to north to south, later in the sighting.  The entire group of witnesses stood in place, watching the lights slowly drift in that direction, for approximately 6-8 minutes.  All of the lights passed ""below"" an almost full moon, becoming fainter, it seemed to me, as they moved to the southwest.   Finally, the lights were no longer visible to me and they became progressively fainter until they were no longer visible to any of the witnesses, either. I have no idea what the objects were, but they CLEARLY were not meteors (!!), conventional aircraft, birds, insects, satellites, or any other object of terrestrial origin, with which I am familiar.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,35.10574736842105,-114.70477894736842

The sighting is as follows: Approximately 10:30 PM last evening [Sunday] while outside here in Corpus Christi and simply looking at the stars because the sky was clear, except for a few scattered clouds, I made what I know was a UFO sighting. Moving in a direction from south to north were three objects that CLEARLY were not conventional aircraft. [ Both my brothers are airline flight instructors and I have been around pilots all my life. I have a fairly good knowledge of aircraft and their characteristics.] The size of the objects is best explained by saying if you held a TYLENOL capsule [ the oval/cylindrical variety] at arms length to your vision, that would represent the size these objects were to my field of vision. They were a pale LUMINESCENT orange/pink in color. Flying/moving in formation. One behind another in a straight line. As they moved over me, the one in the rear of this formation, broke and passed the others, as an auto would on the highway and taking the lead position. Their speed was much faster than conventional aircraft. But as the one in the rear passed the others, and took it's place in the lead their speed all of a sudden intensified as they flashed completely out of my vision. I was most impressed with the impact this had on my consciousness. While observing them I seemed to be in an almost altered state of consciousness. As though time slowed down to allow me to make their observance in remarkable detail. There is not even a slight amount of doubt in my mind that these were not of this world.

Strange Brush fires near Verazanno Bridge I moved to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn in the Spring of 1997 and have since noticed that brush fires are a common occurence on Staten Island near the old fortress.  I have never associated these fires with anything other than dry brush until April of this year.  As we were returning home my fiancee and I noticed a rather large fire that was in the shape of a near perfect rectangle roughly a quarter of a mile high, with a smaller circular fire off to the right of the rectangle.  Standing on Shore Rd. in Brooklyn you could clearly see the red rotating lights from the fire engines on scene but the location must have been a challenge as there is aparently no access to the area, the land on either side of the bridge is a very steep grade that does not allow any vehicle parking much less a fire engine and there is a great disance between the water and the portion of the hill that was on fire. We agreed with two other people wathcing the fire from Shore Rd. that it was peculiar place and time of year for a spontaneous brush fire and that it must have been intentionally set. But by whom? Unless a passenger on a passing ship was able to throw a huge molotov cocktail a distance of approx. 7500 feet it was difficult to imagine how this could have been accomplished.  My fiancee suggested that it may have been set by a ufo during takeoff. Given all that occurred, that sounded more plausible than any other explanation.  I was not aware of the numerous sighting in that particular area of Brooklyn until I read other reports listed in this database.

I followed the sound with my eyes hoping to see something as it passed into view on the other side of the awning but I saw nothing.  The only sound from the object was the aural ""whoosh"" of something cutting through the air, there were no other sounds such as turbine or prop that would be associated with a conventional aircraft.

On Friday July 23 at 2.am, 6 of us walked outside to see a bright light in the eastern sky.  It was moving in a sporadic manner, as a fire fly would,although its light never died out.  At first its distance appeared to be up at the level of the trees, hence, the metaphor with the fire fly.  As we walked closer to it, we realized it was way up in the sky, at the distance an airplane might fly.  Its light was brighter than any star or planet and it emitted 3 major points of light. That is to say that it had an overall glow but it appeared to the squinted eye as three rays. The size of its light was at least 10 times bigger than any star.  The light continued to move in different directions although the movement was subtle, in that it did not cover large portions of the sky.  If you were to hold a ruler straight out it was moving within an area of two square inches.  However, we watched it for a good 45 minutes and it had changed its position in the sky by at least a foot.  Its movement was jagged in that it kind of oscillated back and forth but gained overall movement in one direction.  At certain times it moved steadily and there was one period of time where it moved in circular or elliptical fashion in a somewhat more energetic and less regular manner. Thank you for your attention.

Had direct communication with sphere. In October 1961, I awoke from a sound sleep with a feeling the something was in my room.  I was 7 years old.  My older brother (11 yrs) was already awake and he pointed towards a light behind the metal venetian blinds of our first floor bedroom window.   I felt compelled to look behind the blind slats.  When I did I was face-to-face with a dull silver metalic sphere approximately 18-24 inches in diameter.  The sphere was hovering silently and motionless right next to the window glass (single-pane glass with a metal frame).   The sphere had a recessed rectangular panel (approx 10 inches across by 3-4 inches high).  There were red dots (unkonwn numer and pattern) and there was a very bright white light at the right and left sides of the panel.  (Two lights total).  The lights were the color and intensity of examiination lights in a dentist's office or in an operating room.  (At the time I had never seen either type of medical lights before).   The sphere hovered motionless and I was in direct communication with the sphere.  It was a very strange sense of consciousness that I never experienced before the event.  I was paralyzed and was in a one-way communication with the sphere.  It was telling me things in my head without audible words.  I was unable to understand specifically what was being said, but it was very important that I listen to the messages.  I believe there were at least four simulataneous ""voices"" talking at the same time in Engilish as I stared into the sphere.  It was a multi-voice message.   My brother was not involved in this contact.  The sphere slowly began to rotate silently  away from me to my right.  As it rotated, the lights went off.  The sphere's motion was very smooth and silent.  It rose more rapidly and disappeared into the sky.   My brother did not look out the window as far as I know.  I still look out the window evey night before I go to bed and whenever I wake up during the night to check for something.   I am now 44 years old.

It actually looked like a medium sized submarine hovering in the sky with no wings, fins or propellars. It had redish and blue-green lights that went on and off in rotating motion. What startled us most about it is that it was completely silent; made no noise except for a faint metalic clanging noise. My youngest brother began to cry. It moved along slowly at about 3-5 miles per hour for several minutes and then shot straight up into space and disappeared in a split second (Speed was definately more than 100 miles per hour!).

Every night after that, we ventured back up on the roof of our house to try to see the object again.

My sister and I hiked to the top of a bald mountain, Black Balsam Knob (about 5800'), in Haywood County in North Carolina.  It was a cloudless night with no moon at the time.  We arrived at the top of the mountain about 9:45pm.  We had an unobstructed 360 degree view of the horizon.  We ate sandwiches as a late dinner, and gazed at the stars, locating several constellations, the Milky Way, etc. in the clear mountain air. After eating, we lay on our backs and looked at the sky with our 8x35 binoculars.  Almost directly overhead, near the constellation Cygnus, we saw two objects that we were uncertain about.  Both were slightly larger than stars, one bluish and one orange-tinted.  Neither were familiar to us, though we had been amateur astronomers throughout our youth.  They were no brighter than Vega, an Magnitude Order 1star.  We commented to one another about these two objects of which we were unfamiliar. I looked at the orange-tinted one through the binoculars to see if it might be a planet, but could not identify it as such.  As I was watching it, the binoculars stable against my eye sockets and my head resting directly on a rock, I observed the object begin to move in a zig-zag pattern toward the southeast, with abrupt near-ninety-degree turns at each zig or zag.  The zig-zags were not large, but were about the distance of the width of my index finger held at arm's length, relative to the stars.  After zig-zagging about the distance of the width of my hand held at arm's length, the object accelerated in a straight line for another realtive two inches, then faded from view.  The object did not change in intensity of brightness or color during its movement. The duration of movement was about four seconds. This amazed me, and I exclaimed how cool it was and asked my sister if she saw it.  She answered with an anxious yes.  We discussed what it might have been, and she asked for the binoculars.  I gave them to her, and we commented on the strange bluish object.  As she was watching the bluish object with the binoculars, and I with my naked eye, it proceeeded to move in the same manner as the orange-tinted object, and faded from view. There were no sounds emanating from either object.  We ruled out helicopters due to the no-sound factor, and that we were already at almost 6000 feet.  We ruled out airplanes, due to the impossibility of performing the stationary moevement, then the zig-zag.  Same for balloons.  While they might have been satelites, this does not explain the erratic and substantial zig-zag movement, nor the change from being a stationary object to being a moving one.  They were not comets, as these obviously do not have an apparent movement over that small a time-interval.  They did not behave like meteors, in that they were clearly visible in a stationary fashion for at least five minutes before they moved.  We were left with no aceptable explanation in identifying these. My sister was a rising junior at a state university, and I was a rising freshman at UNC.  Neither of us took drugs or alcohol.",1998-11-19T00:00:00,35.1698,-82.7897

I remember one night being floated against my will down the stairs of our house. I was terrified , and my feet were about a foot off the ground .there was a short figure (even seemed shorte than me )which I took to be a which and it was beside me the whole time. I tried to grab the wall and the bannister but could not get a firm hold. My next memmory, can't say wether or not it was the same night, occured in my driveway. this one happened repeatedly. I would find myselfe being floated down my driveway towards the road by little grey men . that they conformed so accurately to the modern stereo-type is the reason that I am reporting these events.  thes e guys seemed very real to me. after the first time I seemed to recognise them and them me . like with the witch, my feet were about a foot,maybe two feet off the ground and I would keep trying to find the ground so i could run, with my legs moving in a cycling motion below me ,but i never found it. This hpenned about three or for times and at least one of the times one of my little sisters was there with me. At the time I thought these were morethan dreams and wondered if maybe they were real but in another dimension or something that shared the smame space that I normally lived in but was normally not accesible. I also remember finding myselfe in my next door nighboors back yard in the middle of the night and having to climb up the hill back to my house. I moved to Scotland when i was therteen and didn't have anymore of these dreams. But I did have another strange dream when I moved back to connecticut for university I was staying at a freinds house in New Canaan durring the summer when I had this dream where I was on my back on like a hospital bed , being steered through a huge well lit place by two people. there were many other people , in groups but I didn't take much mote of them.when i was left olone on the bed I tried to run but my feet had some kind of glass sandles or something crudely stuck to the soles. as I ran back the way they had brouht me these sandles slid arround on the mettalic floor.  I ended up in some kind of smaller darker room with some people who were doing a project and were very calm and made me feel more relaxed. this could have just been a dream,I really dont know ,but I mention it just in case anyone else has had a similar one I am 27 years of age and fairly well educated and work as a deck -hand in Miami by the way- about a month ago I saw a green/blue fireball looking north west from my balcony .It was bigger and slower than a shooting star and move more horizontal than virtically. it dissapeared after lees than two seconds. it was almost the sise if the moon.",1998-11-19T00:00:00,41.1625,-73.5021

There was ""no sound"" coming from it at all! We watched it for a few moments when we all of a suden heard jet engine noise's (we were both aircraft maintenance) so we knew the sounds but it wasn't coming from the light, it came from to British fighters shooting out ""photo flash cartridges"" to light up the sky for taking photo's. These were ""Recon"" birds but this light shoot across the sky like somethinmg out of ""Star Wars"" with the same type of light as the ""light saber"" would make! In a flash it was headed towards London (you could see the lights of London from this hill). The aircraft tried to ""chase it"", they kicked into ""burner"" (full throttle - afterburner)but couldn't even catch up.

It hit us with the light and then shot straight up and vanished! The fighters flew back towards our area and kept going! I raced back and woke my wife out of her sleep, also the security policeman at the gate (gate-guard) saw the light and asked if ""we"" saw what was going on!

It was moving in a straight line.It was oval shaped with a dull white color. I did not see any protruding features like wings or tail. Due to its small size it was hard to tell how far it was. I feel it was close to a 1/2 mile ahead. Size comparison to birds [ducks or seagulls] in the vincinity but closer was that of the torso of a large bird at 3 to 400 yards without a head or wings. The object was moving too low and fast to belong where it was. Small object.

I came to the stop light behind three or four cars at the Broadway intersection. At this location the street is on a decline.

I've had been out of town until today [12/24]so I am, only at this time doing this report. This gave me a lot of time to think about this sighting and to evaluate what I actually saw. What I saw was this: While coming to a halt at the intersection on icy pavement, I looked to the area just past the intersection, I was slightly higher at this spot as the street was on a decline with several cars ahead of me. We were all waiting for the light to change. This afforded me a view of the viaduct ahead that goes over the Platte River. This viaduct is about a 1/4 mile past Broadway. A few large trees line the river bank on the left. I think they are cottonwoods at about 40 feet in height. That puts the trees  to the south side of my west bound route on Evans Street.The sky was clear with a plume of smoke coming off a power plant to the southwest area beyond these trees. As I looked up I was watching 2 or 3 large birds flying around the trees and the river.I then saw the object come into my line of sight from the right heading from north to south,southwest. I fixxed my eyes on the object because of its speed and course. It past by a bird headed in the same direction at a higher altitude and it was moving!!!. The bird it past is what I compared it to in size. The object was farther away and above some power lines as well. The power lines were closer in, but I can go back and visualize the position of the object above the power lines. I watched it for 5 or 6 seconds until it went behind the trees to the south and traffic started to move again. I moved with traffic across Broadway and up on the viaduct past the trees to see if I could see it again. The object was gone. I beleive the sighting was 5 or6 seconds in duration because I later later recreated its velocity with my finger and move my finger as the object moved and counted the seconds. I know this object did not belong over populated Denver at its altitude and speed. It moved in a straight line with maybe a slight incline to the south southwest direction. The object appeared to be between me and the powerplant to the southwest. The speed I estimate would be comprable to a military jet at 3 or 400 miles per hour.

Christchurch, New Zealand. I love astronomy and often have a good look at the Stars on a clear night. I'm not a fanatic about religion or UFO's and never thought I'd see anything like it. My girlfriend witnessed it briefly, after I woke her up quickly. There I was lying in bed at 4:30am awake, but feeling content. As usual spotting a satellite here and there in the sky. Sometimes looking out the window behind my pillow, sometimes not. -------------------------------------------------- Then I saw a flash of bright white light. as bright as one of the brightest stars. Although, it was more like a pulse. There was no sound. It seemed very high up. But it moved really fast ! 3 pulses, each 2 seconds apart, while moving fast in a straight direction. Then a pause of about 3-4 seconds and two more bright white pulses going in a slightly different direction. ====================================================== Not a satellite... Satellites move much slower, and reflect constant orange light. And move in a straight line. Not a plane... No sound at all, moving too fast, and no red or green tail lights, wing lights or head lights etc. It was traveling almost at the speed of a meteorite or object (like a falling star) entering the atmosphere. Traveling from one side of my large window view to the other, in the space of 10 - 11 seconds. But, it was a pulse like a spot light, quickly pulsing in different directions. Not a window reflection... There was nothing electrical plugged in or switched on in our bedroom. I could almost see it when it wasn't ""pulsing"". Black and much larger than any satelite I've ever seen. I yelled at ((Name deleted)) to wake up, not taking my eye off the sighting. she woke up in time to see the last pulse. She said ""wow a bright flash ! "" ==================================================== That's all. I felt like running outside, but I was stuck staring in the direction of the last visible pulse. Talked with ((Name deleted)) about it for 20 - 30 minutes. Then she fell asleep about 45 minutes before I did. I have no conclusions. Just, that it was the most unusual thing I've ever seen in 20 - 23 years of night sky watching. And happened exactly like I say here. Faithfully. ((Name deleted)).     ( age 33 ) P.S.  this is true. I would never ever make up a story like this. ( unless someone was going to give me a million dollars :) Sorry.... bad joke.  ( the ""million dollar"" part )",1999-02-16T00:00:00,,

Several co-workers and I were at work by the quarry in Hodgkins, IL and saw something in the sky.  It was a clear night, just a couple days after Christmas and the area we were in was located around forest preserves and low lighting.  We looked up towards the north end of the sky because there were several lights in the distance.  Everyone kept saying they were planes but then quickly dismissed that idea when the lights began to change from white to blue to red in very short bursts, so fast that the colrs seemed to blend togather.  These lights were stationary in their positions.  There were five of them: three formed a perfect triangle and the other two just stayed outside of the triangle.  They never moved for five minutes and then all of a sudden one would disappear completely and reappear on the other side of the triangle.  This pattern repeated itself several times, but the triangle always stayed constant and the lights kept flickering colors.  We didn't stay outside long because we had to work and also because no one belived it could be a UFO, may be just something that was ahappening over Lake Michigan with helicopters or something.  Helicopters don't flass several colors at an amazing speed, stay stationary for a while and disappear completely and reappear.",1999-02-16T00:00:00,,

It began quickly flashing orange lights then dimmed into the darkness but quickly lit up again w/a bright white light. It continued w/this flashing pattern for the duration of the event. It never got any closer or further away until about 6 a.m. then it slowly lowered below the treeline out of sight. I woke my husband after watching it for the 1st min. or so. He was intregued enough to watch the entire event. The event occured in the western sky at varying distances above the neighborhood treeline. We couldn't detect a shape for sure.
