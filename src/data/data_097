While I was driving south on I-5 through western Washington at approximately 2 am on the morning of August 6th, 2014, an object flew over my car which I could not identify.  I had just passed the exits for Southcenter Mall and SeaTac Airport a few minutes earlier. Although I only saw this object for a second at the very most, I do recall the image of it clearly, and the thoughts that raced through my mind at the time and shortly thereafter. The object was a bluish white sphere that seemed to have an internal light source.  It was flying in almost the exact same direction as I was driving.  As the object quickly moved away in front of me, it seemed to lose some of its blue tint and become more white, but there was still a definite blue tint to it. When I extend my arm fully and raise my thumb, I would say the object was twice the size of my thumb when it first appeared at the top edge of my windshield.  By the time it vanished over the tree line, or the horizon, it seemed to be only half of its original size. I could not see any stars in the sky at this time, and I’m not sure if there was some cloud cover or there was just too much “city light” at this location.  My first thought was “wow, this thing is close”.   Immediately after this I was thinking “wow, it’s going to hit the ground”. (the object did seem to be losing altitude quickly).  Before I even finished this second thought however, the object had already vanished from sight. There was no flash, sound, or other evidence to convince me it did hit the ground, so now I think it just flew so fast that it disappeared over the horizon.  I was asking myself what this thing could have been, but I didn’t have anything to even compare it to.  Then I asked myself what it was NOT. I’m sure it was not a plane or a jet of any sort, and I’m sure it was not a shooting star.  At least not like any I have ever seen.  This sighting happened 26 hours ago as I type this, and I’m still clueless as to what I actually saw flying over my car.

I stopped playing to look at the sky when I noticed I could see the moon in the daylight, and it looked quite beautiful. As I'm looking at the sky, I get the bright idea (influenced by an internet forum) to pulse a laser into the sky as it is rumored to attract strange craft.  Not believing this in the slightest, I pulsed the light about 10 times in a few seconds. I then noticed a craft slowly flying across the sky to the lower right of where I had shined the laser (at least a couple of miles in the air). When I saw the craft I immediately ceased to use the laser, as I was unsure as to if it was a plane, and the last thing I need is to cause a pilot some distraction.  I continued to watch it fly across the sky from west to east at speeds a typical airliner would be flying.  The intriguing part was that I could see no wings, no tail fin, and no discernible markings that you can usually see on airliners as they fly in the area. As the craft moved further east, my opinion that it was an airliner went out the window as a large electric-blue ball of light quickly appeared behind the craft, and then in disappeared entirely.  The sky was crystal clear in all directions, and at the speed and direction it was flying, it should have continued to be visible for at least another ~3 minutes.

We were drinking a little and just having a good time at his place in west Suffield CT.  When we both stepped outside for whatever reason at the time and saw what appeared to be a great orb of light at first.  It was apparent that this was not an airplane because it was not moving.   It just remained still for about 30 sec then suddenly started to jump in random spots in about a .5 mile radius from its original spot.   Then as crazy as it sounds I could actually make out the shape of the craft.  Classic old sci-fi movie flying saucer is what it appeared to look like with a system of lights around the circular edge.  What really freaked me out is when I looked even closer and could make out what appeared to be what some call a (touchdown).  But the beam of light coming from the bottom of the craft wasn't light at all. It blended in with the sky and I could only see the edge of it.   When suddenly the beam of whatever it was disappeared and the crafts lights flashes starting with one bulb and went around the saucer ending with a single red flash from a bulb.  That red flash was the last I saw from the craft as it quickly disappeared into the sky.   I don't know what that thing was but I am just curious if me and my friend are the only ones who saw this craft that night.

This group changed formation repeatedly but would return to a group of 3 in line with one that moved randomly around them.  These objects moved laterally and up and down. No man made aircraft that I have ever seen moves in this manner. I was in an ait squadron in the Navy and have seen all sorts of planes, helicopters, etc.  These objects did not move in a manner I have witnessed in man-made aircraft. The second group appeared to be a bit north and ~5 miles west of the first group.  This was a group of 5.  It is possible that this 2nd group could have been parachutists that I have heard were working a fireworks show.  They did appear to descend. This report was prompted by the fact that this was the 2nd time I have seen a similar event on the 4th of July.  Either last year or the year before we witnessed objects that moved like the eastern-most group reported last night.  They most definitely moved 1000's of feet up and down and potentially miles side to side in a way that was not possible by man-made aircraft.  Also, these objects were in the air long enough that we actually got bored watching them and went back to watch fireworks.

About 10 minutes later my friend tapped me on the shoulder and pointed in the opposite direction of the fireworks (east) and said ""What is that?""  I turned and looked where he was pointing and saw 3 lights hovering in the sky.  They were completely stationary for about 15 seconds.  Then a fourth light appeared and they started moving slowly left to right in a perfect line. At this point my 4 friends and I were all watching and making a bit of a scene pointing and yelling in confusion and at least 10 other people had turned around and were looking too.  There were at least 30 people on top of the trail we were on, I can't say for sure how many people witnessed this object but there were several. The 4 lights appeared to be absorbed into one, and then would re appear as 4.  Then, all 4 disappeared suddenly, reappeared for a few moments, moved upwards slowly, and then disappeared again.  This all happened in less than 2 minutes. I heard one man ask one of the park rangers who were there if he saw the object and what he thought it was.  The trail ranger said hesitantly ""It was probably parachuters"", which made no logical sense.  No one had any other suggestions of what it was and everyone appeared to have the same uneasy feeling. These were not fireworks or like anything I have ever seen in my life.

Two fiery objects high in the sky before fireworks display. Neighbors gathered to see the fireworks display saw a fiery object high in the southwest sky and streaking toward the north.  First we thought it was a flare but it was much higher than a marine flare would be.  Some one speculated it could be space debris.  As it streaked downward 2 fiery tails came straight down and appeared to burn out before reaching the ground. A few minutes later we noted a fiery orange object high in the sky sky to the west.  It hovered at the same height for 1-2 minutes and then flew to the south at a constant height.  It no longer appeared fiery as it disappeared from view. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello, Peter, I listened to your appearance on the Jeff Rense program when you had guests on who saw the events before the Seattle fireworks on July 4, 2014.  My report is the one above.  I live in the Eastlake neighborhood, of Seattle, 1-1/2 blocks from Lake Union, in a condo.  We have a roof deck above the 3rd floor of the condo where we watch the fireworks every 4th of July. One of your guests seemed to think there was something ominous about the military helicopter carrying the American flag.  That has been a part of the Lake Union fireworks show for about 26 years, as long as I’ve lived on the east shore of Lake Union.  When they first started the show years ago they had searchlights all around the lake to track the helicopter with flag.  But as budgets grew smaller, they went to the military helicopter with a light on the flag, which does not show off the flag as well as the searchlights did.  The helicopter always comes from the north, flies over Gas Works Park (where there is a big daylong event), and then flies around the lake shore before going back north. After I made the above report, I looked online to see if there were any reports about the events I saw.  The first object I saw was a white light streaking, like a shooting star or meteor.  But it suddenly broke into 2 tails that went directly down to the water.  Online I found information that skydivers were supposed to jump into the lake, wearing sparklers on their feet, and the promotional material said it would look like a meteor.  I could not find any news items that said the skydivers completed that dive, although I know skydivers landed at Gas Works Park in an earlier skydive as planned.  I don’t know if that is the explanation for what I saw. I find it hard to believe that sparklers could be that bright. The other object I saw was a fiery, flaming thing. It was orange-red, like when you see a car burst into flames in the movies, as if fueled by gasoline or other accelerant. First I thought it might be a sky lantern, because I frequently see sky lanterns launched from that area - North Queen Anne Hill, in the vicinity of the Lake Washington Ship Canal.  But the flames were so big and bright I did not think a sky lantern could have that much fuel. My next thought was it could be an aircraft on fire, but then it would have crashed. Instead, the flames disappeared.  Then from that location in the sky I saw a steady blue light moving across the sky, I estimate at the same height an airliner at cruising altitude would be, and in about the same location as I often see aircraft.  But the light was steady blue, not flashing, and no other lights were visible.  This light maintained a constant speed from north to south (as I looked toward the west), and I saw it go behind a cloud and then reappear until it disappeared from my view.  Here’s what I found on one online description of the skydivers: Skydivers If you're going to Gasworks Park for the 4th of July celebration, fireworks won't be the only things in the sky you'll be seeing. Skydivers from Shelton company Skydive Kapowsin will be jumping into the Gasworks Park area twice as part of the fireworks show. The first jump will be into the Gasworks Park crowd at 7:30 p.m., while the second jump at 10:10 p.m. will be into the water at Lake Union. The second jump will feature skydivers wearing wingsuits with lights on them, so look for their bright lights to be screeching across Lake Union. ____________________________________________________________________________________ I’m not sure if this makes things more clear or more confusing, but I realized I hadn’t mentioned the blue light before. Thanks,",2014-07-05T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

I would have been about 12 years old at the time.  It was not long after dark.  Weather was warm with clear skies.  I was in the family room of my parent's house, looking out a large picture window.  Windows on both sides of the picture window were open to let in an evening breeze.   Directly in front of me above the trees across the street, a large circular UFO flew directly towards my parent's house.  The craft was darker than the night sky and could be seen as a circle.  The outer circumference of the craft had multi-colored lights all the way around.  Either the craft was rotating as it moved forward or the lights were changing color in a way that mimicked rotation.  The craft moved somewhat slower than I would have expected for low-flying light aircraft.  The craft's altitude appeared to be below 500 feet.  I estimate the craft was 60 to 100 feet across.

Back one evening in 1987 (Fall, I believe), some friends of mine and I were in Portsmouth, NH, where we stopped off at Gooseberry Market.  As we left, one of us pointed out an odd formation in the sky, over above nearby Pease AFB.  We noticed at least one other group of people ahead of us looking at it. The object was a large (two football fields length?) dark black cigar shape.  No color, no visible lights save for the ambient reflection of the AFB ground lighting on its underbelly.  It just stood there silently in the dark partly cloudy sky - it was in the early evening, so the sky was already dark by then. After a few minutes, the object began to move very slowly into a cloud - yet, on the other side of the cloud there was nothing -- it was if it were disappearing somewhere.  During that time, I recall seeing two tiny sparkly white lights drop out of the middle, swirl around each other and dart off in opposite directions. It is possible it just went into the dark sky and wasn't visible, but it really did appear as if it were gradually disappearing into thin air.",2014-05-02T00:00:00,43.06793627118645,-70.7985986440678

I had no thought of aliens or anything, the farthest my questions went was how did we start, and what are stars.  Well my family are Christians, so I thought I had my only answers, until that night.  I was sleeping on the 2nd floor of my great grandparent's house and woke up in the middle of the night.  I was sleeping in a sleeping bag in between two beds where my mom and grandma slept.  I had seen a bright blue light shining through the curtains that covered a sliding door the other side of the room.   I walked over to the sliding door, having no fear or suspicion, just simply curiosity.  I opened the curtain, the house is like an L, and had seen the bright blue light glimmer on the other side of the roof, but couldn't see what the light was.  I had seen to 7 to 8 ft. tall aliens.  I didn't think of aliens at the time.  My thoughts were, ""I thought we were the only walking smart animals on the planet, I didn't know there were others.""   And there were four of them, two on the other side of the roof so I couldn't see them, and two on my side.  One of them had a device in its hand, best description would be like an Ipad as thin as paper, and was swiping its finger over it as if it was a touch screen.  The other paced back and forth, not fast, but quickly as if agitated by something. It stopped and started speaking in a weird tone I can't explain, and the other looked up and responded, then quickly went back to its work.  The other went back to pacing, but stopped, looked up, and turned its head towards me.  I was kinda scared then, but continued looking at it. It started walking towards me, but I thought about how the roof ends before it reaches the sliding door. I was concerned about how it was going to fall and why it didn't realize it was going too. So I watched until the fateful moment, until it stepped on the air.  It took 3 steps on the air as if it was flat ground, at that time! i panicked, thinking that's not normal, this is not real. I r! an to my sleeping bag and covered my eyes for a literal half second, the house is designed weird, the stairs lead straight to the room, the sliding door is right next to the stairs. I peaked over my sleeping bag and had seen its head poking up in the sight between the railings for the stairs.  I did my flash peak again and it was standing at the top of the stairs, I did it again, and it was standing in the middle of the room, again, it was at the foot of my sleeping bag.   It was teleporting, also it got to the stairs when a couple seconds earlier it was walking on air outside and you have to open a door to get to the stairs, the door is so loud, you'll wake everyone up it you open it, it was closed.  And it was looking me in the eyes, it had a slit for a mouth, I couldn't see a nose, but it was dark besides the shimmering blue light.  And it had large black eyes, at the time I described him like Spider-Man.  He bent over and was about to grab my face it looked like but stopped about, 3-4 inches away.  I examined its hand and it had long fingers that ended in round bumps, like frog fingers, and its skin kinda glimmered like a frog's skin.  But it was more of a greyish color with a tint of green.  I looked past its open fingers and saw its head turned to the other side of the room, where an identical being was standing at the top of the stairs, but it was like I could feel their differences through their energy or something.  And then I could hear them in my head, like they were speaking through telepathy, and the other one said something like, ""Leave it alone, we fixed it."" or ""Leave the boy alone, we're done here.""  And the one standing in front of me looked me in the eyes, and pulled away its hand and started to walk away, still scared, I did the flash peak and they were gone, and the light was gone too.    After about 30 seconds of self encouraging, I ran to the sliding door and looked outside, but saw nothing, not even in the sky.  My mom and grandma, were asleep and unaware of anything that happened.  I was so scared of that moment that the idol I basically worshipped, Spider-man, I had my grandma throw everything away that had to do with him, because his eyes reminded me of them.  I threw away my clothes, blankets, pillow cases, figurines, even my tv, and old school gaming system representing him. I hadn't told my grandma why, just that he reminds me of ""them.""   And a couple years later, after I calmed down about it, and I was ready to talk about it, I told them what had happened, but ever since, I have had numerous weird experiences, that follow up aliens and even ghosts.",2014-05-02T00:00:00,,

One night we were on the outskirts of town snooping around an old factory that was fenced in. It was between 2-3am and there was about 6 of us. Before we all jumped the fence (getting into trouble), we sent two people over first to check out the area and make sure there wasn't any one around.  The building is very old and is next to a lot of bush and farmers fields but yet close enough to town.  Security and the cops would check it out once and awhile to make sure it's not being vandalized, so we were always cautious.  Myself and a friend were chosen to take a quick look, so we hopped over and headed for the building.  We stuck close to the walls so we weren't in the open, we walked, talked and goofed around like the usual, but at the same time being very aware of our surrounds and ready for anything.  Coming around the back of the building, suddenly we heard t! he bushes move to the left of us.  My friend and I turned to the left and I swear to God.... a 4-5 foot greyish blackish stalky creature or something was standing there looking at us. It looked at us for 2-3 seconds then we ran the fastest we've ever ran. I was very scared and It all happened so fast, but we both saw it...  It had a head, a body, arms, hands, and was standing straight up.  The head looked like a huge mushroom with eyes on the lower sides, we only got a 2-3 second glimpse before we ran.  When we got back to the guys we were freaking out ALIEN ALIEN but of course everyone laughed there butts off.  Knowing what we saw we started to walk back home through the field when suddenly lights as bright as LED lights started going though the field.  They were very low to the ground and very fast, and you couldn't hear a sound which ruled out a quad or a farmers combine.  We kept low in the grass and hurried our way back into town, never thinking anything of it, except for my ! friend and I. We saw something that night, something not human! nor animal.  I have never spoke of this to anyone besides my parents until now.  Believe this story or not I know what happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

One night while underway onboard an Aircraft Carrier, myself and another sailor were on the 2000 to 0000 Port-Fantail Look Out Watch in the Pacific off the coast of the United States.  I spotted an “Air Contact” and immediately got on Comm’s to report it in.  However, that was proven to be difficult.  I first started to report it as a white light coming from through the fog.  When I attempted to get its elevation, using my hand, it would not stay in one position for no more than a split second and I was only able to provide a target range that it was moving back and forth between. I was reporting it in to the Bridge.  The Bridge could not see it using bino’s, nor was it showing up on radar.  The Bridge and I were stressing the issue, because we had flight op's going on with Jets in the air.  I had already confirmed with the other sailor that he could see it too so that I knew I wasn’t just seeing things.  The Bridge communicated back to me that it was probably just someone on the flight deck shining a flashlight into the fog.  I reported back that it wasn’t shining into the fog and that it was coming from in the fog.  It wasn’t like a light shining towards me either. It was a lighted object. Soon after the encounter started was when I went from reporting it as a light to reporting it in as an object.  I could then see it as an object that was “Camouflaged”, in a way, with the fog.  The fog made it very difficult to get a good shape of it.  The constant darting backwards, forwards, up, and down diagonally made it very difficult as well.  It was almost egg shaped, but distorted.  Everything about it made it to where you could almost get a good description of it, but then lose good sight of it before you could really process it. After about 5-7 minutes or so, I lost contact with the Air Contact.  Myself and the other sailor were weirded-out knowing that we could the Air Contact yet it did not show up on radar or able to be seen by anyone else.  It remained to be an unidentified Air Contact.

I assumed it was a plane, so I didn't stare at it too long.   About 5 or 10 minutes went by, and then I saw my friends coming out from the bar and in front of the car I was in.  I looked up, and the craft was still up in the air, just sitting there.  It wasn't moving at all, and at that moment I realized what its shape was and how close it was.  No noises came from it, even though it was fairly large.   I got out of the car, and walked to where my friends were.  I still didn't hear anything.  It was flashing these bright lights, mostly red.  It was in a big long strip around the hemisphere of the craft, and it seemed like it was a lot of smaller lights making it look like a red strip. Inside the red strip were little bright red dots, so I assume that means those were individual lights.  Sometimes it flashed green on one side, and sometimes blue on the other side.  The red was almost always on.  I think i might have seen another color, but all I can remember is red, green, and blue.  The craft flashed the lights in weird patterns, sometimes it was just still, sometimes the lights flashed.  It was dark out, so they were very bright and intense.  It was hard to see what color the craft was, because of the light, but I think it was metallic.  I know for sure it was shaped like a UFO.  It was a flying saucer, more round than flat.  We were quite close to this craft too, close enough to get a good look at it.   My friends and I watched this craft move and glide around in the air, taking sharp turns in weird directions.  It would stop, then lower itself straight down in a perfect fast motion, then stop.  Then it would rise up, perfectly straight, and stop mid-air.  It went even higher and higher, in the same vertical way, and then it stopped and lowered itself again. Then it would start flying around back and forth, like it was watching something.  It did this for q! uite a w hile, moving around then going up and down fast then slow. I felt like I could see something around it, but I'm not sure what that was.  I might have been seeing something as a result of those lights, but it seemed like the craft was inside of something else.

It was just the one craft.

It consisted of a cluster of round metallic objects making up the top half of the craft, which via a circular midsection joined an elongated four sided pyramid as the bottom half.  All areas of the craft were silver and reflective in nature.  The top half can best be described as if you created a larger sphere out of adjoining smaller spheres.

Typical day.  I was tired and went straight to bed at about 11:00-11:30 pm.  I was in a deep dream state, and can recall my dream for the most part, which is largely unusual for me. I was awoken around 1:00 am June 2 by a series of 3 LOUD knocks coming from somewhere close by, inside the house.  The knocks were loud enough that I woke up with quite a start, and sat straight upright in bed.  Wide awake, my eyes were open and the walls were moving in a wavy sort of way.  I noticed the window sills bending and twisting.  I was a bit weirded out, but figured my eyes were adjusting to having just come directly out of a very vivid dream state.   I looked up at my ceiling fan and it was fading in and out of darkness, like what one might see when you are about to faint when you stand up too fast.  Also I notice my hearing is super super keen.  I can hear the refrigerator humming in the kitchen and other sounds that I think are the house settling.  There is slight banging and knocking sounds and its almost as if I can tell from exactly what direction each noise is coming from in the house, I imagine its like how a bat must hear.  I am also feeling like I am not alone in the house, like something is there.   My small hairs are standing on end at this point.  I'm sitting upright in bed still, my eyes not focusing and feeling like I'm having an acid flashback of some sort, fear is setting in, and after a couple of minutes sitting there, my eyes still aren't adjusting.  I cover one eye with one hand, hoping I will help focus them and do the same with the other eye, nothing changes. I look out the north east window, and see 2 bright stars, swirling and dancing with each other and realize that my vision is quite messed up, I am freaked out and decide I need air.   So I get out of bed, iphone in hand (because I'm more frightened than I have ever been in my life and I might need to call someone) and walk to the west facing windows, which look out over a valley that the village of Jackson is in.  As I am looking out the window, thinking of opening it, I notice the stars in the sky are all perfectly in focus, no swimming or blurring, just perfect wide sky-the two white lights to the northeast that I saw while I was still in my bed- they are still 'dancing' with one another.  Then an orange, steady light comes into view from the south west, about as high as a regular plane would fly, but orange- non blinking.  It travels relatively slowly across the sky- STOPS for about 15 seconds- starts moving again at its original speed in a different direction- STOPS AGAIN- starts moving after a short 5 second pause, then proceeds to fly out of sight beyond the treeline by my house.  As I am watching the orange light move across the sky, I text a friend who lives up the street @ 1:11 am:  ""Look out your window UFOs in Jackson sky!""  Why I didn't film it-I don't know-I was super scared and remember considering doing it, but had the distinct feeling that it might piss someone off or wouldn't be the right thing to do.  I am more scared than ever in my life at this point and decide I need to go out and be with other people.   So I turn to head to the garage and hear sounds in my house.  I am freaked and realize I cant run from this, that going outside might not be a good idea either, so I close my bedroom door, look in the closet for whatever is in the house, and climb into bed- turn on my relaxing music to drown out the sounds in the house, pull the covers over my head and bury myself in pillows and fall asleep. I wake up same as always 4:30 am, feeling calm and rested.  I remember everything clear as a bell.  I walk thru the sun lit house, checking all the doors and closets to make sure no one is in the house.  I go about my day, pondering the night before, my rational mind going over everything, making excuses about what I heard and saw.   By the end of the day, I have everything rationalized, explained logically, EXCEPT the 3 knocks.  So I google it '3 knocks at night' and the first website that pops up,of course, has an alien on the homepage~~~&gt; creepy shivers!   I take a shower before work, look for any strange marks on my body- none.   That's the end of the story I hope.   I don't remember seeing any other worldly beings, I was not hurt in any way- just terrified.",2014-06-13T00:00:00,,

We both thought it was a plane until I realized there was absolutely no noise and it was at a very strange angle for something in the air.  The craft moved back and fourth from left-right a few times.   I don’t remember what happened after that, can't recall if it flew away, disappeared or anything at all really.  I don’t even remember the rest of that day..or the following few days.

Not perfectly round but shaped like a hot air balloon.  Also seemed to have flame at one end like a balloon. It wasn't too high up in the air like a plane but it went over your house from south to north.  It was moving pretty fast.  By the time i went in to get binoculars by back door I couldn't find it but there are a lot of trees in the way. What is it? It's a real object. I think it's a balloon of some sort.  Went overhead about 10:15 tonite.  I don't think it was high enough for a weather balloon.  It was moving fast and straight like it was being controlled and had power of its own. If you find out or have any ideas let me know.  …..MY RESPONSE TO THE E-MAIL….. Thank you sooo much for this.  Finally someone else has seen it.  Since you are right in back of me, it should always be visible to you as well.  No matter what time of the night, if you see it again, PLEASE call me.  Again, thank you.

It moves rapidly across the sky in an easterly direction, it seems to come from south of Mt. Shasta and heads toward Lassen.   Traditional aircraft have also been seen on every occasion, they head up from the south and just as they cross paths, (traditional plane at an obviously lower altitude) the circle craft begins to dim and then totally disappears.

The balls of light seem to appear one after the other and were not all visible initially.   All but one of the orange lights stayed in formation the entire time we watched.  One of the lights rapidly accelerated next to another orange light and remained side by side with the other light until they disappeared.   The orange lights were flying northwest, were evenly spaced approximately 200-300 yards apart and silent.  We watched the lights for approximately five minutes until they made a turn towards southwest and disappeared as they were moving away from our location.  The orange objects did not have any strobes, sound, red or white light. I have worked on numerous military bases, have been an investigator for the state government for more than 13 years, traveled internationally and have flown on private and commercial planes and helicopters.  I have never observed flying objects like we saw on May 31, 2014.  I am 100% certain they were not “Chinese lanterns”, helicopters or planes.   The flying objects had to be controlled by intelligent life due to the exact positioning of the objects, formation and the rapid acceleration of one object next to the other that remained side by side until they disappeared.  I have observed planes and helicopters flying at night and these were definitely neither.  The sky was clear over Frankfort and little to no wind. Before reporting this incident we consulted with two Air Force Officers and they are unaware of any aircraft that are silent or displays orange lights rather than the traditional lights used on aircraft during flight.   I had serious reservations about reporting the incident because I have never believed in UFOs.

I noticed three dark orange spheres out in the distance come into view; they were descending, traveling southward in a fairly straight-line formation toward me from a northwardly direction.  The three spheres were spaced about the same distance apart as they descended toward me.  As they descended they appeared to begin a slow sweeping arch toward a southwest direction.   After about 15 seconds the second (center) sphere appeared to release three small (pin-size) spheres from directly beneath it; all three spheres fell equal distance apart for 3–5 seconds prior to totally, instantly, disappearing. The three dark orange spheres—each appearing to be slightly larger than a pencil eraser—continued their slow, sweeping southwestward descent.  As the three spheres were beginning to level off while continuing to turn (and while they were just barely north of my position) I stepped out onto the deck to get a better view.  The distance between the three spheres appeared to expand. As the sphere in front started to move in a more westward direction and began to gain altitude the middle sphere released three additional small (pin-size) spheres from directly beneath it; all three of these spheres also fell equal distance apart for 3–5 seconds prior to totally, instantly disappearing. The lead sphere began to pull away from the other two as it gained altitude as it traveled in a westward direction; the second (middle) sphere also began to gain attitude as it traveled in a westward direction.  The third (and last) sphere appeared to slow as it gained altitude while also traveling in a westward direction away from Traverse City.  I watched the three spheres until they were completely out of sight…gaining altitude as they continued traveling in a westward direction.

The window was down so it's not dirty glass or a reflection of the Sun.  It's not another jet since there's no jet trail behind it.  And I don't see how a morning star or planet would seem to move such a distance in pictures taken one after the other from virtually the same location.

I was home alone with the exception of my 3 year old daughter. We have been experiencing some strange things around our home/property therefore installed 2 outdoor surveillance cameras a few weeks ago.  One points toward the street in front of our home.   I put my daughter to bed then walked through the kitchen past camera monitor.  Something caught my eye.  I looked at the screen and saw what appeared to be a large white item with no particular shape flowing above the ground in the front yard.   At first I thought it may be a trash bag, until I realized the wind wasn't blowing to that magnitude plus the object wasn't moving around- it was stagnant above the ground in a flowing motion.   There was a ""pole"" or light beam coming from the top of the object- comparable to a flag on a pole upside down.   As I tried to figure out what this was, it proceeded to fly up in the air, go above and over my horse trailer, back down a little and out of sight of the camera.  I sat there, staring for a moment when I saw something else moving around the horse trailer.  It was like a light beam- a thin beam of light yet there was no change in width.  It was the same width as far as I could see it and also ""skipped"" some space in the beam.  Like a pole with occasional dead space.  As I watched this beam move around the hprse trailer- like it was scoping something out- it moved above the trailer and ""did a little dance"" then back down and around the trailer again.  Then, 2 circular bright white lights appear in view of the camera in the sky.   I quickly took out my phone and began to record the monitor screen, not knowing if my husband had set the cameras to record.  The lights in the sky (one just above the other) moved together at first then parted and ""danced"" around and came back together. It hit me I should go outside to see what this was.   Again, we have been privy to strange and unexplainable situations since moving to this home 4 years ago.  I didn't feel threatened but did feel very! anxious I went outside quickly and looked up and around- nothing was there.  I ran back inside and it was all still there on the monitor.  I began to record again for a few moments when I decided to go back out and check again, just to make sure- nothing was there.   I go back inside and check the monitor- the activity stopped and was gone or no longer visible.  I admit to shedding some tears and I'm a pretty strong woman, not one to cry at anything or nothing.  I was overcome with emotion and unsure of what to think or how to feel. My background- I am a credible witness, in my opinion. I am an honest, respected & well-known member of the community.  Contrary to living in MS, I am college educated and have established & operate a non-profit organization that works closely with local law enforcement.  I would not expect anyone that knows me to say that I am weird, on drugs, a fabricator or dramatic. My husband works from home for a respected computer company.   I have video and photos of this occurrence. ((NUFORC Note:  We see no UFO in the two photos sent.  We still await the video.  PD))",2014-04-24T00:00:00,34.8033,-89.9895

It was about 21:00 on Friday evening, April 18th.  The sky was overcast. We were overflown by an aircraft with what appeared to be two white landing lights.  It looked to be flying low, maybe at about 500 to 1000 feet up.  It came roughly out of the north, flying towards the south.  We were in front of the Indian restaurant at the intersection of Wilson Mills Road and Richmond Road in Richmond Heights, Ohio. Cuyahoga County airport is just a couple of miles north of that location between Richmond and Bishop Roads.  So  I just assumed it was a small plane or business jet taking off and gaining some altitude. But two things were unusual for me & my wife.  First it was really clipping along.  It seemed to be going really fast for as low as it was flying.  And secondly, the darn thing was nearly silent. After it was a bit south of us and we lost the two lights in the clouds we thought we heard a low rumble of a jet.  My wife noted:  ""Why do we hear it now and not when it was right over us?""  I live about 3-4 miles southwest of Cuyahoga Country airport and we are overflown by their small business jets.  They make a lot of noise. This thing was just too fast and too quiet to seem right.  I had read about the triangular UFO craft, but we saw no outline of the craft.  And it was just two white lights, not three. I had been a bit curious about the airport. About 4 years ago they put a 33KV, three-phase power feed from the intersection of Bishop & Highland Roads which runs north on Bishop until it is next to the airport grounds, right in front of the Swaglok company buildings.  Then it runs down a power pole and into the ground.  No other customers tie into that power feed along Bishop Road, before it goes underground.  Maybe they have some machinery/technology that needs a lot of power. There is also a company right around the corner from Swaglok on Avion Park Drive that does work on those ""memory metals"" - - - the ones you can deform and then they regain their original shape after being heated with a torch. Might all be coincidence. Maybe there was a weird air layer that reduced the jet noise level.  But I don't think that was the case.  That was one low-flying, fast moving, nearly silent pair of white lights.",2014-04-24T00:00:00,,

Last evening on April 18th, 2014, my 25 year old son from Juneau, Alaska was visiting and we decided to go out in the hot tub and catch a viewing of the ISS at 21:36 Hrs local Pacific Time. The ISS came from the NW on a course towards the SW at about 86* above us.  At about a minute into it, I had looked away and my son, ((son's name deleted)), said he saw a light chasing it and it disappeared.  I never saw it and thought perhaps he was just seeing the reflection from the Space Station since this was his first time. At about 2200 Hrs, I was looking to the south at about 50* center in front of me facing the south and I had saw a satellite.  Make note:  Between 21:36 and 2200 Hrs. we had seen at least 10 plus satellites that seemed to be going north to South and South to North passing the Big Dipper.  Can’t remember a time when there were so many in the sky in a short time. This satellite I saw in the south was going from SNW to SSE and then I saw what appeared to be another satellite about 3 fingers right behind it.  However, these two were going a little bit faster than the normal satellites.   I got my son to look and he locked onto them an then it appeared these were lights and the #2 was following in pursuit of the other #1 light.  Just as the #2 increased speed and a little distance the #1 light increased speed and disappeared as the #2 light disappeared. I have seen lights do weird stuff, but to see these two lights in the sky that were not lanterns and looked like stars or satellites move through the sky like they did and vanish was an incredible rush to share with my son at my age of 51.

UPDATED REPORT AS REQUESTED. . . . . . . . . Again, until the 911 operator called me back, I didn’t even know a National UFO Reporting Center even existed. You requested to place our fingers where we first saw what was flying over to where they had climbed out of sight and blinked out.  We used a degree finder to be as close to  how much of an angle we were watching.  The degree finder gave us a value of 197° until each of them went straight up, so high as to we couldn’t see then anymore and basically they blinked out.  Again I am NOT sure as to exactly what my wife and I were watching.  She definitely did NOT get worked up as much as I did, because again I wasn’t sure what exactly it was we were watching. OK, I do have an update as to the direction they were traveling.  You asked what direction the travel was.  As by compass the (Crafts) or whatever, they were came from the Southeast and was traveling I the direction of the Northwest.  I know you said you had sightings of the same things just South of Seattle Washington, but somewhere the (crafts) must of changed direction of travel.  Again, this started at 21:01 hours and this lasted about a total of 29 minutes. Contacting the National Weather Service about wind speed at our level, which there was NO wind on the ground but you want wind speed at 3000’ and 6000’.  The closest we can come with since all we can seem to get are recorded messages, but the wind speed at about 3000’ was North West at about 10mph.  At 6000’ they weren’t very clear but again North West at between 15 and 20mph.  You also requested to contact the F.A.A., that was a total joke especially in this area, all we could get were recorded messages, NO matter what department we pushed the buttons on the phone to get to.  All  we could get were recorded messages then when finished, there were NO areas to leave a message it just simply just hangs up.  To be honest, right now I am almost sorry I reported what my wife and I were watching and probably will NOT do so in the future. We are trying very hard to do the right thing and make the calls you requested we make and all we seem to get is stonewalled.  I really don’t need this.  Right now we have about five (5) hours trying to report what we were watching.  Again like I explained, I did contact our newspaper office, again to get a recording.  And in the past 5 and ½ hours they have refused to return the telephone call, I know because of what it was.  OK, I am going to try to get six (6) radio stations involved and two (2) two Television Stations, and hopefully again we will NOT get stonewalled again.  Up here I already have over 20 people looking down their noses at us.  This is really making the both of feel like fools.  Again, you are right, I cannot possibly tell you the exact speed and height of the (crafts) we were watching.  I have a very close guess since we do have an airport very close to us and watch jet aircraft all the time and 1 and 2 times the speed of sound.  Normally, anytime this happens there is a very large sonic boom.  These (crafts) last night were totally and I mean totally silent. You asked about the size of the (crafts) against a possible full moon, We both can tell you our guess they were at least 10,000’ feet up but they were large enough even at that height these (crafts) were would completely cover a full moon plus some.  And according what I could see against a very clear sky,  Above the very bright RED and Yellow lighting, the (crafts) appeared to be a saucer shape.  Again, the sky was clear as a bell. We hope this answers some of the questions you had, especially since we are getting stonewalled where ever we have called, now we are getting laughed at by the media also.  I do know in Chico right now there were several more people I personally know witnessed the very exact same thing.  I have tried very hard to get them to come forward with you and submit a report also.  This is with NO avail, they are all too afraid of being laughed at.  Personally, I don’t give a d**** what other people think, this is what my wife and I were watching, and other that being stonewalled with the National Weather Service, the F.A.A. and the news media I just simply want you to know what we were seeing.

Around 2:30 AM I went outside for a cigarette and noticed a round shape orb that was quickly moving in different directions in the sky, way too fast to be an aircraft; so I ran in the house and grab my binoculars ... it sometimes hovered like a bee and then moved in an extremely fast motion....  After watching it for approximately 15 minutes I woke my girlfriend and asked her to see it as well.  So off the second floor balcony we watched it for approximately 45 minutes more.   While I watched it with the binoculars (looking northwest), I saw at times it moved vertically, horizontally and even in a circular motion at times, but for the most part it would stay in a fixed position for approximately 5 minutes and then move sporadically in all different directions until it fixed itself onto its next spot.   The object had a red & green lights and at times appeared to have white electrical bolts of circular lightning on the surface of the orb.  The red light seemed to rotate in a circular position sometimes skipping one of the circular quadrants.   We watch the orbs in the sky and then I noticed a few more of the same types of objects that had the same characteristics but were higher in altitude.   The sky became darker as the time progressed but the initial orb was always in the clear area of the sky.  I then went on my computer to see a satellite image of what was located northwest from my vantage point and found a huge number windmills off a network of roads, kind of like grapes on a vine... covering multiple ridge-tops.   What spooks me out is that the orb distance and angle of movement leads me to believe they were sucking the power out of the windmills.  With or without the binoculars one could see the orbs move and defy any normal kind of aircraft movement.  In the binoculars it was obvious how fast they changed direction vertically, horizontally and also in circular movement.  We took turns looking at the orb and when I was waiting my tu! rn to get the binoculars back I noticed several more orbs of light... I counted a total of four similar red & green lit orbs....  WOW what a night, I would have never believed it until I experienced for myself!  Like I said I'm an architect and have a great deal of precision in drawing lines and angles...my conclusion is that they were hovering over a field of windmills like bees hovering over flowers.

Military chopper pursues a UFO over central Massachusetts.,Northborough,MA,2014-08-14T21:50:00,unknown,45 seconds,"Occurred : 8/14/2014 21:50  (Entered as : 08/14/2014 21:50) Reported: 8/14/2014 8:20:25 PM 20:20 Posted: 8/15/2014 Location: Northborough, MA Shape: Unknown Duration:45 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/112/S112470.html,"Military Chopper pursues a UFO over central Massachusetts. First, at 9:30pm, a relatively slow moving, large and conspicuous (military?) helicopter flew from southeast to northwest under a moonless, starry sky about 50 knots - half the speed of a typical  ""life flight"" chopper or news chopper.  It had a signature deep sound to its rotors like a heavy military war helo.  I didn't pay much attention to it other than noticing its slow speed of travel and bright ""red/green"" FAA signal lights for civilian airspace.  I assumed it was just a nighttime training mission… It should be noted that this is not heavily traveled airspace by helicopter air traffic -- only rarely do we see any helicopter at all.  Typically, it's only passenger jets descending into Logan airport at 15,000', and the occasional weekender in a Cessna. What struck me as odd was hearing the exact same chopper (that signature, deep military sound like a Blackhawk, plus the same signal lights on a black chopper, indicating port/starboard) 20 minutes later coming back from the direction it had traveled initially (this time NW to SE), and on the same vector path and altitude (about 500 feet) and speed...  So... I stepped out from my porch and looked up. That is when I noticed it was ""chasing"" (more like ""escorting"") what was first one dim light and then which became two lights, lights which were a bluish color, but obvious and present.. also conspicuous but considerably less bright (exactly similar to the magnitude of a low-orbit satellite in a dark night sky...  Actually I'd say ""identical."" The lights were not associated with a visible craft (unless the craft was tiny -- like softball sized?) but they were surely too far ahead of the chopper to be an extension of the chopper:  The lights were travelling about 50ft from each other -- one slightly ahead of the other -- together, at about 1/8 to a 1/4 of a mile ahead of the chopper, travelling at the same speed and vector and altitude as the helo. From my experience, the objects were going too fast to be civilian drones, and were ""silent"" under the sound of the chopper.  They seemed to glide effortlessly ahead of the helicopter as if free from our Earthly propulsion systems. If it was alien craft, you'd think the military would use jets to pursue...unless they were testing a drone system and needed a chopper to pursue because it flies too slow for a jet to follow.  Either way, it felt ""planned,"" but then again in civilian airspace, even the drone would need proper FAA green/red port and starboard indicators.  They did not.  Something was very wrong. I will say the whole episode felt very ""off,"" and is absolutely venture to say, ""paranormal.""  This is a heavily populated suburb, though somewhat rural so stars are bright.  They chose a moonless night to transport or escort *something.*  I believe they were low and slow to glide below the ubiquitous radar.

On the evening of July 31st,  2014, at approximately 10:30pm, I was driving on route 15 north of Woodside, Delaware, midway between Woodside and Camden, Delaware.  It was a clear starlit night.   All of a sudden I saw an intense strobing light, emerald green/bluish in color.  The frequency of the strobe was once every couple of seconds.  The strangest thing to me about this sighting is that at no point could I see an object, nor was there any sound associated with it.  It was as if there was a haze surrounding the area where the light emanated from  and it was as if the light came from nothing but open air.    When I initially saw the strobing light, it was directly in front of me.  The distance was difficult to determine but my estimate was possibly less than a half mile and probably less than 1000 feet high.  The flashing light was so bright that I couldn’t  see the object itself, but it traveled at an incredible distance in an instant and changed direction several times.  It was almost as if it was following me.  I stopped my vehicle to watch the object.  As I sat on the side of the road  the object came back toward my direction and slowly descended below the tree line into the field.  At this point the light stayed lit so it was visible to me as it descended.  Even though the light was visible no object could be seen, just the intense and now steady bright light.   Once again the distance was difficult to determine because of darkness but it appeared to be less than a half mile away based on the distance of the trees that I could see.   The light ceased to flash after approximately thirty seconds or so.   I called my grandson who was at my house at the time of the incident and told him what was happening as it happened and stayed on the phone with him during the entire incident.  Much to my dismay I am not proficient with the use of my cell phone camera and was unable to capture any of this sighting.   The entire incident lasted approximately 5 minutes.  I had to ask myself, “What did I just see?   Did I really see what I was seeing?  What did I see?  How do I tell someone that I just saw something but there was nothing there, just a light coming out of nowhere that moved across the sky at incredible speed.  If I tell anyone of this, they’ll never believe me”.  I called 911 when I got home just a few minutes later to report it in case anyone else witnessed it.  I also called the Dover AFB air traffic control tower at the air base and left a message about the incident but they never responded or replied to my call.   There were very few cars on the road in this country area.  The 911 dispatcher whom I spoke with gave me the number to the National UFO Reporting Center.  They instructed me to immediately write the events of the incident down and file a report while it was fresh in my head, which I did.

I posted this vid on youtube tonight, I'll describe it here (not monetizing it at youtube, nor anywhere, I am an enthusiast of ufology, I've heard of you, I respect you.  And I am not drunk.  Yay!)  I just looked up the properties of the short vid, that's the time and date it gave me.  I thought it was November, apparently, twas October 2012.   I walked out my back door, I have a large yard with a woods edge at the rear, deer come each day, I think I was testing the zoom and focus.  Canon powershot 12 mega pix, not an expensive cam, the original on this computer is more striking that what appears in the youtube upload, don't know why.   Walked out the door, saw nothing, focused on rear clearing, stopped film.  When uploaded, saw this thing.  Looks like 2 birds mating, or 2 bees doing something.  But it is about 2 or 3 feet wide, gray top, lighter rear half, strange motion.   I had opened a glass screen door, thought maybe it was a refraction.  Have glass windows on the left as I walk out, but I don't see a connection to my movement and the movement of this thing.   I tell ya, when I re-looked at it the other day on this machine, I said, ""Oh My God.""   My Hungarian GF was here, I showed it without comment twice.  She works in the garden over which it was, and she asked me, ""Do they live here?""   Very strange, a bit disturbing.

I have been living in Chico since 1977.  In 1987 I was laying in a field of grass and looking up at the sky and it was evening about 11pm.  I noticed a small light moving among the stars.  The light moved in every direction impossibly.  It moved in circles and up and down and side-ways and it made no sound. It looked like a star or satellite but like I said it moved im-possibly. It did not move across the entire sky as it only covered a little space in the sky.  It continued for a few minutes and then dissipated. It was soon out of my vi-sion.  This has happened 10 times in my life the recent being In February this year 2014 seeing 6 lights within a two week period and one night seeing 2.  It always happened at nightmore frequently around 7pm. I was in upper Bidwell park. 1 light was more orange than the usual yellow/white star looking light.  There was never any sound.  Some moved irratically and dissipated quickly while others moved straight and very fast and dissipated (at least 1000mph based on time and distance travelled) or turned slightly and dissipated. It felt as if when I noticed them is when they dissapeared.  There is an airport near where I have seen most of these lights.  I have been walking at night in the park for years and am very aware of all of the different air traffic including satellites.  No other craft like airplanes or other lights followed the lights.  1 time one of the lights turned from white to orange as it dissipated,2014-05-02T00:00:00,39.77638902439024,-121.82759634146342

Then another.  Looking back at Orb#1, it was now closer...maybe .5mi away.  These orange orbs were solid in nature, no blinking, flashing, or dimming.  At any one time...my son and I saw 4 lights all in a row...stringing from left to right...with the left light being the closest and the far right being the farthest away.  It was already sundown, as this occurred just after dusk.  Now the wierd part.  All 4 of these orbs were moving slowly and smoothly, then the first orb light faded out...then orb #5 appeared.   Then orb #2 faded out and #6 orb appeared, and so on.  Until all 8 orbs eventually appeared and faded just before hitting the town limits.  These orbs did NOT change direction ever, so it's not like the 1st orb turned, and that's why I couldn't see the light.  Again, at any one time, we saw 4 or 5 of the orbs...all bright orange.   We walked out front and watched....it was dead silent....no sound at all. We should have heard sound from that distance. All orbs flew at the same altitude....I would say at about 750ft up.

April 4th, 2014, I was about to return to work after lunch break was over.  I was walking in the door and glanced up in the sky to try and see if it looked like it was going to rain, a Black orb/oval shaped object caught my attention.  The object was flying across the sky horizontally towards the downtown area, the rate in which it was moving looked faster than any fighter jets that i have seen flying. The back object was moving rather fast, however there was no sound or flashing lights like airplanes, jets or helicopters have.  As the object was moving towards the direction of the downtown area (10-15 miles from my workplace), it appeared to rotate mid-air resulting in looking more narrow and smaller than it did when i first noticed.  After a couple seconds in this narrow appearance it rotated again and was back to the first observed shape. From the moment I initially saw the object until it was out of view lasted about 15-20 seconds. There were clouds covering the sky, and I am no expert of the distance of things, but it was well below the cloud line.  My guess is this object had to be between 1,000 feet - 2,000 feet in the air. I rushed inside work to tell my co-workers what I had seen only to get laughed at.  Within a minute of entering the building, my co-workers & myself heard what sounded like 2 fighter jets flying overhead & the sound of the jets was going in the same direction as the object.

I am an avid star gazer and to my astonishment there was an inordinately bright set of flashing lights in an area of the night sky where no star or planet should be.   This in itself may not seem that strange as aircraft fly over this area very frequently, however this did not act like any aircraft I have ever seen.  For starters the object was silent and remained in the same place while a series of multi-colored lights flashed it what appeared to be a pattern.  The lights themselves would flash off and on in a series of revolutions around a singular red beam, the white lights would flash in a circular motion around the constant red light.   The object just remained in place until about 1:20am, it was at that time another object, most likely a plane judging by its sound and speed had moved relatively close to the object in question.   It was here when things got even crazier. The object projected a huge orb of light around it and it flashed as bright as the sun and vanished.  The other object flying towards it made a quick turn to the south and continued flying a normal course as if it were heading towards Dullus International.   I will continue to search that area of sky again tonight to see if the object returns, but the shear speed at which the object darted off last night made it clear to me this object was not something one normally sees when gazing up in the night sky.   The only other thing I would like to add was that it was a perfectly clear night and thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me I went and got my glasses and an HD set of binoculars and can easily draw and explain what exactly it was that I saw in the western sky outside of Sykesville, MD, last night.

My home is off-grid in an area known as Witch Wells where my closest neighbor is several miles away and the nearest town is about 30 miles away, other than that it is thousands of square miles of high desert with next to no light pollution at night.  I have seen a number of UFOs in my life and spent 10 years in the military, so I have seen just about every kind of aircraft there is. On the 5th of June this year I went outside in the front of my house with my dog to have a cigarette.  It was about 20:20 in the evening and the moon was about half full.  At this time there were no planes or any aircraft of any kind in the sky which is rare here because I see aircraft of all kinds including military everyday.  I was facing towards the southern horizon and was just star gazing.  I tilted my head looking almost straight up but still more towards a direction of South-South-East.  I was observing what I thought was a cluster of stars until one of the ""stars"" began moving at a very fast rate of speed and heading towards the southern horizon.  The object looked exactly like a star, same size, same shape and same brightness.  However it was moving and after a few minutes as it continued at the same speed it slowly faded out until it had disappeared. Now I have seen satellites a number of times before and even the International Space Station once but this was neither.  It was not long after that in the same small area of the night sky which I had seen the first a second began to move in the same exact way as the first. It was moving in the same direction and again looked exactly like a star and was moving in what appeared to be the same speed.   I began to question myself and began looking around for planes but there were none for comparison and these two ""stars"" made no sound.  The second object then at the same rate of speed faded until it was gone as the first had done.  Both act exactly in the same way.   Then I got lucky and did see a meteor seconds later which gave me a good reference.  The shooting star had a tail and was gone in a millisecond so that ruled out that possibility.  Then planes flying at high altitude began to fly by making the sounds of jet engines and I could clearly see there navigation lights blinking so that was ruled out. Over the course of the next hour I witnessed 10 of these same exact objects that all behaved the same way, looked the same, traveling at the same speed and fading until they disappeared the same way.  The only thing that happened with the 10 objects that was not consistent was that the eighth one moved due North and the tenth one moved due East the all the others moved due South.   They all had been stationary and looked exactly like stars. I really thought I was looking at a small cluster of stars but after an hour that cluster was gone.   Now I do not believe these could have been satellites in Low Earth Orbit or even High Earth Orbit because of the way they behaved.  If it is possible that these objects were in High Earth Orbit and were perhaps part of some secret government space project I can only estimate they were traveling anywhere between 40,000 and 60,000 miles per hour and were being operated by someone or something. That of course is only a theory. I do wish I had other witnesses but I live only with my dog.  My dog, ((name deleted)), did act a bit peculiar during this event but I think she was only reacting based on how I was reacting.   After this amazing experience I went inside and looked on all major astronomical websites to see if there had been any reported meteor showers that could be seen in Northwest Arizona and I found nothing.  I again wanted to just make sure it was not some natural event.   Yesterday and today I looked on all major UFO reporting websites and found no such reports that saw what I saw.   I thought the Ghost ship witnessed by myself, a crewman and an entire flight crew on a U.S. Coast Guard HH-60 Jayhawk in the Willipa Bay, Washington, was strange enough when I was stationed at Cape Disappointment.

While speaking with the DPD dispatch, and having had my phone speaker on from the beginning, she could hear myself and all other witnesses excitedly speaking about first one more, then another, only this one was sort of beneath the one on the top, but they were in sync with each other.

For the next 10 to 12 minutes all six of us witnessed in awe at a beautiful event, ultimately involving not less than six vehicles.   They were all the same in physical appearances.  They moved horizontal and rather slow, by other accounts of vehicles.  They were steady.  They were red but not fiery red.  All of them were like this.  They were definitely well into the sky.  When, from our view point, they all reached what seemed to be the same juncture, this huge white light appeared in the front of each craft.  Then it went out and more white lights appeared, only seemingly from within the red tail.   We noticed that a plane was near-by, prompting one child to remark that it was going to collide with this “thing!”  And it sure did look like this was likely from down on the ground, but nothing happened.  Shortly thereafter, another earthly vehicle went by, both vehicles heading northward, opposite the direction of the UFO’S. 	Since we’re all were able to see the earthly vehicles, it made since to me that the UFO’s had to have been relatively close, and the passing of the earthly vehicles provided me with the only reliable means of discerning how far away and how far up they were (as there was no horizon, no sky line … just sky!",2014-06-13T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

I have no history of mental illness, do not drink alcohol nor do I used controlled substances.  The following events concluded at 2243 hours on the same evening. The first light showed up at 2132 and appeared to be a meteor entering the atmosphere from the eastern shy from Rapid City, SD.  Initially, the light streak seemed to grow into a blue and white ball of light.  The altitude of the light was no more than a 1000 feet and probably about 500 feet.  It traveled due west at an impressive speed.  Then, as it passed over head while I rapidly crossed the car park, with my eyes trained on the light, as to have a longer look, there was a loud pop that echoed off of the adjacent building.  The light speed out of sight as I realized I could use my NOAA application to try to view the path on radar. Using NOAA double Doppler, reflectivity loop, I tract the object as it passed over Idaho and into Oregon.  At which point it fall below the radar's minimum ceiling making the landing within 20 miles of John Day, OR. Within a minute of the meteor disappearing of or the radar another member of our bar-b-que party proclaimed, ""What the hell is that?!""  All seven of us came to him as he pointed into the sky, saying, ""That's a ball of light!""  I immediately retrieved my binoculars from my vehicle.  Spotting the light with assistance, I observed the light traveling over Rapid City to the ENE in a weaving pattern.  The altitude of this light was about 50,000 feet. When this light vacated my binocular's ability to view, several jets were spotted in the SE sky over Rapid City by another member of our group.  As I trained my binoculars on the jet I could see that it was a group of five F-14 fighter jets.  Only the lead jet had its lights on.  I told the others, ""get your binoculars if you have them.""  Another member of our group did retrieve his binoculars in time to see the rapidly moving jets as they traversed the sky and out of our sight  As the evening passed we noticed two other similar weaving light.  All three appeared to be only large balls of light.  No wings, no tails or noses were seen on the balls of light by the three of us with binoculars.  That is in contract to the fighter jets that has clearly distinguishable noses, wings and tails to the point that two of us believed them to be F-14s. At 2038 hrs., the last lights were seen.  These lights were significantly different from the others in that they were groups of dim lights within the boundaries of slightly brighter lights.  There were three triangular, formations of brighter lights that traveled slowly from south to north.  Within the peripheral boundaries of each triangular pattern were 18 less blight balls of light that seemed to travel freely within the triangular, more brightly lit spheres' boundaries. Suddenly, as unexpectedly as they appeared, they disappeared, as if a cloak had been engaged.  There were no more lights as our party peered into the night's shy well into the morning.

Its size would be estimated to a large commercial plane, which typically approach from the East.  It was approaching the airport at the angle helicopters and prop planes approach.

There was no wind to cause a commercial plane to perform a crosswind landing (nor have ever seen a commercial plane with that many red lights and no green or white). It was flying very low.

Shortly before disappearing out of sight, another came over at the same speed but larger or at a lower altitude.  It cruised over in the same direction and eventually disappeared as well.  All objects were riddish orange amd had no flashing lights or trails.  We also noticed no noise coming from the lights.

I mean, I'm only telling exactly what I saw.  I'm just not sure exactly what they were.  Both sightings were weird in their own ways.  The first ones were traveling in somewhat straight lines but if you looked hard, you could see them almost zig zag.  Looking like a short wave medium frequency if it had left a trail.  If that makes sense.  The second night was really strange cuz the first sighting was still sorta fresh in our minds.  It was only two of us the second time tho.  Same colors, no zig zag, similar shape, much lower alt.  The second time you could really see that they were like small glowing  boomerangs...  Haha.  I hate explaining it like that cuz it sounds crazy.   I watch all the ufo documentaries and I sound like those folks now.   I'm just looking for an explanation I guess.  I've always been in the middle when it comes to this stuff.  Because I know people lie, exaggerate, halucinate...  But after I saw the lights holding a formation and then the forth one come over even lower, we were just playing it off like they were low level meteors or something....  flying in formation.... yeah.  Meteors fly in formation right?  Haha.  Anyway, I'm not making it up, and I have no reason to pull some hoax.  I'll even be anonymous if I have to.   Thank you for your time and any info you can send.  I can better narrow down the time as well if that helps.  Thank you again.   ((END ADDENDUM))",2014-06-20T00:00:00,42.8955,-78.7071

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It's difficult to be specific with just one sentence to write. Last night as I was going to bed I notice flashes of light outside.  It looked light lightning lighting up the sky but there was no thunder that followed.  It did rain within the next 30 minutes so I've dismissed it since as being heat lightning since that's what it looked like. I have a raised berm in my backyard which is lined with trees and evergreens, with a solid wooden fence behind it so my yard is very dark at night.  I saw a solid white light that could be mistaken for a flashlight but I would say it was larger than that.  If you put your hands together and make a circle with your thumbs and fingers touching, that is about the size it appeared to be.  At first I thought someone may have been walking around my yard - My husband and I were just commenting about the neighbors installing a fence and now so there is no way to get into our yard except from the front of the house or through a neighbors yard so it's pretty private now.  So I thought it was a flashlight, but it didn't move like someone was walking with it.  It would appear and disappear, and then reappear many feet away.  I thought it was strange but maybe still explainable.  But then the light would appear at the top of the trees.  That is 25+ feet in the air so it couldn't be a person holding a flashlight.  And it wasn't like a flashlight was throwing light from place to place, because it was a very bright white light, like it was the source of the light and not from a beam of light.  I watched for at least 5 minutes seeing the light appear and disappear throughout the treeline in my yard - for example it would appear close to the ground on the left and would shine for a few seconds, then the light would disappear and then 10 seconds later would appear to the right near the top of the trees 20 feet away. After about 5 minutes or so I saw a light light up the right side of my yard - like someone drove up my driveway and the headlights were shining light into my yard.  I didn't hear anything though.  It was a steady light and then eventually disappeared.  Sometimes police will drive through the neighborhood, but the headlights wouldn't have been shining in my yard (FYI, my room faces the back of the house and I couldn't see the driveway). Maybe it was police?  Maybe something was going on and they were looking for someone/something?  I live in a pretty boring area and not much happens here at night though.  I can try explaining away everything, but not the bright round white lights that kept appearing and disappearing and appearing again in a new location. Let me know if you would like any additional information. Regards, ((name  ((END ADDENDUM))",2014-06-20T00:00:00,40.32416086956521,-75.12223043478261

Report of UFO Sighting in Newcastle Ontario Canada on July 2014 at 9:30 P.M. 	I was driving southbound in the Port of Newcastle approximately ½ km from the shoreline of Lake Ontario.  Southwest of my position and over the water of Lake Ontario, I witnessed a group of seven slow moving aircraft.   I guessed their speed to be comparable to that of ultralight aircraft.  I judged them to be at a distance of less than five miles and approximately two thousand feet in the air.  Their shape was not immediately discernable.   Six of them were spaced evenly at approximately two hundred feet apart horizontally, with uneven variances in elevation of possibly 100 feet.  The seventh was flying alone at a similar altitude but following the formation at a distance of roughly 1 km.  They were distinguishable at this time only by a crisp, bright circular orange light representing each craft.   As they moved slowly through the sky, I judged them to be flying in a South to Northwest direction.  As they traversed an angle of approximately 70 degrees from my position, I saw the orange light flicker and disappear from each craft beginning with the lead vehicle.  At this time I speculated that this was because the light was projecting forward from each vehicle, and as the vehicles passed by, the source of light was not visible from my angle of observation.  Because the western sky was still relatively bright at this time of night, I was able to discern the shape of each vehicle in silhouette.  All of them appeared to be perfectly round in shape.   No sound was discernable from any of the craft at any time.   Local trees began to obscure my view.   Total observation time was less than two minutes.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,,

The weather conditions were clear at this time.    I was standing on the front porch of my house, which faces to the North.  I happened to look to the west and I saw a bright red light traveling at a slow rate of speed in a downward trajectory, almost as if it were coming straight at me.  Then it seemed to level off and made very subtle movements left to right, almost unnoticeable. The object continued to travel in a easterly direction and no longer towards me.  The brightness of the light never gained or lost brightness as one would expect of an airplane traveling in the night sky.  Also there was no sound coming from this object that was traveling at an altitude that normal aircraft would fly at.  I can not say how high up in the sky it was, as it was night and my ability to judge distance is not as good as it would be during the day.  But if I had to guess, I would say that it was at a height of maybe 5,000 to 7,000 feet, but that is only a guess. As this object was now traveling in and easterly direction it started to make a slow arc to the South East, and began to travel over my house.  I watched the object and I noticed that the color and brightness of the light did not dim or change one bit as it passed over my location, as one would expect with a normal aircraft.  I continued to watch the object and after it passed over my house it traveled for a bit more then seemed to stop and not move one bit. I ran into the house at this time and tried to find something that I could take a picture with, realizing that I did not have time to do this I went back outside.  The time I was in the house was maybe less the 30 seconds.  The object was no where to be seen. I have good visibility around my house so I would have been able to see it traveling had it started to move again.  The rate of speed that it had been traveling had been slow as if it were a helicopter, not fast at all.  I looked and looked all around bout could not find it again.

I had walked out on the back porch and was watching this thing move very rapidly through the sky.   I called my wife out to see if she could recognize what this thing was.  It was moving very fast.  There was NO way these were military flares because they were so bright but not only moving toward the North but were also rapidly moving upward until it blanked out of sight.  I would guess this object was between 10,000 and 15,000 feet up. We thought the sight was over until about 15 seconds later a second one appeared and looked as if it was going a little faster but lower, then five to 8 seconds later a third appeared, then a fourth.  We tentatively watched these things wondering what they were.  I did call 911 and operator took the report and was teasing a little like we were seeing things until the 911 center started to light up.  I hung up with 911 and continued watching with my wife when in about 5 minutes went by and 911 called me back and gave me the number for the National UFO Reporting Center.  I didn’t know this even existed. We continued watching these “things” go by.  We moved out into our parking lot where we could see with a completely unobstructed view.  I a total of 15 minutes went by after 911 called back, my wife and I witnessed a total of (9) nine of these very strange and very fast moving craft.  I would guess these things (crafts) or what ever they were, was moving Northward at what I am guessing to be about between 4 to 5 times the speed of sound.   Not even a sound was heard but as they were going by so fast, again heading Northward but also climbing upward rapidly until they completely blinked out of sight.  Yes, I will be very honest with you, I would really like to know what they were.  	(Very Curious.)  I felt strange reporting what I saw because I know the operator thought at first I was some kind of a nut.  Then she said the 911 lines were all lighting up.  They, (these strange crafts) appeared to have 5 maybe 6 very, very bright red lights with a very bright yellow one in the center.  I have NEVER seen any military craft be able to move that fast and have that bright of lights under them.  There was NO aircraft strobe lights and way, way too bright to be aircraft marker lights.

What happened to me that night was definitely different from any typical ufo sighting I had ever heard of and it was almost unexplainable.   I hoped for another day where it would come again while I was not alone so I wouldn't feel so crazy when explaining a huge flying flame right over my head with black gases rolling around in it to people. lol  I honestly keep it a little hush because it is so bizarre. Well tonight, at about 10:20 pm almost exactly a year later, finally, I saw it again and it was moving through the same exact area as I saw it last time, my sisters yard.  It was not nearly as close to me as the last one was, therefor it wasn't as large, but the plus side to tonights odd fireball sighting was that my sister and my niece both saw the flying orange flame right along side of me.  My skeptical side thought Chinese lantern at first due to its size BUT I quickly changed my mind.   We watched it travel through the yard at about the height of the tree line, moving west in a straight line, not up, not down, but mostly straight, much faster than the one I saw last year, it continued a good straight distance then up a little higher to avoid some trees then straight again until it appeared to stop about a mile or two away where it hovered and began slowly changing colors from orange to red to green to a silver/white color while just hovering.  Seemed to be a little above the! tree line at this point and way below the skyline.  It remained in that same exact spot for at least 30 minutes.  After running to the front and watching it from our street for forever. We got in the car to drive to it and at one point had it in our sight directly in front of our vehicle about half a mile up a country road.  As we drove straight towards it we came down a hill and when we got to the top, a second or two later, it was no longer in front of us.. just gone.  Looked to the right of us, eastwardly, and there it was back in the direction of our house again where we had just left from about another two miles away.  Almost as if to avoid us.  How did it get from in front of our car to 2 miles away in another direction in a matter of 2 seconds? Again, I am so baffled. We all are! And Last year, even though my sister and niece experienced the huge white streak across the sky about 20 minutes after my first fireball sighting, I am so very glad that someone else finally saw t! he orange flame object that I saw last year! I just wish it wa! s closer like it was last year. Don't get me wrong... It was still very close but not nearly as close as it came to me last year. BUT This time my video worked :) and I have a lot of pictures. Im thinking it was so close to me last time that it interfered with my cell and it also knocked our cable out. This time, there was a little distance so my phone did not fail! But the same exact thing happened where it appears much much smaller in video and pictures than what we visually saw. Also the shape changes in the video and pictures than what we visually witnessed as well. Its so bizarre and I feel like a crazy person when I try to explain it lol A couple pics and the video showed two and three fireballs but we could only see one with our eyes. The shape and movement and all around appearance of what we visually saw is totally different than how it shows up in pics and videos. Its a blatant flame like object when you look at it but in the video and pics it shows up as an orange boomara! ng shaped object and sometimes orb like and even shows up as more than one object in some of the pics and video but visually we could only see one. It is so bizarre but almost identical to my experience last year. The object was way to close to be a meteor or plane.. It was right at the tree line. It most definitely was not a lantern. It traveled straight not up with no wind and too fast. When the video i have is played in slo motion the object is totally different than what we could visually see with our eyes. Matter of fact it wasn't even moving in a straight line on the slowed video but visually, with our own eyes it was traveling straight. The video shows erratic movements sometimes appears to be spinning and jolting up and down side to side but it must have been doing this so fast that we saw something different thru human eyes. When it left and hovered a mile or so away it changed to different colors. This is the 2nd time in the same spot that I have seen this and I a! m intrigued and baffled.

The third object came  approx. 20 seconds later with the same flight path as the first one.  And  again where the first one turned, this one did as well at the same altitude.  This time having the binoculars I started to look for it.   As it turned away, I saw it, either it was oval  or round  being in a banking turn and out the back end of it where several maybe 6-8 equally spaced bright solid yellowish lights where the back end of it would be.  I had a good eyeball on it as it turned, then all of a sudden those lights I was looking at out the back of it went dark, yet I was still panning on a dark object in the sky afterwards for a few seconds more.",2014-04-24T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

Past three years have seen many things in the skies.  Yet nothing I feel confident enough to say is a ufo.  Until the morning of July 2, 2014, approximately at 3:14 am. What I saw is something I have never seen before.  It was so amazing it sent chills down my spine.  As real and dramatic as my experience was to me.  I was hesitant to make a report.  I changed my mind because when I arrived at home and turned on the news like every other day.  One of the first segments was a segment on ufo sightings.  Followed by a segment about the rocket luanch the night before.  I felt that the local news was trying to discredit what was clearly a dramatic sighting.  That meant I was not the only one to see it.  I wanted to go ahead and report my sighting and hopefully find out if there are more reports in my area. At 3:14 a.m., I noticed a bright red Orange ball of light coming in to visibility.  Much like an approaching plane that is going to soon land.  Then it came to complete stop.

Not a vessel. I was in my friend’s neighborhood last night around 12:45am (00:45).  He lives in a neighborhood with duplexes, and a public pool.  We were sitting in the pool deck area on pool chairs talking about politics, life, obscure theories, etc.  He was facing me, and just over his shoulder up in the sky, a small glowing disc quickly flew by.  I’ve never had a ufo experience before, and I don’t read up on them much, so I’ll use my limited knowledge to make a description:   This didn’t look like your typical Hollywood UFO.  It was a very small disk in the sky.  At first, I immediately thought it might have been a shooting star, but it was too large, and not out in space.  I’ve seen shooting stars before and they are quick and faint, this was prominent, a little slower, and close. I want to say it was less than 100ft off the ground, it seemed like it just went over the tree tops. What made me confused is that it was VERY small.  Up in the sky it was relative to the size of a Frisbee, and when I described it to my friend, I said it looked like half of the size of the moon in the sky.  So based on its altitude, I’d say it was probly 1/3 the size of a family sedan in reality (it could probably fit in the trunk of a car)   Physical Appearance:  It was FLAT.  It wasn’t a large machine, flying craft, plane, or anything. It was like a flat disk with a faint ball of light in the middle, and then a bright ring surrounding the ball. The space between the ball and the ring were EMPTY.  It was just a ring of light circling a ball of light. Another note:  There was NO noise.  There were no engine sounds from a helicopter or airplane.  It was a quiet breeze.  The only sounds that night were my friend and I talking, and the ambient noise of crickets and air.  It passed without a noise. It quickly flew by in a couple of seconds and disappeared over the tree tops. At first I thought shooting star, and then I thought it looked like a HUGE firefly.  That’s my best comparison to the light it was giving off. The light was not sharp, it was very glow-ie, and gave off a sphere of ambient light from the two light sources that made a sort of sphere around it.  It was a very faint light. Again, it was only a light. It didn’t look like it was a vessel meant to transport anything, and was certainly not large enough for an average man to fit in. I would describe the light's color as a clean white glow.",2014-08-08T00:00:00,28.0145,-82.6923

It was around 10 pm on July 4, 2014, and I was out in the front yard of a friend on Queen Anne Hill in Seattle, waiting for the fireworks over Lake Union when seemingly out of nowhere three orange orbs appeared in the eastern sky; looked like they could have been over South Lake Union or Beacon Hill.  They weren’t very big but clearly visible.   They hovered in a triangular shape for about 10-15 seconds -- one object above and two below that.  I told my friend, those are UFOs!  But he laughed and said, ""No they’re not.""   And I said, then what are they?  He had no answer.  The triangle moved slowly and in unison to the right (S) and moved behind a tree, so we ran over to the edge of the yard to see if we could track them.  I could see the orange lights through the branches.  (These objects were high in the sky; I don’t mean they were behind this tree across the street.)   When they emerged, the orbs spread out into a line and the one farthest to the right turned and dropped a bit below the others.  Again, they just hovered for about 10 seconds.  I was slapping my friend on the back and saying, see, see, those are UFOs!  Then the one to the far right disappeared.  It was just gone.  The other two hung on for a few more seconds and then they, too, were gone, first one, then the other. Yes, there were many choppers and airplanes in the air waiting for the fireworks, but they were noisy and I could easily identify them as aircraft.  At the time we saw the orbs, all the aircraft were farther north and were clearly not near the objects. I flew airplanes as a student pilot years ago, and have many hours of flying time, including solo landings.  I know what aircraft are like and these were not conventional aircraft. The fireworks had not started so these were not fireworks.  Unless there’s a new kind that can hover, turn, stop, and change formations in a crisp manner. I was thinking maybe they were flares, but they just didn’t look like flares.  The orbs were not wavering, fuzzy, but very stable and clear in the sky. To the west, there was a quarter moon out, but again, it couldn’t be confused with these very orange, very round, very clear objects that were hovering in front of us. I looked online the next day and somebody posted a video that shows an orange globe hovering and moving in the sky.  A commenter said it was a Chinese lantern, which, he said, were everywhere last night.  What we saw was not a lantern. When I got home last night, I called my son and told him about it and he said, wow, that’s weird because I saw an orange object hanging over Beacon Hill about the same time.  He said he thought at first that it was a planet but it seemed too big for a planet and it was very round and orange. So, that whole experience was a first for me and my disbelieving friend who witnessed it with me.  I have no idea what they were but sure wish I could find out.",2014-07-05T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

At about 10:00 p.m. on July 4, 2014, I stepped outside, facing west in general, to observe the small fireworks my neighbors were setting off.  When I looked up, though, what I saw was far more interesting than any fireworks.   I am 50 years old, college educated, and a former UFO skeptic.   I called my 85 year-old mother to witness as well; we both watched over the course of about 20 minutes.  Initially, we saw 5 orange-red objects arranged in a V-configuration in the area of the sky as we looked toward the Big Dipper.   They hovered and moved very slowly, moving independent of each other.  They maintained a steady orange-red circular glow at the bottom of the objects, and the objects themselves were dark but their base and outline seemed almost lantern-like in shape and appearance.   I chose the description ""teardrop"" to most closely describe what I saw, but again, they seemed somewhat lantern-like, tapering more narrow toward the top.  These objects seemed to be observing the activities below them.   After about 5 minutes, they moved off from each other, first very slowly and almost imperceptibly, then one by one ascended toward the northwest horizon and eventually disappeared as a pin-dot at what seemed to be a very high altitude in the atmosphere.  They each seemed to accelerate rapidly as they disappeared.   About 10 minutes after this first sighting, another such object approached at a fairly low altitude (perhaps 500 ft. to 1000 ft.) from the southeast, traveling very slowly.  It moved to where we were looking toward the northwest, then hovered for about a minute or two.  It followed a curved trajectory as it slowly moved to the southwest horizon, paused, then ascended rather rapidly and accelerated away to the northwest.   This craft seemed to have a very thin white ring surrounding it, barely perceptible, and almost translucent in appearance.  It maintained this white ring as it noiselessly accelerated toward the nort! hwest as the other objects had done.  I must emphasize that all of these objects moved absolutely noiselessly.   Finally, about 5 minutes after that object, the last object appeared overhead, this time approaching from the northeast, and headed westward, before slowing to a hover.  Then it seemed to drop in altitude and come toward us (our neighborhood, anyway), as if to be coming lower for a closer look at the activity and at us; I would estimate it was no higher than 500 ft.   At that point, the street lamp across the street lost power, although its power was restored about 5 minutes later.   My mother became frightened and implored me to retreat into the house, as she had a sense it was coming right at me.  It seemed that way to me too, but I did not feel frightened, but was far more curious.  It loitered about 20 or 30 seconds, then moved away toward the northwest and high altitude, as the others had done.  It also had the interesting white translucent ""ring"" around it that remained steady as it moved off, which struck me as being so! me manifestation of a self-contained energy field.   I tried to get pictures of these objects but unfortunately I was unsuccessful (cheap cameras and background light were probably at fault).  As of 10:23 p.m., that seemed to be the end of the incident.   Also relevant is that the meteorological conditions included a clear sky, occasional breeze 0-5 mph, no rain, and a temperature around 74 degrees F; all was calm weather-wise.",2014-07-05T00:00:00,38.8251,-90.7289

I could no longer see the striped-bands of clouds illuminated over the moon as I just did. Now the entire moon (which was in crescent form btw) was encased in what looked like a large yellow glowing...light I guess.  As if the little crescent was in the center of this perfect glowing yellow/amber hue/glow/light. Just then from what looked like the bottom tip/point of the moon, directly under the bottom point in the moon, and this yellow glow around the moon was still apparent and actually blocked a little of the vision of where this ""debris"" came from---but anyway     From this area in the sky, and out of nowhere it seemed, fell these flaming large objects.

I don't exactly know where to begin.  To be honest I don't even want to speak about it, but I feel like someone should know what happened. Before I begin.  You must understand I don't want anyone to know about what happened.  I don't want to become famous.  I don't want to be known.  I don't want to make money off this.  I don't want to ever speak about it again it scares me so much.  This is the truth as best as I can tell it. It all seemed like a dream except there was a physical sense of reality and feeling. I went to sleep around 10pm.  In a room with another person sleeping in a bed next to my bed, similar to sharing a hotel room.  I go to sleep.  Everything was normal. I regain consciousness to what seemed like a hospital room.  The first thing I noticed was I was laying back down on what appeared to be a hospital bed.  Immediately I assume I'm in a hospital.  As I realize there is no way I could be in a hospital I began to look around.... I notice the walls of the room seem to be of a metallic color.  This freaked me out because I know hospital rooms have bright colors and do not have metal walls.  This is when I went on a defense mode.  I started trying to understand my surrounding environments and the more details I noticed the more confused and scared I became. I make a quick glance to my right and I think I saw 2 people.  Near my feet another 2.  Then to my left a person sitting in a chair perpendicular to my ""hospital bed.""  My attention is struck by the person on the left of me in the chair.  At this time I realized I was unable to move almost like being asleep but awake at the same time.  Maybe I could explain the feeling as in a coma but with a mental awareness plus I could see everything. The person to the left was a female human.  This I know for sure. I was so scared I remember her telling me it was ok and it would all be over soon.  I then look at her as she puts a needle in my left arm.  Similar to how an IV needle is placed but different.  Their technique of placing the needle required no tape or gauze to hold it in place.  Which I have never seen and I have been in the hospital before so I know how IV needles are placed.  The needle itself was metal but it's luster was odd.  I can't remember if it was too dull or too shiny. But I know for a fact the luster was off.  Nothing I have ever seen before possibly an unknown metal. So, the lady to the left of me said there was nothing to worry about.  When I heard that I went from defense mode to panic mode.  Nothing to worry about to me means your screwed and you can't do any thing about it.  So I tried to move but couldn't.  Then the real panic and fear set into me. Again you have to understand something about me.  I am NOT scared easily.  I am not weak.  And I have no problem facing fears or going into combat.  So for me to be scared out of my mind.  It truly speaks for itself.  Anyways.... The last thing I remember seeing at that point was the person in front of me (one of the people by me feet).  They had what seemed to be a wire connecting to an led flashlight (that's what it looked like) it was all white and I could see the ""led bulbs"" in the ""flashlight.""  I was explained through a mental communication that this was a way to know or decipher something.  I think it was to know who I am or to locate me or something.  It was done for a reason I just can't remember exactly why. The flashlight thing was designed so the placement of each bulb could be measured through its complex variations and measurements so that it could be calculated to individually differentiate people.  In essence to separate them or track them.  Not sure exactly what or why.  But it didn't seem to be in bad intent. They literally touched the lights to my right foot.  I didn't feel any pain or anything.  Just like someone touching your foot with a flashlight.  I blacked out after that. I woke back up in the same room.  No idea how much time had passed by. No one was in the metal room.  Just me by myself. Near where my feet were, were the person holding the flashlight was, there was a door. Same color as the walls.  Metal.  I go through the door.  (Now it gets hard to explain). It was a diagonal hallway.  On one side (opposite of the door) it was a solid metal flat wall.  Maybe 100 feet long from what I could see.  I went 10 feet to the right.  Saw a door. Opened it.  It was the same looking room I was just in.  I close the door.  Start walking down the hallway in the opposite direction.  I pass maybe 10 rooms identical to what I just came out of. When I get to what seems to be a pivot point In the ship I almost shit in my pants.  I could only imagine the ship I was in being the shape of the letter V.  The pivot point I speak of would be the intersecting plot point.  When I got to that spot there was a giant window.  Maybe 30 feet tall 75 feet wide.  And when I looked out the window I saw earth.  It was glorious to view.  Making me realize I was not on my own planet. I panicked needless to say.  Then I saw beings walk by me. Not human.  The one I focused on had an olive colored skin. Looked wet but dry maybe like a lizard or snake.  The face looked like a (Mexican x Asian x African) in facial features (nose mouth eyes etc).  The strangest thing about them was they had what looked like fish gills, on the side of their face, where a humans cheeks are.  Almost like slicing a persons cheeks to look like gills or flaps.  They must have been 6.5-7 feet tall. I asked the being if this was all real and it grabbed my hand.  Next thing I know I regain consciousness inside my own bathroom.  I was stuck staring in the mirror in my bathroom. When I snapped into reality I realized I was in shock.  I looked where the needle was inserted into my arm and there was a blood spot or scab (coagulated blood).  When I realized I was staring in the mirror I noticed I was hallucinating (sort of, it was a feeling not a visual).  I felt like I had been in the ocean all day, got out of the ocean, and still felt the waves.  Or like I was skiing on a mountain all day and got off he mountains and felt like I was still skiing.  I also came to realize that at this point it was 6:45-7:00am.  Almost 9 hours had passed.  I felt so tired like I hadn't slept all night. My hallucinations wore off a few hours after the bathroom.  I came to the conclusion that the hallucinations had something to do with ((what)) they did to me. A few weeks later a spot identical to the shape of the led lights to my foot showed up.  They have never left i still have the physical marking left over from what they did even to this day.",2014-06-27T00:00:00,26.19318196994992,-81.73703021702838

Report of Unusual Lights Seen in Chico, CA  18 April 2014.  	 At approximately 2200hrs., on the evening of 18 April, 2014, my daughter and I spotted approximately 10 luminous lights traveling in an arc from the southeast moving to the West.  I first noticed two bright orange-colored lights moving across the night sky as I was driving Northeast on E. 1st Avenue in the city of Chico, CA. 	I immediately pointed out the lights to my 13 year-old daughter, who asked me what I thought they were.  I pulled the car over at the nearest safe place, at 1035 Village Lane.  We exited the car and immediately noticed that several other lights were appearing over the trees from the horizon.  We were facing the Southeast. 	The lights would appear over the horizon from the Southeast and travel Westward.  The lights appeared in pairs as if they were in a formation.  The lights had a steady, light-orange tint to them and were fairly large.  It was hard to judge their size, but I'm familiar with how bright and large Venus can appear, so I would approximate their size as if 5 or more Venuses were put together into a single object.  The objects would travel in a straight course, heading Westward and then disappear from the sky.  No noise was emitted from the objects.  We observed the lights for a total of about 10 minutes.  Most of the objects appeared to have a constant speed, with one object being fairly faster than the others. During this period of observation my daughter took a one-minute video of some of the objects with her ipod.  She captured three or four of the objects as they moved through the sky.  I will email the video after finishing this report. After pulling over at 1035 Village Lane, I called my wife (our house is close to where my daughter and I were making our observations) and asked her if she saw anything in the sky.  Both she and my 16 year-old son went to the front yard and saw some of the lights my daughter and I observed in the Western sky.  However, my wife and son both reported seeing other objects to the East.  They saw two dimmer objects compared to those seen the West.  They seemed higher and farther away.  First she saw two separate lights come close together and they appeared to cross each others flight path.

My wife and I were driving home from my mom and stepdad's house on Connelly Springs Rd. between Cajah's Mountain, NC, and Rutherford College, NC, towards our house in Drexel, NC.  It was between 10PM and 11PM EST.  We were near a portion of the road where we cross over a body of water and there are a lot of trees and cover around.  My wife is in the passenger seat and tired, so she has her eyes closes and trying to catch a quick nap. I didn't see the crafts approach, because of the trees.  But they appear to have came from my right and moving towards my left in a slightly forward angle. The lead craft was a perfect rectangle with 1 consistent light in each corner and a slowly throbbing light in the bottom center.  There appeared to be a lot of textures on the bottom, also.  The textures reminded me of a large computer chip, with seemingly random bumps and links, none of which were lit and were only visible when the center light throbbed at it's brightest. The trailing craft was much, much smaller and didn't appear to be more than a ball of light.  There was no visible wings, texture, or craft.  It was like a ball of white light gliding through the sky, but was keeping perfect distance slightly behind the rectangular craft (maybe 2-2.5 craft-lengths behind). Besides the appearance of the craft looking like no Earthly craft I've ever seen, the really odd things were the elevation, speed, and noise.  The trees lining the road are 15-20 feet tall, I would estimate. Elevation:  The crafts were low enough that I was concerned it could have been a crashing plane, until I saw they were not losing elevation.  They couldn't have been more the 45-60 feet in the air. Speed:  The crafts weren't going 100s of miles an hour, like you would expect an air-born plane or other craft to go.  They appeared to be slowly gliding.  Almost as if they were just cruising and so slow that it in-fact gave the impression they could speed up, slow down, or even stop as need (almost like a car).  To give you an idea of their speed: The road is 1 lane on each side and a dirt shoulder on either barely wide enough to pull a car on to before you get to the treeline, and from the time they appeared over the trees to the right and disappeared over the trees to the left was about 1 verse and chorus/hook in the song I was listening to (Outsiders - Eric Church). Noise:  Like I said, my wife was trying to fall asleep in the passenger seat with her eyes close.  The craft were so noise free that she never opened her eyes.  I never asked her to, because I was in disbelief of what I was seeing and kind of frozen.  She never knew they were there, never seen them.  An Earth-made aircraft flying that close to the ground and pretty much directly over your head would make it impossible to sleep or even ignore.  I never heard a single noise from either craft.  Also, they never disturbed the trees.  There was no blowing leaves around, no pick-up of wind at all.  It was as though they weren't there.",2014-05-02T00:00:00,,

I have one of those green laser pointers and I thought why not go out and look at the stars for a little bit because it was one of the clearest nights it had been in a while.  To add to the darkness and clearness in the sky, one of my neighbors who always keeps his back light on happened to leave it off that night, so it was about the darkest I've ever seen it in my backyard. So I’m out on my back deck looking at the stars, shining different patterns and pointing out some constellations with the laser pointer for about 30 seconds to a minute, and all of a sudden a bright, round white light illuminates in the sky appearing to be about half the size of the moon at first.  From my position, I was looking up at it at about the 12:00 position but it was not directly above me, a little bit in front of me.  It was hard to tell how high up it was but it looked like it could have been star level.  Right when I saw it light up, it really took me by surprise and I was just thinking like what the hell is that thing. This is where the story gets hard to believe.  After the object illuminated and appeared to remain still for a second or 2, it shot down from sky in in a complete vertical line to about 200-300 ft. above the ground (about 4-5 full tree lengths based on the trees it was above in my backyard), in only a matter of seconds.  When this happened, I was in complete shock and awe and dropped my laser pointer, just standing there and staring.  The light was so bright that it almost hurt my eyes but I couldn’t look away.  It seemed to be about the size of a car but completely round.  When it shot down, it was moving at speeds much faster than any type of aircraft that I’ve ever seen.  When it came to its stopped position, the light bent a little but then went back to its circular shape.  The light was completely white and like I said almost a little bit blinding.  Also, since I was looking up at it, it seemed like I was looking at the bottom of it and didn’t have a side-view, so the c! ircular shape that I saw may have just been the underneath of the structure.  It also emitted a soft, really low frequency sound as it hovered there but there was no sound when it was coming down.  It stayed completely still and hovered for about 5 seconds.  It truly felt like as I was staring at it, it was staring right back at me.  And then all of a sudden it shot strait back up into the sky vertically in the same path at an extremely fast rate of speed about equal to how fast it came down.  But when it shot back up it reached a certain point in the sky, and then paused for a second, then shot off westward at a sharp angle and then quickly disappeared.  One of the craziest parts to me is that I don’t even live in the woods or out in the middle of nowhere.  I live in your average suburban neighborhood. Right after it happened, I went back in the house and went to bed immediately.  I thought about waking my dad up to tell him but it was really late and I was kind of trying to convince myself that I didn't really just see that.  I don’t want to tell a lot of people because I know that this story seems pretty crazy, but I know what I saw and I’m not lying.

My mother has never seen a UFO in her life.  She asked my father what it was.   Apparently, he hesitated when he saw it, then proceeded to run back into the house yelling for me.  I thought there was a medical emergency because he has never yelled like that before.   He ran up the stairs and ran to the room across from mine.  We both looked out the eastern window and I was in shock.    In the distance was what looked like a rotating disc with lights around the circumference.  It was moving fairly quickly, maybe 100 feet per second.   The whole object was lit up and was clearly visible since it was the brightest object in the sky.  All it did was move south.   I live in a suburb and the object appeared to be above the local golf course.  From my location, I estimated that it was about half a mile away because the object was briefly obscured by the trees on a hill on the golf course.  I can't imagine it being any farther than that because that would mean the object would have to be unimaginably huge.   I never believed in any UFO sightings because I always thought people photoshopped images just to gain popularity and scare people.  Now, I am really not sure what to think.  I am scared.   So far, I told some of my closest friends via text message and they insist that it was a drone. I refuse to believe they make drones that big.   Now I am pretty sure they all think I am becoming the crazy conspiracy theorist.  I don't know who to talk to about this and I am currently trying to explain to my parents that society generally looks down upon people who claim to have seen UFOs.",2014-07-26T00:00:00,,

I wear glasses to correct my vision so I took off my glasses to make sure it wasn't an optical illusion on my lenses.  The lights were still there.   I put my glasses back on and watched as 3 orange lights danced around what looked like a commercial airliner.  I could tell it was an airliner because of the red and white strobe lights and the slow movement of the craft.  They looked almost like they were dog-fighting with the airliner.  They were pulling some weird maneuvers around this airliner--for instance, going very very fast and then suddenly stopping near the airliner, then moving very fast past the airliner, then stopping suddenly again and repeating the process.   The airliner looked like it made some course corrections, as if it was affected by the lights.  Then one of the rust-colored lights became more dim, and then dissipated, like it just dissolved into nothing.   The 2 remaining lights danced around as the airliner kept its original course heading approximately south-south east.   After a few more seconds of making very quick, very minute course corrections now behind the airliner, they too both dissipated into nothingness one after another.   I looked around my suburban neighborhood and noticed nobody was outside and nobody else saw this amazing dance in the sky.

It traveled off the water towards shore from east to west in a very straight line.  The line appeared to be perfectly parallel to the ground.  I think it flashed 4 times in the 3-5 seconds I saw it.  I estimate the speed at about 40 miles per hour, way too fast for a firefly.  It looked like it was shot out of a slingshot.  It looked like it was only about the size of a dime.  It was much brighter than a firefly, and the flashes were very consistent.  They went from dark to light almost immediately, like it was on a switch. I said to my fishing partner “tell me you saw that” and he said “yes, I did.”  He agreed it was too big, too fast, and too bright to be a firefly.

We live on a hill with about 200 degrees visibility of unobstructed skyline from the mountains to the ocean. On June 18, 2014, I went to bed at 8 pm with a headache.  I looked out the window and saw a bright orange light in the sky, which at first glance I assumed to be the moonrise, a bit south of east. I realized the light wasn't as large as the moon.  I then thought I was looking at a plane flying in my direction, since it appeared not to move.  But it was a single large orange light, not the multiple white and/or red lights of a plane.  After about a minute of bright stillness, it seemed to collapse in on itself and disappear. It was odd, but I thought maybe it was a weird reflection, or projection or a helicopter.  I dismissed it and fell asleep.  I'm an artist, with a vivid imagination, and so didn't take the sighting seriously. At 1030 pm, I woke up and looked out the window.  To my surprise, the same light was there again.  My husband walked into the room and I asked him to verify what I was seeing.  He agreed that it looked like an incredibly bright, fiery, unmoving orange ball and was nothing he'd seen before.  A software engineer by trade, he is also unrelentingly logical. As we watched, another orange light appeared to the north of the first.  A few seconds later, the first light went out.  I got up and got my binoculars and looked at the object.  I couldn't see much detail--it was a large ball of fire, unmoving, with smoke trails. My husband looked through the binoculars and saw the same thing--an unmoving fiery ball with smoke trails.  He took a video with his iPhone, showing one light going out after another has appeared, but the video doesn't portray well the size, brightness or orange color of the lights. A third light appeared further to the north and the second light went out.  When the third light went out, no other lights appeared and we went to sleep. There is a military base about forty miles to the southeast of us, so our assumption is that it is unknown military tech, but we have no expertise in this regard.",2014-06-20T00:00:00,33.534344000000004,-117.705338

I live in Fauquier County, Virginia.  I left my house with a friend around dusk.  I was driving down Vint Hill Road due North toward Manassas, VA.  My friend looked out the passenger window and made a comment about some cows in a field.   I then turned the music up and continued to drive.  As we came to an area in the road where you have to slow down for a sharp curve, my friend made a comment about something he saw hovering over in the field out the right window.   As I looked over I noticed bright lights about 100- 150 yds. in the air and 1000-1500 ft. away. I immediately slowed to a stop. I put my hazard lights on starring at the object. It was sitting in the air almost motionless just hovering.  I then turned the music down and proceeded to tell my friend to record the flying object.  For about 15 to 30 seconds it stayed in one spot above the field.   As the object slowly moved almost effortlessly in my direction, my friend began recording.  It stayed completely level, not moving up or down just in a straight line toward my vehicle.  I could make out the details of the saucer-like shape.  It had individual bright blue circular lights wrapping around the center of a metallic silver reflective surface.   At this point I was in shock and disbelief of what I was witnessing.  So entranced by the gleaming lights and saucer, I was completely oblivious if any cars were going to rear end me.   All of a sudden, it just stopped less the 200 yds. away from my vehicle.  At this point it started slowly spinning.  Now knowing exactly what I was witnessing, I felt it time to leave as quickly! as possible.  Looking back within seconds of me continuing down the road.  I looked back and the object was no longer there anymore.   My friend and I immediately scanned the sky around us and it was gone.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,,

So I exited off the right on a exit that leads to a golf course an I parked an my girlfriend an I got out to see what it was.  To me it looked like the top of the tree was on fire but it was just glowing above the tree line.   My first reaction was to get my phone out an film but when I clicked on the video to record my phone would not record an then all off the sudden my phone went to 95% battery life to 1% in just seconds and then it died. So while we were watching it, it shot a light down onto the ground in between the trees an when the light hit the ground it made like a round base circle of light on the ground that was multiple of colors (white, red, blue, orange and green).  It was very weird.   So my girlfriend got really scared because we had our 2 year old son in the back.  He was starring at the lights an pointing.  So she wanted to leave so we got in our car an it wouldn't start as if the battery on our car went out.   It wasn't even turning over so I tried to turn my phone on to call my brother in law to give me a jump but it was dead so we tried her phone an that was dead too.   As we were in the car the light or beam slowly went back up into the craft right as it was gone the light on the craft dimmed out an I could see the figure of it.  It was a round disc that was that seemed to have 3 layers of it that were rotating right to left and left to right.  My girlfriend was so scared that she grabbed my pistol, so I grabbed it an popped a shot off not towards the craft but on the ground an it's lights turned back on an right before it took off it was really weird because when I saw it there were no windows at all none.  Then after I popped a warning shot I saw 5 windows an I could see the out line of multiple figures and then it just shot up into the sky heading towards Lake Tahoe towards heavenly ski resort.  I have seen lights in the sky all the time but this was just very disturbing I don't get scared of anything an this had me a little frighten I guess that's why I popped a shot off.   After the craft left out car started and we left back home with my girlfriend really scared.  I just got my phone charged that's why I'm filling out the report so late. Please if anyone who was coming down the hill that night saw it too please report it or if you know what it was please post what it is on the nuforc website.  I know there was 2 cars pulled over when I was leaving so please report it.  Is this a new military aircraft?  I would really like a answer please so I can put myself an my girlfriend's mind at ease.

This is when something transited from right to left (south to north) through the field of view at what appears to be Mars’s equatorial region.  This is to say, it was observed in the field of view beyond Mars and passed somewhere between earth and Mars, exiting my field of view well past Mars.

This pass lasted for only a fraction of a second and the object appeared white (I am color blind, but it appeared white to Mars’s red body with white polar caps as I see them.)

The object was gone. At this point, I ruled a lenses flair, the angle of the sun and my telescope was incorrect.  Due to the recent freezing temperatures, there were no insects flying around and insects have never been visible to me through that level of magnification.

This could be best described as a very brightly flashing spherical/maybe oval shaped light moving about randomly initially.  It was actually spotted by one of my supervisors while we were on the tarmac at Ted Stevens not far from the UPS and FedEx parking.  When we first spotted it, it was moving about randomly low along the mountain slope in a weird, unpredictable circular pattern like it was pacing a bit before it started traveling across a greater distance and at a slightly faster speed.  The unknown object's bright white blinking light moved fast low on the mountains in almost a straight line after about a minute or two, still flashing.  The time posted is estimated.   It moved far too low and too fast to be any sort of small aircraft or military aircraft, or even a vehicle which might have made the most sense, but even then the light was too bright and flashing too constantly at such a distance, and they generally don't flash that bright while moving either.  It covered a lot of ground and seemed to disappear closer to the Cook Inlet by where I live farther south along the mountains towards Girdwood.   Note that had it been bright enough or a normal moving flying object i would have seen it past the last visible slope of the mountain chain in the south Anchorage area unless it turned around the bend out of sight.

This happened to me last night in West Carrollton, OH.  I took the dog out around midnight to find a strange looking cloud similar to a roll cloud moving quickly east.  It flowed across the horizon like a giant jet contrail, and stretching as far as the eye could see.  However it was tremendously lower and larger than I would expect of a contrail and the consistency appeared more like shaving crème than mist.  It had peculiar alternating curls forming intermittently on each side as it continued east.  I watched the cloud as it traveled out of my city and was startled by the silhouette of a giant black triangle.  It was completely silent and without lighting.  I observed the object hovering in front of a cloudbank that was illuminated by the city of Moraine.  I decided the combination of this unnatural and eerie cloud formation and the giant black triangle would be enough to finally vindicate me with my wife who finds my interest in the unexplained distasteful.  After around five minutes of prodding I dragged her outside.  By that time the triangle was gone, the sky was clearing and stars visible.  She had been less than thrilled when I described the sighting a few weeks earlier and refused to wait and see if we could spot the craft again. She stormed away, frustrated again by her ""lunatic husband"".  I stared up at the stars where the previously unnoticed and rapidly expanding puffy white clouds where racing toward one another.  The moment the door slammed shut two tine white orbs that seemed to have long straight tails streak through the cloud cover.  They resembled the little firecrackers in twisted white paper you give you kids to throw at the sidewalk while you light the real ones. I had seen the combination of strange cloud behavior and streaking white orbs recently, so I hoped I could expect to see more. And for the next four hours I witnessed more abundant and varied phenomenon then I ever would have expected. I still hav! e a flip phone with a terrible camera so it was too dark when ! I attemp ted to take pictures. Within minutes a black helicopter with a bright green light came into the area where I was observing the clouds. It was quieter than the Blackhawks I became accustomed to at Ft. Campbell, but bot nearly silent.  It hovered briefly overhead, the turned to pursue a thick smooth puff of cloud as it started to suddenly rapidly ascend towards the main cloud cover.  The cloud seemed to have a slight glow and as it speed off the rear fanned slightly making it look like a little flying whale. s I lost sight of them quickly behind the tree line. Shortly thereafter, noticed a dim bluish pulsing light coming from the larger group of clouds. The mist settled quickly and I thought there could be craft overhead but when I stared my vision became blurry and my eyes wouldn't focus.  Repeated attempts to avert and clear my eyes and observe the object through the mist began to give me a strong headache.  By the eerie way they moved and the abnormal consistency I assumed that! something other than then nature was influencing them.  However I decided to check around the back of my building as it has less light posts and better visibility,   Not sure how long I sat out there, but just when I was about to give up a glowing yellowish white ball of light dropped straight out of the sky,  I couldn't judge the distance properly or discern where it came from, It seemed to just materialize at high altitude and drop straight down.  However a few minutes a an aircraft ascended at a steep angle from what seemed to be where the glowing ball must have fallen.  This craft was possibly unrelated as we are close to an airport. had rapidly flashing red and white lights just as civilian craft, yet it was silent and moved very fast.  I remained outside a short time, until my growing headache compelled me to call it a night.

I turned to my left and saw a round, glowing, orange/red object in the sky.  It was west of us, and low enough to the ground that I could make out the shape, but still far enough away that much detail was yet to be seen.  I immediately begin to think of what it could be, but the shape, color, and behavior was nothing I have ever seen on any flying object that I witnessed.   The object began to pulsate more rapidly and moving at a high rate of speed, faster than any plane I have witnessed. The object began to move south, and suddenly it stopped in mid air for a good half a minute or so.   Suddenly, it began to speed away, going southwest, and disappearing within a few seconds. I could not believe what I just saw; I am a paranormal investigator with a background in Sociology, and consider myself open minded but very skeptical.  I have read about alien ! and UFO encounters, but never witnessed anything of the sort, so I always wondered about the legitimacy of such claims.

When it reached the altitude that it would have exploded at it did no do so.  As I observed it progressed from W NW to SE, at about a 60 - 70 deg. angle from my vantage point, across the southern sky.  When it reached a point approx. ""half-way"" between the western and eastern skies it turned due south and at which point I was viewing it from the rear,and continued on until it faded from view.  The speed at which it covered the distance from the western horizon to the point of its turning south was about 40 seconds, which is why I thought it was perhaps a military jet on afterburner.  However, that seemed odd as there was no sound, even after it had made the turn to the south.  The other odd part was that a jet, which I assume had taken of from Detroit Metro, was heading south and made a slight heading alteration to the southwest so as to not cross the flight path of the object I was viewing.  I DID hear the sound from the passenger jet, though it was faint. I would guess the altitude of the passenger jet at about 20,000 ft +/-, and that of the object to be quite a bit higher, maybe 30,000-35,000 ft.  I did get photos of the object, but they show only an orange / yellow light. As this was coming to an end and I was thinking I had just seen some type of military aircraft, I was turning my attention back to the fireworks when to my amazement two more of the exact type of lights rose up from the western horizon, one directs behind the other, though separated by what I would estimate to be one to two miles, though in a straight line.  I took several photos of these two objects, though they are not very detailed beyond showing orange/yellow lights, one trailing behind the other.  Again, these two objects traveled from W NW to SE, at the same angle in the sky from my vantage point, and upon reaching the same ""mid-way"" point turned due south, and continued until out of range for me to see.  I thought perhaps they were military aircraft that had taken part in some type of July 4th event, and were heading to the air national guard base in Toledo.  However, as I am in the flight path for planes leaving Detroit Metro, and can watch the aircraft in-bo! und to Metro cross from West to NE along the western horizon from my property, I'm familiar with the headings aircraft generally take / use, either in-bound to Metro, or out-bound from Metro, as well as those heading from other points toward Toledo Express airport west of Toledo Ohio, about 30 miles to the Southwest.  These objects did not use any flight path I've ever seen other aircraft take, nor did they appear to be on any heading I've ever seen other aircraft that over-fly Monroe take.  Again, COMPLETE silence as these lights passed over head. As I watched the other two fade from sight, I turned back to the west to see if any more were forthcoming.  As I did so a neighbor to the east put off a couple of fireworks which caught my attention.  As I turned to watch the treeline to the east I noticed a fourth orange light traversing from the north to the south, within 25 deg. of being directly over-head, again, moving at high speed, as a jet on afterburner would, minus the noise.  It made a slight course correction and proceeded to the same point the others had, and continued on until it faded from sight. After that, nothing.  I've been doing photography since I was sixteen, I've photographed the craters on the moon, planes and stars at night, and just about everything else I can photograph.  I've studied just about every plane type, and researched ""ufos"" enough to know that the vast majority are man made aircraft of one type or another, be they experimental, military, drones, satellites, etc.   What I saw last night were not ""space aliens"".  They were man made craft, of that I am certain.  But, what type, I don't know.  They were very fast and used some type of dampening system to mask the engine sound on afterburner.   Where they were going in such a hurry and the fact that obviously other people have been seeing the same type of aircraft in this region and along the upper mid-west over the past couple of weeks is also interesting.   The other thing is the fact that the passenger jet altered its heading so as not to intersect that of the first object I saw.   That al! so tells me these objects were most likely some sort of military craft. my question would be, why all this activity in this region ?",2014-07-05T00:00:00,41.931,-83.4554

If you go to the second entry,  a couple heading from Irvine, California (Orange County) south towards Dana Point, California, video taped the objects, even one going out, and then coming back on.  For your reference, it  says uploaded by Justin Me., and there is a reference to utube at the top of his entry.  You can hear both the husband and the wife, as they are video taping this phenomena.   This sighting was not only reported to your site, but hundreds of calls were received by many television stations from people describing the same thing.  There has been no explanation by anyone of authority over the past 6 days.  Initially, Camp Pendleton Marine Base in Oceanside, California, and the FAA said they had no craft in the air at that time, and did not know what it was that people were viewing. Have you received any more information from your sources?  Several eyewitnesses reported to news stations, helicopters were seen trying to chase these lights in the sky, with their searchlight pointed up instead of towards the ground as we are used to seeing, when a search is occurring. If you get a chance to view the video I referred to you , you will be amazed.  And that is not the only video that has been shown by local television stations.  This is not a hoax.  I just wish someone would explain even if they don’t know what it was, but to let us know someone is looking into this. Thank you",2014-06-27T00:00:00,,

The day before, on Father's day, I was over at my dad's house and we were cooking outside.  Above the house we spotted what looked like a VERY large bird hovering over his house.  It appeared to be roughly 100 meters up, based on comparisons to surrounding trees, and if that estimate was accurate I would guess that this bird had to have had a wingspan equivalent to a small single engine plane.  What was very odd was the way it flew, hovering, very small wing movements at the very tips, and when it did fly away it basically headed directly east and at a very high rate of speed.  There were 4 witnesses total for that sighting.  My dad mentioned he had seen something similar where he works, only when he spotted it previously it spiraled straight up until it was out of sight.  Apparently there have been other sightings of this thing in the area as well. The next day I was laying out in my yard and I spotted the same thing, looked like it was flying at about the same height, very slowly passing from W/SW to the East.  I had my son run and grab my binoculars so I could get a better look at it.  I have good quality Bushnell binoculars and I was able to track it pretty easily.  Again, I am guessing it was roughly 100 meters in the air, same relative size, based on observation of the large trees we have around here.  With my binoculars focused I got a pretty good look at it, and it was not a bird.  This object had wings similar to a bird's, but again only moved the tips and very rarely.  It's midsection was cigar shaped, very pointed both front and rear.  We have large cranes and large ravens in the area, but ravens have a fanned tail when they ride thermals and cranes trail their legs.  This was completely symmetrical, no trialing legs and no fanned tail.  By my guess, based on the time of day and relative heat and wind, it pro! bably was not actually riding thermals either, it would have been too high up.  My son and I watched it for about 3-5 minutes as it passed over.  What was very odd is that it sped up dramatically once I but the binoculars on it, almost like it ""knew"" it was being watched.  It disappeared to the east fairly quickly.  Of note, the animals in the area (dogs, horses, goats, etc.) all seemed very perturbed when this was in the air...making lots of noise. I have been watching since then to see if I can spot it again and I have asked around locally and I can account at least 10 other people who have either seen the same object, or something almost exactly the same. Of interest too, when time permits my wife and I spend a lot of time stargazing, and we have also seen repeated appearances of unexplainable bright white lights that tend to travel southwest to northeast, we have reported this before and we have had numerous witnesses with us when we spot these things.  On the Saturday evening before I spotted the bird we were out stargazing and watched what appeared at first to be a satellite pass over to the west of us slightly, moving from due north towards the south.  However, roughly 20 seconds after we spotted it the object ""split""...as in, there was a bright flash, and then there were suddenly two objects..one moving south at a much more rapid speed, and a brighter object moving north at a rapid speed.  Both grew very bright after the flash and faded out.  Logically, I suppose it could have been a meteor or space debris breaking up at re-entry but I have witnessed both of those types of things numerous times and the way this! object acted was quite different. We have also witnessed numerous other odd lights, mostly they seem to appear above the mountains to the north...they hover a bit, then zigzag around rapidly, sometimes they descend with a motion that is like a falling leaf, sometimes they shoot straight upward. I have an interest in ufology and have read numerous books on the subject, and what concerns me is that we have a personal set of sightings spanning over two years in the same area with multiple witnesses.  Now, we are seeing a large ""bird-like"" object and the sightings continue.  Every time we witness something like this we note the behavior of the animals in the area, most times they are very obviously disturbed.  We have had instances of power anomalies in the neighborhood, and at times there have been areas around here that seem to emit a pervasive feeling of fear for no reason...all of this is strikingly similar to events reported by people in West Virginia in the Ohio River Valley in the 60's, as documented in several books but most notably John Keel's ""The Mothman Prophecies"".  The events there culminated in the collapse of the Silver Bridge in 1967.  So many of the things we have seen parallel the reports in that book that it is hard to believe it! is simply coincidence.  Bearing logical explanations in mind (the bird object could be some kind of drone, the lights could also, etc.) we are trying to keep an open but skeptical mind about these things, but the repeated incidents and so forth lead me to believe that this bears deeper investigation (which I will continue to do as an amateur).",2014-06-27T00:00:00,46.369,-117.2288

The object was a constantly illuminated white-colored orb (spherical), which was about the brightness and size of the planet Jupiter when viewed in the night sky with the naked eye, and which traversed the sky from southwest to northeast at about the same pace as a commercial airliner would be moving, possibly faster.  It was initially moving in a straight line, but then began to disappear beneath the visible horizon while making a zigzagging motion, much like a falling leaf.  The object made no sound. The object then reappeared in the north about ten minutes after the initial sighting in the exact same or approximate location as the North Star.  We did not realize at the time that this object was sighted in that particular location until the following days when a stationary star was spotted in the same locale, which was obviously the North Star.  Our best guess is that either we did not see the North Star during phenomenon, or the phenomenon itself made the North Star appear to be moving. When spotted the second time, in the north, the object moved in circles, then right for a small distance, then it stopped, moved left and up and down, and so on in the same approximate vicinity for at least twenty minutes as it was observed by both myself and my girlfriend who was standing directly behind my shoulder. It would move quickly and then stop or pause before moving again. The object changed colors from white to red to blue and then back to white during the entire second sighting.  The object made no sound and eventually ceased moving sometime after we could no longer watch it because our necks were getting rather stiff.

After these planes were far in the distance, I looked directly up, and saw, YET ANOTHER faint orb travelling what seems to be very high in the sky, possibly above our atmosphere. It was moving in the opposite direction of the two previous sightings.  After this, I saw the last UFO, very similar to the previous one, and on the same path, except it was moving in the opposite direction. I have a video and picture of the first sighting.  I have lived in Las Vegas my entire life (22yo), and I know what planes (both commercial and military, we have bases near here) look like in the sky... the four orbs were NOT planes! I do believe the blinking objects were planes, but I found it quite curious they were in the same formation and flying in the same direction. :)  Maybe our military keeping an eye on things?",2014-05-02T00:00:00,36.026650762829405,-115.0438399445215

We were sailing from the Venice, Louisiana, area to Pensacola, Florida, in our Catamaran sailboat across the Gulf of Mexico.  The night was very clear and there were lots of stars.  One of us noticed a bright white light over their right shoulder up in the night sky, they turned forward to check the boats position on the instruments then looked back to see the light and it was gone.  The other one of us was asleep but came up on deck about 10 minutes later to check on everything.  We were both noticing the stars when a very bright yellow white light came on in the sky to our right(South,Southeast). Then another bright yellow white light came on right below it until 5 total lights were on, in a line down with a space in between each light.  Then in the same order they had come on, they went off one at a time. It lasted less than a minute. We asked each other if we had both seen the same thing, we described it to each other and each of us had seen the same thing.  The one of us that had been asleep stayed up a while longer to see if it was going to come back.  After about 5 to 10 minutes, we had seen nothing more so the one of us went back to the room to sleep a while longer. Almost immediately after leaving the deck, the lights came back, same pattern as before but this time they were over our starboard bow (Southeast) of the boat (front right side).  The one of us below deck saw the five lights go out, confirming that it was the same as before. We did not see any additional lights in the sky that night.  We did not hear any odd noises or notice any other oddities while seeing these lights. We also did not notice any other colors with these lights, they just appeared bright yellow white lights. We tried to rationalize the lights and decided it might be possible that a satellite may have been orbiting low in the Southern sky that night and maybe that was what we saw.  We also wondered if it was something odd flying from the Pensacola Air Force base, but we could not see any type of plane behind the lights.  We cannot find anything about a satellite but we did see a similar sighting mentioned on this website and on the web.  They sighted a pattern of lights off of Dauphin Island, Alabama, on March 23rd.",2014-05-02T00:00:00,30.247,-88.1939

Background:  I am an elementary school teacher and I live in Albuquerque.  I have seen unusual objects in the sky before, but primarily in my hometown of Santa Fe.  I am a frequent sky-watcher.  Living near an airport, I am very familiar with objects that are identifiable, like planes and helicopters and how they move and what lights they emit as well as sounds they make traveling overhead. I went out to my backyard to check on my dog.  I looked up as I always do to check out the stars.  I was looking at the east sky when I noticed what looked like a star, a white light, moving slowly straight up in the sky. I then saw a blinking green light positioned vertically under it, also moving up. The lights changed position. They moved from being vertical to being horizontal to the sky line.  When this happened the white light changed color: turned orange-red.  The blinking green light began blinking red then green. The began to move faster, as they picked up speed I could hear what sounded similar to plane noises, but different, almost a rumble.  The sound was loud compared to their distance away from my house.  I am used to hearing plane engine noise as I live near Double Eagle Airport, which is about 10 miles from my house.  Normally when the sound is as loud as I heard it, the planes appear closer to my location. The objects were traveling due west,not Northwest, which is where the airport is located from my house.. As the two objects began to travel west, dogs all over started barking as it flew overhead.  My own dogs were appearing agitated and looking up at the sky. They traveled together; leading was the orange-red light that was not blinking at all, followed by the blinking red and green light. I fixed my eyes on the space between the lights and something seemed fuzzy about the space in between, almost as if there was something being masked in the middle. They begin to travel pretty quick.  I ran inside and then to the front yard which faces west.  I was able to watch them travel west until I could no longer make out the lights.",2014-05-02T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

Sighting Report  Date of June 18, 2014, at about 21:40  Location: Myrtle Beach SC boardwalk, 6th avenue North ((steps down to the beach and Atlantic Ocean directly in front of us)  Weather: overcast earlier but stars started appearing about 21:00, slightly hazy, nice ocean breeze blowing on shore. We recently (May 3,2014) had moved to Myrtle Beach SC with all our belongings having sold our home in Connecticut, following my retirement as an electrician (licensed) in an industrial facility. Last night we went to the “beach” to view the fireworks display scheduled for 22:00 (they were on schedule)  At about 21:20 we arrived at the above location after having walked and viewed the sights for about 45 minutes.  No alcoholic beverage of any kind had been consumed by me or my wife before, during or after the evening’s event.  Having recently completed re-reading “The Electric Sky” by Donald  Scott and now with but four (4) pages left to finish reading “The Electric Universe” by Wallace Thornhill and David Talbott, viewing the stars is now done with an entirely new sense of wonder. From our location the fireworks would be “fired” off from the end of a pier about 1/3 of a mile distance South East of us.  At about 21:40, I turned to view the scenery including the “Ferris” wheel slightly North West of our location when I observed several more stars that had come into view as the skys cleared even further. These stars appeared at about a 30 degree elevation form us …. As I watched several more stars appeared, four or five, and to my surprise they began “going off and on at about one second intervals, not necessarily in snyc with one another”… I then brought them to my wife’s attention who also observed this behavior. After a total of about four minutes the “flashing” stars went “out” and were not observed by us again. At least four of the stars were in a cross formation though wider in the middle. I later judged the horizontal distant between the stars to be about 2/3 across the width of one of my eyeglass lenses….. and the vertical ones about ½ the height of the lens. I tried to locate the far left horizontal stars position  by trying to picture where it was relative to the shore and  perceived it to be almost directly above the junction of the beach and ocean…..the two vertical stars were mid point between the horizontal ones. Again, I had no accurate means or expectation of any need to perform such a task. As we continued to observe the general location, two luminous circles appeared due East of us over the water. Their diameter seemed to be of 4 or 5 times larger than a star visible immediately to their right side and slightly above them. They had a reddish circumference with a yellowish center, did not appear to be moving and after about 30 seconds just “went out”. After the two lights went out, I inquired of a couple sitting behind us to find out if they were aware of any of these sightings…… They were facing South and did not observer any of the items mentioned until now but as we talked one of the Red/Yellow circles reappeared in the same location for about 10 seconds the again went out. The woman sitting there observed this event but had no knowledge of what it might be. Helicopter rides are a continuous sigh here but though I don’t know if there available at night, the proximity of the objects to one another , the lack of discernable motion and them both appearing then disappearing together make that very unlikely. We did observe two air craft. One was a single propeller type circling over the general area of the fireworks pier a few minutes before the actual display and the other that appeared more like the ISS ( space station) moving North to South, very reflective but as it passes well overhead appeared to have a blinking light. I had observed the ISS before and am aware that there is a web sight dedicated to locating it in the night sky. Nothing further was observed regarding the stars or circles of light.

When I came up around fraternity row I immediately saw a red object floating stationary over the campus adjacent to Carnagie hall art building.I pointed it out to my friends and immediately pulled over.   On an impulse I jumped out of my Volkswagen and ran down to where it was.  Keeping the trees between me and it, I was able to get real close to it.  I remember several small beings in white suits with head coverings who looked somewhat oriental.  They seemed to be possibly taking samples or something similar to that.  I was behind a large pine tree observing them and impulsively,again, stepped out into the open and said HI or hello.   This startled them and I took off running back to the car.  About halfway back I stopped and looked back at the craft.  It remained motionless but changed in color from red to light red to dull yellow to white and shrunk into a small dot just like the tv picture tubes of the 60's used to do.  Then that small light shot into space in the blink of an eye. I ran the rest of the way to my car and we were all excited by the event.My friend MJ said he saw green and white lights on the bottom and I remember being upset with him because I did not see them.  This sighting really changed my life.   That night I called the Orono police to find out if anyone else had seen it as it was in a prominent place over campus only maybe 40' in the air and also next to several dorms.  The police said no reports taken and the next day I posted a flier at the student union asking if anyone had seen it, but got no response back.  The sighting was very clear in my mind but after that I have had very unclear memories of seeing profiles thru Windows (of the craft?)

Much evidence of all types. On or about that date in the early morning hours, my sister heard a loud vibrating on-going bang in the house.  She thought it was the boiler exploding.  The whole house shook with the noise and it lasted more than a few minutes. She ran to my father, asleep in the in-law apartment.  The house is a single level ranch.  She screamed to my father that something just exploded.  My father heard it too and it woke him. The noise was so loud and on-going.  He felt the noise and vibration was from above the house, not the cellar.  He ran out the door onto the porch and looked up in the dark, possibly overcast, sky.  He still heard a very strange loud vibrating noise.  The house was still vibrating.  He believed he seen some type of unknown craft, large and dark just above the tree line across the street and moving away slowly, very slow. He told me the story the next day.  It was in the local paper that many, many, people called the police that night, as they all reported a loud, loud, craft or crafts flying in the sky in west Methuen and headed towards East Methuen, where my father lives.  It was also reported to the police that someone on the west side observed several helicopters flying low in the area. The local paper did an investigation and reported on the front page.  Pease Air force base in nearby Portsmouth, NH, denied it was them, as they are forbidden to fly low and through neighborhoods. The manager at Lawrence Airport related that there were no incidents of any kind there, or connected to flights at the airport there. This all appeared in the Eagle-Tribune News Paper as well. The strangest surprise I got when I went to my fathers house the next day was, a large maple tree in the front of the house had broken tiny limbs all over the ground under the tree.  They had leaves on them.  They were basketball sized clusters on the ground. It was an abnormal sight and I seen it before I got to the house.  The strange thing was, the clusters were directly under the tree. Not scattered about. Which indicates a direct ""downward"" energy.  I took my father out to show him.  Solid evidence that something went over his house, as the tree was taller than the house.  Very good corroboration with this incident.

The craft was white inside every corner rounded off. He freaked out when he saw the greys and ran into another room on the craft to get away from them. He started pullin wires and almost yanked out a box in this engine room. One of the greys spoke in his mind telling him if you rip that box object out the ship will go down!! My dads said what one of you greys said that?? One raised his hand and walked up to my father and took his hand. He took my father in a room wwith a floating table and strapped him down with a sheet that sucked his body tight onto this table. Two shinny needles come out of the ceiling and go directly under each of his eyes. They tolk him they can take his soul out of his body and pute it into another body.

The cylinders appeared to be spinning, and thermal distortion could be seen under the craft, indicating a heat source.  The craft was very quiet.  Only as the object was directly overhead could it be heard.  The sound was that of a gentle hum.  The object was close enough that a rock couldve been thrown to strike the underside.

My husband & I heard the following, on the police scanner we have. Officers from the ""Sherman Police Department"" (Sherman, TX.) were dispatched to a neighborhood, because their were sightings of something ""strange"" in the air. One officer said, ""Does this sound for real?"" Someone (I think the dispatcher) said, ""That neighborhood is a very good neighborhood.  Those people wouldn't be calling if there wasn't something there.""  (She said it was the ""(?something) HILLS"" addition. We heard the responses of the officers as they arrived. They were VERY excited and a female officer said, ""My GOD !!! What IS that thing.  I have never seen anything like this before in my life. It's moving just above the power lines.""  The officers were then talking back and forth (I guess to the dispatcher.)  Then, a man came on and said in a very quick, firm voice, ""Cease talking NOW!!!!!!"" Everything went quiet.  (We think they may have gone to a different frequency or something, so they couldn't be heard.  `````````` Shortly after filing the above report, I remembered that the name of the addition that the police dispatcher stated over the police scanner was:  a word that was a ""directional"" name. i.e., the first word, before HILLS addition"" was (either, Western, Northern, Southern, Eastern)  There is a ""WESTERN HILLS addition"" in Sherman. (As far as I am aware, and have been able to find, there is NO, Northern Hills addition, Southern Hills addition, or Eastern Hills addition.

So in other words, I have been a local for a very long time and I am very familiar with the street names and addition (subdivision) names, of Sherman, as well.)  I am quite certain that the name the police stated was: ""WESTERN HILLS addition"". (It is also worth noting that, she said: ""That is a very nice neighborhood."")  ""WESTERN HILLS addition"", (which is, west, of downtown) is the ""newer"" addition, in Sherman. (The other areas in Sherman, areas in the north, south, east , these areas are close to the downtown area, and they are the ""older"" part of Sherman. (That is where the ""older"" homes are.)  ""WESTERN HILLS addition"" (The homes are newer in that area, and, having gone down some of the roads in that area before, I am aware that some of the paved streets in that housing addition, are ""hilly"".)  I am quite certain (actually, very certain), that the sighting(s) occurred at the  ""WESTERN HILLS addition""  (The reason I did not catch the ""first"" word she stated is:  I was not expecting to hear a report regarding, ""something ""strange"" in the air being seen by people living in the neighborhood.""  (Had I known, that was what I was ""about"" to hear, I'm sure I would have paid more attention to what the ""first"" word was, that the police dispatcher stated.)  But I did recall, that the first word she called the subdivision was, the same word as a, ""directional"" name. (western, or northern, or eastern, or southern)  As far as I am aware, there isn't even another addition(subdivision) in Sherman, that even has word, ""HILLS"" in it. Except for: ""WESTERN HILLS addition""  1. I know for a fact that the police dispatcher stated, ""(something) HILLS addition""  2. I later recalled that the first word she stated was, the same as a ""directional"" name. (So, was either: Western, Eastern, Southern, Northern)  (I have never heard of a eastern hills addition, southern hills addition, northern hills addition, in Sherman.)  But I have heard of (and am familiar where the area is), of: ""WESTERN HILLS addition"".  4. Police dispatcher stated: That the ""(something) HILLS addition"",  ""is a nice neighborhood. Those people wouldn't be saying there was something there, if there wasn't.""  ""WESTERN HILLS addition"", are newer built homes (than in the other areas of Sherman, the older parts. Eastern, northern, southern parts of the city.)

UFO  06/03/ 14 June 3/ 2014 approx 23:45 hours ADST, myself my wife and her two cousins saw an extremely bright yellowish white light in the sky moving at a speed which would be  by my estimation 1/3 as fast as the ISS.  I saw it first at about 22:30.   I just happened to look up `and I saw almost directly over us headed then in a northerly direction a solid yellowish white light just kind of moving through the night sky.  It was the  brightest thing by far in the clear starlit sky which was complimented by a crescent moon to the west.    The funny thing was that as soon as I spoke to point the object out to the three women who were standing outside with me, the bright light blinked out and the object now was indistinguishable from the surrounding stars except for the fact that it was moving at the same speed and heading North.   One of the women said “a satellite?”  I said “I guess so, but it was really, really bright just a second ago...I mean really bright.”   We turned back to the conversation about trees and bears and such things.  After about 10 minutes went by I looked up again there was another one or the same one?  Really, there is no way to tell.  But this time it kept its spot light intensity and seemed to slow as it passed directly over head (it felt kind of creepy as if it somehow may have seen us watching us- somehow) but it kept on moving due east at a speed which I described earlier as that which would equal approx 1/3 less than the international space station (ISS).  The four of us watched it as it silently flew?, floated?, drifted ? across the sky until it was lost in the eastern horizon.  No navigation lights no sound, just a yellowish white light about the size of a soft ball when held at arms length.   We have no idea what it was, what it was doing or where it was from. Upon returning home I went to the computer and looked up the time when the ISS would be flying over the area.  I found that it was scheduled to fly over Caribou Maine at approx 00:30 which is about 15 miles away as the crow flies so there is no way that it was the ISS that we saw at 22:45.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,,
A flashing white light that darted about the sky with incredible agility.,Bethesda,MD,2014-06-03T23:00:00,light,15 minutes,"Occurred : 6/3/2014 23:00  (Entered as : 06/03/14 11:00) Reported: 6/3/2014 10:33:24 PM 22:33 Posted: 6/4/2014 Location: Bethesda, MD Shape: Light Duration:15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109938.html,"A flashing white light that darted about the sky with incredible agility. I was stargazing very high in the sky to the North, towards the big dipper, when I realized I had been seeing various flashes in my peripheral vision and I decided to focus my attention on them.  I saw a fast moving object flashing, with a fairly regular pattern of two flashes in less than a quarter second, then a gap of about three quarters of a second.   After observing a first pair of flashes, I concluded that the object was a fast moving airplane.  However, when the next pair of flashes began less than a second later, the object was moving in a completely different direction, perhaps about 135 degrees off from its original heading.  It didn't seem possible for an airplane to turn so quickly and completely. The flashing light continued this rapid darting behavior, changing its heading seemingly almost at random with each pair of flashes.  After seeing each pair of flashes, I could roughly guess where the next would appear, but the position and particularly the heading would always surprise me somewhat when the next pair of flashes occurred.  It gave the impression of a pinball being bounced rapidly around by bumpers. Over the course of about 90 seconds, the object bounced its way to the West, and finally over to the Southern sky, where I lost it behind some trees.  There was no sound at any time. I watched the sky closely for about 30 minutes thereafter, and I spotted the light twice more, after roughly five minutes intervals.  In both cases, I observed it near the big dipper where I had first seen it before, and in both cases I only had about 20 seconds to observe it before it went behind trees or my house.  However, there was one amazing pair of flashes (again, separated by less than a quarter second) when the object performed a complete 180 degree reversal between the two flashes. After that, I watched the sky with gradually decreasing attentiveness for about another hour, and I didn't see anything else of interest.  There were commercial airplanes in the sky off to the South while I was observing the flashing object, but they had no apparent interactions with it. My impression was that the object was high up and far away, but I cannot rule out the possibility that it may have been closer, though it must have been at least above tree level, since it regularly disappeared behind the trees. As an amateur astronomer, I am highly familiar with the appearance and behavior of aircraft, satellites, and meteors in the night sky, and this phenomenon appeared to be none of these.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,38.997117102137764,-77.12709453681711

The sky was fairly clear over my house but there was a light cloud cover that I noticed at sunset.   I spotted an orange object that I intially thought was a helicopter coming from the east traveling in a south western pattern.  Because I thought it looked strange so I took a photo with my smart phone camera.  I quickly magnified the image and it did not look like a helicopter.   After the first orange object faded from my view, another orange light traveling in the same pattern came into my view.  Both objects were cruising at a casual speed, probably as fast as a helicopter.   The objects were silent and the orange light appeared to be changing from small to bigger and then bigger to small.   Just as the second one faded out of my view, a third one came along traversing in the same pattern.  Then another after that one.  At this point after seeing 3-4 orange objects I started! shooting a video of the orange/orb lights passing by.  I got about 9 minutes of solid footage.  I was in shock as I witnessed the first 3, I have never seen anything like it.  It was either a group of top secret military helicopters or off-world extraterrestrial UFOs?  I feel it might be the ladder, but I can not be sure.

It wasn't a normal light so I watched it travel from the NW to the SE but as it approached the SE horizon the lights turned off and the craft went dark. I then witnessed three other identical crafts traveling the same speed and flight path aprox 20 second to 40 seconds apart.  As one would come close to the SE horizon and go dark the next would appear in the NW horizon.  It was difficult to judge altitude, but I would say they were traveling higher than typical helicopters but much lower than commercial jets.  We are close to a small airport where single prop planes are constantly in the sky and we are also in the flight path of a regular helicopter. These was no noise to suggest either of these types of crafts.

I live in a city that is about 11 miles southeast of downtown L.A., on the edge of the San Gabriel Valley.   They were 10 orange-yellow fireballs about the size, from my perspective, of a small fireball.  They appeared to be in a loose formation at about 3-4000 elevation.  Where I live, our house is under one of the direct flight paths to LAX so many commercial airlines are always over our home.   These ""fireballs"" had no discernible wings or other aviation lights on them.   Four fireballs were leading the ""pack"" in a loose line and then the next four appeared to be in a square like formation with 2 fireballs trailing behind in a loose line.  They appeared to be traveling slowly and kinda lightly ""bobbing"" up ! and down.   I knocked on my neighbor's house and he came out and witnessed the same thing.  The people across the street, who like to sit outside their house in the evening,also witnessed this.  One of the young men who was sitting outside had noticed it right away, but did not want to draw any attention to it for fear of being ridiculed.   It wasn't until I and my neighbor were outside and talking excitedly, did we attract their attention.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone but I have a flip phone and didn't take it.   Also the people across the street were unsuccessful.   Earlier in the week…on Thursday, June 19, this same type of fireball was reported on our local KCBS affliate here in Los Angeles.  Someone had captured it on the phone and sent it in.  This was in Orange county in the evening but instead of 10 fireballs, there were two fireballs which appeared to merge into one fireball.   After about ten minutes the fireballs slowly ""went out"" or dark.  They were still there, I'm sure, but they turned off the lights.   The direc tion they appeared to be going was east towards the San Gabriel mountains.   I have reported this kinda of sighting before on this website about 2 years ago, and at about the same time of year- late June.

I am sending you this video of ""lights"" that were seen over the Orange county  area near Camp Pendelton last Thursday (June 19).  This was televised on our local KCBS station.  If for some reason this link does not work go one their website and click on their video link.    I am sending it because I believe it is directly linked to my sighting on June 21st in Pico Rivera.   Only instead of 2 fireballs (lights) I saw 10.  I did report this on your website.   Strange as this sounds, I have been waiting for them to come back because I reported my ""first"" ufo sighting about 2 years ago on June 29.  Only then it was a huge fireball that ""slowly"" went out until it ""disappeared.""   I had a ""feeling"" they would be ""back"" and about this time of year- late June.  Sure enough, here they are again only more numerous and in other locations.   I did call the local authorities (sheriffs) who told me to call the Air Force and the same KCBS station that had initially reported  the Orange county  lights but they could not do anything because I had no photos or video of it, the same with the local KNBC station.   Again, you had to have video or photos.

On 6/21/14, 4 adults were watching the western horizon to observe an ISS flyby.. (ISS is the International Space Station.) It was visible in our area (Whidbey Island) at 9:49pm for 4 minutes.  It became visible in the WSW at 11 degrees above the horizon and departed at 11 degrees S.  We could see it fly over the Olympics. We were on the west side of Whidbey Island, on a bluff overlooking the water on the south end of the island.  It is about 30 miles from the Naval Air Station. Three objects appeared, consecutively, about a minute or so after we watched the ISS, but they were overhead.   As soon as one disappeared in the southern tree line, another appeared from the north.  The objects were oval shaped.   From below, we didn't see them as 3 dimensional.  They were orange, reddish, almost flame colored with no contrail or flame trail.  Seemed to be like a low flying aircraft.   We fully expected the first one, when noticed, to be a ""search"" helicopter with spotlight.  However, it was shortly followed by a second and then a third object.   All three appeared to have the same overhead trajectory and followed each other at ~30 sec intervals.  Too close to have been the same object circling.   Their flight pattern was straight, with no change in speed or direction.   The eerie part was their silence.  There was no sound detected from any of the objects, which seemed strange, since the slightest noise gets amplified over/around water. The observers were 2 adult males and 2 adult females, ages 66-70.  All with college degrees.  Unfortunately, no photos were taken.",2014-06-27T00:00:00,48.0175,-122.4707

It flew directly overhead and continued towards Fullerton.  The light did not change in intensity as it was coming towards me or when it traveled away from me.  There were no flashing collision lights.  I was standing about one block south of the park.

This sighting was unusual in that there was a police helicopter! traveling with the UFO and at about the same speed.  The helicopter and the brightly lite object were only a few hundred feet apart.  The helicopter was not directly under it, but was slightly west of it.  After both objects passed me and were almost in Fullerton, the helicopter made a 90 degree turn to the east passing under the glowing object.

The object looked to be about the same size as the helicopter, even though it was a little higher than the helicopter.

It may have been an Earth satellite, but I can't imagine why they would put lights on satellites.  It was a distant dim white light flying SE to NW, but was definitely not an airplane whereas I view airplanes frequently in the night sky and am familiar with their lights (most airplanes have white lights on the wings, a red and/or blue light in the front, and a strobe light with a very specific frequency).   I do not think it was a comet because it was moving too fast across the field of vision, in line with the speed of most airplanes and it did not have a tail.  It was not a firefly because it did not flash.  It was not a star, also because it was moving too fast across the field of vision.  I also can rule out the possibility of a meteor, because it was a dim whereas I have seen ""shooting stars"" and they generally are bright white and flash somewhat quickly across the sky.   This light was much dimmer, but still quite visible and moving quite quick! ly AND I was so certain about what I was seeing that I immediately came inside to find out what time it was.  It could have been a satellite, but it seems that satellites should remain stationary above the Earth's surface to serve their purpose for communication, so I would call it a UFO; very specifically an Unidentified Flying Object, because I could not identify it and because it was ""flying,"" but I can not call it a ""craft.""   Personally, I have looked for UFOs as sort of a ""joke"" to myself before because I have believed for some time that extraterrestrial life is quite possible (for 3 or 4 years in earnest).  Since I have become unemployed, I walk frequently on a rural but what I consider to be safe dead end street.  There are few obstructing lights, so I can often see the sky fairly well.  Once or twice last year, I made a game of leaving Tic Tacs on the street ""as a gift"" so that I could return to see if they were still there.  I am a strong believer in evolution and I was an Engineering major for a while during college and had Astronomy in college and retain the textbook for reference.  Because I have a sense of evolution and evolutionary time, especially now that I am mostly absent from the alarm clock world, dinosaurs and ice ages seem to fit for me.  I have read most of the Bible and interpret Genesis and the story of Creation to be not contrary to evolutionary findings, but rather a poetic message from peoples of the past that they had observed that humanity was the most intelligent form of life, and, therefore, LAST on the evolutionary timeline.  As for God, I believe God is not to be argued about, but that does not mean that the writers of the Bible had considered other worlds - although I do know that the Torah mentions other worlds.  Also, I am familiar with the local night sky and can identify Venus, Mars, the Moon phases, and several constellations and am able to connect their movements in the sky with the Earth's movement around the sun.  Basically, unles! s this was a satellite, I think the movement was too regular to have been anything else, although it could have been an Earth aircraft with which I am unfamiliar although it appeared much higher and faster in comparison.",2014-06-20T00:00:00,37.4731,-84.8158

Occasionally, one of the circular lights would disappear as if it was being dimmed out (as if someone was dimming a light in a house).  This event  lasted for what seemed 10-15 minutes.   I was walking into my kitchen to get a drink of water when I noticed two orange lights in the sky through my sliding glass door (leading into my backyard) that overlooks the city I live in. I was facing south while viewing these lights and what made them so interesting to me was they were not moving, completely stationary the entire time the event occurred.  Initially, there were two orange lights and after a couple minutes one would fade out (again, as if being dimmed out).   After about a minute, the light that originally faded out would reappear then the other light would fade out just like the first one did.   The process of one of lights fading out and the other light reappearing happened three times.  Each time the light wou! ld come back it would appear in the same spot that it was in before.  This did not happen simultaneously, when the light would come back the other would stay from anywhere to 5-10 seconds before it would fade away.   What also made this interesting to me was that it occurred near an air force base in my city.  My house is located in a bit of a higher elevation from the rest of the city which gives me a panoramic view of the entire city and is roughly 10 miles from the air force base.  These orange circular lights were not parallel or perpendicular to one another (making me believe they were two separate objects) and one was always sitting a little higher than the other.

I was vacationing in Homer, Alaska, with my family on the night the incident happened.  I guess I’ll give a little context to my story.  My parents, brother and sister-in-law took one of those cruises from Vancouver up the Pacific coast and I flew in from Houston to meet up with them in Anchorage for some sightseeing and fishing.  We spent a couple nights in Talkeetna and Seward before going on to Homer for the last three nights of our trip. 	Anyway, we rented a nice House that sat on a little bluff above the Sterling Hwy on the outskirts coming in to the town of Homer.  It had a great view of the town, bay and mountains around Homer.   At approximately 1 am on July 18, 2012 I was relaxing in the hot tub the house had on its ground level deck when I noticed what was at first very faint lights I thought were satellites.  But quickly I realized that they were not satellites, at least not ones of any conventional variety that I know of because the lights increased and decreased in their luminosity significantly while at the same time executing what almost looked like geometric patterns coupled with darting movements in the same general vicinity of sky. 	I know what satellites look and move like and they sure don’t dart back in forth like these things did.  I know what iridium flares look like as well and I’m almost 100% certain what I saw and photographed was not that.  The lights also seemed to flash in and out in different positions in an instant.  Anyway I continued watching whatever this was for a couple more minutes when the thought finally occurred to me to go in and get my camera to take some pictures so that’s what I did.  It probably took me two or three minutes to towel off a little and run in and get my camera ready.  I took 15 photos between 1:07:09am and 1:10:45am according to the time stamp on the photos.  Some were taken seconds apart and show nothing in the sky and then in the following photos something is streaking across sky. 	The vantage point of the photos was from me on my back laying down on the deck and looking up and to a general southwest direction.  In some of the photos part of the roof of the house is present as are a couple of trees.  I took one photo almost all the way zoomed in and the rest were taken at basically the same zoom.  The only thing I did to the photos is to hit the enhance color button in the iPhoto application on my MacBook Pro but I still have the originals on my digital SD card. 	After I took the photos I took the camera back inside and tried to look at the photos on my little digital screen on the camera but they just looked dark and I didn’t notice that I captured something strange that correlated with what my eyes were seeing until I got back home and pulled them up on my computer.

The moon was on the left side of the vehicle.  Up in the sky, in front of the vehicle, but over toward the left some (colorado river side) we observed an extremely bright ball of light that was brighter than the moon, and about the same approximate size.  It appeared out of nowhere. In an instant, the ball of light dropped vertically downward at super speed, then was ""sucked up"" into what appeared to be clouds.  The clouds were parted in the area the ball of light entered, the clouds surrounding the immediate vicinity of the light were illuminated, there appeared to be no cloud movement.  The ball of light dimmed to where it could no longer be seen. I cant say how far the ball of light vertically dropped, but if you hold a ruler to the sky, it was probably about 5 inches.  The drop lasted 2 seconds.  The suck up and fade out lasted another 2 seconds.

Something that I initially thought was an airplane flew north going right past my house, but it wasn't making any noise and the red lights were a brilliant red and seemed larger than normal.  Within a couple of seconds it reversed direction for about a second or two right in its own path and then reversed again continuing on towards North Las Vegas and perhaps even Nellis Air Force Base.  That got me up and onto a raised cement slab near our fence so I could see better.  I was pretty pumped and shocked at the same time because it was clear right away that this was a UFO.  When you see it in 3D with your own eyes it looks much clearer and way easier to see than any video will show.  My adrenalin was definitely running. Anyway, I was fumbling around, trying to get my camera out of my pocket so I could try to film this thing.  By this time 45 seconds or more before has elapsed before I could start filming.  Being the novice I am, I used the screen on the phone camera to try and keep up with it.  I think that was a mistake because I kept losing the UFO, especially when it would dim in brightness.  I also zoomed in and out too much trying to see it better. I apologize for being so shaky but this might be a once in a lifetime event for me and I wanted proof. So anyway, the video speaks for itself and I welcome any comments or criticisms.  Whatever it was it was amazing!  I see a lot of aircraft living where I live including Air Force One when Obama comes to town but I have never seen something like this putting on a show like it did.  It also had to be moving pretty fast because it was at least 10 miles away and could be close to 20 miles away depending on where it was at times in the video. I also reported this to MUFON, case 55529.  I have already been contacted by the Regional Director (Nevada) for MUFON and told that it is being investigated.

I couldn't convince myself though because the object was way too bright to be a balloon, or a candle inside a plastic bag as my mom suggested wh en I called her and told her what we saw.

The objects were of equal distance from one another and formed a zig-zag line in the sky with the most westerly object being the lowest in the sky and the most easterly object the being highest in the sky. We observed the objects for approximately 5 minutes.  The objects were not flashing but glowing with varying intensity. The highest and most easterly eventually faded and disappeared followed by the next most easterly until all four had disappeared.

It’s the 4th of July, and I was in my backyard watching fireworks from a nearby city. The evening was a very clear sky (no Chem Trails) and a half moon was just rising above the horizon.  The temperature was about 75 degrees and slowly dropping- as it does out in the township.  I happened to glance to the east, seeing a bright light in the sky. At first, I thought it was a firework display.  The object was at least 200 feet above the tree line that is 200 yards away from where I was standing, was fire orange/red, very large, and held a definite course.  The object moved faster than any aircraft I have ever seen as well as being the largest I have ever seen within a short distance to the tree line.  It appeared to be oval, but because of its brightness, I could not discern a distinct shape.  The first object appeared at about 11:00 pm while the neighbors were lighting off small fireworks (like bottle rockets and Roman candles). It seems everyone noticed the craft and all fireworks in the area ceased. The craft came from the west and moved towards the east. My speculation is that is it came from Cleveland towards Pittsburgh. The craft was moving faster than an airplane but slower than a meteor. It appeared to be a huge ball of flame in the sky but had a clear flight path. The object moved out of range in about 2-3 minutes. We called everyone we could; many had seen the same craft. The object made NO sound. About 10 minutes later, the same event occurred again. The flight path was exactly the same, the same height, direction, and duration. I have never seen an object in the sky that was this large, even a blimp would pale in comparison. As it was dark, I cannot provide a good estimate of its size ~ (This object would be about the size of 7 blimps- all fire orange).",2014-07-05T00:00:00,41.1743,-80.5841

It seemed like they slowly flickered out but I'm not sure...maybe they just faded into the distance.  I can't imagine hot air balloons floating in the sky that late at night during a time when people are lighting off big fireworks in the neighborhood.

I thought no that's not a shooting star, then I thought was it a satellite?  no I continued tracking it it was headed in a straight line towards north east.   It got really dim especially cause the light pollution and the smoke from the fireworks but i could still make it out that it was going in a straight line.  What happened that it grew bright again and dimmed, when I continued watching it it continued to go bright and get dimmed, so it would go bright like a star then dim to almost unseen, I even lost it for a bit, but since it continued in a line I could just make out where it should be, but I also noticed that it seems to go farther in the distance.  It just was really weird never seen anything like that. what it did was go bright then dim right away then travel maybe 3 or 4 sec then repeat about 3 times then I lost it then it did it again but lost it cause I guess it either was too far or it flew fast away or just stopped blinking. so at a count of one its bright then one sec dim then 3 or 4 count dimmed. but it was really bright that's why to me it was a UFO cause I never saw anything like that, it was not a plane cause it had one light and it was really small almost invisible when not lit.

Object stationary for 15 seconds then began to rise as it moved slowly Eastward. This object was not an airplane.  It continued to move farther up into the sky and began to fade slowly.  The movement was not consistent with an orbiting satellite nor was it streaking like a meteorite.  The object continued to climb in a linear fashion and faded slowly out until no longer visible.  I was unable to grab my camera in time to take an image.  The speed and movement over the course of watching this object was very peculiar and not familiar.

Our cabin on Orcas Island looks north toward Canada, to the west is Vancouver Island and other smaller BC islands to the northwest.  On June 8th, at approximately 12:30 AM, while talking to my daughter, from the large picture window, I noticed an extremely bright object moving east across the sky.  The night was calm, very quiet, and mostly clear. The moon was waxing gibbous with illumination at approximately 65%. Upon seeing the object, I instinctively ran to the deck for a better look.  My daughter followed and we woke up her beau from his sleep-to-snore fest and he also observed.  Simply stated, we were blown away.  We began to run down every possible scenario of what the object could be and nothing fit.  So in awe, we watched as the massive, brightly shining object moved east across the sky and eventually out of range.  The object was not in the distance, in fact, it flew just above us. It is hard to describe the nature of its shine - imagine Venus, at her brightest dropped to 15,000 ft. and traveled from west to east  across the sky.  It seemed to emit beams (atmospheric illusion?).  The bright shine was so dramatic that that it made it impossible to discern its form but it was not round, if anything, it was oblong.  It did not blink or twinkle and the form, beams and all, did not change as it moved across the sky.  The object was shinning silver tones with golden hues and the ""beams"" appeared to have gold tones as well. As was the night, the object was dead silent - Orcas Island is surrounded by water so that ruled out one convenient explanation.  Also, unusual was that the object did not fly in a continuous straight line, it would also move laterally and also in a squiggly manner. The movements were subtle yet discernible.  The sighting lasted apx. 2 min. and then it flew out of visual range. We work hard, like a beer or two, do fun things and keep it clean.

At approximately 1:45 a.m. on Sunday, June 8, I saw an object go streaking across the sky – extremely fast, much faster than a plane.  Although the trajectory looked like a satellite – very smooth and straight from east/southeast to west – it seemed quite close to the earth and flashed at regular intervals. The flashes were equal in intensity and strobe-like.  The object disappeared between flashes and I was able to track it across the sky from flash to flash.  I saw 4 or 5 flashes in all before it was out of my view. The flashes were white with another color (can't recall exactly what color).  I would say the object was possibly rectangular or cylindrical.  The whole episode lasted maybe 5 seconds to cross my entire field of view.  Fast!  I’ve briefly researched satellites and this sounds like a “tumbling” satellite, but seems that mine was going too fast for that.  Or maybe it was close to Earth and that explains why it seemed to be so fast?  I have seen one satellite in the past, from deep in the Grand Canyon, and that one was much tinier, fainter, steady (not flashing), and took longer to cross the sky.  I am very curious as to what I saw.  Perhaps it was some other sort of satellite?  I don't think it was iridium as the iridium flash description I have read does not match what I saw. About me:  I am a lover of the night sky with little technical knowledge.  I live in the suburb of a large city so it is not often that I am in a dark enough place to really enjoy the stars.  I have witnessed two meteor fireballs in my lifetime (one in the Grand Canyon), many asteroids, and one satellite.  At heart I am a scientist and just wish I knew what that was.

It was about 9PM in Los Angeles, I was walking to my car up the street to get something out of it, and I looked up in the west-southwest direction and saw what looked like a star, except I could see that it was glinting or glimmering, and very obviously turning blue and red. I live under a flight path, so I've seen a lot of airplanes above my house and coming in from the distance, but this looked much higher and farther away than they usually are.  I then thought it might be a police helicopter, because of the presence of red and blue lights and the fact that it wasn't moving, but again, it was so high and so far away,  I've never seen a helicopter that high up before.  If it was a police helicopter, it was extremely high and definitely over the ocean. I continued to watch from my apartment balcony for approximately 45 minutes. The only movement from the light was that it very, very slowly traveled down toward the horizon.  I only noticed this movement because I could tell that it was in a different position relative to the top of an electric pole than when I first started watching it.  This is also how I could tell that it wasn't a star, because none of the other stars in the sky had moved that much since I had begun watching. I filmed it on my small digital camera that I have. It's very poor quality, but you can plainly see that the object is flashing red and blue (and maybe other colors too).  I notice that you don't have an option to send video, so I've uploaded my poor quality video here:  http://youtu.be/haWsy8exV24  (I removed audio because I was on the phone while filming). Again, it was glimmering or glinting as well as flashing red and blue, sort of from one side of the object to the other, while maintaining a consistent bright white light as well. I want to say that I saw it slightly wiggle around or move slightly in its immediate area, but that could have been my eyes playing tricks on me. I watched it until it went behind the hill that was blocking my view, and I'm not sure how much longer it was there for after that.

While in the kitchen tidying up, I heard a loud strange aircraft sound.  The sound had a pulsing nature that is different from normal aircraft engine sounds.  The loud sound had a steady rumble sound pulsed with a wooooOOO  wooooOOO wooooOOO sound.  I went out in the backyard but couldn’t see anything due to the trees, so I quickly went to the front yard, and then to the end of the driveway. Looking straight up, I saw 5 white strobe lights almost at zenith.  The lights were in a line formation pointing toward the southwest from directly overhead.  The strobes were synchronized so that they flashed in the direction of travel for the group.  The last strobe in the line would flash, followed by the one in front of it, then the one I front of it, etc.  The light were in almost a straight line. I called to my bride to bring me a cell phone so I could take a video, but when she came out, she had called 911 and was talking to the operator.  So unfortunately, no photo or videos were taken. I am not sure how well the cell phone would work on this type of situation, with small flashes in a dark sky. I watched the group travel to the south west, for about 6 minutes, until we lost sight of them low in the southwest near the horizon.  The pulsing sound continued but faded as the group traveled further away.  The linear formation broke down as the group got near the horizon.  The group traveled at a constant rate of speed.  I estimated they were about 3000 feet off the ground.  The sky had high clouds and was hazy.  There was a sky glow due to the surrounding urban setting, but no moon. Due to the sound, these craft could not be helicopters.  I have heard various helicopters from the large military two rotor machines to the very small traffic helicopters, and they all have the characteristic chopping sound.  The pulsing sound is not characteristic of either prop or jet aircraft.  There was no connecting structure between the lights.

I came to a red light on Miltary Highway and Shary Road.  I saw something flash in the sky and at first I thought it could be a rain storm with some lightening.  But there were few clouds in the sky.  I continued to look up and saw two triangular objects that had a haze around them.  They were both flying in the sky back and forth within a small area.  No rhyme or reason to the movement.  One seemed to be following the other.  I watched for about five minutes.  Sometimes it looked like the haze was a soft green.  Other times just a white foggy color. I went to the gas station to pick up donuts.  I got back in my truck and as I was pulling out again I thought this is just TOO strange.  I looked up again and they were still there. I decided to pull out my phone and take a picture.  They were moving so fast and I didn’t think I was getting any pictures, so I kept deleting them.  I realized I needed to be at my location so I snapped a few more photos and left.  The house I was going to is not even a mile away.  When I got out of my truck, I tried to take a few more pictures and then went inside.  I explained to my friend and her 15 year old son what I had seen and asked them to come outside with me to see if it was my imagination or if they could also see it.  They came outside and could clearly see what I was seeing.  We watched for a few minutes and then went inside.  We went back out a few minutes later and they were gone. When we went back inside I mentioned that I tried to take photos and the boy, suggested I look at my phone again.  So I did.  The screen is dark and you can barely see little dots of light.  When you enlarged it you could see much more.  So we scrolled through the few pictures I took and each one looks so different from the other.  Even the little spots of light you can see without enlarging does not resemble what I was looking at with the naked eye nor does the enlarged pictures.  When I try to text it or email it doesn’t come through that well at all.  Also if I go in a dark room and enlarge the pictures it’s even more vivid.  The pictures I will email to you are ones I have enlarged on my screen and photo saved. This is so strange to me, I have never seen anything similar to this and I am very perplexed.",2014-05-08T00:00:00,26.201304838709678,-98.35492580645162

I was already looking upward, however out of my peripheral vision, I saw a triangular craft, with red and blue lights at each point of the triangle flashing wildly, that literally went from one side of the sky to the other, blocking out the stars behind the triangle as it moved across the sky.  No sound what so ever, and it appeared to cross the sky in about 3 to 5 seconds.  It was unbelievable.  This area has no lights to speak of, other than the occasional truck passing over the mountain, so it is a wonderful area just see God's creation.  I have a college degree from Charleston Southern University, 1980, and spent many years in upper level management, managing service contracts throughout the Pacific Rim, but specifically in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.  I do not know the other truckers as we just refer to each other as drivers, but we all threesaw this is triangular shape craft.  After it passed over who is somewhat looked at one another in disbelief.  One of the other truckers stated that he was not going to say anything to anybody for fear of ridicule.   So I am really putting myself out here by generating this report to you Peter.  I am a nightly coast to coast listener and have been listening since the Art Bell days.   We appreciate what you do out there Peter.   Keep up the good work.",2014-04-24T00:00:00,,

Once the object was about 35 degrees from the horizon, it slowed very rapidly and stopped completely.  It then started to dim at a more rapid pace as if it was moving away and then suddenly disappeared.

It was very unusual making no sound. All of them came from the northeast and moved to the south/southwest (the opposite direction of our current weather pattern.  Additionally, they would have been moving too fast to be floating.  They were more the speed of a fast aircraft on a calm evening. We had plenty of time due to the number that kept coming to record videos and take a few photos.  Additionally, we were able to observe through binoculars.  I’ve spent considerable time through my life star gazing and have never seen anything like this. I did call 911 to report.

I was outside trying to push start my motorcycle(dead battery) when I noticed a bright light, flying overhead in a straight path. What hit me at first was how bright it was.   Then it changed color from yellow/orange to bright red, then back to yellow/orange.  It would take the light about 5 seconds to gradually change from one color to the other.  Then holding that color for 3 seconds before gradually turning back.  The brightness would kind of pulse on right before it went solid color.   It looked to be a single light source that changed colors.  Not two different lights that faded in and out and definitely not a spinning light. When it was solid red it was a very bright red, almost cherry like or fire engine red.  The light quality reminded me of super bright LEDs.  The light had a sort of uniform glow to it in all directions.   There were no other accompanying or secondary lights on what ever it was. I tried to listen for engine noise but I could hear nothing over traffic down the street.  I would have got my phone but I figured by the time I ran in and got it, it would be out of view.   I kept waiting for it to do something UFO like. Like change direction or take off suddenly but it kept flying in a straight line.  It was pretty high up, about where you'd expect to see air traffic.  But all you could see was this ball of pulsating light.   It could have very well been a plane.  But I've never seen lights like that on anything. When it past, it still had the same uniform glow as if the light was being emitted in all directions.

On the evening of April 26th, 2014 three families were gathered socializing with our kids.  A friend of my 12 year old came to the door and asked that we go outside so she would know she was not crazy.  We then observed what she had been witnessing for the previous 10 minutes or so.  From the horizon north of us heading south/southwest a bright light red/orange/white (changing) would move silently across the sky directly above us and then somewhere between 90-120 degrees across would blink out and disappear.  As one was overhead, the next would come from the horizon.  The 13 year old girl did say that she witnessed two come at once with one blinking out before the other.  The rest of us saw one at a time.  There were 20 of us in the yard the witnessed the last 4.  I was able to video record with my Droid Razor Maxx three of them.  Links to the YouTube posting are provided.  Keep in mind that in the recordings I opted to stay zoomed in at all times other than! the beginning of one that shows one initially coming over the horizon starting spot over our house before I zoomed. Because I was zoomed in you it shakes (remember the flight path was direct and smooth) and you cannot see how quickly they came one at a time across the sky. I hoped by staying zoomed in there might be a moment something of importance might be caught.  My phone was zoomed in at 4x. Just as the last one was gone, I called 911 to report.  They had no knowledge of the event and did not call me back.  I called Wright Patterson Airforce Base, roughly 60 miles north, and they said they had no activity or drills going on that night.  Below is a weather report confirming what I perceived.  We had gentle winds from the west, not the northeast, and clear skys.  I am a professional in the finance industry.

The second I turned, and began to walk down the street, (was walking east), I saw a large fire orange colored object, it basically looked like a giant fireball, or a miniature sun, but was slightly off from a perfect sphere.   I knew immediately it wasn't a plane, a star, or a planet, because of its size and distinct orange hue.  It was about the size of a marble.  I couldn't tell exactly how far away it was, but it appeared to be inside the atmosphere at least, not in space.  It was moving very very slowly, straight down.   I did manage to capture about a minute and a half of it, but on my cellphone the quality isn't great.   I thought it might had been a missile of some sort at the time so I was kind of panicked, and since it was moving down, my camera is shaky for some of the footage because I am walking, so I don't lose sight of it.   The sky wasn't even fully dark at the time so you can tell even in this bad footage that this object shouldn't be there, its just too bright, even on my cellphone camera.   At the end of the footage you can see it begin to blink, it did this several times before shrinking into a much much smaller, yellow sphere.   It still followed its path straight down, until it passed the tree and building line, and I lost sight of it. I wish I had better footage, or more information, but...   That's all I've got.  Oh I also forgot to add the object was dead silent.  Shortly after the event, I saw multiple unmarked planes fly in that direction, not all together, but one at a time, about every 30 seconds to a minute apart.",2014-06-13T00:00:00,33.56413757440476,-111.9050830357143

I pulled out my phone and was able to take a video of the object.  It was a cloudy night, so I saw it move across the sky then I was able to see it in front of a group of clouds.

About 10 minutes after that I saw what appeared to be a military aircraft coming from the direction of where we saw the sphere heading.

Two objects that looked like they were on fire were moving toward my location (south to north) in the sky.   The front one was the larger of the two and looked segmented - a bit like a large and a small ""orb"" joined together, and the second was quite a bit smaller and was a single orb.  The front one had a red and orange glow like fireplace embers, although it was a constant glow and didn't change.  I believe the second one was more orange.   I yelled into the house for my wife and son to ""come see this – quick""!!  Within 15 or 20 seconds my wife came out the door and saw them, and said something about ""fire"".  My son's girlfriend came out and saw part of the show, but I'm not sure how much.  My son came out only after it was all over.   The front orb proceeded at a relatively low altitude straight over my house and went out of range still fully visible.  I realized afterwards that I never heard a sound of any sort emanating from it.   The second one suddenly ""blinked out.""  The way it disappeared caused the wife to say that maybe it had gone into the clouds (it was totally overcast and there was a low ceiling).   Then she said ""look - there's another.""  And I looked back to the location of the first sighting, and there were now three of the smaller orbs coming toward us on the same path.   However, one after the other they ""blinked out"" just like the initial small orb had done.  All in all the show may have lasted 5 minutes or a bit more.

Went outside in the back yard to let our dog out one more time for the night.  Dog started barking and running towards fence.   Looked toward eastern sky and initially saw an extremly very bright orange, steady, spherical shaped light moving steadily from the south headed north-northeast and then immediately noticed a second, third and fourth identical bright orange light all moving above the back lot tree line.   Sky was clear with good visibility.  These objects were spaced apart fairly evenly in a horizontal trail configuration.  Objects were moving fairly slowly.  Estimate possibly ¼ mile between each light.  Hard to determine distance from myself, but possibly within one mile.  Altitude was medium, possibly 5,000', but difficult to determine due to lack of perspective or sky contrast.   All four objects were identical and displayed no navigation lights, position lights, anti-collision lights, wing lights, or landing lights that are standard aircraft lighting.   There was absolutely no sound associated with these objects prior, during or after their passage.  I looked around the nearby houses to see if anyone was outside seeing what I was witnessing, but saw no one else.   After observing for maybe 15-20 seconds, I ran inside to grab binoculars.  Returning to the back yard, I was able to observe the fourth object for about 10 seconds before it moved out of sight beyond the tree line.   Through the binoculars I observed a very bright, clear orange glowing light and I could faintly make out a dark angular object associated with the light.   These were not military fighter aircraft afterburners either.  I live in the vicinity of an F-22 US Air Force Base and these were not F-22s or any other fighter aircraft.  There is also a nearby US Army base with helicopters.  These were definitely not helicopters of any type either.  I'm a retired US Air Force pilot and I know what aircraft look like at night and am very familiar with the sights and! sounds of local aircraft at night.  In fact, as I viewed the fourth object, an MD-80 type commercial airliner flew over my house from front to back (from west to east) at low altitude in the direction of the four orange lights.  I believe the airliner was entering the traffic pattern at the local airport preparing to land.  The lights and sound of this aircraft provided an excellent contrast with the four objects that I'd just observed.",2014-05-08T00:00:00,37.15589761904762,-76.46353809523809

I am an Air Traffic Control Specialist with the Federal Aviation Administration at the Roanoke Regional Airport and also a veteran who served in the US Navy.  I saw three bright fiery orange lights from the northwest direction of my home; the objects appeared to be equal in size and traveling together in a triangular formation.   The surface wind was mostly calm possibly variable less than three knots, and sky conditions were clear.   The objects were approximately 3 to 4 times the size of the brightest star in view.  Each light appeared to belong to a specific object and they seemed to move independently from one another, but in the same fashion remaining in a close proximity to one another in which reminded me of military aircraft in a formation flight.  The light from each object was a constant; it didn’t pulse or st! robe of any sort.  It didn’t change in color or appearance.   The objects didn’t seem to make any sound.  The town was mostly quiet and I did not hear any aircraft engines, or rotary noises.   The objects appeared to be moving southeast direction when I first saw them and were approaching the town of Iron Gate.  The objects appeared to have lateral and vertical control like an aircraft.  The spacing between each object varied and they appeared to not travel in a straight line.   As the objects approached the west side of Iron Gate they turned toward the southwest one at a time and seemed to climb in altitude above the mountainous terrain west of the town.   As to the speed of the objects, the only relation I can use is that of aircraft in the vicinity of an airport being tracked by air traffic radar.   I speculate the objects at the time I witnessed appeared to be traveling less than +/- 150 knots.  As the objects turned southwest, I lost visual contact due to terrain.",2014-05-08T00:00:00,,

We were standing against a railing, looking East out over the ocean when we observed a luminous object, 2 to 3 times the diameter of any of the few visible stars… the object did not appear to have any motion or direction, was at an estimated 35 degrees above the horizon and a fairly luminous yellow color.  The object “turned off” for about 20 seconds then back “on” for a few seconds. This process repeated itself over a 10 minute period or so…… after that time it or a similar object appeared to the south west…using the Easter position as 12 o’clock, the newer object was now at about 1:30…. It also turned on and of during a few minutes period of time. At about 21:15 we both observed that the light reappeared near its original location but to our surprise a second light now came on to the left side of the first, slightly lower the it and then a third and so on until seven luminous objects were present in a straight line. The line descended downward from right to left at about a 10 degree angle with the spacing between objects equal to 4 or 5 diameters of a single object.  The lights “came on” at about one second intervals and as the third object illuminated we both began counting aloud, fascinated by what we were observing.  After observing the group of lighted objects for about 5 to 7 seconds, I turned and asked a couple sitting on one of the boardwalk benches behind us to turn around and verify our observations….  By the  time I was able to explain my request most of the objects were “off” but did come back ”on” individually.  The objects continued to cycle on and off for about 30 more seconds. We continued our observations for an additional 10 minutes or so but all the object had gone “out,” and remained so. We observed no motion of any kind by the objects, no smoke trails as may be observed with flares, no sound… they appeared to be several miles distant but I had no means of determining that. For the record I complete one of these reports on the 19 of June for our observations on the 18 of June in Myrtle Beach SC…",2014-06-27T00:00:00,33.68315,-78.93953909574468

Three or four of them were very close to each other and almost touched at times but most were separated by at least two to five or 10 degrees.

While sitting in the backyard of my home on May 3, 2014 at 10:00 pm, I observed a bright red ball travel over the Las Vegas Valley area that was very odd.  I have been watching the sky's for some time hoping to see something unexplained like this. After watching aircraft come and go from this busy region, this object stood out because it was a solid red light that never blinked.  No other lights were on the craft.  This object flew a straight path from southwest to northwest, leaving sight after 10 to 15 seconds. I was prepared with a new pair of 7x35 binoculars and was able to view the craft well.  The object was bright red and had a halo effect around it, however this may have been an anomaly because it seemed to be ascending slightly as it traveled northeast out of the valley through a low thin cloud cover. The altitude of this craft appeared to be  2000 to 3000 feet.  It made no sound and appeared that the red glow was at the rear of the object and it would shift and from side to side.   Every craft I see here has solid lights and blinking lights.  I can see in great detail with binoculars even at night.  It left no exhaust trail and was certainly something very different than aircraft.  No wing outlines and it resembled a spherical shape of glowing bright red. Though the craft flew straight, suggesting a fast moving plane, it's behavior was not of any plane I have watched.  A rocket, weather balloon, meteor or helicopter would not act like this object. I was happy to finally see something unexplained in our sky's after months of trying.   We live near Area 51 and a large airforce base.  I suspect they had something to do with the object, which was very unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.

I thought it was just another car traveling because the two bright lights moved fluently and very smoothly much like a car with its brights on over the hills.

The bright lights continued from west to east, fluently, over the trees and then made a right turn.  This turn  i would guess to be a 45 degree turn,  which allowed me to see two sides forming a v-shape.  It was moving at a steady rate of traffic so I would guess it was flying 45 to 50 mph. I turned the corner, heading north on Jamestown, as the UFO was directly past.  I turned the corner and decided to follow.   I was able to keep my eyes on it the entire time as I headed North on Harvard.  I immediately turned left.

I should have been reporting my experiences for the last 32 years.  2 years ago I had an extreme close flyby of a blue lightly glowing ball as big as my cab.  It darted across the highway in front of me and paralleled me on my right side and slowed down as it did. I have more questions and somewhat angry feelings with that one.  Primarily because I could have ditched my rig when it crossed in front of me.  Out of fear. Reckless ""ufo"". Sorry.  Tonight's encounter started as a ball of red light in the distance that did not move for a bit. I'm approaching it at a few miles away..  So I'll just stay with what I saw and try my best to stay focused for you.   When it started coming more toward me eastbound along the highway it morphed to a green/blue.  No blinking lights at all.  It changed to a low lit white and then back to red.   There was confusion in the cab with my gf and the iPhone and me not wanting to take my eyes off of it so nothing of worth was captured except us talking and I can't tell if the light in the video was the tower or not so..   I stopped the truck on the shoulder and this thing stopped moving too.  It was on my left near a tower with red lights and you couldn't tell the difference between the two.   More confusion in the truck and I was not responsive enough to obey the gf to simply take the phone and film.   It then changed to that Christmas green and it was a strange light.  Not a spotlight or incandescent type light. It was as if me eyeball was staring into a laser.  Best way to describe it.   It was a dancing brilliant blob if light and the way it shifted from red to green was odd.  Hard to describe.  Not like what I would see with a helicopter or plane.  After it changed green it started moving again eastbound following the highway.   No one was stopping to look at this thing!  It went low lit white real quickly after starting to move and by the time I stuck the phone out the window it was way behind me.  And just kept going.   I want to believe it stopped because I stopped.  But I have the gf who witnessed most of this but I don't think she was intent on really focussing on what was happening as I was.   The color morph was crazy beautiful.   One more thing, two really...  When it stopped i personally think it was mimicking the tower because of the sudden volume of traffic.   I also think it was doing a piss poor job of mimicking police helicopter lights.  I see them all the time here.  Not police helicopter lights.   It was some kind of later like project ion in a blob form.  Like laser light in a semi incandescent form.",2014-04-24T00:00:00,40.307082581453635,-76.8305888471178

They were flying next to each other so immediately I thought they were military aircraft in a training exercise.  They seemed to be coming toward me, but after second thought I think they were going up.  They started moving away from each other, and then one disappeared, followed by the other disappearing about twenty seconds later. Then, from the horizon, a similar light went up and disappeared, this time by itself. Next, two more lights came from the horizon, just like in the first description, and disappeared after parting ways. The sky was a bit cloudy but not enough to block out stars, etc.  I'm sure it wasn't a commercial aircraft because I saw commercial aircraft flying when I saw the lights.  Very interesting sighting; never seen anything like it before.  I was thinking maybe it was a missile but I've seen those too and they were moving too slowly to be missiles.

The lights were orange and diamond or bird-shaped (the chevron shape a child would draw a bird.)  The first pair we saw sort of chased each other and wiggled a lot, enough to make me think it might have been some space junk falling.  But it went fast and straight into the distance.   Then there was a v formation of five or six going in the same direction on the same path about five minutes later.  Then a lone one.  Then another pair  went by side by side.   And then ten or twenty minutes later they flew back from the direction they had gone in a bigger v formation, they were not going the same way they had come more of 90 degree angle from some farther away point.   We were star gazing on a roof when we spotted these.  They were silent and moved about as fast as I've seen fighter jets go (Wich theses may have been?)  They were silent though. No physics defying movements.  The formations were not perfect.  It was really clear out.  The lights seemed like they may have been heading for the bellingham airport, but they were very low and we saw no planes or plane lights or shapes connected to the moving lights.   The lights did not leave trails. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she corrected the time of the sighting.  She reports that it occurred at some time, she estimates, between 10:00 p.m. and midnight on Sunday night, April 27, 2014.

The lights crossed from left to right towards the north west. The final large V formation appeared from right to left many minutes later heading east.. These lights did not move directly above us as the first ones had but were towards the northern horizon and we sat up and looked behind us to watch it go.  I would compare the path of their first trajectory to the trajectory of the final V as a 45 degree angle.  The lights disappeared into the horizon before returning as he final V came into sight.  The sighting took place on railroad avenue from the roof. ((END ADDENDUM))",2014-05-02T00:00:00,48.74688634868421,-122.44462006578947

The two lights were spread apart about the width of a passenger jet wing span.  There were no other visible lights on the aircraft.  When it was directly above me it sounded like a jet but it was very quiet (especially since it was so low).  My wife was in the bedroom and heard nothing.  I was on the phone explaining what I saw and to my niece and she said that she heard it.  When it was directly above me I looked up at the bottom.  It appeared to be whitish color with no markings. It was much wider than a underbelly of a plane.  My original thought was that it was some sort of military transport flying low to avoid radar.  Then I realized that there were no other light on it.  The two lights looked to be giant spot lights and they seemed to move as if it were searching for something.  I cannot explain what it was.  Once it went over the house I ran to the other side of the house to look out a window and it was nowhere to be seen.  I then rushed outside to look but it was gone.  Addendum:  The size of the aircraft approximately 20 moons across from light to light.  The size of the bottom appeared to be about three of my fist on my out stretched arm. It was moving south to north and made a slight oblique move to the west.  The sighting was just east of Oakley. The craft flew over the Shiawassee river towards me.

The first was two years ago (a white orb) between June 6-9, 2012, and just yesterday June 10th, 2014, at 23:00 hours; approximately a year and a day later, which I find to be significant in itself. Mostly cloudless night, upper atmosphere clouds scarce.  Red light gradually appeared out of no where around 160 degrees SW.

Red light then reappeared at about 125 degrees SW a bit lower on the horizon and disappeared in the same fashion as before.

I knew for about a year or so I was going to see one soon and was watching the sky intently.  Later that night I asked my friend if we should report it.  Him and his brother said the next time I can report it. I replied to them both by saying, I don't know,  I have been waiting my whole life to see one; it's kind of a once and a lifetime experience.  My friend said no maybe in a couple of years and it became clear to me he knew this to be a future factual happening which it has now turned out to be.  There is more to this story; a big piece.
