We had been dating for about one year. I was 18 and he was 17.  He was coming out to my parents farm (2+ Mi. from town)to see me at around 9p.m..  He was driving a small Bridgestone motorcycle and was less than 1 mile out from town (where he lived, and almost to the Burlington Northern RR tracks when he sensed something above him. He looked up and a round craft was directly over him at around 100 ft. in the air.  It was not very large in size, completely circular, and had green lights, red lights and some yellowish lights on the bottom.  There seemed to be some sort of lines in the bottom, like spokes in a wheel look.  It was making a low humming sound that resonated. It was almost pitch dark so he couldn't see the color of the craft. He immediately tried to accelerate the bike to get away from it because he was absolutely terrified and realized that he was staying in one place in the road, even though the bike was still running and it seemed that the tires were still moving.  He had driven that road so many times throughout his life and knew every bump in it.  He realized later that during this initial few seconds that if he were still driving fast like he had been before seeing the craft he would have already been past the RR tracks. He remembered cranking the accelerater real hard and the bike didn't speed up.Then he doesn't remember anything AT ALL until suddenly he was back on his bike in almost the same spot, with the bike moving, only he was going real slow, like 25mph, instead of 65mph from before.  He proceeded to come to see me and never mentioned a thing to me or anyone else. From my vantage point, I was waiting at the farm and watching the clock, excited to see him and couldn't figure out why he was late.  He had called me right before he left town and should have been to my place in 5 minutes.  Instead he arrived in about 25-30 minutes later.  I asked him what took him so long and he acted really weird. I noticed that he looked pale and was quiet all nite.  In fact I noticed a change in his personality from then on but kept it to myself. Then, about a month or so after that when we were out on a date, we talked about going and parking at a radio tower near town where all our friends went (lover's lane kinda spot).  We had been there before.  So we went there and were sitting for a few minutes when he freaked our and said he had to leave the spot, then proceeded to tell me what had happened with the UFO. Before that he had made fun of me because I believed they existed. I know this isn't my story to tell. I also know that the experience impacted my life almost as much as his and I feel it is important to tell you about it. I don't remember the date or time, but gave a guess. I was and still am amazed at how terrified he was and remained so for many years. We are no longer married and as far as I know he refuses to talk about it. I think he pushed it out of his conscious mind. At the time, though, I told several friends and family members and he talked about it a couple of times to them, also.

Driving from Dallas to Huston, the guitar player in my band, and I came upon a lot of cars parked along the highway. This was about two hours out of Dallas. Thinking there had been an accident, we pulled off the road and next to the first car on the right side of the highway. I leaned out the window and asked a guy standing there next to his car what had happened. He simply said, ""Well look!"" My guitarist was driving, he pulled in a little more and stopped the engine and we both got out and looked up. There were three very bright lights at equal distance from each other, in a triangular formation slowly circling around a common center. These lights were about as bright as a very bright star, not Venus type bright by any means, never the less very noticable amongst the reat of the stars. I asked the guy standing there how long he had been watching this, he said, about 20 minutes or so, but some of the people here had been watching for more than an hour! I looked around for a moment and realised that there were alot of people there, and many cars on both sides of the highway. It was hard to keep my eyes from the sky, and I didn't really try to estimate the size of the crowd at the time. There was very little talking, most of it was in hushed voices when at all. After a few minutes a very small light came out of one of the larger ones and zoomed across the sky to the horizon, at such an amazing speed that it was incomprehensible. The guy next to us said the only other words he ever said to us then, ""There's been a lot of those."" Maybe 4 or 5 minutes later the little light came back from another direction. After that several more from various directions. They would just appear on the horizon and zoom back to the main lights and sort of merge with one or the other. The whole time the triangular set is turning 'round and 'round in the same spot. When the small lights would appear there was murmuring from the crowd, everyone seemed rather giddy--I know I was, I kept saying ""wow"", I don't know if it was out loud or not, but it was very exciting, simply amazing. It may have been as many as forty minutes that we stood and watched this, until finally, little lights began coming from every direction of the horizon. I didn't try to count them, I was simply in awe, but there were many, maybe 20, maybe as many as a hundred. They were all moving so fast, impossibly fast, taking maybe as little as 7 seconds from horizon to the main lights. After all of th small lights had converged with the big three, these merged tog! ether into one huge light, now at least as bright as Venus, and it simply went Up and away; like a shot into space. the crowd actually cheered like at a ball game or something! I did to, it was just spontanious, so exciting. I wish this could get posted somewhere, there were so many people out there that night, and I'm sure none of them would ever forget it. Maybe some would read this and write in and tell about it too.",,,

As I was looking up at the tree, facing the opposite direction from the others who were still walking along, I saw an object come over the treeline in the distance, some 1/2 mile away. It moved rapidly and silently over the field and was gone in an instant. I yelled at the others and asked them if they saw it also, and they said saw what, we didn't hear anything? That was when I realized that I had not heard any sound either. It was like two silver pie pans with no lip inverted upon each other. It was wobbling side to side as it passed,and could not have been more than a few hundred feet up, depending on the size which I would estimate from the tree it went over to be between 30-40 feet in diameter. We had large planes from Fort Campbell fly over occasionally, they seemed to turn west off our barn roof after we had painted it with silver aluminum paint.

There where lots of them (don't know how many) everywhere. All of us just stood there watching. It was as thought they were giving us a 4 of July show. I really believe they where.  It's funny that this happened, because my husband didn't believe in UFO'S and use to laugh at me because I told him I had seen one before. Well he believes now!  The first time was about 3 years before.   Both sightings were so high they just looked like stars. My old boy friend and I decide we were going to go watch for UFO's one night. We we saw them! The first one I ever saw they were flying paralell to eachother going East. They were doing barrel rolls in the sky.... It was fantastic looking. Then both stopped. One left a star then they both went opposite directions, one North and one South.......fast!! Well that was my first time.  Anyway just always wanted to tell my story to someone. Are there groups that just go out looking for UFO""S to see at night? Just curious..((name deleted))..in .oklahoma",2004-06-04T00:00:00,35.4345,-95.8932

After the initial attack into Az Zubayr (near Basra) my Regiment re-assembled for the movement to Nasariya, about 22 March (the war was very chaotic and I did not keep a journal as things were so hectic). We formed along the highway and started movement well after dark, 2100 or so. As an armored vehicle commander (AAV) my duties had me in the turret searching for threats/targets as we proceeded along the highway at about 20 mph. I had a pair of NVG's (night vision goggles) to aid my night vision and needless to say my crew and I were very alert and nervous/excited with the start of combat a few days earlier. I soon started to notice pulses of dull orange light in the night sky which could be seen with the naked eye. They would trace an arc and pulse in intensity like a flare but would give off very little light (unlike an illumination flare) and the really curious thing was that when observed through NVG's they still gave off very little light. NVG's amplify natural and infra red light very intensly and I could not understand what it might be. My crew saw these lights as well and we agreed none of us had ever seen anything like it in training (new weapon?... if so, whose?) I called it over the net (radio) to the command vehicle and they acknowledged they could see them as well and did not know what they were. These continued one after another all night and seemed to be close aboard. The obvious reaction was that they were some form of illumination being used by the Iraqi's but I should mention that the surrounding area was desolate arid desert with little place to hide and hardly any terrain features for miles. We encountered no resistance whatsoever during the movement, and so no enemy to explain the source. There was no sound that could be heard though the engine noise would have made that difficult. What I found to be really curious was that nobody seemed to care though it obviously! implied some sort of weapon or device was being used and it was not ours. The airspace over the Marine advance was tightly controlled to avoid friendly fire and we saw plenty of helicopters to know the difference. These were to be seen on later nights as well during our push on Baghdad and it got so that we stopped reporting it at all as we would any enemy contact. I never got an explanation though the Regimental Staff was part of my column and all the officers I asked could not explain it either. Again, these lights would move in  slow shallow arcs like small orange balls that would glow brighter then dull and then brighter again. These would pulse maybe 5 or 10 times then disappear and soon another would be seen in a different direction. These were noticed with the naked eye and did not look any different with night vision goggles (?). They were seen only up in the air and did not seem to fall to earth and seemed relativly close by. I should also mention that we were all obviously sober and awake and very alert. On that first night in particular they were seen during most of the movement, 8 to 10 hours along 150 miles of desert highway. The night sky seemed clear enough to make out the stars some of the time but not a lot of moonlight to aid night vision. There was no noticeable effect or purpose to these lights to explain them.

It was around 6:00 P.M., and me and my girlfriend at the time were sitting out on the porch of a third floor tenement, these type of apartments are common in the Providence, RI, area. I was facing towards the east, at a distance of about 2 miles from the ocean.  I noticed three bright lighting groups out in the distance of about 1/4 of a mile or so to the left of where I was sitting, At first I thought that it could be airplanes, but the objects just stood still, so I knew right away that they were not airplanes.  Being that they were motionless caught my attention a little, but at that time I thought that they were just helicoptors. The lights being unusually bright, as well as not moving, kept me looking at them just out of curiosity, just wondering what they were doing there in a group like that, it was just unusual and something to look at while we were sitting there on the porch.  Then the lights seperated in different directions, and one of them was heading straight towards us. By now I was standing up and looking hard at this bright object coming at us, needless to say I was now at a more heightened state of curiosity than before, however, for a brief moment I still thought that it could be just a helicoptor, but being that I was on a third floor apartment which is about tree level high, making the object eye level to us, and due to the fact that the object was not very far away at this time, and making no noise, got me staring very intently at this thing coming right at us, by now I knew that it could not be a helicoptor, but I was saying what the hell could it be?  I kept watching as the object approached, (moving very slowly I might add), until it was right in front of us, at a distance of no more than 30 feet, yes, VERY CLOSE to say the least. The object passed right in front of us completly at EYE LEVEL, making NO MISTAKE about what it was that we were seeing.  It was diamond shaped with a bright white light in the front, a bright red light on the side, and another bright white light in the back. (I never did get to see the opposite side but I assume that it was the same as the side that I could see).  It made absolutely NO SOUND whatsoever, and being THAT CLOSE I was amazed. I honestly started to wave at the object in a welcoming gesture completely unafraid for some reason, hoping that I would get some sort of response from the operators of the flying diamond, however I got no type of recognition that I could see, I was disappointed at that. The object just kept on moving ever so slowly until it just went to a distance of about 1/2 of a mile or so and then just disappeared.  I have only told a couple of people about the sighting, and one response was that I was seeing a stealth bomber, can you imagine not hearing a stealth bomber at 30 feet away? and not recognizing it? one would have to be blind and an absolute idiot!  Also I was told that I saw a helicoptor, same reasoning, I said to the people that I mistakingly told, ""did you not hear what I said that I was only 30 or so feet away from it?"" (now I tell no one, this is the only outlet that I have used in many years, keeping this information in is hard)  Since that time I have seen two more sightings, but none as dramatic as that one because of the amount of time that the incident took (around 30 minutes), and also the distance that I was to the sighting, making it as sure as I am about anything that I can see.  I am glad to have this chance to get this off my chest, for it is not healthy to keep something like this in, but one cannot talk openly about this type of thing without people saying some stupid remark, so I just keep it to myself.

I lay down on a low brick wall which afforded a perfect place to lie back and look up from. It was a very clear night and the stars were easily visible all the way to about 30 degrees above the horizon where the sky became more orange as in dusk. (With a little light pollution thrown in from nearby street lights but certainly not enough to obscure our vision from where we were) I was just lieing back when almost immediately I saw a small oval, like a straight  small bean, red object (uniform brightness,red in colour) travelling fast directly above and behind my head.I had to twist as i jumped up to keep it in sight and i quickly saw that it was travelling very quickly!. if it was as far up as it appeared to be, as in almost like a satellite, it was obviously way too fast. I had seen satelites and recognised loads of them as a youngster then and many since, but never have i seen any travelling this fast. Likewise I had observed loads of aircraft at night and during the day due to the fact I took a keen interest in old WW2 aircraft and jets etc so I knew their behaviour fairly well. This was travelling at a speed which would suggest an aircraft which was a lot lower, yet it appeared to be very high and there was no sound. Luckily I was able to grab my friend and direct his view to the object, with a pointed finger, as it continued to streak accross the sky in a straight line. Then Just as he said 'Yes' to my 'there! can you see it?' question (by this time the object was almost into the orangey part of the sky and i thought my friend would miss it) it suddenly zipped left, right, diagonal up down etc (it was so quick we barely managed to maintain a view on it so i cannot accurateley describe its movements from memory). We both at the exact same time swore in amazement and it disapeared. The dramatic manouvers(?) lasted I would say about 1 second to 2 seconds. (I know i had to really move my gaze to keep it in sight. When it dissapeared I continued to look thinking id missed its last move.)The whole incident was very quick and hard to keep clear from memory but we both STILL talk about it and we have always kept an eye out for anything which sounds similar over the years.(This archive will be invaluable for that and this is why i posted here.The more info available the more it will help i think). I hope this helps somehow. We both would like some sort of answer but doubt we will ever work out what it was.

PD)) Controled flight. Extremely low altitude. Extremely slow speed. NO SOUND! Observed at close distances. I was listening to Peter Grabiel's new video on MTV as I walked out and stood in the cool, crisp, night air of mid-October. The East Texas sky was clear and, as usual, filled with millions of twinkling stars. I could see the Dairy Queen sign that stands beside HWY.8 and was watching the extremely light traffic as it moved east and west along the highway. As I looked further east, just past the huge, blue water tower that stood between me and the highway, I noticed a pair of lights. I assumed it must be a special heavy hauler rig and I waited anxiously for it to pass by the water tower so I could get a better look at it. The lights were above the normal flow of traffic, but I never suspected that they were high enough to be flying and the ""truck"" was moving very, very slow. As I waited for it to pass the water tower and reappear, I assumed that it must have pulled over...The lights that I had been observing west- bound, at just under a half-mile, was now traveling south-west. As it manuevered around the water tower at about 1800 yards distance, I could clearly see that this was an aircraft. It's altitude was less than 35 feet and at it's present speed it would be directly above my head in about 15 minutes. My camera was out of film but I had a M-1 carbine with a 30 round clip full of tracer rounds. I went in the house and got it. A line of pine trees marked the boundry where my backyard joined my neighbor's yard. 45 yards beyond those trees lies the street that runs in front of his house. The craft was now above the old boat factory, about 300 yards, and as I watched it float, ever so slowly, I saw a bright-white light come on which was located directly in the center of the bottom of the craft. I flipped the safety off of the carbine that I was holding as the UFO approached the street which runs in front of my neighbor's home. Directly above the street, the rear of the craft came about as it again, changed it's direction and followed the street west. I am now sixty yards from this craft as it floats through the air so low that the orange reflection from the newly installed amber street lamp was clearly visible on it's shiny, brushed aluminum appearing skin. NO SOUND! NOT A WHISPER!!NOTHING! It was moving so slow, I had to stop moving to make sure that it was not hovering. My neighbor's home is a low, ranch styled home about 80 feet long. I observed the craft through the pines that joined our yards as it moved over his home. As it centered his home, about 20 feet of the craft extended beyond each end of his home, giving it a length of 120'.I readied my carbine and aimed at the center of the bright-white light. The bottom of the UFO was flat with a slight hump toward the rear of the craft. It had a light on each of it's three, rounded corners. These outer lights had the old, yellowish glow, like older vehicles. The top-half of the craft was rounded and egg- shaped and reached a height of at least 15'-20'. I moved across my neighbor's yard and as I stepped into the street, I observed the craft pass directly over a family's home, and comparing the two, the UFO was 60' across the rear and was about 15' across it's nose. I didn't shoot at the UFO . Those tracer rounds could have bounced off of it, stuck in one of my neighbor's roofs, and could have burned their house down. I watched the craft as it stayed it's course and went out of sight. At the time I witnessed this UFO, I was a conveyor mechanic for a government contractor. I've worked on air bases all over this nation and there are no aircraft available in our arsenals that can hover 30' off the ground without making a sound. If a human being stands within 60' of any hovering aircraft made on this earth, with the very latest, most advanced, technology known to man, that human being WILL hear that aircraft!! This sighting makes nine UFO sightings that I've experianced over the years while living in East Texas. These entities are real, people. What I've described here is true. That craft was just as real as the 1985 Chevrolet Silverado that's setting in my driveway. I hate these things. I hate what they've done to peoples lives. I hate the way they can come and go and stalk us. If they are so damned intelligent, then they know what they are doing to us is wrong. Make no mistake about it, I will pull that trigger to stop the threat!!",2004-10-27T00:00:00,33.4593,-94.4301

The recent death of Betty Hill has convinced me that people are interested int this subject, and since I have something to add, I should go ahead and tell the whole story.  I was fifteen, and after the ten o'clock news went down to the beach of our rented summer cabin, as was my habit, to go have a cigarette.  I saw a light on the horizon, hovering over the waves, but was not too bothered by it.  But I felt somehow drawn to it, and kept walking towards the light.  Then, at once, I discovered I was over knee-deep in water, at a fairly low tide.  I hurried back to the beach, in which the light started climbing, slowly, but surely, towards the sky.  Then, a couple other objects shot down, and the group of them begans to bounce around the coastline, up and down, with every once and awhile one coming in close.  By this time I had climbed the stairs and was watching from a lookout, joined by my father, who was poo-pooing the whole idea, though he did not have his glasses, and could not come up with a reasonable explaination for the lights he DID see.  After a long time of observation, one by one, the lights shot up straight into the sky, like a bottle rocket,and we went back to the cabin. We went back to the cabin, and I went to my room, but I couldn't sleep.  I fell asleep reading ""The Great TV Sitcom Book""  What happened next I have no way of proving or disproving, but in my heart and my mind I know that it DID happen: I awoke, after sleeping a short time, and heard a noise on the porch.  I went to the window, and saw at least five bald headed men wearing long, black jackets, waiting at the front door.  As I watched, the porchlight went out.  They were trying to open the front door, and as they did, the porchlight faded and so did my recall. The next morning I awoke as if I had had nightmares, and hadn't slept well.  Bruises and soreness were present, yet it was a few days before I associated it with that night.  I was in a bit of a fog.  I walked many times to the lookout, where I watched this craft, but had no clear knowledge of why.  Later on I went home and tried to put the whole thing behind me.  Obviously I haven't.  I can still see the five men, light glaring off thier bald heads, trying to force their way in to the cabin and knowing that I had no choice in the matter",2004-10-27T00:00:00,,

Since we were close to an Air Force base at the time, I went into the station and asked the clerk to come outside and look.  Since there were no planes/jets around, I figured it might be a military protype.  She said she had never seen anything like it before.  It was moving slowly away.  No one thought to take a picture and by the time I though of using the binoculars, it was far enough away that the detail was no greater than when we first saw it.

We pulled over and had parked in a popular parking spot in a small town called stanley  which is placed right on the ohio river.  We had been parked maybe 5 minutes  and i was resting my head back on the headrest  watching the night sky over the ohio river looking in  the direction of north-west..of this I am positive.  I saw a glowing round light  that seemed to dim and bright in a repeating pattern. The color of this light was whiteish to light bluish in color.  I thought i t was a plane at first  but soon realized  by its movements  that it couldn't be.  Then i said to myself  it is a helicopter... but soon realized  that the distance it was covering  in what seemed like a millioneth of sec  that it wasnt.  I told my friend to look  and he saw it too.  I don't know how to describe it... but this object seemed to be reading my mind  moving in directions that i was telling it to go.  It took 10 minutes for me to KNOW  it wasn't anything manmade  it moved to quickly and efficiently... i had treetops on the opposite side of the river to base distance on  it was not quite as far away as the stars  but not as low as conventional aircraft fly, but way above the treetops. We watched for another 20  minutes or so, before i got scared and asked to be taken home, I also had him close the top on the convertible.   Once home in thruston southeast of where i first spotted the object, I looked in the sky and saw it again but more to the southeast of me  and over a rural area  not the river anymore...  it was still pretty far away...  I was spooked  told my friend bye and went in the house.   I went to a psychiatrist over this  who dismissed it and tried to put me on medicine for it... i found this funny....and maddening.   But 9 years later in late january of 2002 I saw the same object again. I was married at the second sighting it was like 4 am in the morning  and my husband was leaving for work. we live in a small community less than a 1/4 of a mile away from the ohio river  and it seemed to be in the location  that i saw it in 9 yrs. previously.  I was very scared  locked the house down made sure all blinds were closed.  I don't know how describe the feeling of it being able to sense my thoughts.  I told a fieman friend of mine about it several hours later  and he said not to feel strange others have seen these things.  Incedentally i called the airport after the first sighting in 1993 the next morning  but they had no reports of anything strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My three companions and I were traveling from Battle Creek to Galesburg at around 2:15 am on highyway 94.  The night was damp and foggy.  Ahead, we noticed bright beams of blue white light streaming into the sky in random, puslsating fashion, and an angle of about 60 degrees, right up from the ground.  The beams lit the cloud base, and from a distance, they created a wedge shape of beams.  As we got closer, these beams were observed to be very large, as large or larger than a searchlight beam.  They formed a circular pattern on the cloud base.  We slowed down and stopped the van opposite the lights on the berm of the highway.  We sat there for a minute, watching the rectanglar beams pulse upward in random patterns.  We figured there was a car lot or welding shop down there, as they came from below the highway and behind trees.  The number of them, however, and the late hour, convinced us that this could not be search lights.  The area they eminated from was about the size of a ranch home.  I decided to cross the freeway and take a look, and we all opened the doors and got out.  When I closed the door, the lights went out!  We stood there in total darkness for a second and then piled back into the van an got out of there in a hurry. The next day, remembering a mile marker that was close, we returned and found a pond below the trees where the lights had been.  A week later, a Cleveland Plain Dealer artist drew a sketch of a UFO she had seen hovering above her back yard.  She claimed it had thrown bright, blue white beams of light through rectangular windows around its edge.  Her drawing would have corresponded to what we saw that night.",2004-12-03T00:00:00,42.2888,-85.385

Car headlights went out suddenly. I had seen ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind"" a few years ago.  (therefore the date I gave above is only an estimate)  When the lights went out suddenly, I pulled to the right side of interstate 70.  I was headed south.  My 2 companions were go-go dancers.  I was taking them home. I stopped the car and thought that the senario reminded me of the aformentioned movie.  The fog was thick but when I looked to my right I saw a farm house  thousands of yards away that had a large red light above it.  It illuminated the whole area.  I thought at first it was a helicopter searching for some lost kids or something.  But the red light stayed fixed on the farmhouse.  I noticed there was no sound. The huge red light and no sound made me suspicious.  I tried to figure a a reasonable explanation for it, but could find none.  I kept thinking that the red light would move, but it didn't.  The light was so large, I reasoned, that it could not be a helicopter, either. ( I had not read any ufo books on abductions at this time.  Only later did I realize that what I saw appeared to be a classic abduction case.) After watching it for a half hour or more, I realized that this could be a UFO.  I raised my right hand,( in a form of greeting, with palm foreward) and said in my mind.  ""I have a son at home, please don't take me.""  I felt immediately a tingling sensation on my palm, like they had heard my message.  I tried to awaken the two women in the back seat.  However, they did not wake up, no matter how I tried to make them.  I blieve I finally saw the light move some to my right, slowly. Still no sound.  After some time of watching the red light, I fell asleep.  I drove back home  hours later when it was light, as my lights still did not work.  I took the car to a repair shop and asked them pointedly about what caused my headlights to go out.  They said they did not know.  I had to have both headlights replaced.

We were living in the foothills of Santa Barbara - Montecito to be exact.  There were no street lights, thus it was very dark.  I believe it was I that said, ""What are those lights over there?""  What we observed were maybe five or six rounded lights that were just hovering in the night sky, not high up, not flying around, but moving slightly, ,..not fast, just twinkling in the sky very near us.  Similar to a helicopter when trying to hover over an object.  They moved, but not much.  My father immediately said, ""Oh, those are weather balloons!""  I thought he was nuts.  I remember the lights having a whitish hew.  We observed them for maybe five minutes and then just walked back to the house.  Not a word mentioned ever again, except by me over the years.  I moved out of the house the following week.  Under hypnosis many years later, I returned to that night, and quickly realized that I had been abducted later that night.

It was about 9pm, in the fall, September.  I was pacing back and forth next to the sidewalk, speaking with my girlfriend, who was sitting on the curb.  As I turned and faced north, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a light in the sky.  I turned and faced it and pointed at it and said ""Look!"".  My girlfriend jumped up and we both watched it for about 10 seconds.  Then I ran to the front door of my home and yelled at my family to come see.  They were slow to respond.  By the time I went back to my original position to look at it, it was gone.  My girlfriend said it went over the small mountains to the south east.  Its appearance - flawlessly circular, burnt orange, constant hue with small mechanical like random pulsations of equal size on its surface.  Moving slowly in a straight line, silent!   Size difficult to determine, because of it's circular shape, and dark blue background of the clear night sky.

About 10 degrees off of horizontal, decline.  The most striking characteristic of this object was:  silent operation.  No sound whatever.  Also, the appearance of the random pulsations against the burnt orange surface.  And it's apparent size in the sky.  About 20% larger than a full moon. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They stopped allowed us to gaze on them and then shot perpendicular straight up in the sky in a split second (extremely high rate of speed) and disappeared in the atomosphere. We all looked at each other and our thoughts were ""What was that?""  In addition, what I remember the most was the objects had a kind of intelligence. Thought intelligence. As if they wanted us to turn around and see them. Then, when we did they took off.  Goodfellow AFB is not an aircraft base. It is a NSA (and military intelligence) training center.

We stopped and I wondered what the big deal was about the light in the sky.  Looked like a plane or a copter to me.  They told me to keep watching.  The object was about 50 degrees above the horizon, moving in a southeastern direction.  As it got closer, I noticed that the light seemed to change to red and back to white.  It made a right angle turn and went higher in the sky.  No noise, no hesitation.  It made several 90 degree turns, in the meantime traveling southeast to northwest and back again.  The object could also completely reverse direction.  It traveled fast.  It went to the northwest and at that point we noticed there were 2 more objects -one from the southwest, one from the northwest that seemed to be descending on the object we were watching.  They all seemed to merge and after a couple seconds, the object sped off to the northwest at a 75 degree angle and disappear. Several cars had stopped and gone,  so I know there were quite a few that saw the event.  However, those that stayed to the end all agreed -Nobody saw a thing. I guess they are still keeping silent. I may be sketchy on the dates and time, but I know what I saw.  I will never forget it.  Incidentally, the driver of the car in which I was riding broke the speed limits going back home.

The light was a 'white' light. Very brilliant. I could not make out any detail as it glowed so bright. My wife yelled to me to get out of there. She kept saying 'Go..go!'..I speeded up and the object came closer. We went to a side road and I spun the car around and the object went into the desert as if to cut us off. I did a u-turn on the dirt road and and headed back in the opposite direction to the Fort. We were both shaken up. I had never seen anything like it before. I did not tell anyone as they would not believe us. What I remember most that frightened me is the feeling I got.

A friend of mine and I were standing side by side and talking about something. I, for no reason looked upward and about five or ten degrees north.  I saw a silver or white obect which was in the shape of an elongated fairly thin cylinder either rounded or pointed at each end.  I do not recall seeing any control serfaces.  It was not an airship.  The sky was sunny but with patches of cumulus clouds.  The object was moving slowly west to east.  There was no sound from the object.  As I recall there was little or no wind at ground level.  The object was seen for approximately two to three minutes and then disappeared behind a cloud formation.  I alerted my friend about the object and asked if he saw it.  His answer was yes.  I didn't say anthing to anyone else about the sighting but I have remembered it for all of these years.  Since I heard about your organization I thought it was time to say something about it.

He could see every little detail of the under belly of the craft. Not a single sound could be heard. They looked at it for several seconds and he said it then just instantly disappeared before their eyes.

I happened to look out the passenger window and saw several flashing lights which I first thought were airplanes.  What drew my attention was that the lights seemed too erratic.  Although the ""pulses"" were steady (like that of an airplane), there was no symetry.  The flashes did not match what you would have expected on an airplane's wings, or a helicopter's.  When I leaned down further for a broader view upwards, I saw there were many lights spread across half the sky.  They were moving west to east.  I pointed them out to my wife and friend.  My friend was in the back, on the driver side.  She immediately saw the flashing lights on her side of the car.  (I am sorry to add that she also said she saw ""two mother ships"", although I saw nothing of the kind.)  My wife could not look up because she was concentrating on the road, and saw none of this.  The sky was filled with these lights, quite far up.  There was no sound.  Although we were in a car, with plenty of traffic noise, I would have thought a fleet of planes or helicopters that large would have been heard over the engine.  The fact that it was September 11 made me wonder if it was some kind of aerial memorial for the victims of 9/11.

The change in formation was something so perfect and symmetrical that no conventional aircraft could pull off. The craft were flying fairly fast, and were gone after a few seconds. We were both amazed, and agreed that it was nothing of this planet. After ten minutes or so, the amber lights appeared again. This time they were once again travelling in the diamond, returning from the direction that they went the first time. They stayed in the diamond the entire time they went across the sky, which wasn't long because of the speed in which they were moving. I've never seen anything like it in my life.

On November 19, 2003, at 12:30 a.m., witnesses had purposely gone out to watch for meteors, and saw a silent triangle fly overhead so that they could view its underside, and watch it move from north to south so slowly that it took 3-4 minutes for it to disappear from view.  Altitude estimate is 400-500 feet.  [NOTE: Witnesses specify TRIANGULAR SHAPED PINKISH-WHITE GLOWING LIGHTS at each angle of the triangle.  It should be noted that Iowa MUFON has investigated another case recently where triangular-shaped lights were also noted, although the lights were not at the apices of the triangle, but rather along the sides of the triangle.]  At first, witnesses thought they were seeing 3 objects instead of just one, but when the object passed in front of Orion's Belt, they saw that it obscured some stars in the cluster, and that it was one object.

Had no sound, didn't exactly land in my sight, but I'm pretty sure it did! We were driving between Holopaw and Melbourne, on 192.  It was a beautiful, bright, sunny Sunday, my husband, said ""I see a UFO"", I said, ""Where?"", as I was scanning the sky.  And there it was, a ball, looked like a pewter ball, falling gently down from the sky.  As it was falling, the lower part was beginning to flatten out slowly.  Out of the top, it looked like it could have been some sort of antenna, but it was a different material than the rest, a white grainy hard material.  As it was lowering closer to the earth, it was wobbling gently, and at the same time, constantly changing shape. The antennae, or whatever, was coming out of a tufted material from the top.  And at the same time, the color of the whole craft is changing to a bright silver, shining and glinting in the sun, and perfect, still revolving, no imperfections, no lines or marks.  By now, the bottom is completely flat, perfectly flat, and out of the top, the antennae, has changed to show 3 perfectly round, large windows, or glass, which showed the beautiful, blue sky, through them.  I was scrutinizing, to see if any being was looking from the window or glass.  But saw no living being only this perfect object.  By this time, it was perfectly perpendicular to the ground. It was about a couple of feet from landing when it stopped, in mid-air, and whisked off to the left, still ground level, white sand was blown from under the craft, and we were moved from the sight. Looking back from the front seat of the car, I saw a white gate to the left of the craft which opened fast.  It seemed to have been made of the same white, grainy material that the ""antennae"" had been made of, before the transmutation.  Now, looking at the road ahead, leaving this sight, the road looked like it was going to a perfect point ahead.  After seeing this spectacular occurrence, we were both wordless and in awe, and I thought, this was the last day of life on earth.  I said to my hubby, that maybe we should report this to the police to alert who knows who about this for the safety of the world, but he said we would be locked up, for sure.  So we went to the art festival and then to the beach and had a great day.  But I had much anxiety for a few months after this, expecting some sort of repercussions, but, thank God, and I do mean, thank God, we are still in existence!",2004-10-27T00:00:00,,

I was a police officer (Elected Sheriff) for a four year term of office. I was a corporate safety director for five years. I have lived from europe to asia and fought in the VietNam as a marine for two years. I have flown on several different aicrafts and seen many things, but the phenomena I witnessed that morning on Aug.2,1996 is nothing I have ever expierenced before. It all began when I received a doctors appointment for my dad at the VA medical center, Indianapolis on Aug.2,1996 12:45AM.  I followed their directions on how to get there, as I have not been there for several years.   I was travling south on I-69 approaching the Fishers exit when I observed a dark grayish object about 1/4 mi. to the west.  I backed off the cruise to about 60 mph and I thought it was a blimp, like ones that are used when a new business opens.  I thought perhaps the wind might blow it to its side so I could read what it might say. That's when I noticed that it wasn't tethered at either end and it was lumpy and seemed to wobble.  I then realized what it was doing. It was doing,it was raising itself up verticle from a fixed horizontal position in the sky, (Like raising a dirty dime up on a table with a magnet,and leaving it balanced on top. Once it was on top it immediately began to glow white inside, (Like a dim light bulb becoming brighter for a fraction of a second and then dimmed again or pulsed). When it did this I could see inside and there was a dark grayish matter at the bottom, (It was offset to the right of center).   As soon as the whitenss was its brightess it moved to the left (South) in a perfectly straight line about a 1000 ft.I thought it was going into the cloud to hide, but it didnt,it went in front of the cloud.  Thats !! when I could better judge its size and distance.It was approximately 250 in diameter,it was about 50 ft. above cloud ceiling, and approximately 1-1/2 to 2 miles west of my position. When it was moving in front of the cloud I immediately noticed the left side of this perfectly circular object was disappearing (There was a slit an opening in the sky in front of the cloud)it continued into the opening until it completely disappeared. While I observe this event I felt time slow way down, almost to a point that it stopped. It felt like driving into molasses and being hit with novacaine.  I know this happened because I began to worry, (I have not worried like that since the last firefight I fought on football island in VietNam in 1969).  I began to worry because I could not turn my head, but I still nad my peripheral vision and the Fishers overpass was there and we were going to hit its coluums underneath.Thats when the object completly entered the opening and disappeared and time resumed to normal and I had control again.I said outloud ""Hell lets do that again"" and it didnt even wake my dad who slept through the whole 8 to 10 seconds of the event.I turned the radio on to hear the news,but nothing was reported, not even later on the t.v. evening news. The next day Aug.3,1996 I read a article in the Indianapolis Star Newspaper that the National Weather Services Doppler Radar Station at Indianapolis had detected unusal rings on their screens the previous day and reported they reported to the news media that they didnt know what would cause such a phenomena, but they did received two reports of birds taking flight all at the same time together.On Aug.5,1996 I called the NWS station at Indy and reported to two meterologist what I had witnessed that morning.I answered their questions and we decided to meet and view the rings on the radar screen.When saw the rings I said "" Thats not birds"", and the meterologist stated "" No thier not, we know that now"". I went home and never discussed the event again, except with a meterologist at the North Webster Station. This station was constructed about a year later about 23 mi. from my home. Its called NEXRAD for next generation doppler radar because it is linked with all other dopplers to one main office in one location. The reason I choose to speak about it is because I spoke with a gentleman who is a pilot and he told me about an event when he flew into an opening some 30 yrs. ago.We both believe that our events are directly related and we are only seeking scientific explanations.The one thing I do know is that it left its calling card! and the next time this pattern of rings first begins to develope we have about 3-1/2 hrs. before the softspot opens and it arrives and departs through the opening. I believe N.O.A.A. knows this and thats why hundreds of doppler radars are viewed at the same time at one main location. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume the date is correct.

Being in first calss I could see the panic in the eyes of the flight attendents.  Then two large ovals craft went past the right side of the plane and above us. They were much larger than our craft the first being nickel in color and the second a rust color. They were close enough to see with detail their shape and construction. Then a third craft nickel came by on the same path as the first two.I was in the window seat but the person next to me and those behind on the right side of the flight saw them.  The flight attendant tried to get the attention of the flight crew but it was some time,three or four minutes befour the crew would take their call.  There was a heated conversation and the attendants became very distrssed and talked among themeselves. The cockpit door then came open and the crew told the attendants be calm all the while one person on the crew was on the radio looking for a new flight path and seeking information on the other objects we just missed.  the door remained open and I could here conversation as how how they would fly a new route to Dallas. Later the crew all denied anything varied from the norm  and would not discuss this matter.  ON a later flight I was with the same attendtent and was reconized and was asked if I had seen them and she said we were very lucky. I have all the flight info if anyone wants to follow up.  I also have photos of a craft that I took from a flight from New Mexico that was below us. This craft had triangle shape and moved from side to side as it moved to the north at a very slow speed.We saw the craft long enough for me to get my nikon from my case and take photos.

The date is incorrect but it was within a few months.  There was an airshow scheduled for that weekend in SF, as info was in the news I read prior to the flight.  I can go back through my records and get the exact date if needed.  I mean there was activity brought on by the occurrense taking place with the crew and others on the flight that took place for over one hour.  this includes the crew trying to get an ok to fly over parts of Nevada  that were not normal for the flight.  With the door open to the cabin for a period of time you could overhear the conversations taking place.  Also the attendants spoke of this to each other, about the flight being too far south of norm. Actual viewing time was short because of proximity of the three craft, at the most a few seconds.  There were no more than 1200 ft away at the most and details in the surface was obvious.  They  all had weatherbeaten look and looked very as if they had been exposed to harsh conditions. Give me a fax number and I will send a drawing of the craft.  When this started I was on the right side of the aircraft but swiched to the left window after our turn to the left and could see all three over the bay bridge moving northeast and gaining altitude and speed. they maintained this course until out of sight.

I was out our home in the county line road between Coweta and Broken Arrow Oklahoma. I had stepped out the back door facing a pond behind our place and witnessed a very large winged animal/huminoid creature gliding about 20 yards high and about 30 yards away fromme. It was traveling at a very slow rate and was coming from the front area of our home across the norther part of our lawn moving west by northwest. My discription of this winged creature; long with a thin human shaped torso, moth or butterfly shaped wings extended but not moving or beating, rather gliding. It had a wide dark grey colored human-like face and peered diectly at me as it crossed the yard. It had very large dark eyes. It had I guessed at least a eight or nine foot wingspan. It apeared to be covered with a hairlike folical. It seemed to have a sort of high ridge or dorsal spinal rise behind the haed and wings. I guess it was extremly light-weight for its size. I tried to rationalize the was my imagination playing a trick on me and returned inside halfwittingly joking with my ex-wife telling her I just saw a ""Skilly"". This is the term given by Cherokees who claim a superstition of nighthawk people or like other tribal lores, those who change shapes into other than human form. She was going to leave and go visit her sister in Coweta about then and left out the same door. She returned a few minutes later claiming she came face to face with a nine foot tall creature with a red oilish skin and huge red glowing eyes. She was extremley shaken and histerically crying. I heard movement on our front porch after calming her down and finally getting her discription of this thing. I noticealso about a quarter mile across the county line road in front of our home a red light in the pasture. Looking through the screen I saw at first what I thought a police or fire truck lite. Looking closer through the screen I saw a broad silver flattened doom with a red blinking beacon directly center top. My ex was still horribly shaken and I started to go again out the back door possibly to confront this intruder. At that time I recieved a phone call. I answered and a voice sounding as if it was modulated on a radio frequency started speaking with me. I would tell me such as where I was born, where I had been, then in great detail alot of personal facts. The voice was also using what seemed an older type of Englich which I have seen written such as terms in ""three score and fourty et. It made some extremly weid prophetic statements. I became Irate and told whoever it was I would have them traced and arrested. I hung up and it rang again. I removed the plugin and set the phone with cord on the kitchen stove. We had our two children with us, a three yeasr old boy and two year old girl. I was becoming extremly concerned about our safety. A very heavy amonia smell filtered into our house causing my eyes to water heavily. At this time the phone rang again. I glanced and saw the phone still unhooked sitting on the stove. I told my ex-wife the we were going to get the kids between us and move directly to our car behind the house. I grabbed a big kitchen knife and we did as I instructed after I yelled loudly that I would butcher anyone or anything in my path trying to stop us on our way to the car. We saw nothing as we exited our home and got ourselves in the car. I drove to her mother house in Coweta. I returned the next day. No sign of anything, footprints, vandalism et. I really question why this happened to us. It was extremly freightening and I questioned my own sanity when I heard the phone ring after unplugging it. I assume it was using a magnetic inductance to axcess and imulate a voise on the phone. I have red a few books on UFOs since. Jim Marrs discribes numerous events very similar by creature discription in 95-96 I would rather not have ever seen this thing. It looked like it had escaped from hell and could easily fit numerous discriptions of both aliens and demons of folklore and biblical accounts.

I was riding my bike down Bay street headed towards Pierpont ave when I noticed bright lights coming from about 40-50 yards above the water of Racket River to my right. There were multiple lights in a vertical line following each other, if you looked directly at them it would look like the shape of the big an little hand on a clock lit up like it was 1:25. they came on like a switch, the power was bright enough to cast shadows from the trees and houses in front of the water. It was dusk and i assumed the light source was fire works because of the holiday. But when I looked at them they were motionless, they were not falling down like a firework cascade would normally do. I realized pretty quick that all of the lights were slowly moving together as if they were all connected to the same object. Then the lights when out, they were only illuminated brightly for less than 10-20 seconds. You could still see the light very dimly lit, the object was changing its position in the sky, it was turning from vertical to horizontal. I was silent, it made no noise I can recall. It was clear that it was triangle in shape, its size was around 50 yards roughly. It was hard to say how, but I fell like it was not that thick. It then moved very gradually up into the sky until i could no longer see it. The whole event took around 2-3 minutes, but I will never forget it. I thought it was a government project or something. Whatever it was I have never seen commercial technology move the way it did. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-10-27T00:00:00,44.6609,-74.9258

On the above date at Grafenwoehr Germany, (U.S. Army Training Base) a unkown craft enterded the Grafenwoehr training Area at 19 degree's over a MK-19 live fire range.  I was the Range Saftey officer at the time and a cease fire was called, due to the fact that this area is 1. a no fly zone for civilian aircraft (the Germans definatley avoid this area) and 2. cease fires are noted for exact times on the firing ranges for aircraft fire (military aircraft) and a cease fire is additionaly called frome range control 1 hour prior to aircraft entry into the training area.  The craft was the shape of a dodacheron triangle standing on end.  It appeared out of knowhere at 19 degree's off of due north, and slowly proceeded toward 190 degree's.  The craft appeared to be at a height of 800-1000 feet.  I called range control of the situation and they stated that no craft where to be in the area.  I then called TSACC (Air Control Tower) in Grafenwoer and informed SSG Murphey of our situation who was the Controller on duty.  He stated that he had the craft on radar and that he had to make some notifications and would call me back.  The craft came to a stop and appeared to hover, no sound was present comeing from the craft and it was shifting (changing colors), blue, red, green.  The also appeared to be a mirage (aura)or heat trail off to, what I guess would be the rear of the craft or the opposite side of travel.  While hovering the craft was a light blue.  After about another 5 minutes the craft started to change color blue and green and was swaying slightly side to side. Another few minutes went by and the craft again started moving to 190 degree's and then Range control calls all ranges via SINGAR's Radio and reiterates a cease fire for incoming German air craft.  From the North came two German fighter with full afterburners heading for the craft.  The craft turned red in color and accelerated to almost a blur going straight up, the jet immediatly went into a climb.  I got back on the land line with The TSACC and SSG Murphey the told me that the unidentified craft shot up from 1300 feet to about 50,000 feet in a single sweep of the radar. SSG Murphey then said that the Germans and American both attempted to contat the craft which met with negative result and that German and American Fighters had been scrambled and then that he had to go, I heard several phones in the backgroud ringing of the hook. For the next 30 minute several groups of military fighters came through the area at high rates of speed and at different elevations.  The soldiers at the range where then briefed prior to leaving that evening not to repeat what they had seen by our CO and that this action was classified from higher.  I am now out of the military and felt that this should be known.

I had a similar sighting around or on that date.  I cannot remember the exact time or date but the sighting is pretty much the same.   I was heading home from my girlfriends house in Hilton NY between 2200 and 2300.  I was driving along the parkway, east to Rochester.  I noticed off to my left (north) a blue light over Lake Ontario. The light was moving south and then it banked to the east when it got to the edge of the water. That’s when I noticed the blue windows.  The more I looked at it the more it freaked me out.  It was saucer shaped with 5 or 6 blue windows or lights in the middle of it.  It was shaped like two convex plates one on top of the other with the two plates being separated by a row of bright but not dazzling cobalt blue lights.  The row of lights was about 2 feet tall.  The UFO was about 7 to eight feet thick and about 35 feet in diameter.  (I am using the dimensions from the other sighting because they are the same).  The skin of the UFO was a metallic silver color.  It was a dull almost brushed steel finish.  It followed along side of me over the edge of the water for a few miles.   I started to get really scared so I decided to get off the parkway and take some back roads home to my dad’s house.  After I got off the parkway I couldn’t see the object anymore. I was coming around this corner when I saw the object hovering over some trees off to my right (south). Then I was really scared.  I started driving about 50 miles per hour in these residential areas. The object followed me for a couple more miles until I got to the power plant.  Then it just disappeared.  The whole thing really scared me and I am freaked out right now just writing this event down.   I am going to email a map of the area and try and make a picture. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I saw what appeared to be an oval shaped object wrapped or swaddled in a somewhat goldish, metallic material. It was a week night in September of 1976. My Daughter M had just started kindergarten. I was married to B. We were living in a little house on Seminary Dr. in St. Paul, MN. We had gone to bed about 9:30, as we usually did on week nights. It was probably several hours later when I woke with a start to find that B was not in bed with me. This would not have been unusual except that he had to work the next morning. I walked through the house stopping to check on M, who, was missing from her bed. While B being gone was not much cause for concern, he would never, on the longest day of his life, have taken a 5 year old with him. I began to panic. I ran to the back door with the intention of looking to see if our van or car were gone, when I opened it there was a green haze or fog which was quite thick. My dog ran out into the yard, I screamed for him to come back which he did. My panic turning into terror, I picked up the phone but put it back down. Who would I call, and what would I tell them? That my Daughter and Husband were missing, and my house was enveloped in a green fog? Right. I went to the kitchen sink, which was clear of dishes, and splashed my face with cold water in a vane attempt to compose myself. I got a glass of water, drank it and put the glass down on the right side of the sink. At this point I was snot nosed and sniveling. I paced the length of our small house repeatedly, stopping to look in M's room. Was I having some sort of bizarre psychotic episode, or was this just a terrible nightmare? Yes, the Granddaddy of all nightmares. With this in mind I went back to bed. I lay there in a sweat, with my eyes tightly shut, saying to myself, between heaving sobs, ""This is just a bad dream, this is just a bad dream"" At some point I noticed that the lights were on in my bedroom. I didn't recall turning them on. Our security light and the corner street lamp provided more than enough illumination to see most everywhere in the house. I looked down toward the end of the bed and to my horror saw what appeared to be an oval shaped object wrapped or swaddled in a somewhat goldish, metallic material. I opened my mouth to scream. Nothing but a wheezing whimper would pass my lips. Truly frozen with fear, I was pumping adrenaline at a rate I thought might kill me. My heart wasn't beating, it was buzzing. Some time passed before I was able to move one of my feet, very slowly, out of the fetal position to push this object further away from me. I don't remember a thing after that until daylight when I awoke to find that B was in bed beside me. I raced to M's Room where she lay sleeping peacefully. As I walked back to the bedroom I glanced at the sink. There was my glass, on the right side. The light in the bedroom was off. I glanced in a mirror and noticed my face appeared sunburnt. At breakfast I could see that M and B looked sunburnt too. I recall thinking to myself that it had been cloudy and cold all week. I pushed this incident to the back of my mind in a category all it's own labeled ""Nightmare like no other"" and went on with my life. A few years later as I sat in a Dentist's waiting room (in San Diego) paging through a magazine, I noticed an article that pretty nearly described my ordeal. Intrigued, I stopped at a book store on my way home. As I looked through the books on UFO's and the like I came across some drawings of odd looking, supposed, human/alien infants. One was of a red haired baby wrapped in an oval shaped goldish colored blanket. Looking back on the events of that night, I wish that I hadn't been so fearful and that I would have closely examined that oval shaped object. Anyone out there had a similar experience? If so I would like to hear from you. Thanks, R ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-04-27T00:00:00,44.95305527415144,-93.11475467362925

We both noticed a bright light at the end of the street.  I initially thought it was the street light.  However, as we drove closer, I saw that it wasn't the street light.  It was a very bright light about 75 feet to 100 feet or so above and just behind the homes at the end of the street.  It appeared to be in a stationary or hovering position just behind and above the homes.  I parked my car in my parents driveway and walked down the street to see if I could get a closer view of this bright object.  As I walked about 100 feet or so down the street, the bright object slowly (less than 5 mph) began moving toward me.  The bright object was about 75 feet to 100 feet up and made absolutely no sound at all.  As the object moved closer towards me, one of the first things that I could make out was that the craft had an opaque whiteish colored dome. There were red and white lights at the base of the whitish dome that went around the base of the dome in a counter-clockwise direction.   The craft was oval shaped, brass colored and about 15 feet long and 10 feet wide.  It also seemed like there was something like very very faint light blue lines that were emitted around the perimeter of the craft (there was just something about this I can't explain or be sure of).  The craft was so close and I could see it so clearly that I couldn't believe I was actually seeing it right before my eyes.  It looked like nothing I had ever seen or experienced before in my life or in this world.  I got this feeling of exhileration and excitement that I never felt before in my life and have never felt since then.  The object slowly crossed between our neighbor's lawn and my parents lawn.  I walked a few feet off the street and stood under a maple tree.  I saw the underside of the craft.  The craft was oval shaped and brass colored.  It had an opaque whitish colored dome with red and white lights at the base of the dome that went around the base of the dome in a counter-clockwise direction.  The perimeter around the base of the craft curved slightly upwards.  The underside of the craft was a brass color and had ridges that ran across the base of the craft (like a ridged potato chip).  It had four bright warm lights (one in front, one in the rear, one on the left and one on the side).  The lights were cylindrical and imbedded in the base of the craft.  They had a very warm yellowish white glow.  At this point my exhilaration started to turn to being a little afraid.   I started to get a little afraid because the craft was almost directly overhead about 100 feet up.  I stood under the maple tree and observed the craft through the leaves.  The craft slowly began to pick up speed as it hovered silently over our lawn and across the field behind our house.  It slowly picked up spped from less than 5 miles per hour to about 10 mph to 20 mph.  It traveled across the field toward I-94 in a southeasterly direction.  I went in the house and told my mother about it.  I then called the Michigan State Police Post in Benton Harbor/St. Joseph.   I told the State Police trooper what I had just seen and the direction it was traveling in.  I told him I had never seen a UFO before and that I was not mentally ill or drunk.  The State Police trooper treated my call like it was a joke and said what I had seen was probably a ""weather balloon"".  I told him it was not a weather ballon and that the object was headed in a southeasterly direction from St. Joseph, Michigan towards Niles, Michigan.  The next day I was reading the Herald-Palladium (local newspaper) and on one of the back pages, there was an article about a UFO being reported by residents in the Allegan, Michigan area the night I observed the UFO in St. Joseph.  Allegan, Michigan is about 60 miles from St. Joseph in Southwestern  Michigan.

It was 2:00 PM and the electric was still off.  I was bored and decided to lay out in the back yard. This is when I realized how beautiful the day was. I decided to face south with the sun at my back. This would allow me to look up and admire the beautiful sky that had no clouds or haze. As I was looking at the sky I saw to what I thought was a star. I said to myself ""Wow the sky is so clear I can see a star.""  The star was in the 11:00 position in the sky. I continued to look at it for approximately 5 minutes when the phone rang. My brother said the phone call was for me.  I told him to come out and keep your eyes on this while I answer the phone. He came out and said Wow it's so clear you can see a star. I said I know, that's what I said. As soon as I got on the phone he started screaming, ""It's Moving ... It's Moving""  I ran out and was shocked to see it moving very slowly South heading to the 2:00 position in the sky. I told my brother to hurry up and get my telescope. I immediately put the small spotter scope on it then I was able to get it immediately in the large scope. To my shock and surprise I saw very clearly a round object that was silver at the top and glowing orange and yellow at the bottom. I screamed ""It's a UFO""  The UFO was moving very slow as I was following it. Then suddenly my brother started screaming there's another one. I looked away from the telescope and saw 5 more UFO's directly behind the one I originally saw, only now you can see the difference in size. The other 5 UFO's now look like small dots in comparison to the first one.  They were all evenly spaced and started to move a bit faster south when Suddenly they all Bolted across the sky from the 12:00 position in the sky to the 2:00 position in the sky in a flash. They looked to be at least 34 thousand feet up. Then they all stopped at once still evenly spaced at the 2:00 position. Then they dropped down to the 3:00 position and all stopped then all went back up to the 2:00 position all stopped then all shot out at once South West at the 1:00 position faster than a flash of light. Gone Forever.  We were all very excited to be a witness to this UFO sighting. My Brother, Sister, and two of my brothers friends.  After everything was over I sat down by myself and reflected on what I just saw. That's when I was hit with flashes of information.  I was suddenly taken off this planet looking at it disappear in the vastness of space. I was suddenly outside our universe. It looked like a black ball floating in a dimension of white energy.  As I went further back I realized the white energy is also a bubble, only extremely large and still growing. There were other Black bubbles within the white. The other black bubbles are other universes. Some were large and others were smaller then our own. The larger the bubble the older the universe and the more advanced life is within. The most advanced beings were able to travel between universes. They were beings of light able to exist in all dimensions.  As I got taken even further back it came to an endless field of black. The extremely large whit bubble was in this endless field of black.  However this endless field of black was not black at all, it was such a high frequency it would show up in our spectrum as black however it is the brightest white and most intelligent and was the first spark of existence. This Frequency always was and always will be.  This frequency is so intelligent, it deliberately designed our existence by putting frequencies together that would create our universe and matter then us.  From seeing this I understood the following.  1. Our universe is in the 3rd dimension of matter.  2. Our universe sits inside the 2nd dimension of Frequency and energy.  3. The endless field of black that the 2nd dimension sits inside the high intelligent frequency.  4. How frequency and energy was created to push open the third dimension of matter. (Our Universe.)  5.

Dear Peter Davenport, My name is ((name deleted)).  My Brother ((name deleted)) has written into your program on his UFO sighting encounter.  As apart of his story, I also was a witness to this event. The day of the event was July 26th, 1977, the time 2PM.  I had noticed that beautiful, cleared skied Summer day, that my Brother ((name deleted)) was laying out on the lounge chair soaking in the sun.  Next thing I knew there was alot of commotion going on outside as I heard him saying ""Oh my God, look at that"" !  I ran to the back door, and asked him what was going on, he said, "" Get out here, look at this, it's incredible"". So I rushed out to the backyard, and as he pointed up to the sky, my focus targeted on six flying objects.  One large object in the middle, and four to five smaller objects in a formation surrounding the larger craft. The objects seemed to be way up in the atmosphere, and appeared to be "" a strange attraction"" to me because the objects just hovered, and definitely did not act as the flight of a plane craft would.  Suddenly, the smaller objects started to perform  pulsating, multidirectional maneuvers that planes or other craft would never be able to maneuver.  Then all of the flying objects moved across the sky together in the same formation, surrounding the larger object, and continued to maneuver this strange multidirectional flying pattern.  This type of event continued on for what seemed a minimal of ten to fifteen minutes.  Then in a blink of an eye, they all took off in different directions and were gone !!  Just like that..... Thank you for taking the time to read my witnessing of this account. ((name deleted))   Below, is more information on this sighting:  Time:  14:00 Duration:  15 Minutes Sighting:  So.

Big empty sky. I was driving our motorhome westbound and the sun was behind us. It could possibly have been a bit before one PM. I noticed a cigar shape in the southern sky going north. It was at 10 O'clock and very distant. It caught my eye as it was extremely far away as big as a city moving in a straight line without any contrail. It would seem it was above our stratisphere. My husband had worked on the space program and was aware of more possibilities than I, as to the distance and size. We were estimating by going against the flat surface of earth, distant mountains and such. I pulled off the highway as quickly as I could and we, including our four children, watched it cross the sky. It was amazing. To get an idea of its size to our eye, it was the length of the breath of my fingernail and as thick as my short nail, a grain of rice!!! In a clear sky moving as fast as it was, was a UFO as nothing made by us could achieve the speed in which this moved at that distance. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I was walking I looked up in the sky. (for no apparent reason)  I was looking at all the stars in the sky on this clear night when I saw something that has puzzled me for almost 30 years. I glared at an object that was approx: 500 feet higher than the large oak trees that it had hovered and traveled and  past from the south. This object was round in shape with lights that wrapped around it. I would have to say the size of this object was as big as Niagara Falls in diameter and height. As I stared in astonishment the object came to a complete stop over the tree's.  All that was moving at this time was the lights on this thing and my shivering body. Although I was young I new I was witnessing something with a much greater intellect than ours. I new even at that age, airplanes make noise. Blimps don't fly in the dark, hot air balloons don't fly in the dark and weather balloons don't have florescent lights. This object was completely silent. This object also came to a complete stop directly over me for about 2 minutes then flew over the QEW heading over to the Burlington Skyway eventually out of my sight. I went home shortly after to tell my family of this encounter and was disappointed that no-one believed me. The next day at school (BELL CARIN)I told a couple of class mates of my encounter and to my relief my friend had said he saw the same thing while he was sitting in his tree fort.  I often wonder about that night and have thought about undergoing hypnosis to narrow down the exact date and time so I can go to the Hamilton to see if there was other reports of this sighting. I know there has to be other witnesses from the vehicles on the highway that would have seen this.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

UFO hovered and made right angle turns before shooting off at an incredible rate of speed when approached by a jet.,Colorado Springs,CO,,disk,5 minutes,"Occurred : 6/1/1963 23:00  (Entered as : 06/01/1963 23:00) Reported: 7/25/2004 1:37:56 AM 01:37 Posted: 7/25/2004 Location: Colorado Springs (mtns. NW of), CO Shape: Disk Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38299.html,"UFO hovered and made right angle turns before shooting off at an incredible rate of speed when approached by a jet. About 11pm in June 1963, in the company of my father, when outside and looking south down a large valley from our mountain A-frame house high on the mountain side North West of Colorado Springs, CO. We could see the lights of the city through the V shape at the bottom of the mountain valley and the full moon was almost straight S/SE and at maybe a 70 degree angle up. We had NO lights on at the time as we were watching the stars and moon.  My father brought to my attention a glowing single lighted object moving above the mountain ridge to the west of us and traveling south. (this would be to our right side maybe 1/8-1/4 mile away) The entire object glowed in a constant white light and seemed large and elongated. We could see it through and above the trees depending on its position as it was above and on the opposite side of the mountian ridge from our view point. While moving south along and above the ridge it would stop and hover, move at right angles up and down for a period of maybe two minutes before it circled around to the left (easterly direction) at the far south end of the mountain ridge.  (this next part took maybe 3 or 4 minutes) Then it gained in altitude and stopped almost straight south of our view and hovered at maybe a 40 degree angle from our position over what seemed to be the north west area above the city of Colo. Springs just east of the foot hills. It must have been 7-10 miles away from us by this time, maybe more, but was still big enough to see its elongated shape. While it hung in this position two bright orange objects slowly came out of this UFO (about a minute apart). One from the top and then one from the bottom. Once they were a short distance above or below the craft they shoot off at an incredible rate of speed in opposite directions (east and west)and disappeared immediately.  I then noticed a very high flying Jet coming from our left side (east)and traveling south west. It was traveling very fast and seemed to be headed directly for the hovering UFO. I speculate maybe 12,000 ft high. I mentioned to my father that it seemed like it was heading straight at the UFO and wondered what would happen when it got close.  When the jet did get close to this object (UFO) it accelerated up and out at a +/- 45 degree angle straight south and disappeared out of sight in maybe 1 or 2 seconds. Just like a scene in ""Star Trek"" when they go into warp. I have never seen anything accelerate that fast in my life except for a SciFi movie. At no time during this entire sighting did this object make any noise what so ever.  I have not shared this story with many people through the years and recently had a massive heart attack and felt it was time to tell my story while I can. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness have his father submit a report, as well, if that would be possible.  PD))",,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

It was told that many people were very upset at seeing lights over the farm that is out in front of a gravel road just off the blacktop H. Cattle horses hogs and other livestock animals died or literally run themselves to death along with several species of wild-life. From the southern end of Sedalia missouri it was thought that a massive fire was taking place. Some people sent fire trucks down to Benton county because it was thought there was a fire. according to people there were hundreds of billions of lights in the sky some of them were lights within lights all colors imaginable. But the animals ran in sheer fright and the ones who didn't run; all died. The vets who come into the area said that many of the animals died as if run to death. Many farmers in the area lost thousands of dollars in livestock and crops. Other people fell dead thinking that it was the end of the world. There was the meeting of the townspeople and all of them wonderd what had happend that day. Someone told that a child had been born exactly seven hours earlier in Menora hospital of Kansas City Missouri.  The child's home was where all of the lights were seen above.  Many of the farmers in the region lost their livelihoods and were deeply bitter.  It was the night of devestation. Very few if any are alive today to talk about it. Most people do not want to talk of it. Most people deny anything happend. But they didn't want it to happen again. Funny about all of this is that the man of the house on this farm said that he went to bed at eight o clock. Most of the animals he had down at the barn consisted of Beagles and if there had been anything strange going on the head dog would have made a racket about it. The next morning; all of the dogs were fine the females with their puppies were all fine. The man didn't say anything but listined to everyone at work talking about what happend in the night He thought everyone was crazy.  Although he did look around the yard and found cow patties on the ground and several hoof marks and paths going up and down the pasture but still, none of the dogs knew anything about it.  So that is one of the stories right there.  If there is anyone who is out there who knows more about what happend may they enter their findings here. Any information on this wierd incident would be welcome. ITs here to either be proved or disproved. all entries are welcome. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We would welcome more information, or newspaper articles, about the alleged incident.  Does anyone else know anything about this event?  PD))",,38.3583,-93.2972

The location was Valley Station, Kentucky, about ¾ mile east of Pond Creek on a lightly traveled road with houses and fields.  We were checking out the moon and stars. I tried to sight in a large yellow star directly above us but I just could not get the proper angle, so I shifted the scope to a bright star more along the horizon to the southeast. I was adjusting the focus, with one eye on the eyepiece, and the other eye looking at the ground. My friend started yelling, ""Look"" and at the same time I noticed the ground started to take on a yellow glow.  I looked up and there was an oval shaped glowing and humming craft above us. The craft was about 50 foot by 40 foot and about 15 foot tall at the peak of the center.  It was hovering about 15 feet above the tree top, approximately 100 feet above the ground and slightly to the south of us about 10 feet. It was somewhat elongated (left to right) and the outer edge of the craft was beveled or rounded and had 3 windows along the edge I saw, and the orientation of the craft did not change very much so I don’t know what the other side looked like. The windows were about 1.5 foot wide by 1 foot tall and they were somewhat oval shaped with a bluish white florescent glow inside, but I could only see slightly inside and saw nothing other than a white overhead. There were some sort of recessed/level red lights around it.  We could feel the heat from the craft, no smell other than heat, and as the very low hum rose in pitch, the glow changed from dark yellow to a golden color.  There appeared to be some sort of burnt crusty material on the under surface that was a slightly darker glow. As the hum rose in pitch the craft glowed golden, and then slowly moved about 300 feet to the south over a field. A bright spotlight came out of the bottom of the craft and it scanned the hills from east to the north and stopping directly on us.  The light was of the intensity of a carbon arc search light even thought the light housing was about football size. After the light shown directly on us for about 5 seconds it turned off and the light was retracted inside. The hum then increased rapidly in pitch, the glow was almost white, and the craft raised and move to the west at an ever increasing speed. As it approached the creek something that looked like a chunk of the crusty material from the bottom fell (nobody could find anything) near the creek. As it moved rapidly off to the west in a straight line, it abruptly changed course about 30 degrees to the northwest and faded off into the distance at an incredible speed. Total time: 6 to 7 minutes. From the time it started to move to the west were screaming for my family to come out and see it but they were too late.  We gave my family all the details and I drew a picture of it.  The next day my Aunt, who was visiting one of my uncles at a nearby house, told my mom she saw it too. The one thing about this that still sticks in my mind was the exit. As it changed course, it reminded me the way a stick looks when you put it into a bucket of water, how the image appears to bend. I have not told many about this, because I didn’t want to be ridiculed.  I am getting old now and thought this may be useful to someone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,,
3 hours in a UFO.,New Kensington,PA,,disk,3 hours,"Occurred : 6/15/1965 19:00 Reported: 7/22/2004 1:52:48 PM 13:52 Posted: 7/25/2004 Location: New Kensington, PA Shape: Disk Duration:3 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38259.html,"3 hours in a UFO I was 14 at the time, skate boarding with 2 of my friends. We were coming home down an alley in the back of our house.  There was an empty lot next to my house with a large elm tree about a 100 feet tall at the far end of the lot.  I use to climb that tree a lot because it had a lot of branches where I could hide and spy on the people down below.  As we reached the empty lot, we all gazed up, because something caught our attention.  It was a real UFO hoovering above the tree line.  I could see into it through a window that looked as if the blue,gray metaled UFO had opened by making that part of it transparent.  There were no hard edges or frame like regular window.  It was if it was all part of the ship but could make that part of it see through.  As I gazed up at it, I was unbelivably exited.  There were many sighting in our suburbian town through out the years and I was finally looking at one close up.  Little did I know, how close up I really would get to see.  I started waving at it as if to say, please give me a ride!  I really did want a ride in it and I knew that they knew what I wanted. I could see two beings looking out the window at me.  They appeared human.  One was taller then the other.  I could only see sillouquettes though.  They appeared to be a darkened gray.  They didn't look like the grays so often described. they just looked like regular humans pearring out at me.  I could only see them from the waist up.  I felt that they were reading my mind and that I could feel that I was being acknowledged when I was waving both my hands up high to get there attention.  My two friends were beside me, one on each side.  They were gazing up at it also.  I commented to them, we are actually seeing a real UFO! They looked as if they were paralized.  They didn't move at all, just staring up at it. I couldn't understand why they weren't as excited as me.  They just stared at it with plain faces. I was so excited about it, that I didn't let it bother me to much.  This thing had my full attention and I wasn't about to let it out of my sight for a second afraid it my dissapear before my eyes.  As I shout for joy at it, I examined it close.  It was bluish gray in clor except for it's underside.  In the middle taking up about one third of the bottom was a round glowing reddish black, pulsating, what I formulated was it's engine. It glowed and pulsated every half of a second from a deep red to a deep black,red.  It reminded me of a red bike reflector and had the same texture.  It portruded out from the rest of the ship, not a lot, but made it distinct from the rest of the ship.  It to looked as if it were all one piece with the ship.  It was simply beautiful in my eyes.  It was completely round with a domed top where the window was located half way down.  It was half way down from the top of the dome to where it  blended in with the main body of the ship.  I could see no other portholes or marks on it.  It was smooth all around and the domed top was about as high as the rest of the body.  As the engine pulsated, I could see that the rest of the underside did not take on the reddish glow of the engine.  It remained it bluish gray color.  It didn't make a sound. It was a little errie but I was to excited to think was green little Mars men.  They made me feel very comfortable as if they were my friends and would harm me.  I stood there about a minute or at least it seemed about a minute.  I could see both my friend on either side of me still just starring at this beautiful object.  Then the next thing I remember is looking at this UFO leaving me.  I was completely turned around, my two friend were now together to the right of me still looking into blank space as I was waving good bye to it.  My two friends, Craig and Joey were just starring up at nothing as if they were paralized. I myself was very saddened by this UFO leaving me.  I remember feeling sad but also at peace as I waved good bye to it.  I felt a lonely type of feeling as if saying good bye to a good friend or freinds.  The UFO was now smaller appearing because it was higher up in the night sky when I first noticed it again. I thought it very strange, because I was facing a different dirrection then my two buddies. I could see them out of the corner of my eyes as I was waving good bye. The UFO was no longer a UFO to me.  I could identify it and I saw it's occupants. I knew that I was a witness to the most extroidenary event I would ever see with my own two eyes.  I watched as the ship zipped away going faster a nd faster as it seemed to dissapear around a three quarter moon.  It left a tracer behind it as it first went straight the curved around to the dark side of the moon.  I didn't want it to go!  I heard them say good bye to me in my mind as if they knew I needed that. I stood there for an instant and then turned to my two buddied.  They had just awoken up from this deep trance that they were in. I reminded them again of this spectacular event and all they could say as we didn't see anything.  I thought they were teasing me but they weren't.  They looked at there watches and commmented that they were going to get killed for being so late.  They had a curfew, where they had to be in their doors at 7:00 pm. were there at 7:00 pm, because at that time of year it got dark around 7:00 pm., but it was now 10:00 pm. and that's why they were scarred. I couldn't believe it was 10:00 pm. ((name #1 deleted))  and ((name #2 deleted)) were both on curfews but I wasn't.  My parents let me stay out till 10:00 If I wanted. It was vacation time from school in the summer so I was always aloud to stay up later except when school was back in.  Anyway,  They told me that they had to get it or they would be in bigger trouble by their parents.  As they were leaving, I said I would come over early the next mourning to talk about it.  They, didn't acknowledge me, they just ran home, which was right across the alley way to their house.  I went home thinking did this really all take place.  My mother was up waiting for me. She asked me where I was.  I told her all about what had happened.  Some how we had lost three hours out there and I wasn't about to forget any of it. My mother didn't act to surprized but listened intently.  I couldn't wait to get up the next morning to got to my friends house and relive this fantastic experience. I went to sleep and got up early.  I went dirrectly over to Craigs house. He got in trouble and wasn't aloud out the whole day, but he did come to the door. I ask him about the UFO. HE said he didn't remember seeing it. I was beside myself.  I ran over to Joey's house. He to was grounded and he to said he didn't remember seeing any UFO.  Now, I thought I was going crazy.  I ran home, I knew I wasn't crazy, I knew I saw it and I could notr deny it. It was clear in my mind as if it had just happened.  I told my mother that my two freinds don't remember seeing it. She said don't worry about it because it had made front page news in the news paper and that several people had seen it going across the sky of our town. I jumped for joy, just knowing that I wasn't crazy and then I felt at peace again. I said see mom, I wasn't lying, I really did see it. Later that month, I started to remember other things as clear as a bell.  I remembered being inside of this UFO.  I was sitting on a silver colored bench.  Next to me were two adults, just sitting there, starring, like my freind were when they were fixed on this UFO without moving a muscle.  I said Hi to them, but they didn't say anything.  They just starred straight ahead.  The bench was about eight feet long and was curved around what seemed to be the roundness of the ship. It was blocked off on one end to the left. On the other side it seemed to go on following the circumfrence of the UFO. I looked up straight in front of me and I saw two humans standing in the interior of the UFO. ONe was a man about 6 feet tall and the other was a beautiful women about 5 foot 8 inches tall. They both had on silver grayish jumpsuits but was formed to their body not to loose or not to tight. I could see that it was all one piece. Even their shoes were a part of their appearal. It had the same color as the outside of the UFO. There was no collar to the suit but it was up to the neck near the bottom. She had brownish blond hair and long and flowing down to about one third her back. It was shinny and very pretty to look at. She was very pretty and she smiled at me. He was very handsome and had blondish color hair. They both had very blue eyes that were warm as they looked at me. I got up off the bench and walked towards them seeing the other two just sitting there starring. As I walked over to them the man was standing across from a wall of the dome. He was moving his hands across and down what seemed to be a panel of some sort. It didn't have much to it, but what ever he was doing was like a waving motion over it. She was standing to the right side of him and then came around toward me. She gave me a hug, which made me feel very welcome. She then moved back toward the wall and was also doing something like waving her hands over a panel. He moved away from the panel and motioned me with his hands to move to the left. As I did I could see a window. it was panoramic in shape and about waist high. I guess it was about 4 feet by 15 feet across. I could see stars. Millions of them. They were very clear, clearer then I've ever seen them. I walked closer to the window. I felt as if I were watching a movie in a movie theatre but much more clearer. I felt like I could touch these stars as they slowly moved across my view. I knew we wer moving in outer space. We must have been going very fast because the stars moved to the left and right of me as we went forward. They were like diamonds. The window was deffinately all one piece of the ship. there were no rivets or bolts of any kind. The window blended in with the rest of the ship. Even though it was rectangular in shape, it had no blunt or deffinate frame, just as it looked to me from outside the ship, looking up at it. I knew I was now in this UFO and the pilots were giving me the ride of my life. I was so excited, I just felt at peace and that these two beautiful people were ansering my request. They appeared to me a perfect people. Now, that I'm a 53 years old and very religeous, I could identify them as looking like two resurrected personages. I could see not one flaw on their faces. They seemed very happy with each other. I had the feeling that they were married and that they were husband and wife. When they looked at me, they always looked contented and that they enjoyed what they do. The window of the space ship contoured around the dome. I could feel the impression that I was in the the same space hip as I was looking at from down below. I felt very comfortable and at ease. I knew they would not harm me in any way, that they just wanted to please me. The next think I remember is waving good bye to them, not wanting to leave. I didn't even think of my family then, I was to caught up in this great venture I was taking. I often remember this incident over and over again. It ist till this day so very clear in my mind. However, I don't recall anything else that happened during my three our ride. One day I will and just hope it was a fuylfilling as what I did remember. I will never forget it and since then I have seen many sightings of UFO's, some golden egg shaped, some ball shaped and others just round. My children also have seen them many times. My daughter also had a very close encounter of one bluish shaped UFO that came right down the street when we lived in the San Bernardino Mountains. It flew right over her and my wifes head, only about 10 feet above. She said if she were as tall as her mother, she could have reached up and touched it. But that is another real story I can tell later. I know they exist. I know who they are and where they come from. I also know more about them, probably then most people know. That doesn't make me special. I have just been told and it sets my mind free to live a productive, happy and informed life. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Believe the event happened around the second weekend in May, 1966, but I am just now reporting it.  You may verify the event as reported in the Chattanooga Times, approximately the second weekend in May, 1966.  Attending a house party (hosted by the Jr. Optimist Club) with a group of high school juniors and seniors from Chattanooga, a group of us were sitting around a campfire in an outdoor clearing, with one girl playing the guitar and others of us sitting around the fire.  Adult chaperones were present.  In the background at a distance of about two to three hundred yards was a ridge; a dense forest in front of that, with a lake.  Looking up at the sky (unable to tell the direction), I noticed two egg shaped objects that appeared to be about the size of a harvest moon appearing just above the ridge, moving from left to right.  One object was slightly above and ahead of the other.  They appeared to be a silvery-white in color.  Both objects skirted the top of the ridge, keeping equi-distant with each other; traveling very fast.  Suddenly, both objects stopped, and made a 45 degree turn to the left and upward, racing up until they vanished out of sight.  Those of us who were facing the ridge were able to track the event in its entirety; the others turned and looked as soon as we shouted ""Look at that!""  Needless to say, none of us were able to sleep that night, and talked of the event all night long.  Upon returning to Chattanooga, I noticed that The Chattanooga Times ran a short article in their paper referring to Unidentified Objects spotted near Mentone, Alabama. This event can be confirmed by that newspaper report that appeared in the Sunday edition, I believe, of the Chattanooga Times. Would like a reply, by e-mail, as to exact date of the article in the Times, if possible.  (I have moved away from Chattanoog). ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))",,34.5597,-85.5789

We heard what we thought was the wind blowing through a stack of irrigation pipes. It was very loud and strange. We noticed that there was no wind blowing across the pond and the hillsides were only about 20' higher than the water level. We ran to the top of the hill where the sound came from and there wasn't any irrigation pipe to create the sound. The wind was blowing straight down on us, moving the pasture grass as if by a leaf blower and the sound seemed to be coming from above us. We looked up and did not see anything even though the sky was clear. As we stood there the wind and the sound moved off to the east at an increasing rate of speed. We talked about this for awhile with the reasoning of an 11 year old and went back to fishing never bringing this event up again. I never forgot what happened that day and while talking one day about 3 years ago to one of the other persons that was there I brought it up. I said ""You know, we've been friends for over 40 years and there is one thing we have never talked about, you know what that is?"" and he just looked straight ahead and said "" You mean the day we went fishing?"". He just kept looking straight ahead and said he didn't want to talk about it.  Are there any similar reports? I've been curious all of this time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This is more a plea for confirmation rather than an actual report to publish.  The reason I've decided to actually contact someone about this is that I have had memories of this incident that have haunted me for over 40 years that I was never quite sure was real or a dream.  That is, until I mentioned it to my father almost 10 years ago (he died in 1996) and he said it really happened.  I wanted to investigate it then, but was sidetracked.   Then yesterday, my younger sister and I were discussing some childhood memories and she asked me, ""What was that about ufo's at our school?""  I knew it was time to ask someone who could actually find information and probably others who remember this incident.  It happened sometime between March 1966 and June 1967.  I was attending Opa Locka Elementary School in the northernmost part of Miami, Florida.  It was either the end of my 5th grade (66) or during the 6th grade (66-67). This is the memory I have:   Around noon, the police and alot of military (probably National Guard) came and evacuated the school.  There were alot of people standing around watching, but I just remember being escorted from the school because, (I saw this myself) 3 UFO's were hovering over the school yard.  It's funny that the actual UFO's are a blur to me, and the fact that we got to leave school early was the part that I remember being most excited about.  However, I remember seeing 3 objects, oblong but with 3 softly rounded sides shaped alot like a turnover, 1 long side with 2 shorter coming to a point in the center.  This was the shape from underneath not from the side.  They were metallic and very smooth and rounded.  I don't remember any sound coming from them.  There was one hovering over the Portable building, one over the woods just beside the school playgrounds, and one on the other side of the school.  I don't remember seeing that one, but for some reason, I know it was there. Is there anyone out there that remembers this or has any information?  Pictures would be fabulous.  I can't imagine that it wasn't in the Miami Herald.  I have no way to find it myself.  I am also really curious to see how they explained this one.  If my memory is correct, they hovered there for most of the evening.  I don't know how long or anything about their departure.  I really don't remember them arriving.  Just seeing them there when were escorted from the school property.  And now that I know my sister also remembers, I want answers.  Please help if you can.  The military doesn't evacuate schools due to weather balloons. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,,

Moved very little I had just departed DFW International Airport enroute to Little Rock Airport, and we were passing through a Flight Level as announced by the pilot.  I noticed a bright round light in the distance.  Being an Air Traffic Controller I thought this was an aircraft at first thinking it was in a sequence to land with two similar lights behind it, but the lights weren't flashing like most lights on an aircraft at night do.  I thought then maybe it was in holding but the lights weren't really moving. This made kind of look harder at what I was looking at. I thought it kind of strange. They looked very similar to how bright lights are on top of a Radio tower or something but they weren't flashing.  Of course, it was way too high for a tower or a helicopter because of the altitude we were at.  By this time I am pretty sure were around FL 200 or higher. As we flew along what I initially thought to be a sequence into DFW started to look two of the lights came together and one was still in the distance behind it. These lights stayed like this for along time. The longer I looked the lights seemed to be in one spot the whole time.  THey were big almost round spots of light just hovering in the sky.  I looked around in the plane to see if anyone was seeing the same thing I was but no one was. These lights never really moved the whole time I watched and I stared at them til they were just tiny spots in the sky. They moved slightly lateral from each while I saw them.  They were not aircraft and I still cannot to this day figure out what it was.  I waited so long to report because I felt like people wouldn't believe me  or think I was kind of crazy, but after reading the report about the Mexican Air Force pilots and their encounter ( it was in the news not too long ago)...what I saw was very similar to what they saw.

The PGA instructor noticed something cross the screen in less than a split second and when viewed repeatadly, beyond the wall where the golfer was taking his shot from was the sea, then there it was a flat/circular object obviously leaving the sea at speed.  When he first played the movie to me, I said jokingly it was a big fly.  But when the movie was slowed down the object is leaving the sea at about 30 degress and when zoomed in you are able to notice that the object is shedding water. To give you a rough Idea of how fast the object is moving :  The golfer was just starting his back swing and by the time club head had left the back of the ball and was inline with his left foot the object appeared and then disapeaed from view,  If you have played golf before you wil know that the time taken from ball to left foot will be somthing like 100th of a second. The Movie has been sent to scientists and came back that the sighting was defenately a UFO ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-06-04T00:00:00,,

I was parked out of the town near other RV's, there for the winter RV show.  About an hour before sunset, I looked out my window south, to see a huge circular ""ring ""in the sky, over the town, more south west.  This was HUGE, many times over the size of a jet or airplane..  It had what looked like black smoke oulining it, with nothing inside.  What it looked like ,was a UFO type craft, but with the black outlining only.  I ran outside with my binoculars to look, though I could see it very plain without them.  I had no camera to take a picture!  I was trying to get a better veiw of two objects that looked to be parachutes just below the circular ""smoke""ring.  The two  objects below the ""ring"" looked like something was attached.   I ran over to an RV to my left and behind me, to tell them.   At that time, it was still quite visible.  I was wondering, had a plane blew up???  Had someone parachuted out?  But the huge outline, amazed me, as it was in the pattern of a craft, much larger than that a plane, many times! So I told the RV  people who had recently pulled nearby me. They had been drinking, (I had not) they laughed, and asked had I been to Roswell?  They did not seem concerned nor wanting to even look, so I left.  Back at my RV, I looked again, just a bit of ""smoke""remained.  From the RV to my right came a woman to see what I was looking at.  She saw some of the remaining ""smoke"" or outline of the ring.  It had been in the sky some time, about ten minutes approx.   I asked in town the next day about any reports, any accidents of aircraft, none that I could hear of. There is a surveillence balloon  south near Yuma.  I have seen it for years.  It was further south, and east of what I saw.  The parachute objects may have been local ultralights.  If so they should have seen what I saw, unless they did not look up!  I was not going to report this, until I saw the photo from Texas, March 04 on the Coast to Coast Website.

As I neared Davenport, I was about 10 miles west, I noticed a small silver object at about 8000 ft in the air, that was straight North of Davenport. The object was going slow, and then in a burst of speed headed straight South and slowed and stopped somewhere over the Davenport area.  As it slowed, it turned red and had a slight bounce to it. It settled to a stop and continued to glow red.  After several seconds it accelerated and headed back North and within a few seconds it was out of sight, also when it accelerated it turned from red and back into a silver object.  This year, 2004, I again went to Chicago for the labor day weekend. I examined the map of the area that I saw this object over and learned that the Rock Island Arsenal is right directly south of Davenport.  Our so called leaders have assured us that we are in danger of a dirty bomb attack, this could be true, and instead of being made in the Mid-east, it might actually be from the Midwest. I have noticed recently reported  sightings in Kewanee, Atkinson and Prophetstown Illinois.

This report may seem a bit overdue, but it has taken me awhile to analize what I ""saw"".  First, I would like to say something about my background. I was 59 years old when I observed the UFO. I have a Masters degree and was a Professor of Art for two decades , before I resigned to operate an artist studio. I am now a commodities transporter, a professional driver. My wife and I are an owner/operator team of an express truck for a trucking company based in Florida. We deliver loads throughout the United States and Canada. Being a rational person, I have been unable to explain what I saw in this report, only that it was indeed unidentified.  To the best of my knowledge, this incident occurred on October 14, 2002 after we had picked up a load in California.  This trip was to be an all night drive, so sometime around midnight, we turned off of Interstate 15 in Utah, and turned unto Interstate 70 eastbound, heading for Denver, Colorado. In the daytime, the first 50 miles of Interstate 70 is one of the most beautiful drives through a canyon on the interstate system, but at night, this can be one of the lonely stretches of highway in the US. Anyway, it was around 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, I was driving the truck through the Fishlake National Forest area, just west of Joseph, Utah. My wife was asleep in the sleeper, so I was driving in the cab by myself. I was winding my way through the canyon pass. All I could see was the canyon walls, as my headlights swept across them. Then I saw a green light about 50 yards down the road. My first thought was that it was a transformer, of some sort. When, suddenly, this green light passed over my truck. The green light appeared to be a horizontal triangle, with beveled edges. I couldn't see anything around the light. It was pitch black, and there were no other markings or lights. Since this happened so quickly, and due to the fact I was still going 55 miles an hour through a winding canyon pass at night, I could not stop the truck, to see where the object went after it passed over my truck.  However there was one observation that I was able to make: the object was quite small, no wider than my truck. In other words, if this was a flying vehicle, it appeared to be big enough for only one, or two, occupants.  Finally, I would like to mention that I have driven this stretch of interstate twice since then. Once in 2003, and once in 2004. Both trips occurred during the daylight hours. Neither time did I see anything on the highway that resembled what I saw on October 14, 2002. All I saw was a winding stretch of interstate and miles of beautiful canyon walls.

I can't be positive about the shape except that it was a lot longer than it was wide. It had 3 red marker lights in the shape of a funny triangle. It must have been about 300 yards long @ least.

About a year to a year and a half ago while standing outside of my house, I happened to see from almost directly overhead a bright object, slightly brighter than a star crossing the sky at quite a pace. The light was almost constant but did seem to fade in and out as it passed. I've been an avid aircraft enthusiast for many years and I can tell you this thing was moving. I estimate the altitude at between 80,000 and 100,000 ft OR HIGHER!. My reason for this estimate is the fact that this craft made virtually no sound and that I could see a contrail in dashes. It appeared that the craft was so high that its contrail was being illuminated by the SUN. I feel that this craft was right on the edge of the terminator from its location. The contrail seemed to have an even pulse. Also the aircraft was heading Due North (Not your typical satellite path). I could ascertain this from the fact that I can see the Big and Little dipper clearly from the intersection of streets I live on. I estimate the craft crossed approximately 30° of sky in approx. 10 seconds. The craft did not waver or fluctuate in course. It flew perfectly straight to the North.  The only reason I am making this statement now is to see if anyone else may have seen a sighting like this in the North East. I do not believe this craft to be of alien origin but I believe it could be the Aurora. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not specifically state that to be the case.  Satellites generally do not leave streams of material behind them, and they do not cover 30 degrees of arc in 10 seconds.  If the object was, in fact, being illuminated by the Sun, it must have been very high.  PD))",2004-10-27T00:00:00,41.39098647450111,-73.47073769401331

I was driving south on the highway from Victor, Montana to Hamilton, Montana.  Sitting next to me was my girlfriend, and in the passenger seat was her mother. Her mother said ""look at the saucers!""  The distance between the highway and the Bitterroot Mountains to the West was approximately a mile and a half.  The three red-orange ovals, which were lit from within like japanese lanterns, were between us and the mountains.  I would guess their distance at about one half mile from the higway we were traveling on. I would estimate their size to be 150 0r 200 feet in length.  The trio paced us at seventy miles an hour. Just North of Hamilton is a deep canyou into the Bitteroots.  The trio turned as one aircraft and entered the canyon, displaying their thickened saucer shape.  The above incident is only one of several events seen by residents of Missoula and the bitterroot valley during the Summer of 1964.  Check the Sunday supplement  of the Missoulian, the local paper.  It contained a report about a family that saw saucers landing nightly in the pastures around their ranchouse in Rattlesnake canyon North of Missoula.

I have purposely kept this story to myself for 40 years, but remember it like it was yesterday. I was a teacher in a 3 town School District in Southwest Iowa. One day at school all the kids were talking about seeing a UFO that hovered over the gymnasium as the crowd came out from a game.  The same UFO later followed the away teams school bus and the bright light that shown on the bus forced it to pull over. Behind the bus were many parents cars and the chief of police of the away teams town. They were all witnesses. That same night, one of the cheerleaders and her boyfriend were chased by this low flying noiseless craft shining a bright light on them. On arriving at the girl's house, the girls family came out into the yard to see what the light was,, all of these people were witnesses. My friend and I were both teaching at this school, and decided to go out the following night and take our cameras and tripods and see if we could witness what everyone was talkin about. He and I were both very level headed people who did not drink and were born skeptics. We drove along a ""river road"" that was west of Tabor, Iowa, next to the Missouri River. This placed us only a few miles from Offutt Air Force Base (headquarters of the Strategic Air Command) on the other side of the river. As we drove north on the River Road, my friend and I saw what we thought was a greenish yard light at a farm, but then noticed it was moving toward us at a rapid speed. we stopped and got out of the car and began to place our tripods, to take pics.  As we prepared to shoot the pics the UFO which had been traveling south approx. 100 feet off the ground shining a bright blueish green light over the ground, abruptly shot up at a 45 degree angle and behind the river bluffs. When it did this there was no sound except the rush of air around the object.  We got in our car and drove up a bluff road to see if we could  find it at a higher vantage point.  We didnt see anything of it and drove back down to the river road, talking about what it could be. We were out of the car, talking by the  road side, when i noticed to the south, a light moving slowly from east to west in the sky at about  1030 high in the view. It was moving slow then it fell almost at the speed of a falling star,, leveled out and began to move slowly north up along the river banks of the Missouri River. My friend and i immediately set up our cameras, and it continued moving North and just slighly (less than 1/8th mile) to the west of us. it passed us and continued north and during that time my friend and I both took 5 or 6 photos.  then it once again changed directions moving East, for a bit then shoot up almost instantaneously at a 45 degree angle and behind the bluffs again. My friend and I went home to his darkroom and developed the photos. We both had images of the UFO showing arrangements of lights and a vague shape of the UFO.  The next day, I took one of the photos to school. When i had the students in class who had seen the UFO on the nights before, i asked one student who had seen it close to go to the board and draw what he saw on the board. He did,, and then i showed him the photo I took. I asked him if that was what he saw. He enthusiastically said yes it was. All the students who saw the photo that day said that it was what they saw. And his picture looked like my photo. A day or so later, my friend called me and said that his home had been broken into and that the negatives and photos had been taken from his darkroom. Also, his camera had been opened and a roll of film taken from it. (that film was unexposed, but was taken also and the camera left laying open on his workbench) A short time later, the one photo I had disapearred, and my friend and I were kind of in a state of shock. We never talked about it again.  I thought many times to tell the story to someone, but, i honestly had a fear to tell it until this time. Its like something told me not to talk about it, you know? I think that there is something very odd about the fact that out of hundreds of witnesses and very reliable ones at that,, the school bus driver, the crowd coming from the gym, the chief of police of Sidney Iowa that followed the bus  home, teachers etc, it is very odd that this story did not ever get out because i have looked for it in various ways, wanting to know more but being afraid to talk too much. Now Im retired and wish to tell the story, i have a lot more detail, for instance, at the time the school bus stopped, one set of observers said the UFO hovered over the bus and the bus stopped on its own, but others said that the light was so bright the driver had to pull over and the cars behind all took to the shoulder to see what was happening.  My feeling and my friends feelings at the time was that it was something secret that was being tested by the STrategic Air Command. But all these years have gone by, and theres never been any aircraft developed that could do what this aircraft did. The rapid descent and ascent, passing so very close to us, with the river bluffs at our backs, with no echo, no buffetting of prop like a helicopter would have, only the whoosh of air sound,, as it passed, not loud at all almost a whisper. Its been a mystery to me all these years, but I definitely know that there are at least a hundred other people who saw the same craft over a 3- 4 day period. I wish that I had the date exactly, I dropped this from my active conscious thought, as soon as it got too creepy with the film and photos being taken. I can send you a drawing of exactly what it looked like, if you are interested. I would like to know if any of the other people who witnessed this have reported it also. Im not using my friends name, because I know that he,, like me, was not anxious to talk about it.  But now I want to. I dont know how to answer about having an investigator contact me, it asks if  I want that, I dont  object to that, lets put it that way.   thanks.

It was almost dinner time when I was heading home. I looked up to the sky as I was walking home and something caught my eye right away. Since the object was very high in the sky, I had to check my vision my looking at nearby objects such as a tree to reset my eye focus. Then I looked back to the sky and saw the same thing. I saw tiny objects flying in formation heading south, parallel to highway 101. They were solid objects and were not omiting lights. They look like small metalic balls with different colors, flying in formation. They flew in pairs. About 5 total. One flew alone in front and had a pearly red color while the other 4 flew behind it and was a pearly blue color each. The four that flew beind flew in pairs so when you looked at them, you would see the red ball infron by itself, two blue balls behind it, and two more blue balls behind the first pair of blue balls. They were moving and was heading somewhere, not hovering in one place. There was no sound and no trail behind them to indicate it was a high flying aircraft. If it were high flying aircrafts, there would be a distinct siloute, an airplane shape to it. Usually, when you see high flying planes, they either have smoke trails behind them or they fly solo. These balls flew together without any trails left behind them. That was the first time I saw UFOs. Later on I saw a UFO sightings show called ""Sightings"" and saw a story about a similar sighting. They described the exact same thing I saw; the color, and the formation. Everything was exactly what I saw. The sighting on the show was dated around 1920 to 1930. At that moment, I knew that it had to be real since I just saw something that someone else saw more that 50 years ago. It couldnt have been military because I don't think that the airforce from the 1920s would be flying in the same formation in the 1990s. Also, the sighting from the 1920s was seen in a diferent state I was in. I hope that if anyone out there saw the same thing, the same flying formation and color, they should speak up so it can reinforce what I have just said. The more sightings there is in different areas, the more credible it will be. Also, i've continued to research and watch shows on UFOs and havent seen any story of sightings similar to mine. All the sightings describe the same thing, triangles and lights. Mine was different and I still continue to wait to see if there is anymore sightings like mine. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My dad and I were heading up north to go hunting. We were just outside city limits of Bemidji Minnesota traveling north on Hwy 89. We noticed a weird set of lights over a field, but since we only make it up that way about twice a year, we figured it may be a new radio tower or some form of tower that had been errected since we last passed through. As we got closer to where the ""tower"" should have been our conversation changed from ""hunting"" to what that could be in the sky. we came to a point where we were directly across from it. It was a clear night and there was no structure reaching to the sky, just 3 lights hovering above the ground. The lights were in the form of a triangle, and were all white. The reminded me of club lights, because they were tumbling. They never left the shape of a triangle, but they were tumbling, as if spinning from top to bottom. Like if you were to take a popcan and make it tumble top to bottom, from end to end. What was really cool about that is that when the lights would tumble they were as if there was a... that's it, a better description would be a light house. There would be a beam of light that would shine out and then it would be more soft, then beam of light. It's been a while I can't recall if they all tumbled in unisyn, or if they tumbled independent of each other. The craft itself you could not see, but you could see that there were 3 distinct points on it. It was like a triangle, or a flying pryamid. We had pulled over to the side of the road, and watched this thing for about 10 minutes. Two cars passed us by and we waved to them and pointed to the sky in the direction of the object. The cars hit their break lights as they passed, but continued on their way. After 10 minutes the object slowly started to move to the south, then in a blink of an eye it was like a distant star.

I noticed a Florissant police officer had a motorist pulled over to the right of the road and was walking back towards his cruiser.  He was looking up towards the sky near a grocery store with his mouth wide open.  I started to look towards the direction he was gazing and that is when I saw the object.  It appeared to me to be a two story rectangle with very large windows on the side of the object.  It appeared to be very dark or black in color.  I did notice some lights but can’t tell you the exact place they were situated on the craft as it was night and very hard to tell where the edges began and ended.  The exterior lights were bright and seemed to have a bluish hue to them like you see on some of the newer BMW or Mercedes cars.  The object was flying nearly directly over the Schnuck’s market (grocer)  at approximately 100-200 feet ( very low like a police helicopter height ).  The object was almost silent, maybe a slight hum as it flew in front of my car.  What caught my attention in the short time I saw the object was that the interior of the object was dimly lit up enough that I could see inside the windows I described above.  I couldn’t tell much detail other than the interior was massive.  I would estimate the total size of the object to be the size of a football field.  I make this assumption because it nearly spanned the entire roadway ( 4 lanes plus a turn lane ) as it crossed my path.  The strangest thing about my encounter was that as it floated by I noticed movement in one of the rear windows.  I can’t say how many total windows there were on the craft.  In the one I saw into, it looked as if a person was moving from the inside towards the window to look out in the general direction of me and the police officers car with its flashing lights.  I didn’t report this story initially to anyone except I did tell my friends and my now wife the next day after my sighting.  About 3 years later I happened to be watching the Discovery channel and saw a documentary that had several police officers from Ill. Talking about witnessing the same object on the same day a few hours after my encounter.  I have since given my statement to a local videographer  (WWW.DBARKERTV.com) who did some interviews with Melvin Knoll, and the P.O. in Illinois.  Mr. Barker has recently done a video interview with me as well about the incident.",2004-12-03T00:00:00,38.807988732394364,-90.31338873239436

It was clear and a million stars were out when I happen to glance up through my windshield to see what seemed to be flickering sparkles of fire, the kind you see flooting down after a firework goes off! This went on for about 15seconds and behind the flickering I saw a perfect circle of gray so I pulled to the side of the road! NO TRAFFIC was coming as it was a country road and late! I stepped out on my running board to get a better look. I know the gray hole in space was there because it blocked the view of the stars that were just there! When the hole dissappeared an object, completely black began moving notheast at a slow speed not making a sound or non that I could hear. Once again I know it was there because it black out the stars as it moved only to see them reappear as it moved forward! Size was hard to tell but it seemed big with no lights and distance was hard to judge because of night. Then after about a minute 12 objects seemed to come from the object at fast speeds.They were or seemed to be just balls of light that race out in all directions from the craft! I stood amazed as I watched these objects do fast sprints away and back to the object! They could stop on a dime and excellerate to high speeds in as instant! Some would circle the craft as I could see then go behind the craft only to re appear on the other side ! I will never forget it as Long as I live!The big craft just moved slowly toward the northeast with the smaller crafts manuvering back and forth around the craft! this went on for at least 20 mins and I could still see the stars blackening out and re appearing as I stepped back into my truck and drove on to our yard! I should have written to you before now but I know what I saw! I listen to coast to coast and have an open mind!I was just setting here at home watching about oufo coverups on scifi network and felt compelled to write you! I know because of the time factor involved theres not much you can do with my account But i know what I saw was real ! I believe that space travel can be achieved by bending space or worm holes like the one I think I saw that night !Thank you for your time! Firmly a believer since that night.

Lisa and I left Boulder,Co. with our next planned stop to be Las Vegas.  I was driving and Lisa was snoozing.  I remember turning off the a/c and the 8 track tape we'd been listening to and rolling down the windows because it was such a nice calm night driving through the desert.  I noticed quite a few stars out, then an erie feeling came over me.   All of a sudden, to my left, I saw what seemed to me to be 3 very very bright objects or crafts. A bigger one in the middle and two smaller ones on either side.  They all moved in a pattern that I'd never seen before in my life.....  Like all of a sudden they were forward, and then they were back,and then side to side, with the (mother ship?) moving first, then the 2 on the side, moving exactly at the same time.   I quickly woke up my sister (which I really didn't want to do since she was driving me crazy, never shutting up since we left Jersey)   But I needed a witness to this crazy thing I was seeing. I pulled over to the side of Interstate 15 and my sis saw the same thing I saw and said, ""Oh my God""! ""what is that?""    Now the really weird part......I hadn't seen one other car on the highway for maybe 2 hours.  Now, all of a sudden, there was this guy standing at my car window, startling Lisa and I, to say the least. He asked if we were OK and we excitedly yelled ""turn around, look!""  And as he did, the bright lights disappeared. He again asked if we were OK and if we needed anything and we said no thanks. Then he was gone!  The strangest thing about this story was my that sister and I have never mentioned a thing about this to anyone or each other until 2 Christmas's ago at my mom and dad's home in Scottsdale ,AZ, 23 years later. It was as if we were kept silent on purpose, cause our family is very close and very loud and talkative and we found it so so weird that we were just now bringing up the subject.  Just to make sure I wasn't going crazy, I asked Lisa to tell me everything she could remember about that night. and bingo...exactly as I remembered it too.  She even described  the guy at the window to the tee as I remembered.  The unusual things about him were he was very short, barley coming up to the roof of the car, he had on a silver metalic zip up jumpsuit (which I don't know if they even made them yet in 1978) and the deepest set green green eyes you've ever seen.  I didn't think anything of it but Lisa brought up the fact that not many people if any were wearing colored contacts in those days, and there was no possible way those green eyes were his real color.He also had dark skin and the most chisled features we'd ever seen on a person. I also asked Lisa what he was driving that night. She said a motorcyle and that's what I thought too. The only thing was that neither one of us saw him pulling up or pulling away, which seems odd to me being that there was no one else on the road, and no exits off the highway for the longest time. ( I remember this because I thought I was going to run out of gas but thank God a gas station had just opened, because we hit a little part of Arizona on the 15, so instead of 5 am it was 6 am ( they're not on daylight savings time.) So where did that guy come from or go? And why did the lights disappear right when we told him to LOOK!? I was watching a show on Discovery or the History channel tonight on UFO's and it sparked my memory so I found your sight on my computer and thought what the heck, I might as well document our incident, whether anyone believes us or not. One more thing I remember. When the sun came up and the 6 o'clock news came on ,they mentioned that several people had reported seeing UFO'S, the night before, going out of the Rockies and into the dessert. I wonder why no one else has written anything about it? ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2004-04-27T00:00:00,,

We were on a road with very rough railroad tracks so we were almost at a stand-still at the time. Something caught my eye and I looked up.

Too slow it seemed to stay airborne. It had no lights on it and the only sound heard was the sound of something slicing through the air. No motor or propulsion noise. We  were able to make out the shape due to the background lighting. We sat and watched it for 5 to 10 minutes until it disappeared beyond some trees in the distance.

I was driving in my car on I-5 when I saw what appeared to be a craft as large as a jet fighter with heavy metal struts and no lights on floating soundlessly about 200 feet in the air.  I wanted to stop and observe it but it was as if emanations of fear surrounded the craft.  It seems emanations of forgetfulness also came off the machine because I forgot about it until two weeks later when a small article in the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported that a triangular craft was spotted by several people near the Boeing plant between Edmonds and Everett.  It seemed to me that either Boeing had developed an antigravity device or had a balloon that looked like it was made of metal or that Boeing was being observed by some sort of an alien craft.

The craft that I saw was a HUGE boomerang shape.  I still remember it so clearly and have never reported it before because I didn't want people to think I was nuts.  I KNOW what I saw was real and in all my reading, research, etc., can't justify it away with any other answer! At the time, the area we lived in was very rural.  We live about 30 miles south of Phoenix, and in an area with very few homes (3).  We live 15 miles SW of the town of Maricopa.  I was in my house watching TV when my brother in law came screaming up to the door.  When I answered, he just said, ""Look!"" and pointed to the Eastern sky. What we saw at first was what I said looked like planes flying in a V-formation.  He kept arguing.  As we watched, the craft moved in our direction VERY SLOWLY.  Eventually, it came directly over our house.  This thing was HUGE!!!!!!! It was solid black.  It was probably no more than 100 feet above our house.  We live on 3 1/3 acres and the wing span easily reached side to side.  It was moving incredibly slow.  I have been around planes a lot in my life.  This was not a plane.  You could see NO landing gear doors, no rivits on the bottom of the craft, no call numbers, no lights on the wings.  It was very much a boomerang shape with a small tail added to that shape.  I have drawn the shape a 1,000 times since then. As it approached us, there was a single center light inside, more like the irridescent glow of a light...greenish.  I saw no movement inside, just light. The craft continued to move east to west at the same slow rate...we were able to walk at a very normal pace to stay under it.  I walked to our fence line, about 180 feet away, under it and stood there and watched it.  It continued across the desert about a mile past my inlaws acerage, then stopped and turned very, very slowly to the south where it just seemed to sit for a few seconds.  Then it flipped upward, sort of tilted onto its back and was GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't even come close to the speed it left. There was absolutely NO SOUND coming from this craft.  I think I have never been outside at night since, that I have not watched the sky, looking for its return. About a week later, there was a report in a small mountain town to the northeast of us, Morenci, that the same shaped HUGE object was observed during a football game.  I tried to write the paper in Morenci, but never received a response. This was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  I had 2 cameras hanging just inside the door, but was afraid to open the door and go in for fear I would miss something.  I was just AMAZED.  I have kicked myself OFTEN for that choice.  Man, would I love to have a photo of what I saw. Any questions, feel free to email me.  That was not a choice below, but for sure the best way to reach me.

As of this writing of this I am considering attempting making a paper mache replica of this since I still have a very vivid memory in my head of this occurance and desire to understand the craft and its movements like I have never have seen by any craft before or since by someone that used to work at an airport and know of planes fast and slow and none have ever compared to the speed and movement of said ""ufo"" that I had witnessed that life altering night.....there are other people in the skies and foolish are the people who do not believe in other life.",2004-04-27T00:00:00,41.475,-87.6256

My father was a very intelligent man, not one to mistake anything.  So after we walked back to our VW bug talking about what we'd all just experienced and drove down the freeway a bit I began to draw a picture of what I'd seen.  If I remember correctly they were, either all sphere's or some were triangle, some maybe square, and that they were either all different illuminating colors or opalescent/reflective.  They seemed large, out of this world, but right there like fireflies.  Ok, so I give my mother the picture and she say's something like ""That's cute honey but they were much bigger."" and my dad said some thing about them not being colorful, that they were dark black or silver, maybe reflective.  We argued back and forth for a while, and then we all felt weird like they'd gone in saw who we were etc and then erased our memory, or scrambled it.  Perhaps messages that I now see. One thing I know, while we walked back to the bug we all agreed, and knew what we’d seen thought it was awesome etc. and then the memory faded away, very, very quickly.  I wish I still had that picture. When men in black the movie came out and they zapped their memory away, it was funny but real.  I’ll write of my most recent soon.

My stepson (he was 12)and I went to sit on the beach above the lake and were just talking and watching the sky for ""shooting stars"".  Now and then we'd see a satellite pass.  I might note that the sky was clear, stars very bright, as the lake runs for miles in a north-south direction with mountains jutting high on the sides ... no lights other than Nature's. Anyway, one of us points out what we thought was another satellite, but moving a bit slower and with a slight coloration to it .. I want to say a mottled orange.  It came from the east, and as we watched, it would have passed directly east/west, when it suddenly changed direction 90 degrees and passed over us going due north.  What was a mind blower at the time is that it never changed speed, but made the turn while maintaining velocy.  It disappeared over the horizon to the north. We joked about the aliens being all jammed into one corner of their ship from some neophyte driver's hard right turn, as he wanted to go visit Santa Claus.

This is the second report I have submitted to your site. My first report is dated 10/24/73. But I had seen something a few years before that. This sighting occured on July 4th, but I am not completely sure of the year. I was around 15 years old, which would have been 1969.  At that time I lived in Jacksonville Beach, Fl. which is located on the Atlantic Ocean. Every year on the 4th of July my town would have a spectacular fireworks display, better than many large cities. They would shoot the fireworks out over the ocean. Huge crowds would gather every year, sometimes as many as 100,000 people.  It was near dark and I went out in my driveway to look at the sky. If it was dark enough, I was going to walk down to the beach to see the display. The sun had either gone down or was behind the distant treeline, but it was still fairly light.  As I was looking up I saw a very strange Flying-V object. It had 4 or 5 bright red flares on each side connected by what appeared to be narrow black tubes. It was flying the way you would expect a V shaped object would, with the point going first. The flares looked like the red flares you often see on the 4th of July that glow brightly and float down slowly. The little tubes were narrow and very black. It reminded me of Tinker-Toys when you connect those round wood shapes with the longer rods they provide you. This object was very low in the sky. I would estimate it was only 100 feet high at most. It flew directly over my head, heading due North. This object did not look large at all. I would estimate its wingspan at maybe 8-10 feet. Somehow it reminded me of a box-kite. It also made a ""sizzling"" sound, sort of like when you fry bacon. Also, faint wisps of black smoke were floating off the flares. I would estimate this object was traveling at 15-20 miles per hour. I could see it plain as day.  At first I thought it was some sort of new firework that I had never seen before. But it was strange. I could not figure out what was making it move through the sky. It was not shooting fire out the back or anything like that. And the faint smoke coming from it was not shooting backward like a form of propulsion, but just floating away from the red flare balls. I continued to watch this object, expecting it to eventually descend. But it did not. It maintained a steady altitude and speed. That was what really got to me. It just kept on going. I knew no firework could do that. I continued to watch this object until it sailed out of sight to the north. I watched it for at least 2-3 minutes and it never did come down. Finally it grew so small and disappeared from my view.  This object did not scare me like other objects I would see years later. It did not appear to be a craft that could be manned. It was just these balls and rods. It had no body to it at all. But it was under some type of control.",2004-07-25T00:00:00,30.280529411764707,-81.40465
One thousand saucers observed telescopically crossing the sun over a ninety minute period.,New Orleans,LA,1971-07-10T14:00:00,oval,90 minutes,"Occurred : 7/10/1971 14:00  (Entered as : 07/10/1971 14:00) Reported: 7/22/2004 7:41:45 PM 19:41 Posted: 7/25/2004 Location: New Orleans, LA Shape: Oval Duration:90 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38264.html,"One thousand saucers observed telescopically crossing the sun over a ninety minute period. My sister, cousin, mother and I all were witness to an event where over one-thousand UFOs crossed the sun one bright summer day in New Orleans, Louisiana. (They were viewed telescopically as they crossed the sun’s disk (details below).  The day was a usual clear blue sky scorcher, and being an avid amateur astronomer, I spent much of the day and night just looking around the sky and keeping notes. It was 1971 and I was 13 years old.  The summer was typically boring, and so I tried out my 2.5 inch refractor telescope given to me by my parents a couple of years earlier on sunspot observations; once again, I borrowed a chair from my mother’s kitchen, and placed a leftover poster board (they were only white in those days) on the chair to accept the image from the telescope eyepiece. This way everyone could enjoy the huge image of the broiling sun at the same time as me and I could leisurely sit in the chair I had taken from my desk to make notes and sketch sunspots. This was the umpteenth time I had done this and so I was the only one watching when the event started, interest from the rest of my family having waned over the last many times I had performed this type of observation.  After several hours of watching and sketching that June day in 1971, I noticed a small black dot cross from right to left across the sun’s disk. Being experienced at seeing planes, birds, and insects fly by I was initially puzzled by this rather non-descript and slowly moving object. It took about 5 seconds to cross and was about 1/40 of the sun’s apparent diameter on the poster board. This made the object about a half inch in length. My curiosity increased when a second object began crossing from the right just before the first one exited on the left side of the sun’s disk. I immediately refocused the refractor to get the crossing object better focused, as it had a well defined gray annulus around the black center. Interestingly, the focus for the sun (essentially infinity) was the correct focus for the object! Before the second object exited the sun’s disk to my left (after crossing about 4/5 of the sun’s diameter), a third object entered from the right. Each of these objects were identical; they consisted of a black (matching the center of sunspots, essentially) lozenge shaped center, surrounded by a uniform thickness, very sharply defined gray annular ring. The lozenge length to width was about 3 to one, and the annular gray ring was slightly less than half the thickest (center) part of the black shadow. (In reviewing the sighting afterwards, I took a dish from my mother's cabinet and found that if one held the dish so that it was about 30 degrees from edge on, the projected shape roughly matched the objects I had sighted.)  The three objects all exhibited the same shimmering that the sun’s disk and sunspots exhibited, indicating they were far enough up in the air (or out in space?) to be affected by the atmosphere in the same way stars twinkle. I was watching in the afternoon and so my refractor was angled about 45 degrees above horizontal to start with, and about an hour and a half later (after the last object had crossed), it was less than 30 degrees. After another half dozen or so had crossed the face of the sun and cast their shadows on my poster board, I had enough data to enable me to leave the scene and gather my family as witnesses. My cousin and sister were playing outside at the time (they were about three years and two years younger than me, respectively), and so I brought them to the telescope to see what was happening. Being only 10 and 11 years old, their interest waned after just three crossings, since the scenario remained identical; just prior to one object leaving the  disk to our left, another entered from our right, over and over. After less than a half minute, they went back to whatever they were doing before I coaxed them into watching “that boring stuff Herbie does”. I yelled for my mom to come see; we lived in one of those duplex shotgun houses in New Orleans; they were called shotgun houses because you could fire a weapon from the front room and it would go all the way through to the one bathroom at the rear without hitting any wall but going through the open doors of each of the four rooms (after the front room, the parent’s bedroom, then the children’s bedroom, then the living room, then the kitchen). It was easy to yell for her even though she was all the way back in the kitchen. Her reply was typical of when I asked her to come see something – whether through my microscope or telescope; a delaying action born of many observations of relatively boring (to her) objects. She said she was busy and would be there soon.  I asked her to bring the camera (a box black and white) so I could photograph the sun’s disk and these crossing objects, and again she said she’d be there soon. After about an hour I had to relieve myself (one does drink fluids in New Orleans on a hot summer day!) and so I asked my sister to take over and watch if anything changes. I took the opportunity to implore my mother to come see again and after I returned to the refractor and the objects passing (my sister had already abandoned her post to go play again) she showed up without the camera, saying it had no film. She watched for about 30 seconds and then went back to the kitchen, apparently as uninterested in the whole thing as my sister and cousin; it didn’t affect anything that day (or even for the conceivable future), and so I alone was left to the task of watching what I could only assume were alien visitors from space moving from one place to another in single file in their flying saucers.  About 90 minutes after the procession started, it ended. Not as abruptly as it started, however. At first near the end there was no follower to the object exiting to the left side of the sun’s disk where it should have been, but then another would show up timed as if there had been the ""missing"" object, and followed appropriately by the next object entering from the right as the prior object exited to the left. This occurred several times before no more objects entered or exited the sun’s image.  Altogether I estimated 1,080 (that’s one-thousand and eighty, give or take) had passed between my 2.5 inch objective refractor telescope with Barlow lens and the sun. Near what was to be the middle of the event, or about 45 minutes into the procession - the density of crossing increased several times. At one point there were five objects ""on screen"" at the same time. A single object entered from the right, as usual when the prior object was nearing its exit to the left, when a pair of objects entered shortly after. The top object in this pair was in line with the boring procession as it had unfolded for the last three quarters of an hour, but the companion was below and to the rear, offset about half the length of one of these objects and down about the width in close proximity. When the single object had reached the spot where another object entered opposite it on the sun’s face, another object did enter, and was followed almost immediately by another (fifth) object. This train of discs continued across, followed by four in line objects, and then the pattern returned to normal, with only two objects on the sun's face at any one time (until the end of the event, of course).  Also during what was to be the middle of the event, I tried to detect the objects before and after they crossed the sun proper, by moving my telescope just off to either side of the sun and looking directly out into the clear blue sky. I saw nothing through the refractor (neither directly or cast on the poster board), nor did I see anything with the naked eye as I shielded my vision with my hand from direct sunlight.  Were they ours or theirs? Earth made or made somewhere else? I don’t know. However, subsequent to this observation, I read in a Charles Fort book that a Mexican astronomer by the name of Bonilla had witnessed a similar train of shadows in 1883. More recently, I have found several other astronomical sightings through the internet that resemble my 1971 event (though with far fewer numbers) and I have done some back of the envelope calculations using elementary trigonometry that shows the objects would have been about 100 feet in diameter if exo-atmospheric. Additionally, the difference in girth from a thin plate held at an angle and the thicker, lozenge shape of these objects I found could be explained if they had some thickness to them.  There are other analyses and minor observations related to this event, but these are best left for a later time, as this e-mail has gotten way too big already!  If anyone else has heard of or seen such things, I would appreciate feedback. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-07-25T00:00:00,29.96590338078292,-90.0784456405694

It was the summer of 1972-1973, I don't remeber for shure, I was 12 to 13 year's old that year and was living in the small town of Hudson, Ks. School had just started about a month ago, it was a Sunday evening sometime between 9 to 10 pm. Three freind's and myself where playing on some large sandpile's that the county had put beside the highway on the southeast corner of town getting ready to oil the blacktop. The four of us where trying to enjoy the last few minute's of our weekend before having to go back to school the next day, by playing a game of war by throwing small dirt clod's at eachother as we ran around and over the sandpile hiding and trying to get into a good position to throw a clod at someone. I was somewhere on the south end of the pile's, ((name #1 deleted)) and ((name #2)) where on the west side and ((name #3 deleted)) was on the east. We where all having a good time when suddenly Kyle stood up and pointed to the west and said what is that, (and got hit by sevral clod's) I stopped and looked to the west and noticed two redish\orange light's in the sky. Ed and Randy looked too and we all ran over the sandpile to the east side where Kyle was and all got down on our stomach's where we could just see over the top and watched the light's come closer. After a minute or two we got up and moved to the south side of the pile's and stood next to the highway to where we could get a better view of what we where seeing. As they came closer the two light's that we where watching took shape. The redish\orange round light's turned as they came closer to us a kind of arrowhead shape, but with rounded end instead of coming to a sharp point's. The closest shape I've seen to the shape of these thing's are the shape of the starfleet insigna pin's on the uniform's of the crew of the old Star Trek tv show. As we where watching the two craft come closer Kyle again spotted another craft that was coming behind the other two and a little lower. It was quite clear by now that these where not just light's but some type of craft. All three craft where travling from west to east in a straight line and maybe some 500 or 600 feet up by my best guess. Just to the north are two big grain elevator's and flour mill where  Hudson Cream Flour is made  and our town is known for stand. And I would say that if these craft where traveling in line with the elevator's they would of had to move up in altitude or fly around them they where that low. The first craft was traveling in a line that would take it on a path some hundred feet north of us, the second craft was right behind and to the south of the first and the third craft was about a quarter mile behind the first two and maybe a hunderd feet lower but in line with the first two. As the first two got close to the w! estern edge of town the third craft that was behind the first two sped up and caught up to the first two to where it was some fifty feet and right in line behind the first one. As I said they where arrowhead shaped and a redish\orange in color, and they pulsated bright and then dimmer slowly, and you could see that the shape of them seemed to be a solid redish\orange but made of light, then extending outward's was a lighter dimmer corona of light ray's coming out from the more soild core. You could'nt see a edge  or the hull of what would be a solid body to the craft, just light as if the where made of light only. There where no door's window's or seam's to the shape, nothing that you could see that would help you in being able to say what was the front back top bottom of them other than there overall shape and the direction of there flight, with the point narrow end pointed to the east in the direction of travel. The craft where some onehunderd feet long, fifty feet wide at the widest and some twentyfive feet tall, from my best guess. As they pasted over there was no sound at all from them, but you could kind of feel the pulsing in the center of your chest as they grew brighter and then dimmed. As the craft passed the last one being the lowest was so close that I could of thrown a dirtclod and hit it if I would of thought to. The night of the sighting was a calm clear summer eaving, the sun was just a dim  glow on the western horizon, the star's where out and no cloud's or wind at all. When the craft where first sighted by Kyle the first two where about a mile west of town and some twohunderd feet north of the highway that run's west\east threw the south end of town. After they passed over head we watched them travle east of town some two and a half to three mile's. The total lenght of time of the sighting was about twenty minute's or so. They flew very slowly, from watching plane's mainly crop duster's that flew over the feild's when I was a kid and later in life seeing hot air ballon's fly, I now know that I have never seen any type of craft that fly's move so slowly. Not plane's, hotair balloon's, or even toy ballon's move this slowly, maybe a helicopter in a slow foward hover could but not without making a lot of noise and generating a lot of wind. And when the craft got to the far east of there flight path they all three at the same time kind of turned there nose's northward and uppward to the northeast very slowly and just took off at a very hi rate of speed to where they just where gone in less than a second in a streak of light. And one strange thing about the way they moved as they made there turn, they did'nt make a banking turn like a plane would dipping one wing and moving in a arc changing there direction of travel and position together to make the turn. These craft moved from some center point moving there nose's to the north and uppward to the northeast, but there direction of travel continued straight eastward it was most strange and unlike any aircraft I've ever seen make a turn while in flight. And just when the nose of the craft finnished the move to the northeast to change corse for a new direction of flight they just accelerated very fast in a streak of light until in less than a second they where lost in the star's in the sky. We all stood there for less than a minute and without saying anything to eachother just turned and went to our home's. The next day after school we all came together and walked with eachother not talking for a short time when Kyle said what was it we saw last night, and I remeber Ed replying, they said we wasn't suppost to talk about it. And we all seperated and went our own way to go home. And we never talked about it again. It was not until year's later when I was in my early twenty's that I even remebered or thought about this sighting until after I reading a book on ufo's for something differnt to read. Before reading the book I never had any intrest in ufo's or anything that was outside the norm? And now year's later I wonder about what we saw that night and I wander even more about who Ed was talking about when he said they said that we wasn't suppost to talk about it. All of this in this statement is the truth as best I am able to rember. And I belive that it was a real event that I shared with three freind's in a small Kansas town one summer eaving. What was it we saw and who they where that  Ed eluded to I have no ideal. But after much reading on the subject of ufo's and alien's and remebering other sighting's and thing's that happened to us a kid's I can't  help but to think that maybe they are here and sometime's visit small town's in Kansas for whatever reason..

The light chased us.,Hudson,KS,1974-10-10T23:00:00,light,One hour?,"Occurred : 10/10/1974 23:00  (Entered as : 10/10/1974 23:00) Reported: 7/18/2004 4:12:00 PM 16:12 Posted: 7/25/2004 Location: Hudson, KS Shape: Light Duration:One hour?",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38195.html,"The light chased us. It was a winter night in maybe the year 1973 or 74. There where four of us boy's out coon hunting in a group of tree's that has a boy scout camp in it call Camp Boonee. There was four of us hunting that night Ed, his younger brother Mike and Randy and myself we had I think 3 or 4 coondog's with us and where just getting into the hunt. We had ran the dog threw the wood's of Camp Boonee and where going to cross Hudson Rd and go to the east side of the road to another small group of tree's to hunt a bit. It was when we got some twenty to thirty feet to the edge of the road when a very bright white light came on up in the sky somewhere just above the tree top's. It was very bright and lit up the ground and the tree's cast shadow's on the ground and if you look right at the light it would hurt you'r eye's to do so. Well this scared us all and we ran a way's westward back into the thicker part of the tree's for cover and when we did so the light went out. We all stoped in a group and where looking around to see where the light might of gone but could'nt see it anymore. So we all continued west with the ideal of coming out on the west side of the tree's and then circle back to the east along the north side and come back to Hudson Rd then head back north on the road and go back to Hudson and go home. But as we got close to the west side of the tree's the light again came on above and in front of where we where, scaring us again and we all ran back into the thicker part of the tree's for cover once again. And while we all where running for cover the light went out and when we stop in the center of the tree's to take a look around we could'nt see it. So we all just crouched down and waited a while looking and listening, trying to figure out where the light had gone. It was while we where all crouched down around this big old cottonwood tree looking around for this light we then saw it come on and shine down to the gound some few hundered feet to the south and east of where we where. Did it think m! aybe it had found us or maybe one of our dog's or some other animal? Well after about half a minute of so the light went out and we couldnt tell where it had gone. After setting there for maybe twenty or thirty minute's or so but what seemed to be all night we all got up and went threw the tree's to the north and east and then came to the road and fallowed it north back to town and all went to our home's.  After thinking about this some year's later it is still a mystery to me. The light that shone down on us that night was very much brighter than any kind of spotlight that I have ever seen, it was almost as bright as if the sun was shining in just a small beam of light some fourty feet around when it struck the ground. It would hurt you'r eye's to look right at it for very long. One might think that maybe it was some spotlight or bright flashlight from some other hunter's or some farmer looking to see who might be in there tree's, or even someone just playing a joke on some kid's in the night. But I don't think so, for Hudson is a very small town and we all know everyone and would know if someother hunter's would be out that night. And there is the fact of where the light had shown down from. It was well above the tree's coming down on a slant so that if a person was behind the light they would have to have some way to be up above the tree's and then move from one place to another all without being seen or heard, for all the while this was going on there was no sound from the light. It was a calm clear night with no wind at all. And the only sound's we heard that night was of ourself's runing threw the tree's and our out of breath voice's from the running and fear. And there is the ideal when I have told other's before about this and they sugest that maybe the light or who was shining the light where up on a tower or pole or something? But there are no towers or pole's for someone to be up on at all just the tree's. And on the west side where once the light came down from, beyond the tree's is just open feild's for mile's to the west and nothing that one could get up on to shine the light from. It was not a spotlight from any car or plane or helicopter, for there was no sound at all from any type of machine. Just a light that chased us. The time from when the light first shown down on us to the time where we all came out on the road to go home was maybe a little less than a hour I think but who know's for! shure it could of be much longer.

I was slowly and silently glidding over the hydro lines, I kept watching in amazement, then the second one came into sight doing the same as the first, I could also see small objects twirling around the hydro lines then going up to the ship, then back to the hydro lines.

Then I happened to look up and slightly over to the right, and there was a ufo right above the house.

It was red, and as it made its way towards us, I could tell that it was maybe no larger than the house.  It was red, very red, like it was pulsating, as it had the bright blue sky as a background.  It had no reflection, I remember because I thought that it should since the sunlight was hitting it, any metallic object might reflect.

It was getting dark, so we decided to head home.  We were on a 22ft center console fishing boat.  As we turned the eastside of the island and started heading toward the Angels gate in LA Harbor, I looked to the west and noticed a circular craft in the air at approx. 5000 ft to the north side of the island ( which is actually the front side).  I have been very interested in the UFO Phenomenom for 15 yrs now and have spoken to people concerning the subject.  However I never had a sighting. That is why when I looked up at the object in the sky I kinda questioned it immediately.  It was circular, but taller.  I had extremely bright lights around and on top of it. I watched the object while I held on to the boat( as we were coming in, approx. 14 knots.)   It seemed to hover moving eastward, moving along the frontside of the island.  I couldn't believe that what I saw in the air was not a craft that I could describe.  My brother's a private pilot and we have no problem identifying airplanes and blimps (Goodyear Blimp right down the street).  I am a space enthusiast as well so when this object appeared, I was downright purplexed.  What the hell is that?, I said to my self.  As I said in the duration, I watched the object for a few minutes and then said to the captain and my brother who were also on the boat,  ""hey look at that"".  Immediately the captain said ""that looks like a UFO"".  I almost fell out because he shared the same interpretation as I did, without me bring up the UFO possibilty.  He was driving the boat and it was getting dark so his immediate focus was keeping the boat safe, nevertheless, I kept watching the craft.  Before I knew it, the craft shot straight up into the sky extremely FAST and then disappered.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.  If this was a real sighting , I saw what everyone is talking about.  Please understand this is not a hoax.  I would never spend my time li! ke this over something that did not happen.  I just saw a report of the Mexican 11 UFO's all over the news and it inspired me to report this.  I also have another incident to report, that I experienced traveling south on Pacific Coast Highway in the City of Torrace, CA.  I was coming home from my business and was going home which is in Harbor City. This was approximately 6pm and was in late 2003, before the daylight savings time change.  I was driving normally, traffic on PCH was normal and I had just passed Crenshaw BLVD. As I got to Pennsylvania Ave, I noticed three lights coming from the east going westbound, like they were on approach to Torrance Airport. As I mentioned, my twin brother is a private pilot and achieved his license at Torrance Airport, so I am very familiar with the traffic of planes coming in for landings.  I could help but notice that the two lights on the outside were much brighter and the center light seemed very normal in it's brightness.  I thought ""wow, that guy is coming in very low"".  I followed the lights as they were coming toward me as I traveled east on PCH.  Then the lights shifted like one wing was turning completely over to the otherside, vice versa.  I thought the plane was trying to do an upside down manuver, therefore shifting ( I'm doing my best to describe)  or doing a manuver that would have the lights flip over, like doing a barrel roll.  Right then the I could see that there were now the two bright lights were in front of the normal light. They were only 400 ft above and as the lights came to the leftside of my truck I could see two TEARDROP Black shaped crafts, with one extremely bright light on the very front of the vehicle.  I could not believe what I saw resembled the early versions of a UAV or a sleath teardrop craft, but it did make sense that these vehicles would be right there on PCH.  These vehicles were now inter-weaving with one another and boom they took off almost instantly!  Then came the private plane, probably a Cessna or Mooney.  This ws so off the wall, I could not explain it.  I told my family about the sighting but that was it. I know I never saw any stealth aircraft in the area, an! d have been next to one before.  This was not an F-117, but a formation of two teardrop shaped craft.  This was real for sure.  Please let me know if there were any sightings of these crafts in my area so I can know whats going on.  Remember guys, I'm not joking here.  This is not some student joke or a false report.  This was real and will stand behind everything I have said.",2004-06-04T00:00:00,33.389,-118.4548

A long-time believer in flying saucers, journalist Jaime Maussan told a news conference Tuesday the objects were real and seemed ""intelligent"" after they at one point changed direction and surrounded the plane chasing them. ""They were invisible to the eye but they were there, there is no doubt about it. They had mass, they had energy and they were moving about,"" he said, after showing a 15-minute video he said the Defense Ministry gave him permission to publicize. The ministry confirmed to Reuters it had provided the video, filmed by the Air Force on March 5 over the eastern coastal state of Campeche. ""We are not alone! This is so weird,"" one of the pilots can be heard yelling, after the plane's crew switched on an infrared camera to track the objects, first picked up by radar. The film, recorded by a plane looking for drugs trafficking near the Gulf of Mexico, shows 11 objects as blobs of light that hover in formation or dart about, sometimes disappearing into cloud. Mexico's most popular nightly news broadcast showed the video Monday night. Interviewed by Mausson on another section of the video, the pilots said they grew nervous when the objects, still invisible, turned back during a chase and surrounded the plane. ""There was a moment when ... the screens showed they were behind us, to the left and in front of us. It was at that point that I felt a bit tense,"" said Maj. Magdaleno Castanon. Mexico has a long history of fanciful UFO sightings, most of which are dismissed by scientists as space debris, missiles, weather balloons, natural weather phenomena or hoaxes.

Had just seen a plane fly by and not 2 minutes later saw cruising at the same altitude as the plane had just passed, (I thought first was another plane)an silver egg shaped craft. No noise, no wings and no trail behind it. It was going slower than the plane previously, about 15 sec of viewing time. Smaller part of the egg was flying in front. Didn't notice it until I could see the side and then the back of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-06-04T00:00:00,28.6812,-81.2763

An airplane flew went right by it, so that's how I gauged the size. From my point of view, the plane flew right below it. (The plane, by the way, was leaving a chem trail.) The object didn't move for the time I was out there, which was about 30 more minutes. After I finished playing tennis, I went inside (I live right by the tennis court), got a little telescope and looked at it. Only now it was dark and it was glowing. It could have been glowing the whole time, but in the daylight it looked metallic. In the telescope, you could see the round shape, which rules out a bright star. All I saw was a white sphere; no details. OK, at this point, I was thinking, is this a real UFO? Before I though it might be a weather balloon, except I would think a balloon would move with the wind. It was in the equatorial plain, so I wanted to rule out Venus or some other bright planet, so I went back inside to check. There were no bright planets in that part of the sky at that time.

It had little white port-holes (We couldn't tell what shape, they were so brightly shining.) and they were all across the ship in one big, thick, sideways ""Y"" shape. Anyway, the ship wasn't spinning or rotating, just speeding away. But it was strange, this thing was so bright but didn't light up the sky one bit. So then came the second UFO orb, red, and glaring. But this one wasn't quiet at all. It had the sound of a large, metal bowl, with broken lightbulbs scraping around inside. It was a noise that scratched the inside of our skulls like really gritty sandpaper. And this one was red like lava, with ripples, or two golden bands, one inside the other, all over it. This ship was the same size as the other one, or maybe bigger, and was speeding after it, like it was chasing it. After that ship passed, we waited for the others to come.

I am from Chicago, and live in a flight line for Midway airport in Chicago all my life, so I know planes, hellicopters, etc, from other things.  Plus, have spent the last 12 years in Special Forces in the Navy, so I know that too.   We were at the beach late, waiting for the time for my flight out of Ft. Lauderdale, just relaxing and spending time together before I had to leave at 01:30 hours.  We were laid back on one of the life guard tower platforms which are closed and on an angle, unlike those in Chicago, Cali, and other places, where there are stairs.   Anyway, we had not been drinking; she was just asking when I would make another trip back.  We were looking east across the ocean, talking and thinking, and that's when a single, orange light caught my eye in the distance.  I asked her, ""Is that a light house of some kind?""  But it did not move at all like one would.   She looked and we stared at it, and she wondered as well.  It appeared to be off the coast about 3 miles, maybe less, maybe more, but from projection, about 500' to 1000' off the surface, perfectly static in station.  We watched for a good ten minutes when a spot light projected across the water.  I thought first, police, because parks and lake fronts in Chicago close at 11:00PM, and we were going to be forced off.   YES...I looked or trailing and guiding lights, there were none.  It moved slowly and quietly towards us and to the south of us and then just went blank.  We looked at each other and laughed, almost dismissing it, until she looked north along the beach and we saw 5, yes five more of them just hanging there, north, off the ocean coast, and yes, the city was still alive, espcially since spring break for colleges in the country was just starting.  They too hung there, quiet, motionless, however, none shown direct light, only an ambient glow.  3 faded out!!!  Just there, then gone, and then approx. a mile or less away, one appeared and then the other.  No speed, no streaks, just there one moment and then gone.   We were freaked.  We walked up the beach a bit to see; each one looking at the other in quiet wonder and disbelief.  In 10 minutes they were all gone....no flashing lights, no tail rudder lights, no sounds.  Just there and then nothing.  We spent the next 45 minutes in travel, plus the next days via cell phone conversations asking each other, ""Did you see what I saw?""  We both agreed that we did.   I am not crazy...don't do drugs, quite intelligent, and however I DO believe in other life out there (only a fool would think this would be made for just only us [hence a lot of wasted space]), but I cannot ignore what I saw.  This to me was a change, and when I would read other people's stories about sightings and think they were crazy, well, then I must be just as well.   Take it for what you want, but I was an aero-structural-mechanic in the miitary originally, and did the other thing later...I know aircraft, this was none we have, or anything else.   Well, that's it...I don't know what IS out there, but something more than we are is truly there.

He began to watch the lights as he worked, as they appeared to move periodically then stop. He said he first became aware of feeling there was something feeling in the air which made him look around and see the lights.The light were togather but were not connected.They woud seem to be in formation,as in a triangle, then they would move into another pattern, or would just mold into another triangle with the lights in different places.It seems that there was a slight coloration in two of the lights, but it was subtle color.    Our farm sat on a pretty high hill and had good perspective of the surrounding area,and these lights did not seem to have much altitude.  After finishing the milking my parents brother and I got in our truck to go have a closer look at the lights. The lights were possibly 3/4 of a mile northwest of our farm so we went west to the first road north all the while the lights were clearly visible.  It was maybe 200 feet in the air, and moved from west to east as we approached.  This is a very primitive area of small farms, mostly having an incandescent light on a pole for a yard light if any outside light at all so there was no light contamination from man made sources.   We approached the lights  from the south, and were still to the east of it.  When we got as far north as the road would allow we turned west to get as close as possible.  It was then the lights seemed to get interested in us.  The lights moved east until they were parallel to us.  The movement was fairly quick and noticable, then as we drove slowly west on the road the lights moved parallel to our movement.  We would stop and watch the lights,and they would stop and hover.  The lights were perhaps 400 yards north of us and still roughly 200 feet in the air,but we heard no sounds coming from that direction.  As a matter of fact there was no sound of any kind to be heard. The very air around us seemed to deaden all sound even muffling the sound of our trucks engine. We drove to the next road then turned back south to the highway. The lights continued west for a short distance then turned south  with us only not quite coming to parallel with us this time.  We drove slowly watching the strange lights hoping it would not go away before we got to my grandparents house.  The lights did not come all the way to the highway but was still near enough to be seen clearly when we turned back east onto the highway.  When we turned east the lights turned east with us,but staying three or four hundred yards north of the highway.  The lights stayed with us until we reached my grandparents, but they were not home, so we drove another 1/4 mile up the highway to my aunt and uncles farm where we found my grandparents also. My father went into the house asking everyone to come out and look at the lights. There were 11 people all told with six adults four teenage children, and one younger (8) child.  We all watched the lights for another twenty minutes or more as they hovered in the sky periodically changing shapes,or patterns as though in a silent vacume,devoid of all night sound  you would have on a night in the country,no bug,no farm dogs barking,no cattle bawling....nothing. This was more troubling to all these farm people than the strange lights itself. Finally the lights just left. It didn't zoom away, or shoot up into space they just moved off along the horizon at the same low altitude almost ""casually"". Then they were gone, and soon the noise of night resumed.",2004-09-29T00:00:00,37.325,-93.7101

Didnt make sense so i got back up and put my face against the screen to get a better look.I could make out one full globe with a dull shine and the edges of two more in a triangular position.

It even bleached the road where it had crossed!!! I knew then that i had did the right thing by not reportiing it or making it into a big deal Or going outside to take pictures or signal the stupid thing to hover down and pick me up! I never made jokes about UFOs again and I never wish to see another one.I do know it was real and im totally convinced it was military.

From out of nowhere I saw this fireball appear over the tree tops and fall into the nearby woods. I screamed ""Holy ****!"" My friend turned around and caught a glimpse of it as well. It was really close. At first I thought it was a meteorite although it was the size of a medicine ball at least. Maybe slightly larger. Moments later we both heard a rustling sound in the leaves and the breaking of twigs and branches. Something was moving through the woods towards us quickly. I immediatly felt very strong sense of danger and fear. It scared the hell out of us. We jumped in the truck and locked the doors and took off as fast I could.  I never spoke of this to anyone until recently when I realized that there was no way it could have been a meteorite.

The only reason the lights caught our attention was thier percieved hieght. We both quickly dissmissed them as a low flying airplane. (note: these lights seemed far away and appeared to be moving very slowly.) We turned west off of the north bound road we were travling on. Drove west about 100 yards and turned north into the wooded driveway. The driveway is about 75 yards long and curves to the east to face the house which rests on a hill in a clearing. A soon as we turned toward the house, into the clearing we where both shocked that this aircraft was allready about to fly over us. It was now obvious that this was no airplane. It appeared to be incredibly large. It was creaping overhead very very slowly. My girlfriend started to get out of the car to look at it. I was so shaken I tried to keep her in the car but she pulled away and got out leaving the door open. I then quickly got out too. looking up I couldn't make out the outline or even guess at the total size of the craft. It was a cloudy night and the sky was too dark too contrast between the aircraft and the sky. Not a single sound came from the thing. The air was still. It had a round blue light in the middle and three yellow lights in the pattern of a triangle. If this craft did not have lights it would have been invisable. It creeped over head very slowly and eventually went out of sight over the trees. We looked at each other and the I ran up the hill towards the house to watch it float away. Reaching the front porch I turned around to see the craft....it was gone. I cant understand how something that seemed so large could disapear so fast. It seemed huge. It was completely silent and then it just disapeared. Of coarse we went into the house and shared our story with the family inside.

During the fall grain harvest in approx 1983 around 2200hrs, I was the truck driver waiting for the combine to have it's next load of grain.  I was facing west and the combine was approx 1/4 mile away at the time and hidden behind a roll of hills.  There was no lights from buildings in the area, no road traffic, there was no moon light that evening & it was nice and clear.  I was standing outside of the grain truck looking at the stars, when I noticed what I thought was a satellite coming from the north/west going south/east.  It was just a bright little light, just like any satellite which I had seen several times before.  When I first noticed it, it was almost straight above me, approx 80 degrees off the horizon.  It was travelling about the speed of other satellites I had seen in the past & since.  After watching this light move for approx 5-10 seconds, and at this point it was almost directly above me at 90 degrees, it made a perfect 90 degree turn without losing any speed and started to head directly east.  A split second after the object turned, I noticed a second object, a red flashing light which I assumed to be a tail light or wing light of an aircraft following the first object.  It appeared to be coming from the same direction as the first object.  It made a more of a swooping/banking turn to turn to the east and followed the first object.  Very much like any normal aircraft would have to do, in making a turn.  Both objects headed east, the first object from what I recall was way ahead of the red flashing light in no time at all.  I don't recall the first object changing speed or streaking away or anything like that, but making that 90 degree turn was pretty wild and it got ahead very quickly becasue the other object took longer to turn to the east.  After the 90 turn I could see the objects for approx another 5 seconds.  I didn't hear anything unusual during the event, however an hour or two latter when we had finished working for the evening and I was taking a shower and my ! father was upstairs in the house, he heard a loud boom or a bang, which I didn't hear.  A sonic boom?? maybe??  The closest military airbase with jets, is in Cold Lake, about 2 hrs away by ground to the north/west.  At the time there was a military air base in Edmonton about an hour away by ground,to the west, however I think they only had helicopters at that site. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

July 31, 1984 10-pm sighting Middlebury CT over Police tower I-84 next to South St. arch bridge I had an experience in 1984 I will never forget.  My name is ((name deleted)). I am now 44, in 1984 I was 24, and at the time I was a D-J at a radio station in central Connecticut. It was a Sunday night, summertime, I know it was July 31st, 1984. I had just visited my parents, watched 60 minutes (thats how I remember it was a Sunday night; at the time I remember thinking it was at the beginning of the month, but I looked it up on a perpetual calendar and realized it was a few hours before August 1st.) and I watched a movie with them, and left about 10 o'clock and drove home on I-84. My parents lived in Newtown and I in Waterbury. Driving up thru Middlebury, past exit 16, I saw what I thought was a plane coming down fast to my right, in the corner of my eye. As I drove up a grade, the ""plane"" came down over some pine trees, and I was approaching a large Arch bridge in front of me about a quarter of a mile ahead. The ""plane""  ""stopped on a dime"" instantaneously above the bridge !  For about 1/8th of a second I thought it was a military jet called a VTOL  (Vertical take off or landing) -- there is Oxford airport about a mile away to my right at this point -- and so I thought, ""Oh !  A  VTOL !!""  And then, in that 1/8th of a second, my heart came up into my throat !!!  It's not a VTOL but a freakin' UFO  !!! And I am driving at 65 m.p.h. -- RIGHT TOWARDS IT !!!   It scared the ((deleted)) me so much I was trying in those few seconds to figure out how to turn around, but the ditch to the other side of the highway was too steep, I'd get stuck in my Ford Escort if I tried it. So, my next thought was to floor it --- fly at high speed right under the bridge and UFO -- but as I got up to it, I was then thinking, this might be the ONLY chance I ever get to see something like this, so I mustered all my nerve and found a place to pull over. I sat there for what I thought was 15 minutes, virtually frozen in my seat, scared to death, watching this thing move slowly to the other side of the highway over a large police radio tower next to the bridge ...  it was only a few hundred feet from me... I felt I could have hit it with a rock or a baseball if I'd had the nerve. Well, it hovered, turned -- rotated, actually -- very slowly, and I unwound my window and heard NO sound, just crickets and cars passing by. I looked at two as they went by, I remember seeing the people looking up at it, and thinking I wasn't the only person seeing this. The proverbial ""deer in the headlights"" phrase kept going thru my mind. It was larger than a two-story house, just floating there, and I definitely had the feeling I was being watched, I was NEVER so scared in my entire life. It had what looked like a notch cut out of one side of it, otherwise it seemed almost round, but there were actually flat sides to it, like a dodecahedron, with what I would describe as xmas tree lights all over it, but much more brighter and more brilliant, brilliant colors of blue, red, yellow, purple, all kinds of colors. I could also see what looked like metal-work on it behind the lights, like, beams or something, and I remember thinking WOW, this is something not made on this planet ! The thing floated there for 15 minutes, or so I thought.... because it then moved slowly away, disappeared over a hill, and I drove home, went up to my apartment, drained from this, but I couldn't sleep, so I sat down in my dark apartment at my kitchen table, sat there for what I thought was 10 -15 mins., looked at my watch and was stunned to see it was 3:30 am !!   So what happened to the time ?? I still do not know, I am now looking into some hypnosis sessions to find out what happened, my sister knows a woman who does hypnosis. Anyway, although the experience scared the living crap out of me at the time, I was glad to have experienced it because it gave me insight into the fact that not only are we NOT alone, but that how insignificant things can be on this lonely little planet in a corner of the Universe in the grand scheme of things.  Not that things aren't important here, but just to know that there are many other things going on we have NO clue about in the vastness of space. And not only that, but at least I ""know"" in my heart what ""I saw""  and no one can take that away from me,even if they don't believe me at least I believe what I myself saw. The next night, I got on the radio and asked if anyone had seen anything and got 4 or 5 calls from people who'd seen similar looking UFOs the night before, one down near the Merritt Parkway and another near Waterbury I remember.",2004-04-27T00:00:00,41.5289,-73.1175

I was about twelve or thirteen years old and my younger brother and I were washing and waxing the car and boat, which we did every summer before going to the lake to water ski.  After finishing I went inside the house then my brother came in excitedly telling me there was a UFO outside and I thought to myself, ""Yeah, right!"" thinking he was messing with me.  I reluctantly went out and looked up into the sky where he was pointing and saw a perfectly shaped silver pyramid floating about ten or fifteen feet above the power line next to our driveway (only forty or so feet from where we were standing).  The pyramid was about five or six feet tall, had four sides, three of which were dull silver and the fourth which reflected the sun in our eyes every time that side of the object turned our way.  The object was heading East at a leisurly pace and we could walk to keep up with it.  After becoming fairly confident it wasn't going to jet off I ran inside to tell my parents and ask them to get the camera (we had a fairly strict family and I wasn't allowed to touch my dad's camera) but my mom thought I was joking so I ran back outside to watch the object slowly move across the sky.  About fifteen or so minutes into observation the object simply vanished.  Over the years I've tried to find out if others have seen the same thing but have found only a few marginally similar reports.

This is my 3rd report on this site. I seem to be one of those people who are fortunate (or maybe unfortunate?) to see these objects. I am not sure of the exact date, but my best guess is around March 1980. At that time I worked 2nd shift at a small shop in New Milford, Ct., but lived in Waterbury, Ct., maybe 30 miles away. I was driving home from work on Interstate 84 around 12:30 A.M.. It was a beautiful night. There was a very bright full moon, and it was perfectly clear. I had just passed though Southbury Ct.. There is a large hill as you come to the exit for Oxford, Ct. From this hill you can see Waterbury in the distance maybe 5-6 miles away. I was driving east, and I was coming down this hill. I looked to my left over the 4 lane highway. Just above the treeline on the other side of the highway I saw what you would first believe to be a blimp. This object was dark against the bright sky and I could see it clearly. It looked to be almost 100 feet long, and 15 feet high. It had no undercarriage of any kind, nor wings, or vertical/horizontal stabilizers as blimps usually have. It was round on each end. It really did not look like a blimp. It was too long and narrow. Most blimps I have ever seen are much fatter than this object was. It was maybe 150 feet to my left, and was flying VERY LOW. It did not look to be more than 30 feet above the trees that lined the highway. So it was maybe 60-75 feet above the ground. This object was going east just like me, but slightly faster. I was probably going 65 MPH, I estimate the object to be travelling at around 80 MPH. The first thing I did was roll down my window to see if I could hear it, but all I could hear was the wind blowing past my car. I left the window down so I could get a good look at it. Fortunately, there was no traffic at all, so I was able to take a pretty good look. What looked extremely strange and shocking about this object is that it had 3 large, perfectly round port-holes on it's underside. They looked exactly like the port-holes on a ship. They were windows. I could see inside this object. A blue light shined out of each port-hole downward into the trees. All I could see inside this object was blue light, but I am positive I could see into this object. Then, as the object gained on me, I could see another perfectly round port-hole on it's rear end. I could also see inside this window. But this port-hole was different. A green light shined out of this port-hole and out behind it. I was looking into this port-hole. But all I could see was green light inside the object. None of the lights were difficult to look at. Now, the object was starting to get pretty far ahead of me. Then it did something that amazed me. At the bottom of this long hill the highway curves sharply to the left (north). When this object came to the curve it made a smooth left turn. It was following the highway! That was a very strange thing to see. By now I was getting to the bottom of the hill myself and the object was getting pretty far away. I lost it in the glow coming up from Waterbury. There is one more thing I want to say. I know many people mistake common objects for UFO's. But I have thought about this object for many years, and do not believe I am mistaken. The ONLY object this remotely resembled would be a blimp. But I am sure it was not for several reasons. 1) It did not look like a blimp. I could see it clearly. It had no undercarriage for pilots, nor any wings, vertical or horizontal of any type. 2) It was quiet. I have seen the Goodyear Blimp and other blimps many times. They are quite loud. You can usually hear them many miles away. Even though I was driving, this object was so close I should have been able to hear it clearly. 3) It was too low. I cannot imagine anyone flying any aircraft just above the trees like this. Even if the military had some secret aircraft, I sincerely doubt they would fly it at such a dangerously low altitude. 4) It followed the highway. I guess an aircraft could follow a highway, but I can't imagine why. I made a picture of this object on my computer using Paint. I am not an artist, the colors are not right at all, but it will give you the idea. It was a pretty easy object to draw. You are welcome to use it if you wish, but please do not disclose my name or e-mail. Here is the link for my drawing:  http://imagebay.org/users/800/21727.bmp ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I remember we wound up wrapping the blanket around us because the night was chilly. The sky was dark and we could see plenty of stars. However, the one that caught our attention was the one that was moving. At first, we thought it might be a plane. But then I realized that was imposible because it went from one end of the sky to the other in a matter of about 8 or 9 seconds then would come to a dead stop, change directions and traverse the sky again. The star seemed to be moving as if it were connecting dots, like in a coloring book. We noticed it first near the northwest horizon, then moving in a straight line it traveled directly above us and ended over in the Southeast, then it stopped and started again moving West, then it connected dots mainly overhead after that which made us wander if somehow it knew we were watching it. We didn't know what it was but agreed it had to be otherworldly. The moving star carried on for so long that after a while, we finally lost interest in watching it.

They both moved in sink, they were going as fast as the airplane and at the same time seem to swivel in miniature circles (perfectly in sync).

He stated that while he was in a rooming house he got to know a man there that always seemed to be disturbed about something.  He also appeared to show a great deal of anxiety.  One day while my friend and the man were talking the man admitted that there was a time in his life when he was normal as any other average person.  It all changed one day while he was hunting in the Watchung Mountains region.  While he was in the woods he encountered a creature that he described as being ""not from this world"".  It frightened him significantly.  He yelled at the creature to leave.  When the creature did not he tried to shoot at it with his gun.  However, the gun jammed.  This terrified him even more.  The man became upset during this part of the conversation and did not want to talk about the experience anymore.  Since much time had passed my friend has lost contact with the man. I have known my friend for some time and do know him well.  I have always found him to be a honest, level headed, and straight forward person.  He believes the man to be credible.

Never have I heard anyone talk about what I know about aliens. I was watching your show on SCI FI channel and I’ve seen other UFO shows but this one peaked my interest.  Currently I’m writing a book about my dealings with a government agency and aliens. I will be using a pseudo name and an attorney in order to process this book because I’m afraid for my life if I use my true identity. In brief, I was only 8 days old when I died from Spinal Meningitis and revived over a minute later. After that I had a few unusual effects about me. My Father was in the military at the time and we were a bit poor. Suddenly we had some money which I believe came from the government. Due to our doctor reporting the incidents that were reported by My Mother, suddenly some people were interested in my abilities. Later in life I wanted to join the military but after trying to enlist I was suddenly pulled into a situation which placed me in an unknown place, an unknown room and unknown building that had the facilities to live. This room that I stayed in was normal except for the mirrored glass that was approx. 15 feet wide. I felt as if something was watching me. To make this story even shorter, I felt something trying to communicate with me behind that glass. I truly believe that my subconscious mind or 7th sense let me see what was behind that mirror. In my dreams I saw that it was not human. What I had figured out was that I was placed there for an experiment. It was watching me as I ate and probably copying me. Learning from me my habits. It’s a shot in the dark but being there for 2 months told me that that’s what was going on. The agency was definitely tied with the U.S. Air Force. There were mirrors in every room that I went to even the shower room. My abilities are telekinesis, telepathy and foresight. I never practice anything. I am a strong believer of God and never believed in aliens until that time. I don’t believe that there is time travel. I do believe that our Air Force has experiments that they are playing with and people see those UFO’s yet I know in my heart for sure that there are aliens alive and not held captive yet instead they must be here learning about us. My dreams most of all tell me things. I was not imagining anything. When I finish this book it will need to be edited. Someone that I contacted in another state who is a professional writer is very afraid to take on my book. She read the detail and said that her life would probably be in danger if she helped me at all. I have resigned from the Department of Justice in March of 2004 here in California. I felt that someone was looking over my shoulder. I don’t know what interest you may have in this but if you don’t contact me at least you will eventually see my book on the shelves one day. 5 friends know about some of the things and promised to carry out my book providing that I pass on before I find a way to print it all. I told you in short but there is much more detail that brings this to evidential events. ((name deleted))-Pseudo Name  ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I watched the light hovering, there was another movement right underneath the bright light and these were of different colours - 2 RED lights rotating in a clockwise direction, and they seemed to be rotating at an equal distance from each other with unexplainable speed, while this was happening another 3 lights appeared or seemed to come out of the bright light at a phenomal speed and they were smaller than the ""mother ship"" but they were the same size as the 2 red ones that were rotating.  As we were watching the lights and marvelling at the rate of speed they were showing, 3 ""atv""'s appeared on the trail going home on a fishing/hunting trip.   As we were looking on, the lights then stopped on what they were doing, as they seemed to notice the atv's.  The lights then headed towards the oncoming atv's and proceeded to go towards them, then when they came upon the atv's they started to hover above them and followed there every move.  As we were watching them, I jokingly said ""Oh no, they're going to be abducted by the lights!""  As we were watching the atv's go on, the lights were moving on as they seemed to lose interest atv's.  Back to the original spot where we had just watched them.  I then said to my friend that we should wait for the atv's to see if they noticed anything up in the sky.   We decided to wait for them, the first 2 atv's just passed us and didn't stop, seeing this, I decided to flag down the 3rd atv - he stopped.  My first question was ""Did you see the lights?""  The driver seemed to be perplexed as I asked the question,  ""What lights?"", he said.  I then went on to tell him that they were being followed by the lights for about a minute, and the lights moved on, he looked at me as if I was a madman and he drove off.  As the other 3 atv's were on the trail we were behind them and they had stopped for a cigarette, meanwhile, I kept looking behind us, above us, and all around, I then noticed the lights going in a northerly direction while these other guys were stopped, I tried to show the other 2 drivers but they weren't the least bit interested and didn't see what I was trying to show them, until I went over to the 3rd driver who proceeded to ask me where I was seeing the lights, I then pointed towards the lights and he saw them.  I was happy or relieved that one of them saw the lights.  To this day I can only say that I have seen something not of this world.",2004-10-27T00:00:00,,

This is 3 satelites that are strategically placed to remain in formation as they travel.  They are usually in the formation of an isosceles triangle.  They appear to have a light at each tip as each satelite reflects the sun, like all satelites do (Well, at least the normal ones the public knows about).  It moves slowly across the night sky and eventually passes out of view.  In my area it is usually moving from the NW to the SE.  We consider this a great thrill to see the Naval Array as it is something so different to see... 3 satelties moving in formation with no sound.  It is quite alarming to see for the first time because it really appears to be some kind of craft, BUT, you can still see the stars behind it as it passes by... so it seems as though the craft is invisible except for the lights (which are really the satelites themselves).  What appears to be a UFO is really 3 satelites traveling together in formation.  Very cool thing to see if you get the chance.  I have tried watching for it each night, to come up with some kind of schedule of when it passes over, but so far have not been able to document anything routine, it seems to be hit or miss.

Hello, I was sitting in my hot tub late at night on a clear evening there wasn't much moonlight if any at all.  I was facing east while resting my head back on the side of the hot tub. I was staring up at the starts as I do frequently. I noticed out of the corner of my right eye, something moving south to north from behind a tree. It looked just like medium bright star but moved steadily across the sky. It was not a passenger jet, it was way too high and had no blinking lights at all and was moving faster than planes at that altitude move. I see heavy air traffic on a regular basis and this didn't look like any of it.  It reminded me of a waterbug gliding on water. I followed it across the sky, I'd say it covered a distance equaling if I held my arms out above my head as far apart as I could.  I thought maybe it was the ISS or something however a few weeks later I saw something even more strange.  I was again in my hot tub watching the stars only I was facing north and the objects were moving from east to west. This time they looked the same, like medium bright stars but there were three of them. One obviously running and two that were pursuing the leader. The lead light was not moving in a straight steady line it was maneuvering and the pursuers were reacting. The lead pursuer was probably half the distance between the first and last object. They formed a triangular formation. These objects also reminded me of water bugs. I wondered if the objects may have been fighter jets since there are  plethora of military installations within 100 miles of my home. These craft had no blinking lights either, and they had to be at an extremely high altitude, it seems unlikely that I would be able to see jet afterburners that brightly. I mean these things looked just like starts they were good size, bigger than passenger jets look at night so the fighter jet thing just doesn't make sense to me.  Anyway, I keep watching.

The UFO was captured on two photos. The first photo clearly shows the UFO with a blue sky background. It has a shape which closely resembles the starship enterprise from star trek. The second photo was taken approx 1 minute later, showing the UFO at a slightly different angle, showing a definite metallic reflection. A very interesting point to be made here is that given that both photos are approx 1 minute apart, it is not reasonable to say the UFO was travelling at high speed to avoid detection by the human eye. Also, given that I did NOT see this aircraft that day, I have come to the conclusion that it had a ""camouflage"" of some sort - which was somehow not effective on the flash of a camera, even though it was a disposable camera! Given the photo timing, I'd say it travelled at a fairly low speed, and low altitude as can be seen by the photos. It was pure coincidence that I had taken two photos, as my itent was to capture the greenery of conneticut having stayed there for a month on work purposes. Of course it may be possible that there were two of these UFO's. I will send the photos by email, and have the negatives if there are any interested parties. This is not a hoax! my email is w_v@optusnet.com.au should anyone wish to enquire. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS)) Hi, I've already submitted an online report, and stated that I would send the pics via email.  These pics are genuine, and I have the negatives with me. The timing difference between the two pictures is about a minute, and were taken in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. I am from Australia and was in the U.S. on a two week work assignment.  At the time I can say without a doubt I did not see the UFO when taking the pictures,  and I would think something of that strange shape would have caught my attention.  Also note that I only had a disposable camera with me, and was simply taking snaps of the ""nice road"" and wasting some of the camera snaps. I was not looking through the lens at the time, I was driving and simply held the camera in front of me to take the random shots, (as strange as it may sound!). So, I am sending the two scanned pics, and two other pics which are only of the UFO from the first two pics with a higher  scanning resolution.  Looking forward to hearing any thoughts on this… ((END CORRESPONDENCE)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the four photographs provided by the witness.

She described a bright light with lights shooting off of it and circling around and then rejoining the main light.  Several of us that were there went outside to investigate.  We walked the half block down the gravel road to the Farm to Market road to get a better view.  Just coming into view was an object flying very low and slow.  It was coming out of the East and moving directly West following the FM road.  I would estimate it's height to have been around 600 ft and it's width to be about 75 yards wide.  It was triangular in shape and had several lights down each ""wing"".  The lights were different colors but of the same configuration on each wing.  I remember 4 lights on each wing of blue, orange, and white colors.  Where the tail of a normal aircraft would have been were three lights arranged in an L shape but we could clearly see the straight line across the back extending to the tips of the wings forming the triangle shape.  In the center of the object was a red check mark.  It was similar to an arrow pointing in the direction of travel, dead center on the bottom, but was missing one of the lines that would have formed a complete arrow, instead resembling an upside down check mark.  The craft made absolutely no sound as it travled and continued moving very slowly until it passed out of our field of view.  We observed the craft for about 20 minutes.  I called my grandfather who was a dispatcher at the local Sheriffs office to see if he had heard any reports and he had not.  He went up on the county courthouse roof where he worked but did not observe anything.  He was about 3 miles to the southwest of our location.  I also contacted the small municiple airport in Commerce, TX which is about 25 miles to the SW of our location to see if they knew of any military operations in the area.  Their response was that if they did they couldn't tell us.  Very shortly after the event, the neighbor who had alerted us to the object and had described something very different from what we observed was suddenly stricken with Pancreatic cancer and passed away very suddenly.  She seemed to be of perfect health and went into the hospital for stomache pains,  a few days later she passed away.  I have been watching the sky ever since and have never seen anything like it again.  I'm an avid aircraft and military ""buff"".  The B2 bomber was unveiled around this time and I just chalked the sighting up as a lucky view of some secret test flight.  Of all the pictures I have seen of the B2 since, I have never seen any with anything like the light configuration I described above.

I thought I heard a low rocket noise and looked up. I saw a shimmering trail of white sparks. I gazed at it for awhile and could just make out a shape of some kind that I percieved to be an elongated shape. It was traveling at about 500-1000 feet. I thought I could make out faint triangular shaped ""windows"" in a row along the visable side. It was traveling in a North Easterly direction heading towards Millard. The key things that I noted about it was that I could make out a faint engine noise of some kind and that it was traveling very level and straight. It was flying at about the top speed of a single engine Cesna airplane, not very fast but at a good clip. I did gather that it had a rather massive size to it. It was a very big shadow that was darker than the new night sky.  What I also noted was this, I could see that it was being escorted by two other aircraft. I could make out their flashing marker lights. One on each side just slightly ahead of the larger object. I figured that whatever it was, it was being escorted by two fighter jets. Of this I have no doubt.  The next day, a small story was printed in The Omaha World Herald that some ""Space Junk"" had fallen and area residents had called in with UFO sightings. It's interesting that  this term space junk was again used later in another sighting in the same Sector of Nebraska. In the report on your site he was told that his Cigar shaped object was also just Space junk....If I ever go to that region of Nebraska again I'll make sure to bring my umbrella...it seems that there must be some sort of magnetic field that attracts all of these level flying space junk objects falling from the sky.

I guess it didn't dawn on either of us that this could be a ufo. We actually were just discussing the aircraft and how strange it looked. There was a gondola-like structure (round) which hung underneath the black aircraft.. I thought it might be a stealth plane, but knew they had no such gondola. We could actually see many people moving around in the gondola that were far enough up that they looked minute in size.It was, as I said a huge craft.We thought that the gondola-like center could possibly move up into the ship.

It was Victoria Day weekend in Canada...the Saturday Night and my friends and I were out having a few drinks (yes we were *slightly intoxicated*).  After leaving a Bar around College and Bathurst in downtown Toronto we ending up in a children's playground of a school near Harbbord & Bathurst.  3 males and a female and we where having a cigarette when the female member of our group said ""Hey, check out the seagulls""...Since I am an avid amateur ornothologist I immediately lookup up (so did the other 2 males).  Instantly we all recognised that they were NOT seagulls.  All our impressions of the object/s vary slighly including altitude and size.  My perception is as follows:  What was originally percived as seaguls were actually white occolating/slightly-glowing triangle shaped pads (flat on the bottom but seemed to be wobbling, which originally looked like wings flapping to the female who first spotted them/it).  The 3 slightly glowing triangles were in the formation of a triangle - this made it hard to tell if they were 3 seperate objects or all part of the same object.  Indeed it was a dark moonless night with almost no wind at all (I could lite a match and it'd burn to the end).  The Object/s were moving from W to E (direction of the wind) at a low altitude (again, our perceptions differ).  To me it appeared to be about 100 ft (twice as high as the city tree tops and standard Seagull hight) and there was no noise.  Although it only seemed to be moving about 10-15kph there didn't seem to be enough wind to propell anything at that speed.  The 3 glowing triangles never varied in distance from each other - which led us to believe they were attached/tethered to each other or perhaps there was a large dark object (we could not see anything between the smaller triangles though it could have been a very dark object against a really dark sky) and the smaller triangles would be at the bottom 3 corners of the black triangular base.  We watched the entire time, from when it was first spotted (directly above our heads) until it dissapeared into the eastern horizon (about 1.5-3 minutes).  We had lots of time to discuss between us what were were looking at.  2 thought the object was more like 500 ft up.  1 (the female) thought it was just at tree level and I figure it was twice tree level (about 100-130 ft)- I am into bird watching, amateur astronomy, amateur aviation and amateur meteorology aswell as entomology...so if it's in the sky I have a good idea about it...I'm also an excellent judge of distance and hight.  From my perspective the size of the object (if it was around 120 ft) is: each glowing triangle was about 3 feet square and about 13-18 feet apart from each other.  Lastly, the next day (Sunday of that long weekend) I saw a military jet moving from west to east along more or less the same path as the object from the night before.  There were no airshows going on in the city and it is unusual to see a jet fighter over Toronto otherwise.  The jet was moving fairly slow.  I tried to report this to MUFON at the time but they didn't have website reporting and I never received the reporting form from them as promised over the phone.  We were all pretty well affected by our sighting and were anxious to discover what it was...to this day we still don't know. ((name deleted))",2004-09-29T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

I live just west of the okefenokee national reserve swamp and am often awakned  during the early morning hours-[no apparent reason]- and in order to return back to sleep I will walk around my property and enjoy the stars. On this night I just happened to look over the St. Marys river between the tree line and noticed a VERY bright reddish orange light from where I was standing at approx. 245 degrees compass heading  moving so fast and erratically that it was at first a blur.  I thought that it was at first a helicopter from the  national guard-[they fly over the river often]- and moving so strangely I thought it was in trouble. The longer I watched though the less rapid the movement became and the VERY distinct outline became apparent. The object still had the same basic colors but was more red on the upper side and lighter toward the orange hue on the lower side. The movement was still jerkyand would move up and down and side to side quite rapidly. The longer I watched the more it seemed to stabilize and at once dropped straight  down. As I continued to watch it rose again and at approx. 200ft. the bottom became VERY white in color and a [what I would call] vortex began to form beneath it and to ""my"" eye it looked to be drawing what looked like water withen the vortex rising to the now very stable object. This lasted for about 5min. and as suddenly as it started, it quit! The vortex seemed to expand so quickly it looked similar to when someone would pop a balloon filled with water. The resulting mist expanded and the lighe from the lower side of the objece made a beautiful light show for a few seconds-[under a min.]. This is not the first time I have seen this exact same design of this type. I was raised in the Oceola national forest and as a child with my grandmother we would see these sights often and in ""many"" different forms and colors. She reffered to them as Gods lights. I have ""always"" believed in the fact that there is something about this we do not totally understand but this was the first time I saw this type of an action-and ""so close""! The object when it performed this action could have not been more than 1/2 mile away and was large enough to be seen with extreme detail and clarity.The depiction in pictures one sees oh this type of craft is perfect in every way. The government with their continuing denial of these objects insults anyones intelligence when they say they are seeing what does not exist. The fact that within the hour of this sighting the military had a sky full if their own <flying> objects. The difference is they were noisy and quite stable in flight. I was in the Air Force [SAC] and have as much time in the air as most private pilots will get in any 5 years and I am more than familiar with most unusual things that are seen and meet no known description, but when something is this close---THERE IS NO DOUBT---what is seen!I have been asked why, if this so common that I don't take photos? You really cannot get one that is clear enough to be able to discern the objects as they appear to the naked eye. Anyone who has tried knows this is so! I just watch and enjoy our visitors antics that I have known for so long. Disbelivers---BELIEVE! There is no problem to see this if you spend any 1 month near this area and observe mostly at night in the early morning hours. The daytime can also be active in the summer months if you have tine to lie on your back and just watch! As a child this was a daily and nightly ritual. It us so.

The object, a saucer shaped craft, appeared to come out of a cloud bank to the west of a city park in south Topeka, Kans. This occurred shortly after sunset while there was still twilight in the west. The craft flew due east in my direction - I was seated on a picnic table next to a softball field and close to home plate. The craft flew fast and low over the ball field at an altitude of 15-20 feet and passed by me at a distance of about 150 feet to the south of me. It passed underneath an electric line running along the right field line and under another line that ran along the center field fence. It then left the ball field and climbed to pass over a building in an apartment complex, located on the east side of the ball field. The craft then dropped out of sight on the other side of the building. I continued to look in the direction of the apartments. Less than a minute later, the craft reappeared on the north side of the apartments, directly to the east of me. It then rose to an altitude of about 50 feet and slowly moved toward me.  It passed to the north of me at a distance of 100 feet or less from me. It then turned south and appeared to land at the south end of a parking lot, which is located on the west side of the ball field, about 150-200 feet from me. The craft then rotated to face me and then began to move toward me slowly and low over the ground. At this point I became somewhat afraid and left the park in my car. The craft was black in color and had a single white light on the front of it. Because it was getting dark, I could make out no further detail other than its shape and approximate size. I estimate the diameter of the craft to be 10-15 feet. Its shape is what I would describe to be a ""classic"" saucer shape. I felt the need to go someplace where there were other people (I was alone in the park), so I drove to a Walmart store, located about three blocks east of the park. As I entered the parking lot, I saw a white light flying eastward to the south of Walmart. It then made a large U turn and flew directly over Walmart at an altitude of less than 100 feet and then headed southwest and disappeared. I went into Walmart for about 10 minutes to make a purchase. When I came out, I saw a white light flying circles, altitude of 100 feet or less, over an apartment complex located just east of Walmart. I am assuming this white light was the saucer I saw earlier at the park, but the body of the craft wasn't visible at this point because the sky was too dark. As far as I knew, I was the only witness to the craft's activities. I went to a tavern located in a strip mall just northeast of Walmart to find someone I knew who could be a witness. Unfortunately, I didn't know any of the people who were in the tavern at that time. I stayed at the tavern for a time, occasionally stepping outside to see if the craft was still in the vicinty and saw it again on two more occasions. Both times, I saw it hovering over the east end of Walmart at a height of 75-100 feet. The first time, the craft began to move toward the southeast and then turned north. It passed low over the apartment complex and then over a service station. The body of the craft was briefly visible as it passed over the service station. The craft continued north and then made a sharp turn west. I then lost sight of it. I went back into the tavern and came out again about 15-20 minutes later. Once more, it was hovering over Walmart in the same place. This was my final, and most bizarre, sighting of the craft. The craft began to move on the same course as before, but this time it turned directly toward me instead of passing over the service station. It came at me fast and very low over the parking lot of the strip mall, came very close to me and then simply vanished. I looked all around me, even directly above me, but couldn't see it. I have no idea where it went. Because this happened so quickly and because I was somewhat stunned by what happened, I really couldn't discern any further details of the craft's appearance. I re-entered the tavern and came out again a short time later. I didn't see the craft this time, so I went home. About me: I am a 50-year old male. I have bachelor degrees in journalism and business, with work experience in both fields. At present, I am part owner of a computer store. This was my only ""real"" encounter with a UFO. In the past, I have seen lights in the night sky that I couldn't identify, but I had never seen a ""flying saucer"" before this incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Both friends spotted it before me, as it took my eyes a minute to adjust to the clear bright sky. We were looking west in the direction of W.hwy 80. The object hovered and intermittingly moved as though it was going in and out of visibility. Every time it would do a sharp fast maneuver the sun would reflect silver. The object appeared to be at least 20000 ft high at first, hovering, then disappearing and appearing 1000's of feet lower, sometimes higher. Then it would do a 180 degree (half circle) maneuver and disappear only to reappear higher again. It was moving from west to N.east and eventually went straight over my apartment. The object was the typical silver saucer type. When it moved from south to north in a straight line it had some kind of tail behind it, hard to describe. It glowed amber/white. We watched this craft for 30 minutes. I watched my watch carefully as time seemed to stand still. I have never in my life watched a UFO for this long! 5-10 minutes at the most with a few past sightings but this was unreal. I remember the times specifically because I had a doctor’s appointment at 1:30pm that afternoon which I ended up being late to by 5 minutes and the doctor’s office is right across the street from my apartment not 2 minutes away. My two friends watched it for 5-10 minutes after I left for my doctors appointment as they say it came directly over the apartments at what they said was about 4000 feet. It then turned reddish amber and then just disappeared. The movements and maneuvering were simply mind blowing. No sound whatsoever.  The strangest part of this sighting was that after watching the craft for about 10 minutes I heard a jet high above. It must have been at least 30000 feet up and it was all white with a radar type thing on top. Military for sure. It came from east, (possibly the Fallon, NV airbase?) and turned left and was heading south straight for the craft. The craft seemed to toy with the jet, appearing above then below flying in front then behind. Then the craft just hovered and seemed to start ignoring the jet as the jet flew from north to south maybe 20-30 miles and then banked east and just flew till we couldn’t see it anymore. The strangest part was that as the craft hovered and maneuvered around the jet, the jet turned on some kind of ultra bright light of some kind that came from the center area of the plane and flashed a steady bright light that resembled a huge camera flash but it stayed on for at least 45 seconds then went off. All I know is the gov knew it was up there and must have been checking it out. The craft as it toyed with the jet, it seemed to show off to us. I think what seemed like a 30 minute sighting may have involved missing time. All I know is my watch said 30 minutes had passed from the time we first started watching the craft, until I left for my appointment.",2004-12-03T00:00:00,39.50650741150443,-119.8174511061947

(AZ & Hawaii) I heard Peter express interest in experiences of those who have had UFO encounters in the past as well as present, so after hearing this, I was compelled to share this. Please forgive the explanation, because I've never formally reported anything like this before. But after hearing the stories tonight, I had to share... All of the times reported above are not exact. This first experience happened when I was 17 while driving from Bullhead City back to Phoenix, AZ. I was doing a scheduled pickup & delivery from Bullhead City with my cousin around sunset. As we approached a large mountainous rock formation, the road curved around it. Before we even got to the curve, we both saw a very large ball of light cross the sky slowly (separate of the sun), and stop dead in the air near the rock formation we were approaching. We both were stupified, and couldn't shake the feeling of wanting to rush over to this light. So I remember speeding up, and then slowing down and pulling over to the side of the road. We both got out, and walked toward this ball of light. I specifically remember looking back at my cousin in disbelief because this proved not to be just a reflection off of the glass of the windshield from the vehicle we were driving. I also remember walking with him closer to this ball of light. The sun was going down, and by this point, you could actually see that this ball of light was now higher in the sky than we saw originally. And to make things even stranger, this ball of light seemed to move away, just as we would get closer. At the closest I can remember, we were about 100-200 meters away. Next thing we know, both of us were cussing, and we were both scared. I still to this day cannot remember why we were feeling scared. My heart was racing, and we both ran back to the vehicle, jumping in, and started it up. The only strange thing that completely made me get scared was the fact that I don't remember seeing this ball fly away. My cousin doesn't either. Even more, it was complely dark when we were running back to the vehicle. By the time we got back to Phoenix, it was dark night. When we got back, my uncle cussed us out, and accused us of taking the vehicle for joyrides and paryting. We didn't do any such thing. But instead, we just agreed with him and took our punishment for fear of ridicule, and not being beleived. We had also realized that there was at least 45 mins. to and hour of missing time. A similar experience happened to me again way later when I was stationed in Hawaii with the ((deleted/military unit). At the time, our battalion was sent to the big island of Hawaii for training. The training area is located in the very middle of the big island of Hawaii. It's called P.T.A. (Pohakuloa Training Area). Anyway, this PTA is located between the 2 volcanoes. I was ((deleted/on assignment)), it was like 0300 hrs, and I was facing North I beleive (there's an observatory on the top of the volcano). Anyway, since I was on ((assignment)) for 2 hours, and because it's so incredibly beautiful there (the sky has literally millions of stars which can be visible on a clear night). Well, I was viewing the sky through my NVGs (Night Vision Goggles), and looking in the direction of the observatory in the North. After looking for like 4 minutes at shooting stars, something to the left caught my eye. Actually, the NVGs flashed brightly to my left, so I put them down because I thought that some dumb soldier was using a white light (which is totally against field rules during training or combat). When I put down the NVGs, I saw a brigh light approach silently from the West (my left) toward my position. As it got closer, it increased in brightness. As it got close enough to see that it was perfectly round, it stopped in the air. I called in on my telelphone to report, and they thought I was joking. When I told the Sgt. to come out and look, he did, and about 10 seconds after speaking with him, the light got very bright, and then shot across the sky. What makes this sighting even more crazy is that maybe not even 4 minutes after this ""fireball"" shot across the sky, a large group (maybe 10 or 15) of wild boarhogs came running through our position as if something was chasing them. Normally, these boarhogs don't usually just come runnning through, especially when we have our battery setup. They might come in individually to scrounge around for food, but you won't normally see them just ""stampede"" through like they did that night. Out of all the many times I had to go out to the field for training there in PTA, I never experienced another stampede of boarhogs again. I also didn't see another fireball there either. Later the next day, I was questioned by my Platoon Sgt, and Commander about what had occurred. I reported it, and they made no visible reaction, other than telling me that it was from one of the volcanoes. There is no way that this was from a volcano. The ball stayed in mid air for that whole time, and then shot across the sky. I've never seen any lava do that before. The area we were moving around in was in a large valley, with wide open spaces, and very dusty fields. We weren't even close to the active volcano, or to the black rocked lava fields. The space is very wide open, with the occasional ""PU"" here and there. (A PU is the Hawaiian word for large hill) When we finally got out of the field after over 2.5 weeks, it was big talk. Apparently, MANY other soldiers who were also in the area from the other batteries saw it too.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Early morning at 1:30am, having had some brews, very humid, hot and sitting on the ground in chairs.  We watched the object  pass directly overhead. There were no navigation lights.  It was loud and sounded like somebody creasing a thick piece of one-ply cardboard.  The craft was about 500ft up. It sounded like a jet, but not like any I had heard at multiple air shows I'd seen in the past.  We were members of a SAC unit that was a part of a GSU (geographically seperated unit) approx.  120 miles west of Omaha, NE.  Our mission was in part support of SAC by operating a VLF transmitter site there. We both agreed that we did not see any exhaust or visible light from the craft.  There was very little light in the upper clear sky as the moon was hidden by low partly cloudy cover.    About 15 min. after the sighting, I smelled something like jet exhaust that I have smelled before at airshows or on a flight line.  On a note, the site we worked at had a radio tower, the height of which was a little higher than the Empire St. building in N.Y.  This tower was surrounded by ""HAZ"" markers at the four sides of our 1/2 mile sq. site.  (HAZ was short for HAZARD and lighted at night)  Our site covered 4 corners of four counties, not unlike the ""four corners"". Years later and keeping in touch with my friend, I saw an airshow at Scott AFB, IL, in 1991.  The very same shape and sound was emitted by a craft that flew overhead: the F-117!   As it turns out, my supervisor knew that the F-117 would do flybys by remote USAF sites in the midwest in the late '80s!  From UFO to IFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I would have never noticed it except there was lightning that went from the ground up which caught my eye. Then there was another burst of lightning, again from the ground up when I saw that it was going towards this object. It was a grey cloudy drizzling day and the object was halfway hidden by a cloud. This was strange because clouds thick enough to hide an object at so close a range could not do so. It was as if the object was deliberately hiding from view behind a cloud that could not be there. What was even more strange was I felt my mind go sort of foggy and I was having difficulty hanging on to the image and the memory only second after I saw it.

It was wednesday before halloween but I don't remember the date.  I fell asleep about 8:30 and was awakened by a bright light in my room.  At first I thought I had overslept and it was full day but when I woke I realized the light was gone, I looked out the window thinking someone was in the yard putting a flashlight to windows (I lived in a 4plex that was empty except for my unit).  No sign of anyone, then I thought maybe a car had gone down the dirt road behind the complex, but there was nothing.  I was ready to go back to sleep when I saw that it was almost a full moon.  While I was admiring the moon I saw a 'star' move from one side of the moon to another, then it was joined by two more.  The three moved together to another part of the sky, then were joined by 6 more.  They did geometric formations, pyramids, triangles, then light shot between them for a few seconds.  Then all but one zipped off.  The one came close and got big, it looked like a sphere with lights stobing around the middle, but I could have imagined that.  It might have been a disk or just a circle of stobing lights.  No way to tell.  It hovered a while and suddenly the lights went dark for a second, then they came back on and a beam of light shot down to the ground.  It was bright white and seemed to have a spiral of brighter light in it (some kind of movement).  It stayed on for a few seconds, went off then on again.  then it went off and the lights left.  There was no sound the whole time.  I looked at the clock and it was 9:00pm.  I remember it fairly well because I wrote it down.  What was weird is that I was usually exhausted because of work and kids and too much to do to ever get enough sleep and I felt like I had a full nights restful sleep.  The next day I called the police and sheriff to see if a helicopter had been in the area or if anyone else had seen anything.  Neither department owned a helicopter and said the military did not have one in the area.  No one had reported seeing any lights. ((NUFORC Note:  The Wednesday before Halloween was October 28.

On the 26th jan 1988 around 11pm or a bit later my friend and i were driving along the highway next to the now Sydney 2000 Olympic site. We were alone and one car was about 1 kilometer in front. A bright light approached us and veered to the right. It was a huge craft 400-500 meters away and 200 ft off the ground estimate size 200 ft long. It was cigar shaped and pulsated from the centre outwards every 3-4 seconds a golden yellowish glow. We slowed down I was driving and observed it for several minutes before it vanished over a disused factory quarry sites..I reported this to 2 researchers in 1993 after a series of dreams of people in robes telling me they would appear at the time of a great games in Sydney. When this was reported in 1993 as yet we were not awarded the Olympic games the site was not even chosen.

Evidence of this is in the papers of Sydney Telegraph Mirror. Late on that year we were awarded the Olympic games and the site where my friend and i witnessed this gigantic craft was commenced to be built. I have just recently this month decided to keep all the shiny metalic things coming out of my face .I have 2 samples which I need to have examined for my peace of mind as I have no explanation for what is happening to me.

I lived near Central Ave. and Tuckahoe Rd..  My mom walked me out to throw the trash when we saw my neighbor from accross the street and his dog just standing there looking up at the sky.  When we got to the end of the driveway we saw this ENORMOUS craft hovering silently in the sky.  This object was atleast the size of an aircraft carrier and about 7 or 8 stories tall and the sky was crystal clear.  It was lighted but the lights were strange and ""flashed"" in a pattern that made them appear as though they wer circling the craft.  It was mettalic like a brushed aluminum or stainless steel with a very low gloss finish. We just stood there in aw when my mom suggested that I run accross the street to my uncle's house for a camera.  My uncle always had a loaded camera on hand and he had offered to drive me to my friend's house.  When I arrived at his house I yelled up to his window and told him whatr we were looking at.  Being my uncle he did not pay any attention to me and assumed that I was trying to rush him to give me a lift.  As I pleaded for the camera the object began to move slowly SW.  Not wanting to loose sight of it I ran back to the position my mom and my neighbor were at and climbed a tree as the craft began to move beyond our sight.  I watched as it moved past some apartment buildings located on Palmer Rd. and noted that it was lower that the buildings which would put it at about 50-75 yards in the air since the buildings sit on a hill. I kept an eye on it until it disapeared behind the tree-line still moving SW. O.K. this is where it should end right?  Well, my uncle finally comes out with the camera and asks what all the xciment was about...I told him as we drove across Tuckahoe Rd. and eventually up Lake Ave. from Saw Mill River Rd..  Just as we approached Lake there were people stopped and getting out of their cars looking toward the sky.  We of course stopped and saw a series of green lights in a formation very much shaped like a kite.  As these lights passed overhead we could hear humming. As I explained that this was not what I had seen a few minutes earlier the lights reappeared and seemed to be circling over the city.  When I arrived at my friend's house we snapped a photo of these lights with a crappy poliroid,  (they circled for about an hour), and then being a not-unintelligent child,  I ran into my friend's house and called the operator for the FBI's #..LOL… The kicker is that I actually got to talk to someone in some office of the FBI who put me on hold for a min. or two and returned, telling me that there were marines choppers on manuvers over Yonkers that night.  I insisted that perhaps the green lights were marines but that the first object was certainly not.  They of course blew me off and said they had no further info.  What the heck were marine's flying over Yonkers when the closest base at the time was 1.5 hours away in NJ??? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was hosting a friend from Alaska, who works there as a boat captain, and who had just arrived in Seattle on the bus earlier in the day.  We were sitting in the living room of the home where I lived in Ballard, waiting for friends to come home.  I seem to recall that they had gone to a movie.  Just minutes before they arrive back at the house, both I and my friend were shocked to hear some type of aerial object STREAK overhead, moving generally, we agreed, from southeast to northwest.  It was the (angular) velocity of the object, and the THOROUGHLY BIZARRE nature of the sound, that captured our attention immediately, and left us both stunned, and staring at one another in disbelief.  My friend, who admitted to me immediately after the incident that she had never believed in the possibility of UFO’s, turned to me and stated that THAT object was a UFO!!  Her eyes were as big as tea cups as she said it, as she turned in my direction in a state of obvious shock and disbelief!   The sound that emanated from the object, in the opinion of both of us, consisted of two distinct, distinguishable sounds.  One sound was a very high-pitched whining, buzzing, or perhaps even screeching tone, not too dissimilar from the sound of a high-speed hydraulic pump, running at very high speed.  Another close equivalent to the high-pitched sound is the distinct ""buzzing"" sound that the human ear can detect from either a Boeing 747, or a DC-10, as it passes overhead at a high power setting.  To my ear, the sound I am trying to describe here has a slightly ""metallic"" quality to it, combined with the peculiar ""buzzing"" sound one might expect to hear from a bee hive, or from a large swarm of bees in flight.  The other sound was a very low-pitched, ""deep"" rumbling sound.  In mirth, I often equate it to the bubbling sound one would hear from a very large cauldron at a slow boil with four missionaries being boiled down into a thick gravy.  Rather like a rapid ""blub, blub, blub.""  I cannot emphasize enough with words how thoroughly bizarre, and unearthly, this sound was, and how it immediately commanded our attention.  We heard it, I estimate, for not more than TWO SECONDS, as it streaked overhead at what seemed to me to be almost directly above us.  Now, the velocity of the source of the sound.  The object was moving at a stunning angular velocity overhead.  I estimate that the object making the sound passed through from 140 to 160 degrees of arc, again from southeast to northwest, in less than two seconds!!  This object could not have been any kind of terrestrial aircraft that I am aware of!  Given that there was absolutely no trace of the sound that would have been generated by a propeller, or from either the main- or tail-rotor of a helicopter, I conclude that the object could not have been either a fixed-wing or rotor-wing aircraft.  As to my credentials, I have held a commercial pilot rating for over a quarter century (Flight Instructor for 10 years), and I have been around aircraft all my life.  My father worked in the airline industry for many decades, and I lived for a portion of my life with a family in the U. S. Air Force.  I know what aircraft sound like, and I know what they are capable of doing.  I cannot imagine that the object I heard on this particular Monday night could have been either built, or flown, by humans. ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by Peter B.

Heard on C2C that you are interested in old sightings. Here's one I had years ago and didn't know where to report it. While walking at night in our small rural town, I was stargazing as I walked and noticed a bright gold light approaching from the south. At first I thought it was a star, but quickly remembered that there are no stars like that in the southern sky and planets are never as low in the sky where I first spotted it. It gave the appearance of Jupiter, all gold and glowing steadily. I think the reason I didn't think of it as an ""moving object"" at first was because it was approaching so slowly. Then I noticed the movement against a tree limb. I watched until the light started to elongate, this was due to it's coming nearer, I don't believe it changed shape. When it got close enough, I could see that it was a rectangular shape. For some reason I think it decended as it neared the town... My mouth dropped open when I could distinguish two dark, backlit shapes in the ""window"". They were human-looking in size and were visible from the waist up. Since the gold light was so strong behind them, I could see no features. Just the shape of heads and shoulders. They were side by side, not quite touching. There was absolutely no noise. There was also no other shape discernable that I can recall. It is strange that I can remember no other details or the exact time I saw this or really how long it lasted. I only remember watching the approach and looking up and being in awe. When the ""craft"" was almost out of my sight range to the north, I shook my head to clear it, and ran to a nearby gas station to see if anyone else had witnessed what I had. They were closed. I couldn't find anyone, anywhere! I felt like I was alone in town... I ran back home, which was close and found binoculars but the light, by this time, only looked like a slowly dimming gold dot, in the binoculars. I remember telling my family about this and my Dad told me that he had seen almost the identical thing in Eugene, Oregon, back in the early 70's, only the window that was lit up on the craft he saw was bluish. I will have him report his sighting. Interesting that they are so similar. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-04-27T00:00:00,44.8141,-117.7453

I was an air traffic controller at Miami International at the time this event occured. I came on duty at 10 o'clock am on this day. The whole facility was buzzing so I asked what was going on. The person I asked said that the midnighters had seen a UFO at the airport early..I did not get the full details for several weeks. The controller was obviously upset over what he had witnessed and refused to talk about it. I waited a few weeks for the right time and when it was quiet I asked this controller to tell me the whole story. Bob said that he working the midnight shift and his relief had arrived up in the tower cab as well as a flight data assistant (three total). They were chatting and one them looked up at the tower radar display. Something was quickly moving across the scope from the north and toward the airport. The observer called out and they all started looking out the windows (it's dark but getting light in the east). To the north something low was covering up the lights on the ground. At this point the UFO is almost over airport. They all saw it as it came to a hover over the commuter ramp, (low, 100 feet or less) which is in the middle of the airport. At this point I stopped the story to ask a question; how big was it? Bob said it was about the size a B-727, which is quite large. He also said that it was dark in color, maybe dark olive. The object hovered over a vehicle and turned on a bright light. There was a ramp person in the vehicle asleep. The ramp vehicles all have radios tuned to the ground control frequency. This person started screaming on frequency for the tower to quit playing pranks. The light stayed on for several minutes. Remember it's getting lighter outside every minute. The light turned off and it continued to hover. Now it's light enough to see detail. The object the rises vertically and passes very close to a an arriving Eastern Airlines A-300. The aircraft was coming in from the south and was on downwind and preparing to land. The pilot asked ""what the hell was that?"" The controllers said that they did not know. The object continued up to many thousands of feet, but still visible fron the ground. At this point two other controllers were driving into work. One was coming in from the south and the other from the north. They both saw the object ascend and watched it until it stopped. When it stopped it stayed motionless for several minutes and then it started to gyrate wildly. While it was gyrating it had many multi-colored lights flashing. The object performed like this for several more minutes. When it stopped it stayed motionless for several minutes and then suddenly went vertically out of sight. In the the tower things were hectic trying to see if the radar room could see anything and getting the airliner on the ground. While taxiing in the pilot asked if the controllers knew anything more and then stated ""well I guess I've seen one now"". Over the next hour or so ""answers"" started coming from various agencies, none of which were accepted by the controller witnesses. In the end the FAA told them to say nothing of the event. One final thing, Bob mentioned that for the next couple of hours (no wind) a yellow-green haze was seen to stay in the area where the object was hovering.This event was a catalyst, of sorts, to open a host of stories from other controllers.  All very interesting. You can e-mail or call for more details if you wold like. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-04-27T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829
"A huge triangularly shaped silent object that blotted out 25 degrees of the sky, lighted by four glowing points.",Centralia,WA,1989-10-10T21:00:00,triangle,1 minute,"Occurred : 10/10/1989 21:00  (Entered as : 10/10/1989 21:00) Reported: 4/10/2004 5:04:42 AM 05:04 Posted: 4/27/2004 Location: Centralia, WA Shape: Triangle Duration:1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36137.html,"A huge triangularly shaped silent object that blotted out 25 degrees of the sky, lighted by four glowing points. An old sighting.  I was a System Analysis for SAC in the early 1960 and stationed at Ellsworth AFB, SD.   I have held the nation's highest security clearance, take no drugs, am a tea toddler and have never hallucinated in my life. During this same time I frequently rode to and from the Minuteman silos, in South Dakota, on HP helicopters.  So I have seen these aircraft up close and personal on many occasions.  I have thus a many year experience with B-52s at close and medium ranges.  In the late 60s I had many personal experiences with the C-5A in Georgia, where they were being designed and built.   About this same time I saw the Blackbird at Elgin AFB, Fla.  So when I say that what I saw over my home in Washington state early one winter night in the late 1980s or early 1990s wasn't a miliary or civilian aircraft of any known type, I am speaking with some authority. What I saw as a very large, slowly moving delta shaped object that blotted out at least 30 degrees of the nighttime sky.  The object was moving from the SSW and headed, thus, towards the NNE.  This is an occasional glide path for some military aircraft head from Macord AFB, in Tacoma, about 40 NNE of my home.  The object was about 20 degrees above the horizon, but appeared to move upwards as it passed nearly overhead.  My young son, Max, then about eight, i.e., c. 1990, was with me.  We were both in my hot tub which was located about fifty feet behind and to the West of my home at ((address deleted)) Rd, Centralia, WA.  It would have been early evening about 8 or 9 PM., PST. The object had lights at the front and ""wing"" tips, clearly making the ""Delta"" shape easy to see.  What was so curious about the object was it's size and the total silence of it's travel.  I have never seen a larger object in the sky.  Keep in mind that I have frequently seen both B-52s and C-5As takeoff at close range, i.e., right over my head and at very low altitudes.  At these altitudes these aircraft must be using full power to stay airborne and are thus quite loud.  This object, however seemed to be ""floating"" though it was obviously not a balloon.  I would describe the propulsion as ""gravitational"" rather than aerodynamic.  There was no hint of the roar of these jets nor was there any sound similar to a helicopter or copters. No ""thump/thump"" of blades.   I would say that this object was at least the size of a C-5A, right on the deck.  However if the object was at five thousand feet, far more likely, given my impression of the object and the cloud cover that evening, which was broken with the ceiling at about 5,000 feet. So if the object was at 5,000 ft, ""gliding"" slowly over head, it would have been many times larger than any C-5A.  Indeed this was my impression of this ""craft.""  The entire time I had it in sight, not long, only about one minute, my impression was of *hugeness*.  The object seem to be at least a thousand feet across.   It is easy to give the impression of size.  The object was as large as the oak tree that stands near the hot tub and pool in the back ward.  This tree covers about 25 degrees of the sky from the tub. I add that the lights were not aircraft lights.  They were not flashing, they were not port and starboard, red and green lights,. they were white, but not sealed beams pointing down, as they would have illuminated us as they passed ""overhead"".   The ""glowed.""   I say ""overhead"" because it missed being directly overhead by what appeared to be a few hundred feet, i.e., it appeared to be over my barn and not over my hot tub. These could not have been separate objects, because the entire sky was blotted out between them.  The stars and clouds disappeared between them and this ""area"" moved with the lights as the light moved.  I could not see any metallic ""underside,"" just darkness.  Now this entire thing is complicated by the fact that I was not wearing my glasses.  So I would not be able to see much detail.  I can easily make out the planets, first, second and third magnitude stars.  I would say these lights were at least of the brightness of Venus. My son, however, has normal sight and I had him give me a running narrative.  He saw no detail between the lights and clearly confirmed that the entire sky was blacked out between them.  I have reported the sighting.  NPR carried the report, nation wide, since I heard from former friends, a few years after it happened, when I attended a public meeting on UFO's at the local library (Centralia, WA). During those years I kept a daily planner and have preserved them, so I could, no doubt pin point the date with some luck and time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Before the craft came howering over the houses I called my family who were in my sister-in-law's home; by the time they all gathered to see, the craft had dipped a little below the houses in top of the hill (who is aproximately 500 ft. high). The craft made a turn at a very slow speed and went towards the left (west) parrallel to the hill. My wife, sister-in-law, and my two kids saw it perfectly well in front of us at a height of about 300 ft. It didn't make any noise, and I perfectly saw the three rays of lignts on the bottom of the craft inside this round hole on the center of the bottom. The craft looked identical to saucers that have been drawn or fotografed before.  It was night but we could clearly see its dome shape siluate and bottom because of the light of the city. My kids noticed many blue colored windows. There were neighbors on the other side of the street in front who were talking together in a circle who didn't noticed it even though it went by very slowly until it disapeared behind the same hill over the houses not far from our house.

It was sometime in the year of 1987 maybe? I was living in a trailer house in Salina, Ks in a small trailer court on the southeast cornner of the intersection of Cloud and Broadway street's. The trailer set lenght way's north and south on the lot, with the front or front room\kitchen to the north. The layout of the trailer was the front north the first room is the kitchen, then the living room, two small bedroom's the bathroom then the master bedroom on the south end. There was a hallway that ran from the living room down the east side of the trailer to the master bedroom. With two outside doorway's, one from the livingroom to the front porch just off the kichen and the second back door down the hall across from the bathroom.  It was probley around 11 or 11:30 at night and I had just gone to the back bedroom to to to sleep. I hadent been in bed for very long when I heard a very loud bang or exsplosion (ever put a cherrybomb in a metal trash can?) right out the south bedroom window not but a few feet from my head. I was just starting to setup in bed to go out to see who was messing around. And right when I got ready to swing my feet from the bed to get up I noticed something on the east wall of the hall some four feet down from the back door. There was a spot on the wall glowing kind of orange in color and as I sat frozen in bed watching this spot it slowly grew bigger around and came outward from the wall in a glowing dome of light on the dark brown wood paneling of the wall, and ever so slowly it grew bigger and then a more solid core of this thing started to come threw until it emerged completly into a glowing orb of redish\orange light. And as it was floating across the hall some two feet above the floor then started to go threw the wall between the hall and bedroom I saw another spot start to form on the outside hall wall this time a greenish\yellow in color and it slowly grew in size and came into the house into the hallway and as it was coming into the hall the first redish one was slowly going threw the other wall into the second bedroom. Then the greenish one moved across the hall to go into the wall and into the bedroom after the first one. The doorway of the bedroom was open and as I lay there half out of bed frozen in wonder at what I was seeing and watch one then the other of these ball's of light come into the house and float aross the hall and go threw the wall into the bedroom I could see the light grow brighter and bigger as they came threw the wall from outside and the full brightness and size of them while they where in direct veiw in the hallway and as they kind of dimmed down as they moved threw the bedroom wall and as the first one was going threw the bedroom wall a notice as the full brightness of it th! at was in the hallway dimmed down and as part of it's light no longer came from the hall but slowly started coming out of the open doorway of the bedroom until the light from the first one came more and more from the doorway and less from the hall and all the while the first one's light changed from the hall to coming out of the doorway the second one was coming threw the outside wall into the hall until by the time the light from the first was coming from just the door way and now the second one was now fully in the hall in all of it's brightness and size and then it too slowly went across the hall to start to go threw the bedroom wall into the second bedroom fallowing the path of the first and it's light slowly changed from just coming from the hall to slowly starting to come out of the doorway until it too was  in the bedroom with the first one and I could no longer see eaither one of them but only there light coming out of the doorway and I could see the angle of the light change as they move across the bedroom until the redish\orange light of the first one slowly started to dimm and then the light of it went out completly and then the second greenish\yellow one slowly dimmed down to go out after the first one. I set there as I had the entire time half setting up in bed  in the darkness now that the light from the orb's had gone. Then I got out of bed and pulled on my jean's and went out the back doorway and around the south end of the trailer to the west yard to try to see where the ball's of light had gone to but I could see no sign of  them, there was another trailer that set to the west of mine and I looked at the window's  to see if I could see the light of the orb's coming from them thinking that maybe they had gone into it as they had mine but I could see no sign of them.  After looking around and up into the night sky for a few minute's I gave up and went back in and went back to bed and fell quickly asleep as if nothing much had happened at all.  The lenght of time of this sighting is about 2 to 3 minute's? The orb's\ball's of light about two to three feet in diameter of the outer corona of light coming out from the more solid inter core of the center wich was about a foot across. I had seen ball's of light or orb's like this before in a bigger group flying across some feild's and wich I have also made a report on. And to the best I am able to tell they are of the same type of craft\probe or whatever they are. And they had a feeling about them that they where somehow alive or at least controled by some intelegant being? And one thing that has alway's puzzeled me is how while it was all going on how in wonder and amazement I felt and then how after it was over I could just forget about it all and go to sleep as if nothing had happened at all. It was only year's latter when I thought about it any at all that I wished that I would of thought to get out of bed and touched one of them to see what would happen and to know for shure that they where real by touching them, but then maybe that would'nt have been such a smart thing to do? And after thinking about this sighting and other one's I have had I have only question's with no answer's and many question's to ask with knowone to ask them. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

THe sighting took place at about 10:15PM on Thursday, July 8th. About 30 minutes before the sighting, waiting in line in the car for the ferry, I noticed a helicopter moving in from the NE to the SE. I saw it and then it moved behind us and I could hear it for some time. A little bit later I was on the ferry in the car, which was parked at the very front of the ferry. I saw one helicopter who had 5 or so uncolored lights on. I also saw another object, that I could not discern as a helicopter or plane. It was too far away for me to tell its shape, but I could tell it was pointed. I thought it might be a small airplane. The unidentified object was directly in front of the ferry, and the helicopter was a ways to the left, moving to circle the area. The helicopter and unidentified object appeared to be at about the same height, and around the same speed, though the helicopter was farther away (I am terrible at estimating distances and altitude and speed.) The helicopter's lights, after a few seconds, changed to one uncolored light and one red/blue light (it appeared to be two lights cloase to each other, but I am nto sure) that alternated in blinking between uncolored and red/blue. This was the lighting all helicopters I saw from that point on were using. The unidentified object remained the same in terms of lighting. I looked at the object closely, as it passed directly over the ferry. I saw that the lights were all uncolored, shaped in an equilateral triangle, with one light in the center appearing to pulsate. I saw this from directly under the object as it passed over the ferry. Then the object mobed behind us and the ferry itself obstructed my ability to see it. The helicopter also moved out of sight as it moved to the left of the ferry where I was unable to see it. However, a few minutes later one helicopter came over the hill directly in front of me, and another came in! from the right where it had been invisible to me before due to the ferry obstructing my vision. I estimate that in all there were 3 or 4, possibly even 5 helicopters that appeared to be circling the area around Vashon Island. The craft I saw did not exhibit physically remarkable flight characteristics, except possibly for air-speed which I am not capable of effectively judging and so have no idea. The craft simply moved in a straight line and maintained the same speed and altitude. Like I said I guess it was traveling a little faster than the helicopters in the area, but it is hard for me to tell. Once I got off the ferry I saw another helicopter which was likely one of the ones I had seen earlier coming around in the circle. As surprising as it may sound I did not attempt to look back across the water at the object and choppers after I got off the ferry. I am not certain why.",2004-07-25T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

Typically during business hours the parking lot flood lights are on to help customers get to there cars. After closing time the lights are turned off at this particular site. While I was out tracking down some carts I happened to look up and noticed a black, rectangular object silently fly directly over head. The object was all black with no running lights. The object made no sound. It appeared very smooth as I did not view any surface features. In fact the only way I noticed it was from the reflection of the street/city lights off the bottom of the craft. I would say the craft was anywhere from 500-1000ft from the ground and maybe 100-150ft across. It was a clear night and the craft was as black as the night sky if not slightly darker. It was heading due North. The whole event lasted about 10secs. Another point of interest is that McClellan AFB is about 1-2 miles west of sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There were approximately 10-20 of us all around the area. It's been more than 10 years, so I'll do my best at decribing what I can remember. I only just found this site today (07/19/04).  I was living in Sedona at the time, and my friends and I loved to go hiking whenever we could. We had heard many stories of UFO's, but most there had never witnessed any personally.  A couple of my closest friends and I were inside the van which was parked at the top of Shnebley (sp?)or as close as we could get. There was a sort of pseudo rocky parking lot which we used as a ""base"".  I don't remember the exact time, but it was near dusk and I was inside the van with a few friends. All of a sudden someone pulled open the sliding door and screamed, ""you've got to come see this....there are some strange things going on out here!""  So, of course, we all piled out and walked to the end of the ""parking lot"", looking towards the major rock formations directly across from us (I can't remember the name of the certain formation now). They were all pointing across the way to what looked like two black helicoptors which were looking like they were ""guarding"" either side of this strange rock formation. This is so hard to explain, I wish I could remember the name of the rock...you'd know exactly how it was set up. WEll, just then, the middle flat front face of this rock formation all of a sudden disappeared while the black helicoptors just ""stood guard"" on either side of the ""cave"" and UFO's stared flying out of the new formed ""cave"". The UFO's were fling very erraticly, hard to count or follow a certain one. They continued to zip about until all were out of the ""cave"". Then in a flash they were here, then there, then zap! gone! no where to be seen! Then, the rock face closed back up and the black helicoptors waited a few minutes and took off.  All of us were stunned, needless to say. We didn't know what to think and all of us had our own descriptions of what we saw, but we all agreed that we had witnessed something none of us could explain. All of us all felt an unnatural ""buzzing"" like a different frequency disturbing the area.  During the next few months of living there, I encountered many sightings of black helicopters, strange stories of ""government men in black"" turning away hikers in certain areas and caves, and even a strange underground explosion, or earthquake, or something...(none who were with me ever heard anything in the news about an earthquake or explosion underground in the Sedona area).

We had been interviewing a local tribe of that region.  My crew (except for the cameraman and I) had left.  We stayed behind to spend the night for ""wrap-arounds"" and extra footage.  We were sitting high above a moonlit field or plateau talking with some of the natives over a  small bonfire.  I happen to detect an oval shape gliding over and across the large field rapidly.  When I alarmed the rest to witness, it had retrieved into the woods.  It had no lights.  It looked like a floating silohette about the size of a car. Natives and my cameraman wondered if I had seen a horse or a car, but I assured them that niether would have had the distinct abiltiy to move so steadily the way I saw this, and glide as fast across the open space.  They began to cajole about it as a superstition, so I dropped it to avoid further embarressment.  But later, after about half an hour I heard a noise (like someone blowing hard into my ear)and immediately felt like someone threw a burst of air on my back.  I reacted.  Surprisingly, I looked around and noticed no one heard or sensed this even though we all sat tightley in a circle. Later that night we went to bed in our cabin.  Needless to say I was a little scared, but the calmness and assurances of the natives made me feel safer, ""that none of these ""energies"" would bring us harm so long as we stayed away"". The cameraman and I slept on the floor in individual sleeping-bags.  He slept in front of me facing away about five feet away.  I couldn't sleep, but just when I began to feel drowsy I heard that harsh noise in my ear again.  Then I heard the sounds of children(for about a second or two).  I didn't want to hear anymore, when all of a sudden the cameraman's head bobs up asking me if I had heard the same thing.  He scrammbled for his flashlight in his backpack.  I had the strange sensation that this was truley abnormal, but the juornalistic sense in me had me curious as to see what was going on, and we stepped outside.  As we reached about ten feet away from the front door.  I heard and felt the air go through me again.  I turned around and looked at my cameraman.  Staring at me wide-eyed he blurted, ""I heard it this time!"".  We rushed back inside the cabin trusting the natives warning that ""these energies would bring no harm if we stay out of their way"".  We didn't hear anything the rest of the night. Six years later, back in the United States, I hosted a conference for the Air Force.  But there was one group which anchored the event called Air Force/IPT whose activities were not to be disclosed or disturbed.  Their makeshift computer displays in secluede rooms of our Ranch were to be visited or touched in any way by our staff or anyone.  At the end of the week a small reception to place where all colonels, captains and respective staff memebers of IPT congregated for farewells.  They were a lot more relaxed and I was able to find out a little more about their organization.  ""IPT, they said, ""stands for Integral Programming Technologies, we put your military satellites in space"".  Curious about their stand on UFO's, I was surprised that they admitted they did believe in them, and that in their line of work they had constantley interacted with them in one way or another.

It performed seemingly random turns 3 or 4 more times before finally moving away beyond our sight. It appeared to move slowly but, using the roof of the house as one reference point and the treeline opposite as another, which were around 30 meteres apart, dependant on the height of the object iot crossed this space in about 20 seconds, suggesting a rate of some hundreds of miles per hour.

I am very interested in UFOs, but my interest began one night  long while ago- I was only 4 years old, but I had high IQ stats. It was the middle of the night one something awoke me- a strange feeling-I didn't like it. I looked at the clock. 2:03 am. The clock was on a dresser next to the window. I saw a light outside, but assumed it was an aircraft. I made a double take. The light I saw was very large, larger than the moon.(In appearance) Its colours constantly shifted, changing hues every second. Surrounding it were dozens of smaller lights. Through the window I saw it had a strange, grotesque shape- the large light was the center of the craft, and along with the other lights were a few that were smaller than the big one, but bigger than the small ones, that lined the outline of the craft. The craft iself seemed tear-drop shaped, yet sprouting from random parts of the craft were long, tentacle-like protrusions, and they seemed to be comming dangerously close to the ground. The pointed end of the craft was a single, stiff spine. Having keen vision, even in the dark, I squinted to see if I could refer just what was on the ship. I saw mininscule humanoids in the craft, but before I could decifer more, a flash of light broke the calm, settle night, and it's the last thing I remember. I came back to in my bed, nearly an hour later, but did not recall falling asleep. A week later, however, strange markings began appearing on me. They looked like needle marks- only much bigger, and much redder. My IQ nearly doubled, perplexing my doctor over the few weeks it happened. Things strange still happen to me, and although I move around alot, I have constant UFO sightings. I'm still obseesed in UFOs, aliens, area 51, and the like. In my quest for answers, I stumbled upon an odd book that revealed some secrets to me. I may be, as the book says, a ""Star Child,"" one of very few people that are either descendents of aliens, or are looked after by the like, with occasional ""check-ups.""

We were in an open field, no moon, so dark you could not see where you were walking. At the time I had a Starlight Scope with an attached IR light.  As I looked around through the scope, I could see animal eyes, deer, coyotes, rabits, etc., glowing in the dark from the IR light source.  Then I decided to look up into the moonless night sky.  I turned off the IR. Now and then I could see an airliner moving high overhead.  To idintify the airliner, I looked at it with the Starlight Scope (2.5 X) and then noticed I could see the flashing nav. light.  Without the scope it was difficult to see the flashing nav. light. A few minutes later, almost straight overhead I noticed another dot of light moving west.  When I examined this light there was no flashing nav. light.  At first I thought it was a satilite, however, the dot of light changed direction and proceeded somewhat south then east, then back west to a point about 50 degrees off the horizon. I constantly checked this dot with my Starlight Scope and still no flashing nav. light. The dot of light then remained locked in position with the stars and slowly dimmed out.  I belive the object became dim because it was moving away from earth. Conclusion:  This has to be a UFO in the true meaning of the word.  It was not an airliner nor a satilite.

What looked like a star , proved to something much more interesting!!!!! Me my girlfriend and roomate went down to the beach after sunset. We were watching the stars, when what appeared to just be a star hanging low right on the horixon, burst into a huge ball of yellow-orange light. The glow lasted approx 5 seconds and then dissolved right back to a star on the horizon. All three of us saw the same thing. Then the object shot across the horizon at an unreal speed.  It seemed to almost teleport all the way across the horizon. It sat for a second and then shot about halfway back. It then abruptly stopped and began moving slow and smooth like a plane. At this point we were all absolutely speechless!  As we began to discuss what might have just happened, I noticed the object looked like it might have been coming off the horizon.  It made its way directly towards us. In under 45 sec. the object that was a dot on the horizon had so smoothly approached us within 1000 yds. off shore and was hovering at approx. 1000 ft.  It was never possible to get a good visual of the object though, it was extremely errie that it was that close and we never were able to tell what it was.  The light on it was a wide bright white glow, the glow was the only thing we could see.  The object approached so gracefully, making just a slight hum, it was not a prop enging plane, it was not a jet engine plane, it was not a helecopter! After the object hovered over us for approx. 50 sec. it turned its light away from us and slowly headed back off to the horizon, yet still even from behind we were never able to get a visual on the object.  All three of us were in complete shock, when the object began approaching, no one said a damn word untill it left!  we all saw the same thing, and we all are convinced it was absolutely out of this world. My uncle was an F15 pilot for 25 years, growing up I was facinated will all aviation, I can tell you almost any jet that flys over the beach either en route to Mac Dill, Tampa or Clear/St.Pt.  This experience leads me to believe that there is definetely some! thing somewhere with far better technology than ours.  A brand new F22 went over a few days ago, he hit the after burners while going over and it shook the whole neighborhood, this new superjets speed was probably 1/1000th of the objects!! Anyway, This experience was unreal, I am a firm believer now that something else is out There.  And then two days later, I see in the St Pete Times the Incident in Iran. An entire village observed an object in braod daylight.  And now the March 5th video of the Mexican Air force, it was explained as balls of lightning, are you kidding they surrounded the jet!!!

I was driving from bethlehem to naugatuck. Crossing route 6, i saw this thing. that looked similiar to a plane, it was really low, REALLY LOW and going down at an angle. When i got to route 6 not even 30seconds later i looked to the right and there was nothing. My boyfriend was behind me and he told me it was an Helicopter. Well i got to middlebury where westover was and i passed westover and i looked up and i saw the same thing! but this time it did look like an helicopter because it fast across the road.. <---- like that. Then it went up the side of the trees.. toward my direction. It was REALLY REALLY low. Like above the trees. I slowed down to see what it was.. It was just sitting there. I couldn't really see a body shape at all. I could only see the lights.. which made a shape similiar to a plane... It had wing lights on the very edges and a light on what seemed to be a tail. but there was nothing else then that and it was just SITTING THERE and then it started to move away.. very very very slowly. So by now i am freaked out.. i called my boyfriend who went another way and when i drove by hop brook in naugatuck, he called me. He said there was one over his head where he was in nauagatuck. He said it was real low but he rolled down his window and it sounded like a plane but he wasn't sure. I just think its really strange and bizarre.

This is in response to the audio program you aired on 10-12-2004 on the object above the Minneapolis area.  I was listening to the program and was also emailing one of your guests, Will.  He suggested I provide a description of what I saw on August 19th, 2004.  I arrived home to Chaska, MN (about 5 miles from the Chanhassen Weather Center) from a business trip to Madison, WI.  the last 110 miles of the trip heads pretty much East to West heading into and through the Minneapolis area.  As I was unloading my vehicle my neighbor stopped by (he is retired military) and we chatted a little bit.  When I asked him what I had missed the last couple of days, he pointed in the sky directly above us and said, ""see that, it's been in the spot since 9:00 am this morning.  I looked up in the sky and saw a very bright object, very high in the sky.  I asked hime what it was, and he said nobody knows.  He said reports had been on TV and radio, but nobody knew what it was.  I ran in the house and grabbed my 10X binoculars and focused in on it.  It was very bright, light looking into a bright light and had a sloped rectangular shape (trapezoid?).  The brightness was unusual.  The light seemed to, well, move like when you look at an asphalt road and see the heat coming off the surface.  As I watched it, I noticed from the middle of the object to the bottom of it, was a grey V shape.  More like a rounded V, coming from the middle sides of the object and meeting at a point in the bottom of the object.  I ran back in the house and grabbed my video recorder.  It has a 150X digital zoom.  I tried to focus on the object, but couldn't keep it steady enough as I lay on my back in my yard.  I recorded it for about a minute, then reviewed what I had recorded.  All you could see was a bright light in the sky, it did not focus very well.  So I went back to watching it through the binoculars.  The object did move a little as I watched it.  If I held my hands above my head, at a distance of about 2 feet apart, that is the distance it moved by 7:30pm.  My military neighbor came back over to my house to let me know, that if it was something unknown, he was guaranteed that there would be military jets flying around.  I just kept watching.  Around 8:30, I asked another neighbor to look at the object through the binoculars and describe what he saw.  He saw it the same way as I did.  His wife looked at it and agreed.  Both were as curious as I was on what the object was.  By 9:00pm, the object had continued to move (another 2 feet measured by holding my hands above my head).  As my neighbor and his wife watched with me, the sun began to sink into the horizon.  As the sun goes down, it does turn a reddish orange.  As the sun turned that color, so did the object.  Leads me to believe the object was highly reflective, and reflecting light from the sun.  As the sun went down, the moon was rising from the SW.  The moon rose and the object stayed in the same location.  Once the sun was totally below the horizon, we could no longer see the object.  Even though there was still some sunlight left in the horizon.  Through the whole time I watched the object, it moved, drifted in a North to South direction.  I wasn't looking straight up in the air, but the object was about 75 degrees above the horizon.  I checked for reports the next day if there were sightings to the South, like Iowa or Nebraska, and nothing was reported.  BUT, I did see reports on August 20th that an object was noticed in the skies around Phoenix.  Some of the pictures that were submitted looked very similar to what I saw.  Again, submitting this based on the comments Mr Rense made from your show. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above to 1700 hrs.  PD))",2004-10-27T00:00:00,44.8054,-93.6248

My 6 year old daughter asked if I had ever seen any UFOs. I said with all the sky watching I've done over the years I never had. I do think they exist. I'm an aviation buff. I do a lot of amature astronomy & sky watching. Meteor showers, Planets, Northern lights, Helicoptors, military aircraft. I've seen some pretty spectacular meteors. Even one that hit the earth. I know aircraft & stuff in the sky. About 2 minutes after I said I'd never seen a UFO my wife said ""is that one?"" I thought she was kidding. The kids got pretty excited. I looked up to the west. What I say sent a chill up my spine. 2 dark red oval or surf board shaped objects traveling side by side. They looked like two sets of eliptical wings like a WW 2 Spitfire but no fuselage. It looked like they had some kind of internal glow or lighting. A rust red or dark orange. I thought it looked like they had some kind of geometric pattern on the bottom that mimiced the eliptical shape of craft. Maybe a light or window. My 9 year old daughter thought on of them tilted a bit and she could see the top and it had some kind of structure like a box on the top. They seemed to be in formation. Traveling very fast straight east. No sound at all. We get a of approaching air traffic for Mpls, St Paul Int airport. Pretty high up here.

Slowly moving east then gone! The date was July 6, 2000. An easy date to verify since it was the date of President Clinton's visit to Missouri University here in Coloumbia, MO.  It had just become dark. I was on my bicycle and was peddling west on Wilks Blvd. just north of Columbia Collage.  I stopped at 8th street. As as I crossed 8th street I noticed a very bright light in the sky, slightly to the south of my location but north of the Missouri University complex and the downtown business district.  It was like a helicoptor search light and seemed to be at about two to three thousand feet altitude. However, there was no red or green running light, or strobe light; and there was no noise!  I then noticed there was a second, similar bright light at least two football fields to the south; and a third similar, bright light at least three football fields to the east! The lights formed a huge triangle in the night sky.  My first thought was that they were very quiet military helicopters hovering over the sight of President Clinton's address to the nation from the university campus. Then I noticed that within the huge triangle the stars were blotted out!  There was a huge, apparently solid object hovering in the night sky over the city of Columbia, Missouri!  There was a police car parked on 8th street and as I started to go toward the squad car the three lights in the sky started moving in tandem slowly to the east. The police car started moving north towards me and I tried to flag them down; but they evidently had been dispatched and they paid no attention to my attempt to stop them.  The lights at the tips of the triangular craft never changed in color or brightness.  There were no other lights or distinguishable characteristics visible or audible to me. As I peddled to the south to maintain my view of the UFO I looked down the street and when I looked back up and it was gone!  It just disappeared!  I had heard of Art Bell's tales of big black triangles in the sky and WAS a complete skeptic of the phenomenon.  I was a grade school teacher. I am an ex-special forces medic who became a chiropractor (PCC, 1969).  I don't drink, smoke or do recreational or pharmaceutical drugs.  I am a well read, 65 years young ""health nut"" who takes very good care of my self. I have flown and jumped from many different aircraft. I have a good sense of what I observed.  I  believe that what I saw was not created by our then-current or now current human technology.  SOME VERY INTELLIGENT ENTITY IS OBSERVING US; just like we observe our flocks and heards!  I hope we don't get treated by them like we treat our plants and animals!  We had best straighten up our behavior and fly right... The consenquences of our acts could be frightening.

Curiosity finally took hold and after 3 years I am investigating what was so obvious to my wife and I. I am a private pilot of small aircraft out of NJ as well as a military aircraft buff. I am highly familiar with the NYC sky, aircraft, military aircraft and flight patterns. Now that I have given you my credentials I will explain what we saw while sailing 4 miles south of the Verazzano bridge just 4 days after the WTC disaster. You could document my being there because besides the coast guard there couldn't have been more than a handful of boats in the entire area.  This is what we observed: From my positions sailing from the Naval ships docked at Earle to Keyport NJ (east to west) we saw a perfectly shaped reflective ""pill"" shaped object that was positioned like a blimp standing on its end. The sky was perfectly clear with a light North to Northwest breeze blowing. The object was absolutely stationary, seemed to be at an altitude of 10K to 15K feet and the approximate size of a blimp. However it looked nothing like a blimp acted nothing like a blimp and I am very familiar with the many blimps in our area. We were extremely upset that entire sailing trip seeing first hand the devistation that had taken place with our own eyes and smelling the acrid smoldering of the WTC all day. We were a bit shocked so the sighting didn't seem as spectacular as it might have at another time. So, after observing this thing for some 45 min plus the sun lowering seemed to illuminate or reflect twilight making it more and more visible. It then did something that really amazed me. It started to move slowly (relatively slowly depending on its actual size and elevation) and smoothly across the manhattan skyline and straight up the Hudson river (North) at the same altitude until it dissappeared. This thing didn't move an inch and then she just moved with utter perfection directly AGAINST THE WIND. Not a sound and defied everything I knew about aircraft and proposed military aircraft. I know that the military was flying high altitude CAP at that very time and did not seem to be at all interested in this giant thing hanging over NYC.",2004-09-29T00:00:00,,

It was before sunrise and the sky was still somewhat dark but beginning lighten. The aircraft appeared to be similar in shape and 1/2 the size of a normal size airliner. I could see the left side of the aircraft and it had a shape of a tail section similar to a normal aircraft but I could not see any defined wings.The aircraft caught my attention because there were no aircraft running lights blinking on the craft and it appeared as though it was preparing to land.(No Airport in the area) The aircraft then made a move in flight where I was able to see several lights under the craft as it was getting farther away from me. I was approximately 1/2 mile from the craft as I was drivng my car Northbound in its direction.As I got closer to the area where I saw the aircraft, I lost sight of it. I looked to the West to see if the craft was actually making a landing in the desert to the West. When I looked in that direction, I saw for a brief second a large craft coming quickly in my direction from almost ground level and then swooping up in a upward direction back up to the sky. I could see what appeared as three dull or filtered circular shaped lights under the craft facing me as the craft darted back up in the sky. I believe there were two white lights with a red/amber light between them under the craft.I estimate the distance between the aicraft and me to be within a couple of hundred yards from my location and there was no engine or jet noise that I could hear coming from the craft.Because I was driving at the time of the sighting,I was unable to stop because there was other traffic at the intersection that I was approaching.

We were aboard the Royal Clipper sailing from Losinj to Hvar on Friday, 20 August 2004 at 22:15 CEST (GMT+1) 44d06m09s N 14d44m06s E, looking at the beautiful starfield afforded by the view just behind the bridge. Maritime regulations require the front of a ship to be dark, so the view of the sky was quite good. We're suburbanites, and we don't get a good view of the sky including the Milky Way all that often. The only real issue was the haze: it had been a hot, muggy day, and the haze limited viewing to about 45 degrees from zenith.  We were counting meteors (and a good count, too: stragglers from the Perseids?) when my eyes caught two lights almost directly overhead. The two lights were on the same line of flight but offset from one another. I'm not good at magnitudes, but the lights were not that much brighter than most of the stars in the sky. What was obvious was that they were white and steady (did not twinkle like stars or blink/flash like aircraft navigation lights) and they were definitely headed in the same direction and staying the same distance apart. The two lights were about as far apart as 2 quarters held at arms length. They moved across the span of my fist at arms length in about two seconds.  I figured this was a pair of fighters in formation except for the complete lack of jet noise. Then I saw the third light moving alongside the trailing light making an isosceles triangle about as long as it was wide moving in the direction of the narrow vertex. Again, the three objects maintained their spacing the whole of the time we watched.  The ship was on a heading of 148.2 degrees magnetic (based upon the magnetic compass under my right elbow), and the object appeared to be headed toward about 110 degrees on the horizon. We lost the object in the haze at about 45 degrees from zenith.  My darling wife saw the object as well. (Amazing I could get her attention given I had laryngitis and couldn't speak above a whisper.) She says that she saw the stars between the three lights blink out as they went by, but I'm not so sure about that. The eyes can play tricks, and I'm not certain that that ""blink out"" wasn't just the effect of ones eyes dealing with moving objects against a non-moving field.  Of course we were alone on the foredeck during our sighting. Several people joined us just as we lost the object in the haze. Darling wife dived into the bridge to get our location and heading.  My sense was that these three lights were very high up and resembled the Space Station or satellites I've seen in that they were moving in a steady straight line. My first notion was that this was the NOSS satellite constellation. However, that system would be in a polar orbit.

It was flying very low, slower than most small airplanes in a northeast to southwest direction in the general path I-69 follows into Indianapolis.  As the craft flew towards Indy, I could see its silhoutte against the city lights and I saw a small red orb-like light fly up to the craft then a short time later fly back towards the ground.  At the time I didn't think too much about what I saw, but I seen the same craft that was seen in Belgium, Illinois, etc., and when I realized that others have seen this craft I knew I wasn't imagining this thing.  In my opinion, if this craft is one of ours then I believe it's some sort of low and slow stealth reconnaise craft.  This football field sized craft obviously wasn't concerned with being seen since there was probably 10,000-15,000 people at the show.

The night sky was crystal clear and moon-less. No city lights or anything to dim the view at the sky. The craft got close enough that we could see 5 lights, each one as if on the corner of a pentagon. The craft came directly overhead, no sound at all. We thought it possible to be 5 helos in formation, but found it wierd that we did not hear them. When it passed over, we saw it to be one craft. We could not see anything between the lights and did not realize it was a single craft until it blocked the view of stars as it passed over. We could not tell how high it was but agreed that it was as large as a jumbo jet and flying at an altitude that private planes usually fly. We watched for another 20-30 mins until it was out of view.

We was watching tv and all of a sudden the door came open , it was my brother , he said there was a ufo ! I thought yeah i bet . We all got up and went out side , there was a very big and very bright green ball moving across the sky from east to west , at times a red glow was under the object , and little red objects would move out from the bottom of this red glowing corona . The sighting didn't last very long as we watched the ufo go behind the trees in the west and as it went behind the trees , we were all watching the skies and all of a sudden a very bright green light shot up from the ground into the air , the light was in the shape of a V , I have never seen anything like this in my life , it was a very bright green and in the shape of a perfect V , and the green light slowly faded away . We were all so amazed at what we had just seen , and were trying to figure out what it could have been , we talked for a minute or so and my mom went it to the house and we went in with her , she got on the phone to call my dad and tell him what we had just seen , she tried dialing the number where he works and a voice came on the line and said (this is an international operator and your call did not go through , and the line went dead, in a few minutes the tone came back , so she tried it again , and the very same thing happened again, she would keep trying , and the same thing would happen , in hour or so the phone started working normal again , We thought we had seen the ufo crash so we got in the car and started driving toward the direction of the bright green flash , we looked for hours but didn't find anything , so we all went home and went to bed , the kids were a bit scared , but in time all went to sleep.

My wife and I had tried to have kids the whole time while I was in the service but to no avail.  An Air Force physician had told us that we couldn't have any kids because my sperm count was too low.  I told him that I had suffered an injury ((deleted)) when I was a child.  He said that this was probably the reason why we couldn't have any children. One night in the summer of 1993 I had a nightmare and woke up the next morning in a cold sweat. For some reason I couldn't recall what I had dreamed and just shook it off.  I noticed a burn or boil ((deleted--in groin.))  A couple of days later I was mowing the grass and noticed three burn marks on the ground.  Each mark was circular and about 2 feet in diameter and blackened. I then noticed that the three circles formed a perfect triangle with about 30 foot sides. My wife can confirm this.  One of the circles was in close proximity to one of our blue spruce pine trees.  I thought that was peculiar so I grabbed my flashlight and squirmed underneath the tree.  On the trunk I found that the bark was burnt and a couple of small branches had been burned off. There was also some residue on the ground that resembled small chunks of yellow plastic.   This is not the end of the story.  Next month my wife missed her period. We did a home pregnancy test and found out she was pregnant with my daughter **** (Born April 1994).  **** is extraordinary.  She gets straight A's and has some precognitive abilities.  A very sensitive child. It's as though whoever put the burn marks on my privates, fixed whatever damage there was from childhood.  Last year **** came into our bedroom and asked to sleep with us because she was afraid. We said yes and the next morning she said that she woke up in the middle of the night,(she was laying between us), and said that four alien looking creatures were doing something to mommy and daddy.  ""Two on daddy's side and two on mommy's side.""  She said that she got scared and put the blanket over her head and stayed that way till morning.  She did go on to say that they stepped through a door or portal and it had a bluish haze to it. It wasn't our bedroom door.  This makes me think that maybe the aliens are traveling through dimensions and not space.  Anyway, you might think that I'm totally wacko by now but I swear on a stack of bibles that this is the truth.  I told my parents about the facts and they laughed at me, so that's why I dropped the subject.  Please, if you print this story I don't want my name publicized for obvious reasons.

It was 8:45 PM, July-7-1997.  I was leaving work and heading west down Nike Ave.  I had just reached the horse shoe curve at Launch Complex-32 .  In the distant mountains, just north of the artillery range, in the smallest portion of the mountain range, I thought I saw a orange ball of fire burning two- thirds  the  way up the  mountain side.  There were fires in that same place the year before.  The smoke of those fires  invaded Main Post.  The diameter of the object was about 1/4 to 1/5 the height of the mountain. As I continued to drive west on Nike Ave. I notice that this was not a fire				 but something that was fiery orange and was floating down the mountain.				 When the object was about half way down it headed north towards Main Post.				 I continued to drive west on Nike Ave towards Main Post.				 The object then changed from orange to a luminous white. 				 The object then headed in my direction and stopped half way down Nike Ave.				 It stayed lit or luminated all the way from the mountain to the halfway point of Nike Ave.				 The light intensity stayed the same too. It started to descend and I thought it was going to land  but it did not. It came within about 15 feet of the ground and I waiting to see sand kick up around it but there was none.  It was the size of a VW beetle shaped like a ordinary light bulb. This object just stopped in mid-air and didn't float around or wobble  but stayed in one place. Any other known aircraft would wobble a little to compensate for air currents. It wasn't a helicopter because it was so close you would have heard the helicopter's motor.  There was no sound.  You can hear a helicopter a mile away and this object was less than a block away. The object was so luminous that it was like looking right into a light bulb at night and seeing nothing but the light. If someone was inside the object they would be blinded. I stopped my car and set my headlights in it's direction. I then saw the light turn off. (The light being the object). I said to myself if this is a hot-air balloon then when it relites it should flicker before it glows in full intensity. I have seen balloons at night like at the Night Glow Festival and they all flicker when the propane burners turn on. I then said to myself "" don't blink my eyes or I might miss the relighting and miss the glimpse of flickering. I did not blink and the object did not flicker but came back to full intensity instantly like turning on a light bulb. I thought if there was any intelligence on board this thing it might understand mathematics. I turned my headlights off and then blinked the headlights once, twice, and three times, then twice, then once. This would show addition and subtraction in its simplest form. Now the object started to move in the direction from which it came. It followed the same flight path back the same way it had came.  As though it was following a programmed flight course. I started my car and continued to drive west on Nike Ave.  Keeping an eye on it until it went over the mountain.  It got to the mountain before I got to the end of Nike Ave. which tells me this thing was not a balloon but flew under quite some power because it traveled an estimated distance of 8 miles in about 8 minutes and that works out to be about 60 MPH. From that point on I headed home going north on Owen Road which leads to Highway 70. As I cloverleafed around to get on highway 70, I was now facing south and looking at the mountains where the object flew over.  I could see two bright lights coming over the mountain and they were together.  It looked like headlights of a car flying over the mountain heading north. The lights, flying parallel to each other, split apart, one going west and the other going East and both turned back to the mountain they just came over to go back over it again. I also observed a red blinking light setting over the mountain where these two white lights were. Then all three lights moved back behind the mountain and I didn't see nothing after that.  I proceeded to continue on my way back home. After many years of pondering this incident I don't believe it to have been a balloon. Because people flying in a balloon so close at night in the mountains would be very dangerous.  And this object flew a long distance in a short time which means the balloon would have to have a motor to move it so fast.   But I don't know what it was I cannot leave out the possibly it could have been a balloon.  I have another idea it could have been a light source like a laser facility shinning a light against the mountain and then pointing the light down Nike Ave.  But when I saw the light at such close distance to me the object looked like a solid object.   I don't know to this day what I saw.",2004-07-25T00:00:00,,

It was a hot, dark summer night and the windows were open.  He did not hear any sound and although he looked up into the night sky to see where the lights were coming from, he could not see anything.  He came to bed and woke me up saying, ""Look out the window and tell me what you see.""  I had to put my eyeglasses on to see.  I got on my knees and looked one of two windows that overlook our back yard.  I could see the rotating lights.  The lights moved continuously from one side to the other along our neighbors fence.  They also ran perfectly between two sheds in our back yard.  The lights stayed inside the space between the sheds and only shone on the tall picket fence.  My first thought was that the police were in his yard shining their lights but his fence pickets are close together so that much light would not be able to shine on our side of his fence like they were.  I then looked out a third window in our bedroom which looks over our driveway onto the main road near our home hoping to see a police car or a fire truck.  I saw nothing.  My heart was pounding and I was curious as to what was causing these lights to shine in our back yard.  I then walked into our son's bedroom in the front of the house.  His room has two windows, one over the driveway and one in the front overlooking the entire front yard.  I pulled up the blinds and looked from left to right seeing absolutely no police or fire trucks.  What was going on?  I was getting scared now.  I walked to the other side of our home into the dining room.  The windows in the dining room face the front yard and the side yard facing our next door neighbor.  It was pitch black outside.  Although we have trees surrounding our home we can still see moonshine if the moon is up.  I have never checked any almanac to see what cycle the moon was in on July 18, 1997 but I bet there was no moonlight.  It was pitch!  I saw no police or fire trucks.  I cannot imagine what other vehicle could be emitting these lights except a police car or a fire truck.  No other lights that I know of rotate like the kind on top of a police car and these lights were closer to that type of fast rotation but they were faster.  So now the only place I could go to get a last look would be into the den where my husband had originally seen the lights.  Mind you, he never told me what he saw ... he only told me to look up from the bed I had been sleeping in and tell him what I saw!  When I got to the sliding doors, I was afraid.  I froze!  By this time I had been thinking about where these lights could be coming from and since I had not seen or heard anything from the opened windows that would give me a single clue as to where these lights were coming.  The only logical idea I could come up with was, ""What if there is a burglar in our yard with some sort of ""spectacular"" flashlight or something along those lines?""  ""What if this burglar sees me in the den?""  ""He might see me seeing him and I live here ... I was so scared.""  I could not open the sliding door to enter the den to look out those windows.  Instead I walked back to our bedroom.  I asked my husband if he thought maybe we had left the light in the sunroom on ... maybe we had left the light and the fan on.""  I wondered out loud if that would make the lights in the back yard.  I was grasping at straws, I admit that now but then I was just trying to figure out every conceivable idea that might make some sense.  I asked him if he wanted to go downstairs with me to check the sunroom.  He did not want to go.  So, I just kneeled on the bed and strained my eyes and ears to hear anything.  I may have kneeled that way for another ten minutes and then the lights just stopped.  I waited to hear crunching sounds on the ground and there was not a single sound of any kind.  I lay down and my heart was pounding out of my chest.  We eventually went to sleep.  In the morning I went downstairs to open the curtains to the sunroom to see if the lights and ceiling fan were on.  They were off!  I walked into the room and went right up to the glass windows which run from the ceiling to the floor to see if there were any footprints in the grass.  It's a stretch but I wanted to look for any clue that might make the whole incident more ""earth bound"" than unidentified!  About a month after this event, I was reading the Eagle Tribune and in the Sound Off portion of the paper where folks can call in a question or voice an opinion, I read a short story where a caller wanted to know if anyone had noticied the rotating lights that were shining for about an hour one night over the dump in Derry.  I have never seen or heard anything else about these lights in this area.  We never told our neighbors or called the local authorities to report.  That was seven years ago just this past Sunday and I finally feel that enough time has elapsed that I can write about it.  It would be interesting to know if anyone else in Salem, NH has ever seen lights like this or had a similar experience.  Thanks!",2004-07-25T00:00:00,42.79500000000001,-71.2256

At first I thought it was a little strange and almost as soon as I finished the thought I noticed a black shape (Triangular) moving through the sky. The sky was clear of clouds that night so that is why I didn't see this object at first, plus the fact that the object seemed to make no noise. At first I wasn't really comprehending what I was seeing. As soon as I realized what it was I froze. I wanted to go get one of my other family members but for some reason I was unable to do anything more then to stare at it as it fly slowly overhead at about 700 to 1,000 ft. The  strangest thing about the object was that it was moving so slowly. If I had to guess the object's speed, I'd say it was moving at about 50 to 75 mph(North to South). It was so black that if I hadn't noticed the stars dissapearing and reappearing then I probably would of never of noticed it. One more thing. This might sound stupid but the object appeared to have a circular window on the bottom side of it with light coming out of it.I didn't observe any type of activity in the window(if that was in fact a window and that was the bottom side of the object).Maybe it was a light on the bottom but it didn't seem to be.Until that night I never really believed if unexplained flying objects and while my knowledge may be limited in the area of terrestial flying objects I am sure that what I witnessed that night was an object that I can't explained and my thoughts sometimes go back to that night. I also believe that I witnessed see the same object one more time in march of 1998 after I returned to my home in Long Beach, Ca that event was so fast that it lasted less then 10 seconds. I caught a glimpse of it between some buildings when an object passed between the moon and me casting a shadow on me.I looked up because I didn't hear the helicopter that the police use flying over hear and there it was again.I have never seen the object again. I also cannot explain why I froze in place the first time I saw the object.All my senses were screaming at me to go get someone but I just stood there in utter amazment and shock. Go figure.

I am a 50 year old woman and didn't want my family to think I was crazy.  It wasn't until I mentioned it to someone I know about my experience that they told me that they also had seen a UFO in the same area.  This is what happen to me.  I was driving home over Cornilius Pass in Portland heading to my home in Scappoose, Or.  I had been over at my parents home in Portland.  As I neared Cornilius Pass just before a corner I saw 4 large lights in each corner of this object with a blinking red light in the middle, hanging above the Pine trees.  There was no noice even though I was with in 150 feet of it.  The lights were very bright yet my car was not lit up by the lights.  I would say that the lights were at least 30 feet from light to light.  My first thought was that something was going to crash on the other side of the trees.  As I got closer and went around the corner in the road to the other side of the trees, I looked to see if something had crashed.  I didn't see anything at all.  I suddenly got a feeling of dread.  I knew I had seen something I couldn't explain.  I continued down the road through Cornilius Pass Road.  Which is dark and not too many house are there, I kept looking through the trees to see if I could see it again.  I wanted to stop on the road and look better but I was by myself and the road has no shoulders or driveways to pull into.  About 1 1/2 miles from where I first saw the lights I saw through the trees a V shaped row of lights now hovering above the hill on the other side of where I was driving. I would say there was about three to four lights on each side of the V with one light in the front middle.  There was also a spot light coming down from either the front of the V or just behind the V.  It was spot lighting the ground below.  After seeing that I hit the peddle to the car and got out of there.  It was probably a year ago that I mentioned it to! a friend of my daughters what I saw.  She told me that she has seen a dish shaped UFO following her on the same road.  This has happen to her twice.  I am sorry but I could not tell its shape because the lights were so bright but I can tell you it was big.

In the rear of the formation (way back) was the flashing red side lights of the helicopter, 2 lights on either side.The southern most lit craft passed approx 100-200 ft above the hill top to my south and I observed that the lit portion was only in the front of the craft.There appeared to be some type of tail or upward wing extension in the rear as I was observing it in an almost parallel view. It appeared tear drop in shape, moving at a high rate of speed,and moving as if it was skimming across the surface of water (a jerking kind of forward movement).The center craft had the same kind of motion and appearance but the real observation I had was the northern most craft that kept coming directly towards me. The front of the craft with the glowing light was approximately 100 ft up and I could see that the light area was quite wide, at least 10ft across in the front. I could see the lit  portion as it passed directly over me, the dark metallic shape as it blocked all the stars above,the passage of the craft over the roof of my house.No noise,40ft across,no wind,turbulence,nothing.The helicopter pursued that one but it could never catch up.All three shot up to the western sky across the Casinos along the river, the northern one being chased by the helicopter  which was way in the rear. I observed that I could see the lit area in the front of the crafts as they were going away from me and up which means that the lit portion is on the top, sides and bottom. They are not spotlights as they do not project any beam but seem to glow quite brightly instead.All 3 craft plus the helicopter passed almost directly over the Bullhead City International Airport probably 500 ft high. No mention of any flyovers was ever made in the local papers the next day. I wonder if any Radar reports by the Airport were ever made and of course no military reports were ever released to the media.In short,nothing ever happened and for 2min of my life, I was privileged to see something the likes of which I will probably never see again. Maybe the craft that passed over my rooftop saw that I was a fellow star traveler of sorts (25 years of astronomy) and granted me the honor of just a peek.I was never in fear of the crafts but I do fear my government which is why it has taken so long to report this event. I wish that they would give us the benefit of the doubt and let the people decide how to handle the truth.We die in wars,pay taxes ,support politicians,serve in the armed forces, and raise families to name just a few decisions that we people make,daily.

I must reiterate that it seemed very distant and at first glance appeared to be a planet shining very brightly. It stayed in the same place for the next five minutes as we continued north on college Rd. We decided to stop and observe the object because of the luminosity it possessed. A radar tower blinked red directly below the object, only the tower was closer to where we were parked and the object was at a very high altitude and many miles away. I mention the tower because i was able to notice that the bright object was slowing moving to the west to the left of the tower, my friend and I could see the object no longer was inline with the top of the tower. We watched for the next hour noticing faint variation in light and brightness as well as slow movement. After another hour the light got faint as if it were moving away from out spot, it got brighter for a short time moved about erratically then begin to get smaller and smaller until it faded altogether. The following half hour my friend and I observed two more occurences of the light appearing very dimly a good ways above the surrounding hills then disappearing from sight. I was completely blown away by this because the light emitted a glow that looked more akin to a flash light shined through a fancy diamond, rather then the light a star produces. I was also in aww at the fact that it stayed relatively in the same place for a number of hours then began to move and eventually got smaller and smaller until it faded completely.

I was a night security officer at a plant in South Phoenix. From approximately 20:25 to 20:40 on 9-13-04 myself and one other guard witnessed four amber colored lights fading in and out in perfectly straight lines appearing one after the other. One light would fade in then the next would fade in next to it. Then the next would appear until there were four in a row; then the first would fade out and reappear in line on the other side of the others to continue the line eventually all fading out in order of appearance. First they lined up parallel with the ground and next in a 45 degree angle from the ground aligning upwards. They were completely stationary while lit. They did not appear in exactly the same place each time although in the same relative vicinity. They were below the top of South Mountain but above the ground. I checked out that area a few days later and could find nothing but a residential area and what appears to be an unmarked city water reservoir. I could find nothing that would emit these types of lights. I could not find any roads on that end of the mountain (northside on west end). My conclusion was that these lights would have had to have been approximately 150-250 feet off the ground. Occasionally the lights would flash very bright. A few minutes later fighter jets were flying over and helicopters appeared searching the mountain. On my investigative journey there were three helicopters patroling the mountain with spotlights. This may or may not be related. I saw the same exact thing nine days later on 9-22-04 at the exact same time of day. The same guard was working. He said that earlier in the day (he works an earlier shift which overlapped with mine) he thought he saw something triangular in shape which was transparent and sort of blurry. I can not vouch for his day time report; I can only say that he told me about his day time sighting before we saw the evening lights on 9-22-04. This for me provided some validation. All sightings were witnessed below the mountain top almost due South of the I-17 freeway bend (turns from North/South to East/West). I approximate that the lights would have been above Elliot Road and 27th Avenue roughly.

At around 10:30 PM EST, a very large triangular shaped object began to move very slowly above us, we estimate around 10,000 feet, but it was hard to tell, due to it's size and there was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. The object traveled over Moosehead Lake and as it shrunk from view just across the lake, it began to climb straight up, then it began to reverse direction in an arc like motion and head back in the opposite direction across the lake. There were 3 very large, glowing gold lights on the object that were stationary and no other lights or blinking lights were noticed. The object disappeared out of viewing range once it crossed the lake. This was the most unusual and large flying object any of us had ever witnessed.

On Thursday, Jan. 29, 2004, my wife and I were returning home to Howell, NJ after having dinner at a T.G.I. Friday's restaurant in Freehold, NJ.  The restaurant is located on Route 9 South, just north of the Howell border and slightly south of Route 33.  I keep a journal where I noted having arrived home around 10 PM, and kept a receipt from the restaurant that shows the time we paid as 9:41 PM.  It is about a 15-20 minute ride home from that location, so the time this occurred is extremely accurate - between 9:45 and 9:50 PM.  As we left the restaurant and proceeded southbound on Rt. 9, we noticed very strong headlights, very low in the sky and to the south of us, that appeared to be coming directly at us.  They were no more than 10 or 20 degrees above the horizon, and appeared to be slightly to the right (or to the west) of Rt. 9.  The lights were very bright, and we were at first concerned that a commercial airliner or two was heading right at us, because the height and angle of the lights suggested it.  As they got closer to us, we began to think they were from two or more helicopters.  Over a period of about 3 minutes or so, the lights continued to approach directly toward us as we crossed over into Howell.  We were no more than about a mile or so into Howell, and sitting at a red traffic light with dozens of vehicles around us on both sides of the highway when the craft crossed directly above us.  They (or it) was probably 300-400 feet or so above us, and about the size of a large helicopter (troop transport size, I would guess).  All the other cars around us could see what was happening, and many opened their windows as we did to listen, or stick their heads out and get a better look.  My wife and I were stunned, since they (or it) was completely silent, and there was no downdraft or other phenomenon to suggest wings, rotors, or propellor/jet propulsion systems of any kind.  The forward speed seemed to be something you would expect from a slower moving helicopter (30-40 MPH?), and just as they got over us they turned 90 degrees (but not sharply, more like a drift) and headed to our west (paralleling Rt. 33, but a mile or two south of it).  I don't know why, but I am hazy on what kind of shape it was, or if in fact it was one or two separate vehicles.  Part of that is the passage of time, and for some reason I didn't really note it in my journal, but it was also difficult for me since I was behind the wheel on a major highway and the lights being thrown off by this ""thing"" was blinding.  My wife only remembers this entire incident with the same level of detail as me.  I know the exact date when this happened because of having read an article yesterday on MSNBC.com which discussed how sightings of 'flying black triangles' are on the rise, and that they often appear over urban centers or major highways and make no effort to disguise themselves.  When I recalled what we saw, I put in some search terms on Google (something like ""UFO Howell Freehold New Jersey""), and was brought to the NUFORC.org site.  When I scrolled down looking for reference to what I had seen, there was an entry describing the exact same thing at the exact same time from someone who was slightly further north of us.  The description of everything matched exactly, including the flight path taken by the object(s).  It was a perfectly clear, cold night as described by that writer.  When I looked back in my journal to that date, there it was!  I also ran a search of the archives for the Asbury Park Press, which is the major daily newspaper in the area, and the one and only paper that would probably have reported it if anyone contacted them.  Nothing came up in that search.  I am astounded that literally hundreds of people were out that night and saw all of this from a major highway, and it was not widely reported that I know of.  The reason I don't remember every detail, or didn't freak out about it was that we are used to air traffic over our house all the time from the many military bases in the area, and we just assumed we were seeing something that was out for a test flight and wasn't really supposed to be seen so up-close by the general public.  I have an engineering background and work for the State, so I could appreciate that what I was seeing was some new technology I had never seen before, but automatically assumed it was military in nature.  It never occurred to me that so many other similar incidents had been reported by so many other people, including law enforcement types, etc.  Either I saw something otherwordly (which never really crossed my mind that night), or had seen evidence of some military technology which was far-beyond anything I had heard of before.  What doesn't make sense at all, is that the 'pilots' seemed to be doing everything in their power to be noticed rather than remain covert in any way.  I would love to talk to other drivers who saw this that night, and find out what their impressions were, or what else they might have seen in terms of origin or destination.  Someone else also reported it in Pennsauken, New Jersey about 20 minutes earlier and that is about 40 miles to the southwest, so it must have been moving pretty quickly if it was the same vehicle(s) that night.  I feel privileged to have witnessed this event, and wish I could find out more about it!",2004-09-29T00:00:00,,

We had left the local coliseum and were heading home around 9PM. We were headed east on a road that runs behind a cemetery and is only a half mile or so from our home. I happened to look south out over the trees and see this huge triangle moving just above the treetops. It was 100' in length, black, four light (three white ones on each of the corners and a blue colored one in the center), and it moved slowly and silently. We came to a complete stop to watch it. It was odd because the next thing we realized it was moving away from us in a SW direction. In the short distance to our home we never discussed it. And when we got inside our house it was around 11 PM or so. I seriously doubt it took two hours to drive a half mile.  The reason I tell this is because over the years we've seen the object(s) more than once. Sometimes it hovers and at other times it will disappear in, what seems like, a blink of an eye. Not too long after the above incident my mother and sister were coming home from Wal-Mart and saw it again. They said they only saw it for about five seconds but as soon as my sister saw it her mouth broke out in small blisters almost like ulcers. Like I said, we've seen it many times over the years, plus other kinds of UFO's, but the last time we saw it was around the beginning of this summer, about the middle of June. This time it was my sister and me, I was driving, coming home from a friend's house, probably around 8 or 9 PM, and there was one over the cemetery again. This time we decided to follow it. As we neared the cemetery, heading east, the object started to move off at a high rate of speed, to the NE. I turned down another street heading N, which has a school, I stopped in the middle of the road because we could see that there were two other objects, like the triangle, forming a larger triangle. I started to go forward again and this time all three disappeared in maybe two seconds.  As I stated, we've seen many kinds of UFO's. The triangle, sphere's, cigar-shapped ones, lights that just hovered, and so on. We've also become accustomed to having bruises we can't explain,my sister's mysterious ulcers, blood on our bed sheets and pillow cases, and blood on our clothes. I also know that one night I had a very vivid dream about being in the middle of some woods and seeing a UFO above me and when I woke up there were dead leaves in my bed that weren't there the night before.

Both were shaped like triangles. The lead craft had two outboard white strobing lights and a light on the front. It also had what looked like fluffy whit lights inboard of the strobes. These were definitely not FAA regulation navigation beacons. The second craft had the triangular shape following below the first and to the rear of the first craft.

There were also about five or six others hovering around the top one but they weren't all that bright. The top one slowly lowered itself to the bottom one and when it touched it, it got brighter. The top one rose back up to its original spot and the bottom one was gone. Almost like they combined. After the brightest one was in place the other little ones all moved in to combine with the brightest one and it got even brighter.

The sighting took place at roughly 11:45 PM on Friday October 29 near the junction of 730 and what is locally known as Bobos crossing (I believe its county road 4668).  We had set up camp at a bend in the river maybe ¼ mile from the highway.  It had rained earlier that day and there were still a few clouds hanging around but you could clearly see stars. There were three of us there that night sitting around the campfire and there wasn’t any alcohol involved. Probably an hour before the incident took place we were all witness to a low flying helicopter with a spotlight surveying the area. That was not uncommon, a few years back there was a prison escape in the area and the convicts were on the run in our area so they were searching like this before as well. Of course we were not without firearms so we kind of got a little excited and readied ourselves. After about forty five minutes things kind of died down and we went back to the usual campfire conversation.  Ten or so minutes later a rumbling noise could be heard in the distance, well more appropriately described as that of a diesel in the distance (which would be fitting since we were near the highway). We no longer heard the rumbling sound but we did begin to hear a humming noise in the opposite direction. We started to look around because in that direction there was nothing but trees and open space for a good ¾ of a mile. You could make out the moon reflecting off a metallic object in the sky just above the tree line. Natural reaction was to grab the guns but as we did it was starting to move towards out position. As we sit gazing into the night sky the object positioned itself above our camp site maybe 100ft up and it paused for a brief moment and then proceeded to change directions and headed off towards the south at an alarmingly slow pace. The rest of the night we were all on high alert, sleeping would almost seem nearly impossible.  I was first to wake in the morning and it was a trying experience to say the least. Well, we decided it would be best if we packed our things and headed home. As we were driving towards the gate that would open the way to the road we noticed another helicopter flying over. I’m not real educated on military aircrafts but from what I’ve looked at online it appeared to be a CH-47 Chinook. I do see a lot of these in my area though; I believe there is a place where they do training and whatnot with them near Newark. I am a bit skeptical about our sighting, being that there are a few air fields in the area plus were a hop skip and jump away from Carswell Air Force Base (or whatever it is called now).

The 911 dispatch center called the National Weather Service to check if they had anything on radar in that vicinity, and they confirmed that they had unexplained ""blips"" on radar between 5,000 and 12,000 feet moving southwest near the Lake Michigan shoreline towards Chicago.   The radar showed the ""blips"" intercepting and moving apart into multiple returns on the screen, and of a size on the screen larger than that of normal aircraft.

In fact, Robert Gribble, founder and director of the National UFO Reporting Center at the time of the incident, was instrumental in the capture of the radar data of the objects over Lake Michigan.  He called the National Weather Service, and recommended that they use their radar in order to detect the objects, which was successful.  It was  NWS radar operator who spoke with a Michigan Highway Patrolman, and both of them were looking at the objects, the patrolman visually, and the operator using radar.  Interestingly, there was a dramatic sighting of a presumed UFO over the University District of Seattle on the night of the event over Lake Michigan.

I am a military retiree. I Top Secret (Cosmic) and Nuclear (PRP) clearances when I was on active duty. I also had a two week interlude in Spain that occured when I was stationed in Rota, Cadiz, Spain that I will report when I am contacted and interviewed.  This experience I believe has led to the multitude of books that have emerged since 1975 because when I asked people not to report what I had seen, it appears that all of these individuals decided to go out and write their own books. The incident that I want to report was witnessed by Momi Leilani (fictious name) and I.  The object that Momi and I observed looked very similar to a U.S. USN aircraft carrier in color, and appearance, except about 10 times larger.  And this craft was clearly hovering above the horizon and was about 1/4 mile from me in distance.  I could see the sheets of metal squares that were welded and riveted to the hull of the spaceship.  I could clearly see the rivets that appeared to be about 10 inches in diameter.   The spaceship appeared almost instantaneaously and without any sound. It was airborne and about 10 degrees above the horizon.  Momi and I were seated on a picnic table about 50 feet from the beach. We were seated facing the beach.  I could see a rectangular port that was approximately 40 feet wide and 20 feet high taking into account the stature of the onboard Humans that I saw.  I could clearly see human people comprising of adults and children standing and observing us.  As soon as they realized that I could see them the spacecraft dissapeared ala Star Trek warp speed departure.  All we saw was the ship elongate and disapear towards Honolulu.  Again no sound and no wind movement.   The next day, when I went to work in Honolulu, the Radio Talk Show Personality by the Name of Larry Price reported that he had also observed the Space Craft and asked over the air live if anyone had witnessed the spacecraft to contact him at the radio station.  I did not call in because I was still not accepting what I had observed.  I tried to rationalize what I had seen and at first believed that maybe the U.S. must surely have some sort of super Top Secret space craft that I was not aware of, but later I could not rationalize why the people onboard appeared to be alarmed when they realized that I could see them.  This is when I had to accept that this spacecraft was not a U.S. aircraft.   This craft could easliy transport about 100,000 personnel.  The immediate impression in my mind was that the people new me and were observing us to see how we were doing.  Or could it be that they were just taking a sightseeing tour of the Hawaiian Islands?   When I was in the Navy I used to have to take polygraphs examinations in order to maintain my security clearances.  I used to have to take polygraphs from the various agencies.  There were circumstances when during the course of about 3 months I took polygraphs from the DIA, FBI, NIS, etc and ultimately interviewed by the CIA.  The polygraphs were always mainly having to do with National Security concerns.  It always alarmed me to have to take so many polygraphs, because it appeared like the intelligence agencies did not contact each other to confirm that I had already taken my required polygraph examinations.  It was like the agencies did not trust the results of the other agencies.",2004-04-27T00:00:00,,

I am not sure of the exact year or date of this event.  I just know that it was late summer and the year was either 1995 or 1996.  I was looking for a place to kick it with this girl I was seeing at the time.  So we pulled up to a poplular spot to hang out on the ocean near captains cove.   The moon was about full and there was an object in the sky that was orangey yellow.  It was on the other side of the sky.  It was a perfect circle.   Larger than the moon.   We watched it for about a half hour.  Every minute it would get smaller and smaller.  It maintained a perfect cirlce shape.  And finally it got to the size of a star and then dissapeared.   This object didn't move.  It just simpley shrunk into nothing.  It was so big that I cannot believe that anyone did not see it.,2004-04-27T00:00:00,41.19200961038961,-73.20145714285715

Bright red fireball in the sky.  Seen two seperate occasions.

Seen two seperate occasions.  Resembled a flare. In April of 1995, I was in my house typing when I noticed a bright red fireball in the sky slowly heading north above the tree line above Hicks Rd.  My vantage point was from the east side of Hicks in my neighborhood, Reseda.  I initially thought it was a flare or a firework but I dismissed that notion quickly due to the fact that from my point of view, it was about the size of a marble and it was traveling in a straight horizontal line.  Although it looked exactly like a flare, the middle of the object clearly had a large amount of mass, which looked to be slightly ovular.  There was no discernable texture on the object, just bright red light.  After about eight seconds it disappeared behind the trees.  Later that year in October, I saw the object again traveling roughly the same speed at an altitude of about 200 ft.  It was heading west over Reseda.  This time I was outside on my friend's driveway waiting for my buddy to come out of the house and I got a good fifteen-second glimpse of it.  For a while, I believed it may have been ball lightning, but based on the altitude of the object and the size from my view it should have been about the size of a car or a truck, traveling at about 40 MPH.  Both times, the object appeared to be slowly hovering in a direct horizontal trajectory.  The object never appeared to be flaming nor did it leave a trail.  The object made no sound.  Incidentally, I have no witnesses to back me up on either of the accounts.  Though I can back it up with maps, drawings and similar pictures.  I've experienced some weird things in my life, but this is probably the weirdest so far.  I do apologize for the long and detailed explanation of this incident, but I'm hoping someone else may have seen the same thing as I. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a warm Labor Day, I was working as a part time security shift at the Roadway Trucking station. It was my second year working there. On the second year I gradually developed the urge to start looking up into the sky. On that day I was speaking to a friend from a private business just down the hill, who walked his dog four times a day past the compound. We were discussing the possibility of UFOs and aliens, as we often did. At a point I complained to him something to the effect, ""I've been watching the sky around here for a long time. I know other people have seen UFOs. How come I never seen any?"" Before long my friend and his Dog returned to their place down the hill. Approximately 45 minutes later, at twilight, I was listening to a program on my small radio and walking across the property from west toward the one building on the compound to the east. To my left, high in the sky; higher than most of the local aircraft flew in the area, and travelling a bit faster, was a lighted object traveling from north to south. I then said to myself, ""What's this?"" As I watched, the object began flying in an up and down pattern once, and then again, and possibly a third time but I can't be sure. But certainly at least two times. I never seen aircraft fly in this manner and I knew that no conventional craft could do that. The object traveled along after the unusual aerial display and then suddenly blinked out.It didn't burn out like meteors and shooting stars, but blinked out, and I've witnessed enought meteors to know the difference. The sky was clear and light enough where I would be able to locate it in the event it had turned in another direction, but I could not find it. It was just gone. No acceleration, just gone, as if it had gone into another dimension, if you can imagine that. At that point I began to realize that I had just witnessed my first and so far, only UFO. And it showed up within 45 minutes after complaining out loud that I have never seen one. It was as though someone heard m! y complaint and decided to show themselves to me. My friend and his dog returned shortly after dark and I told him that I indeed had seen a UFO. My friend started to explain the UFO away but then started offering an explanation on how we on Earth began with the wheel and the aliens began with ""flight"" as if he knew all about something. The next day I was working in Chula Vista making a patrol around a large motel and spotted a black car parked in the rear of the building with its windows so dark I could hardly see inside. The vehicle was not on the motel guest list. I won't go into detail the remainder of that incident.  But I'll end this by saying that my report is the honest to God truth exactly as I have told it. I swear on a stack of Bibles. I don't know what the object was or its origins but I never seen anything like it prior nor after it. I am retired military and observed many times aircraft in the sky, but again, nothing that came close to the lighted object and its impossible aerial performance.

I was driving from one housing area to another on midnights in an isolated area. I saw a light headed straight for the ground at a high rate of speed. Even though it was moving too fast and was far away I believed it was a helicopter or plane crashing. I was at an aviation base and had recently had a helicopter go down. I came to a stop in the middle of the road hoping it wasn't going to be a crash. The object did a 90 turn and shot back out and disappeared in a matter of seconds. Upon reflection later I realized the speed had been too fast for a crashing plane or helicopter. The sharpness of the turn and speed is what really confused me. I can not say for sure what this was. I was at an aviation base and was familiar with many type of aircraft but this not anything I had seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked of to the left because I thought I saw a deer by the median. I began to slow down when I caught a glimpse of an object going behind the tree lines. I told my wife to put the video camera on nightshot and record the object.We had been to savannah the year before and saw alot of military aircraft. I thought this was one of them so I wanted to get it on camera. It looked like it was preparing to land from what I could tell. I noticed a clearing of the tree tops just ahead in it's path. When the craft got to the clearing, I realized this was no military craft. I was triangular in shape, black, very smooth texture,very areo dynamic. It's lights were not flashing as an airplane's landing lights would. I knew this thing wasn't a plane, it wasn't a steath bomber, I have seen those before.I rolled down the window and slowed down to see If I could hear the engine. I work at a major airport and I have heard many different engines. I heard nothing. Not a sound. We had a fully charged battery when we began our trip and there is pretty much nothing on the way there for us to record. I know we didn't waste the battery before this and my wife told me she got the object on camera.As soon as the craft dropped behind the tree line my wife told me the battery was going dead.When we got to our hotel room, I charged the camera. When I went to watch the event on tape, I couldn't find It anywhere on the tape. It went from just before I told my wife to put the camera on nightshot to well after the inncident,close to our exit.

Three lights in a horizontal row. Main light in center and to outer lights just slightly smaller. At first I thought it was a plane. We were sitting on the back patio of my friends house when I looked into the sky (have to go back to his house to figure out North, South, East, or West) and I saw these 3 lights. Like I said, at first I thought it was a plane. But as I watched I saw no blinking lights, and it apeared to be still. There was a, what I would expect to see in the movies, a radient blur of energy surrouning the objects. Don't know that it was energy, just light blur. I did not say anything to the other two guys who were talking for about 5 minutes when I was sure that it was not moving. I asked them what they thought it was. Of course they said a plane at first but I told them it was not moving. Then they said maybe it is coming at us so it is hard to determine if it is moving or not. I said I don't think so because at this point I had already been watching it for about 7 minutes. In that time, I saw at lease 3 planes fly within the same perimeter. It would surprise me to find out if i was the only sighting of this that night. I continued to watch for the next hour. I would go inside and about every 1.5 - 2 minutes I would go back and check. It never moved or changed position. I used an opening in some trees in the backyard as reference. Hard to say how far away they were but to guess I would say 5 miles. Finally after about an hour of watching this I returned to look and it was gone. I could not see it anywhere in the sky. Keep in mind my view was limited to a space in the backyard, however if these lights were just stars, I had enough of a view to be able to see them change position for a good few hours. Then my friend emailed me the mexican piolet sighting that happend in March I beleive. and the group of 3 lights is exactly what I saw, although there was only one group that I saw.",2004-06-04T00:00:00,,

The object was easily visible from near perfect sky.  Thinking that the object was perhaps a cargo plane, I banked to the left lane and immediately ask my passenger if there was any air traffic in the vicinity other than the object. The reply was negative. As I completed the lane change, the unknown object suddenly appeared at my 1 o'clock position (no more than a mile away) to change shape. And it was definitely not a cargo plane. The upper section, not concealed by any cloud, was gray, and on the lower section there appeared to be one or two reflective bright silver panels. The object was approximately 13 to 15 meters in diameter. Suddenly it accelerated and vanished from what I believe was a slow moving position. We gave chase but the object was gone.

The pictures where taken approximately three to five seconds apart. I am a non believer myself and I really want to find out what this is that we have unknowingly photographed. I don’t think that it is a digital malfunction of my camera because I have taken very good care of it and I have taken more the 1500 pictures with this camera. The object appears to be white or off white in color, on a standard 8’10’ print out it is one inch wide as well as long. It seems to glow; it is globular in shape and has a darker maybe a shadow ring around the outer part of the outside of the circle shape. It stands out in all four pictures. We live on a big farm and we own dogs and ever since that night they bark relentlessly at times during the night. I don’t know if it is returning and I don’t want to know what it wants I just want to know that what ever is in these pictures are not here to harm us. For the most part you may not believe me but I was the one who brought the camera in and placed them into the folder and I did not leave this computer for anything.

The lake was called Hay Lake.  Near Whitney ON(South Algonquin District)  We had arrived there that night.  Around 10 - 11pm, we had decided to go out to the lake side to start a fire and stare at the stars.  We never lite the fire.  The sky was crystal clear.  We could see all stars. The hill sides across the water were definitely easy to see reflecting off a moonlite lake.  We walked down to the water line from our cottage around 9:30- 10-ish.  When we had both noticed that a red-ish and oval shape was hovering object above the land across the lake and near what appeared to be ""Lower Hay Lake"".  This thing moved in a weird way from right to left and up and down.  Best description agreed by us both.......... - Oval-ish and round looking. - It's body seemed to be glowing different colors from red to orange and yellow in a pretty smooth but fast (changing) pattern. - Separate from the body’s changing colors, was a noticable light that seemed to be shining below and moving around like a search light looking towards the ground and land around it.  ((name deleted)) described it as flickering a white light. - Movements were odd.  Mostly in one place but hovering in a way that no man made craft could ever do. -  It was the largest thing in the sky other than the moon.  Like a dime and the moon was a Silver Dollar.  This thing did its dance in the sky for what seemed to be 15 - 20 mins.  We (((name deleted)) and I) debated over what ""it"" could have possibly been.  In reality over 5 solid min's guaranteed, and I am now here reporting this in hopes that someone else might have seen something there that night aswell.  I will never forget it.  I am stumped and at a lose to explain it.  Listen, I am a Software Executive and my wife is a Pilates Instructor.  We are not crazy, nor are we big sci-fi movie buffs.  We honestly saw something that spooked us enough, to not want a fire put on.  Our logic was that since its completely secluded up at the cottage lake, if we could see this thing clear as day, than it could easily see us if we had we put a fire on, no problem.  So hell no to the fire.",2004-10-27T00:00:00,,

As I looked out my window I saw in the distance a very intense almost neon blue light flashing against the sky.  Each time the light flashed everything electrical stopped.  By my approximation the light appeared to be coming from the Perry Ohio Nuclear Power Plant (approx. 25 miles away).   The light ""flashed"" just like lightning except it looked like it was orginating from the gound and reflecting up against the clouds.  The last flash was the most intense lighting up the whole horizon and included red and orange as well as blue light and what appeared to be a fireball.  After that no more lights and no more power disturbances. Apperently others saw the light and reported it on the radio next morning WTAM 1100.  I thought it would be good to report the power interruptions as well.

I was otherwise pre-occupied and didn't really sit down and talk with her about it until last night.  She told me she was driving to the gym that day. It was late afternoon, perfectly clear sky and plenty of daylight. She was moving slowly in traffic when she caught something out of the corner of her eye. She looked up and saw what she believed was either a large private jet or a small commercial jet. The unusual thing is that, flying about two plane lengths ahead of the aircraft, she clearly saw what appeared to be a small silver ball. The plane and the object flew along a straight flight path. Judging from my daughter's descriptions, it appeared both were at around 10000 feet, flying perhaps a couple hundred miles an hour. Nothing erratic, just a smooth trajectory across the sky.  She had them in clear view for less than a minute. However, during that time she saw the sun glinting off both the jet and the object. They maintained their relative distance from each other but my daughter was convinced that these were two discrete objects and not connected to one another in any way. Again, judging from a drawing she made, I estimate the object was no more than 10 feet in diameter.  My daughter is a pretty level-headed young woman.  She said this was like nothing she had ever seen before.  I am reporting this because the sighting took place in a heavily populated area and I would think there might be other independent witnesses.

I live in South London, England, and was greatly surprised to read the account of a sighting on July 29th, in Chelsea, just up the road from MY stamping-ground, Brixton.My experience occurred the following night.The whole weekend of July 30th had been very hot, and the Saturday night was no exception. Taking advantage of this, my wife and I decided to take a late evening stroll. This would have taken place between, I guess, 10.30 - 11.30pm - although,unfortunately,I wasn't wearing a watch at the time. We left the house in Brixton, and finished up in a small park nearby on the Brixton/Stockwell border. Lying on the grass, looking up at the stars, my wife, ((name deleted)) started asking the names of some of the things we were looking at. Many years ago, I had a fleeting interest in Astronomy, and enough of this remains to be able to identify things like the Pole Star, and a few of the planets, so I gamely dived in, doing my best.  I had made a couple of convincing astronomical stabs, when I noticed what I took to be a flight of birds, very high above us. They were obviously white, because they were reflecting the lights of the city, magnified by the pollution of the last few hot days. I wondered aloud  what sort of bird could fly so high at night, and what it would use for navigation.  As we continued watching, the 'blobs' suddenly resolved into three tiny objects (I could have fitted all of them on my thumbnail) like big triangles with a smaller tail behind. They flew in a diamond formation for a few seconds, and then one of them broke ranks and moved to a position diagonally opposite the other two. This movement was really extraordinary; I have never seen any aircraft perform it. The object moved across the sky extremely quickly, and in an absolutely straight line, as if being pulled on a wire. A moment later, the other two UFOs joined the first, and flew on for another few seconds, followed by two pairs of wildly curious eyes on the ground.  As we looked, the three objects then flew straight into each other to form a ball, then split apart again, flying off in different directions. Finally a third one streaked straight up, away from the other two, in a crazy 'stunt-flying' manoeuvre, flipping and twisting, as if showing off to the others. We lost the first two UFOs at this point, and after its aerobatic performance, the third object seemed to slide off into some low cloud or mist, and we lost that one too. The whole experience lasted no more than thirty to thirty five seconds.  I am forty-two years old and work as a videotape editor, my wife is a forty-year-old TV production manager, we are both extremely qualified professionals in an industry that positively encourages cynicism and suspicion. We are not given to flights of fancy, and certainly did not wish for a close encounter of the first kind on a late-night walk round Brixton.However, we are utterly unable to explain what we DID see. It certainly wasn't no weather balloon, tho'!  As an afterthought, I must mention one last thing, if only as a foil to the unidentified aircraft' enthusiasts among us. Thirty seconds after this extraordinary display, a REAL plane went by, and I thought it lumbered across the sky like an airborne steam-train after the extraordinary aerial ballet we had just witnessed. I noticed that even though the plane was flying comparatively low, there was no reflection from the streetlights whatsoever. Judging by the size of my UFOs, they were tens of thousands feet higher than that plane, yet they were lit with an orange light that I misinterpreted as streetlight - this can only mean that they had their OWN light source, i.e. they were glowing. How many glowing planes have YOU ever seen?",2004-09-29T00:00:00,,

The sky was clear and visiblilty was excellent from south Minneapolis. The object reflected sunlight and was not luminous.

However, when I was looking straight up, a movememnt in the peripheral feild of vision in my right eye made me look towards the western sky, at a degree of 60 from the western horizon. The sky was cloudy due to a cyclone in the Arabian sea. But, luckily, a small linear break in the clouds allowed me to see a V-SHAPED/Boomerang shaped UFO which was visible in that hour only because of the lights , circular, atleast 6 of them under its structure.  It was moving from west to east. Speed was about that which normal airliners take over cities. It made NO NOISE AT ALL. Inspite of that flying at cloud level (clouds during cyclones are somewhat low in altitude) , there was no engine noise/ no noise due to aerodynamic disturbance. Its size, I estimate it to be bigger than a boeing747.  Shape, and illustration of the UFO , I am submitting a jpg file by email to this site.   And I am almost sure that the UFO which I saw was not a secret military aircraft. Reasons: 1) the Noiseless flight. If it were to be using a jet engine, even if the engine was hidden inside the airframe, it would have emitted some sound, flying at that low altitude. 2) The big light emitting circles under it. Why would a 'stealth aircraft' have such lights underneath it? the meaning of stealth itself if challenged if a stealth aircraft travels over a highly populated city like Bangalore, that too at low altitude, that too with light emitting circles under it.  Desciption of myself : 21 year old medical student. Astronomy enthusiast and stargazer since 10years. And extremely interested in any kinds of flying machines , visit my room and find posters of all kinds of warplanes. (thats why I can easily concude that the UFO I saw was not a normal one built on existing earthly technology. Why would the USA be spending billions on the F-22 if it would have owned the UFO I saw, which was so noiseless and RADAR invisible. Moreover,  newspaper reports of unidentified RADAR signatures in the Air traffic control was NOT reported, that means the the UFO was: 1)Invisible to RADAR 2) Noiseless  Note, I on another site on the net, have come to know of a similar sighting of a similar type of UFO in Jaipur, Rajasthan , India, at october 2004. (note that I live in Bangalore, Karnataka, India)  (Note: the weird noiseless flight, and the prescence of rather big circular yellowish light emitting things underneath. . makes me almost sure that the UFO I saw was similar to the one in phoenix Arizona in 1996/97 , later when I searched on google for pictures of UFOs on the internet, if I could find someone who had in the past photographed the kind of UFO I had seen, I was surprised that the photos of Phoenix, AZ were somewhat similar to the one I had seen.)",2004-12-03T00:00:00,,

I am a high school graduate(1976) and one of my favorite classes in high school was Astro-science. My high school had a planetarium built into it and it was always an interesting experience to look forward to everyday. I had an interest in space and always watched televised NASA events. In december of 1995, I finally broke down and bought a 4.5 reflector telescope from a department store. I suddenly became an avid sky-watcher. I bought software to show me where the planets were and started a sketckbook to draw the planets as I was seeing them through my telescope at certain times. I would write the times and dates below the sketches. I was lucky enough to see comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp and a couple of lunar eclipses which I added to my sketchbook. I could point out Jupiter and Saturn and sometimes Mars with my naked eye as well as star clusters such as the Pleiades and nebulas like the one in Orion to friends and co-workers. As I became more aware of just how immense our universe is, my interest in U.F.O.s came to the forefront. I read many books of sightings and have amassed a library of video tapes and books on the phenomena. I was wishing to see one for myself. On Sept.13,1996 I got my chance. At that time in my life, I was delivering pizza for a living and my sighting happened while on a run. I added it to my sketchbook 2 days after I saw it. It is from these notes and my recollection that I now relay the information to you. It happened in the southern-most part of Austin near the intersection of Slaughter and Manchaca. I was driving east on Slaughter lane and crossed Manchaca road and made a right turn onto Bilbrook. Now facing south, I looked in the sky for Jupiter, but the sky just was not quite dark enough to see it yet. I made another quick right turn onto Slaughter Creek drive, a long dead-end road which is where the delivery was going to. Now I was facing west and I saw a bright headlight up in the air and not all that high. I assumed it was a Cessna airplane which I had seen flying in the area before as there is a farmer on Slaughter lane that has his own dirt airstrip and I had seen him flying many times. The light was coming toward me, flying east as I was headed west. As the space between us narrowed, I became aware that it was not the Cessna that I thought it was and I could not identify what kind of plane it was. It was then that I saw that it was a triangle. Curious, I pulled to the side of the road and looked up through my windshield at the thing. ""What is that?"" I said out loud. It was flying slowly and low. I could not take my eyes off it. ""How can that be flying?"" I said outloud again. With my car still running, I stepped out of my car and just watched this thing glide overhead. It was after sunset but the sky was not quite dark yet. I became aware that this was my U.F.O. I did not know what it was, how it could be flying,it was to me an unidentified flying object. It was a dark (possibly black) triangle, the trailing edge being a little shorter than the other two with the bright headlight being at the front point. There was a revolving red light on the bottom encased in a glass dome and I remember thinking of a fire engine light. There were two or three other smaller white lights on the bottom shining straight down but they were not that bright. It was heading to the east,parallel with Slaughter Ln. at about 45-50 m.p.h.and there was no noise coming from it that I could hear. It was approximatly 100 yds. to my south and approximatly 300 yds. up. As it flew past, and as I was now looking at the rear of it, I could see a pair of small stabilizer wings on the top of the rear section just like a F-117 Stealth Fighter has. I looked at my watch, and even though I did not make a note of the exact time, I now know it was very near 8:30 p.m. I stood there and watched it slowly glide away over the nearby roofs of a neighborhood until I could no longer see it. I got back in my car and made the delivery and contemplated what I had seen. I was familiar with most planes but I never heard of one that flied so slowly without sound. I thought it might be a Stealth Fighter because it was about the same size, but the shape was not right. An F-117 is triangular, but not a triangle. From my vantage point, it appeared to be a flat triangle gliding through the air. There were no navigation lights (red on the left, green on the right) although, I could not see the entire right side. I wanted to tell my friends when I got back to the store but I did not. I always thought if I ever saw a flying saucer, I would tell everyone that they are real. Now I understood why people hesitate or just keep it to themselves. I hope I have given you enough information to help out in some way. I never reported it and was kind of scared to tell anyone for a while. When I finally showed my sketch of the object and the notes I wrote to one of my friends, he kind of looked at me strange. I know he did not think I was lying, and it seems to me that he thinks I was mistaken about what I saw. But it was completly unknown to me. The only reason that I do not think it was ""alien"" , is because of the revolving red light on the bottom and the stabilizer wings on the rear. But still, I was pretty exited and I am glad that now I can tell you about it. Thank you.",2004-04-27T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

It was the end of the summer season and the island was mostly vacated.  A friend and I were walking on the beach in an eastward direction.  He spotted a light coming from the northwest over the Great South Bay.  It was a moonless night.  He kept and eye on it as we strolled along, his hobby was identifying airplanes by their landing lights or sound of an engine.  As the object got closer it was easier to see.  It was low and slowly coming in our direction. It looked flat at first then came closer still so that we could see slightly under it. From beneath it we noticed a blue flashing light striking the water.  It ticked when it flashed.  It was going about 5 miles per hour and as it got to shore, over the forested reserve between the Pines and Water Island the blue light stopped.  We couldn't hear an engine...nothing.  It was moving towards us and I panicked running up a small dune and dune fensing to one of the homes where I saw a man watching tv.  I looked down at Ken and he wasn't following or responding so I went back down and yelled to follow.  He grabbed my wrist and pushed me into the dune as the craft moved overhead.  We huddled together in shock...at least I was.  It had a 90 degree, cone-shaped nose, a swept back wing and deep body.  I estimate it was 400 ft wide by 200 deep (nose to tail).  At that time I lived in a a 20-story building on Sutton Place, in Manhattan, so I used that scale to quess the dimensions and hieght of it.  It was approx. 20 stories overhead.  The back end was arced slightly into the body.  It was dark grey or black.  The color was hard to see, however the shape is burned in my mind since the starry sky defined it so clearly.  It continued to move and when it got to the southern (beach) shore of Fire Island it stopped.  No sound, no engine noise, no vibrations, moving at 5 MPH... it just stopped in mid air over the beach.  By this time we could see the rear of it and Ken said, ""Look at the pattern of lights.""  There was a small red light in the middle rea! r and two white lights at eithther end.  They blinked red, red, rt. white, red, lft white then the white light moved across to the other white light across the rear.  Then we saw an amber light, like the ones on the helicopters that patrolled the east river sometimes.  I said, ""Thank God it must be the National Guard.""  It got closer, but we heard no sound.  It was a round, glowing, amber light, the color of a glowing flame.  It was about 12 in diameter, I think.  The nose of the ship was still pointing southwest.  Suddenly the amber light collapsed.  It disappeared.  Then the large craft, on it's axis, pivoted pointing its' nose due south.  It moved forward until it was over the ocean and the blue flashed started up agin.  We sat there watching it move towards the horizon flashing the blue light every 40 feet or so as if it was mapping or searching for something.  We walked back to our hosts house.  On the way I kept asking Ken what he had seen.  I wasn't sure if it had happened so I asked him if he had seen anything on the beach.  I was unhappy to hear that he had seen somthing.  I asked him to describe what he saw and to my dismay he did.  We went back to the house and told our friends. Of course, I was in shock and couldn't sleep that night.  I wanted to know what I'd seen.  Ken slept all right.  When he got up I asked him how he got any sleep at all and he said that he'd seen one before as a child on his parents woodlands in Ohio.  That wasn't what I wanted to hear.  At that time I was Chief Operations Office for a large furniture company in Manhattan.  My friend was studying to be a personal trainer.  I've always wanted to report the incident.  I've told some close friends about it. I spent the next three months reading UFO literature.  I needed to define what I'd seen.  My life chnaged.  NYC was no longer the center of the Universe.  Everything seem so insignificant.  Thank you, ever so much, for the opportunity to share my experience.",2004-04-27T00:00:00,,

The lights were diagonal flashing in a domino affect. The lights were a bright fire looking color like the color of a lighter flam. They danced in the sky in the same pattern for about a minute it. The length of the lights given the distance from the sky looked about 40 to 50 yards long. The lights disapeard with no fading or dimering just disapeared. Like I said the light show only lasted for 1 min. I don't know if the green triangular shape was the same thing we say from the east of us or if they were two different objects. The date should be right because I wrote it down the same day it happend.,2004-04-27T00:00:00,27.8134,-81.477

It's been quite a while since I've seen the object I'm going to describe so I'm foggy as to the exact date. I do remember the actual incident quite vividly, though, and will do my best to describe it. I was driving north on highway 315. As I approached the exit to get on Bethel Road, I noticed a dark object moving overhead heading south/south-west. It seemed to be ""gliding"" slowly overhead, quietly, quite aways away, yet close enough that I could estimate it as being maybe 3-4 car-lengths in size. In the dusk sky light available, it appeared to be dark (black or dark grey) in color. It was still very clear out so I'm positive it was a triangular craft of which I'd never seen before at that time. I must mention that I was driving a convertible car with the top off so I did in fact get a clear view of the object. There were many other cars on 315 and on Bethel Road at the time so I'd be surprised if no others saw it too. I only wish I'd had a camera with me then. At first, I thought it was some experimental craft being tested from the nearby OSU airport on West Case Road, which is located a few miles away from where I saw the craft. It wasn't until I started seeing similar triangular UFO sightings in books and on television that I realized the craft I saw wasn't some local aircraft project. The image of the craft that was photographed in the Belgium sighting was almost identical to the one I saw, the only difference being the one I saw didn't have lights shining underneath each corner, perhaps because the sky was fairly still light outside. Not until I came across this site did I feel there was a neutral way for me to report my sighting without being ridiculed. Please honor my privacy and don't release my name. Thank you.

Received: April 12, 2004  Hi Brian,  I've held there is a type of UFO that is a RPV-whether ours or theirs ,I know not. Back in 1997, my wife and I  were working out on our deck at our old place in Port Orford, Oregon. It was in July, and I can't find my old Diary to get an exact date but it was like the 12th or thereabouts.  I'd noticed a little twin turbo-prop with funny markrings: Parallel  red stripes on the wings. Also _I couldn't Identify the type!!_ it was a combination of Cessna/Beechcraft/ Piper Turboprops. (I've flown or been around -all- of the  common types.) Also, there was no discernible registration number I'd estimate the altitude to be no more than 2500 ft.agl. What was very curious, was the fact that it would fly over the coastline (ocean was 1/4 mile away and US 101 .  Now this little Twin Turboprop hung around for hours, it was at low altitude, hardly efficiently using fuel. It was at least 4 hours in the Air over Port Orford, flying back and forth over the area.  My wife looked up at the Little plane and said ""what's THAT?"" Here was a white ""football"" with a black stripe around the middle (about 2:00 pm)  and it was moving  north to south at about the same altitude as the Twin.  Abruptly the Twin turned and was gone over the Treeline south following the 'Football' the  Football appeared to be about 1/4 the size of the Twin. They  were quite close for a while about a wingspan (30-35 ft, ) apart. Then watching this ,high in the sky was a large cigar-shape heading west to east, no way to tell how high it was or how large. just well above this other show.I know it wasn't a large jet.-no wings or tail. my wife and I used our 8X50 binocs, on all of this, to no avial on detail just closer.

I am a Federal Police officer and I worked downtown in Washington, D.C. I decided to take off early that Friday night due to boredom when I arrived home at around 2115 hours.  All the lights were off in my house but my husband and eleven year old daughter were in the family room watching TV.  My husband (now ex-husband) went to take a shower while my daughter and I remained in the family room watching the TV. I decided to make hot chocolate for her and coffee for me in our kitchen which was dimly illuminated by the under range top light, when I heard my daughter tell me in a very startled voice, ""Mommy, come look at the lights!""  I told her to hold on a minute while I finished making our drinks, but her voice became even more desperate almost pleading with me to come look at the lights, and finally she started crying and almost in a state of panic, ""look at the lights!""  I thought she had turned the lights on in the family room because my kitchen lit up as if every light were on.  I turned around and couldn't believe my eyes when I realized how brightly lit our family room was.  It was a very warm October night, about 68 degrees outside, so we had a few of our windows open, including my sliding glass door in the kitchen which leads to the backyard where my dog Cleo was.  Cleo is a black lab, doberman, dalmation mix, who weighs about 95 lbs. I told her to wait inside while I went outside to see who or what was in my driveway.  As I walked outside, I noticed three circular lights at about tree level across the street at my neighbors house.  The tree was about 35 feet in height and the neighbors house was only about 20 feet high.  In relationship to my house and my driveway, the circular lights were approximately 75 feet from me and were intensely bright.  The circles of light were lined up horizontally and about 35 feet off of the ground.  The circle in the middle was large and appeared to be five feet or so wide, the smaller lights on each side appeared to be two to three feet wide and all three ligths were a combination of amber, cream and white.  A color that I have never seen before or since.  The lights gave off or emitted heat and there was a humming noise in the air.  When I walked out further to try and see what these lights were and where they were coming from, they moved quickly from horizontal to vertical, with the largest light still in the middle.  The larger light seemed to be gyrating or oscillating and the lights appeared to be moving closer to me in which the lights became even more intensely bright, almost blinding me and there was heat being emitted.  I didn't realize that my little girl had ran outside the door after me, so when I realized the lights were coming closer, and now I placed them at about 30 feet away from me the lights appeared to be like a ""beacon"" almost with a circular shape and almost to where you couldn't tell where one circle was from the other -- like they fused together.  I turned around and ran inside, not realizing my child was outside crying, I ran back out to get her and I got her inside when my dog and other neighborhood dogs started growling and howling and acting almost as if she were spooked or rabid, she busted through the screen door and began barking and snarling at the front door.  At that point I ran into the bathroom and pullled my husband from the shower with my hysterics about what my daughter and I were seeing outside.  By the time my husband got the soap out of his eyes and a towel on him, we ran out to the front yard where the object still was brightly illuminated in our driveway, when the lights separated into three discs and sped off at at a rate of speed that most conventional airplanes could do and at what appeared to be a 45 degree angle.  You could see a vapor trail of where they left because it was partly cloudy with the moon behind my house which is located in a southwesterly direction.  When the police arrived, some of my neighbors came out to ask me if I had seen or heard anything because their dogs were going nuts and my daughter and I explained what we had seen.  But my daughter saw it first so I have no idea of where they came from or how they descended to tree level.  I think the sheriff's deputy thought my child and I were crazy, but my ex-husband who really didn't get a good look at anything too much agreed that my child and I definitely saw something, particularly convincing was the fact that our dog busted through our screen door and didn't calm down until ten minutes after the lights disappeared.

And then the red circle disappeared and re-appeared on the opposite side, on the bottom of the window itself, and I thought to myself, ""something is moving from right to left and is probing this room from the outside.""

He stated that he and his ""date"" had witnessed an unusual event in 1949, but he had not reported the incident to anyone due to being temporarily AWOL from the Air Force in order to go on the outing. Witness stated that it was either the spring or fall of 1949 and he was in the U.S. Air Force, attending a military training school, and was overdue because of his date.  He and his friend were in MARION ALABAMA (Perry County, west central Alabama) near her farmhouse home.  The weather was nice and mild, and they were standing under a tree in the front yard.   She suddenly observed something in the sky behind him and pointed it out.  He looked and they both observed several ROUND, AERIAL, BLACK ORBS in the far distance.  They were in what he described as a diamond formation, appearing back-lit, seeming to make them black, and about the size of an ASPIRIN held at arms length.  He recalled there being FOUR ROUND OBJECTS/ORBS, perhaps 15 degrees above the horizon.  As they watched, said orbs DOVE DOWN toward the horizon and vanished.  Event duration was much less than a minute, perhaps just moments, and occurred at what he recalled was about 3:00-4:00PM. Witness DID NOT notice any unusual physiological or psychological effects, nor any influence on his watch or other devices. This witness is obviously intelligent, educated and well spoken, and seemed very forthright and serious during the telephone interview. His recounting of the event remained CONSISTENT as FOCUS was applied to several areas of his experience.

Efforts will be made to locate similar accounts in that general area and time frame.

We knew that was a story because it sure wasn't floating now even though there was a small breeze. What's more it was the size of a bus not a weather balloon.Close to 1pm the object slowly moved straight upwards a little and then a little more. There was no noise but I felt the energy of it. It then moved very rapidly straight up to I guess maybe 1000 meters,slowed and then shot off at great speed straight up into the blue sky where it disappeared from sight.The powers-that-be kept pushing the weather balloon story which didn't fit the facts.

GEORGIA UFO GROUP- Joint post of 2002 witness account via MUFON of Georgia inquiry.  The below described inquiry and witness debriefing was conducted by this investigator during my tenure as Georgia Director of MUFON.   On 20April02, this investigator received a WUFOD report from a former Georgia resident then living in Minnesota. Over the course of April-May 2002, this FI communicated in detail with the witness via email, telephone, and U.S. Mail.   The witness stated that in 1973 or 1974, she was a 27 YOA mother and home-maker living in suburban MACON GEORGIA. Her husband (now deceased) was an aviator and away from home at the time of the event. Her husband's cousin and family lived very close-by.   (Investigator's Note: Macon is one of the larger Georgia cities, sitting astride north-south I-75 in our state's ""center mass"", with Warner Robbins AFB being about 14 miles due south, mostly very flat terrain).   WITNESS ACCOUNT - During the evening in question, the witness said it was very warm, the sky was clear, but with some clouds, perhaps above 5000 feet. The witness stated that she had put her baby to bed, fixed a glass of iced-tea and proceeded outside to sit on the patio in the dark. Within a short time, she noticed a GLOW coming across the tree tops to the SW, proceeding TOWARD her, and while enroute, passing directly over the parking lot of the ""Disabled American Veterans"" organization, which was located ACROSS the N-S road from her E-W residential street. Witness continued, stating that the GLOW was LOW-LEVEL and SILENT, continuously moving toward her in a SWIFT manner. As she watched the approach, the glow resolved itself and she observed a THICK LENS SHAPED OBJECT heading right toward her position. This object was still SILENT and steadily GLOWING in a bright YELLOW-ORANGE color......also described as AMBER. As it passed directly OVER the witness, she was able to determine from UNDERNEATH that is was actually a ROUND saucer-like craft, additionally described as being ""gigantic"", like two ranch style homes placed together (WUFOD data fields.... ACTUAL SIZE-300 ft.; ALTITUDE-500 ft.+). Witness observed NO fuselage protrusions, portholes or the like.   At that time, the witness became nervous, ran inside and locked the door. She went to her rear bathroom window and watched as the craft departed, continuing on over the nearby homes to the NE.   The next day, she discussed the matter with her husband's cousin who told her that along with his wife and kids, he too had observed something similar. They debated if it was the same object, but the witness does not recall their final conclusion. She DOES recall a newspaper or TV news report about it, saying several other people described similar observations in Macon from that night.   OTHER RESEARCH- GUFOG investigator Officer Michael D. Hitt spent three years of intense research, focusing year by year, on ALL locally reported UFO phenomenon in Georgia from 1947 through 1987. This resulted in his 1999 publication documenting this activity (appx. 250 accounts). The period of 1973 in Georgia reflected the SAME TYPE of activity as that being reported nationally.......""The Wave of 1973""........as it is described by some of the top American researchers, Ronald Story, Peter Davenport, Dick Hall, Stanton Friedman, Jerome Clark, et al.   1973 in Georgia found reports POURING in from citizens, motorists, MANY law enforcement officers, pilots, reporters and news crews. These reports were being made to the various media, local police and other officials. Numerous of these reports were from central and south Georgia, including the MACON area where our primary witness lived.  This writer was a police Patrol Officer in 1973 and during the summer and autumn of that year, had been routinely assigned to temporary administrative duties after shooting and killing a deranged gunman. While working at night in the radio center during this period, MANY teletype messages from central and south Georgia were monitored as various agencies had patrol units actively pursuing and reporting ""unknowns"" from county to county. This included the MACON and central Georgia area where the witness lived and made her observation. A few of these teletype messages were preserved by this writer (if conditions had permitted, ALL would have been preserved!).   Due to the above circumstances, this writer feels that the MACON witness' report is PROBABLY part of the ""1973 Wave"", even though she cannot remember the exact date or year......stating either 1973 or maybe 1974.   The MACON witness was forthright and above board in ALL of her accounting and conversations with this investigator. The witness' OUTSTANDING writing ability and diction was traced to growing up and being educated in England AND Europe. She did not muck about, being intelligent, observant and concise. One highly credible lady.   I imagine that bits and pieces from the ""Wave of 73"" and other eras will probably continue to come in and undergo some form of scrutiny by GUFOG or my friends and associates in MUFON of Georgia. Credible witnesses, such as described in this report, will hopefully add more pieces to the 1973 Georgia puzzle.   As always, any past or present citizens of Georgia that might have information related to these events, can contact me at the GUFOG office in Fayetteville Georgia--- 678-817-4555; or email at <<<<georgiaUFOgroup@webtv.net>>>>   GUFOG WILL HOLD THE IDENTITY OF ALL WITNESSES CONFIDENTIAL.

I was in Jr. High at the time of the event since i lived in Miami from 1972-1976 starting in the 5th grade so the 1975 approx date of numerous craft supports what i recall. My father was Director of ((deleted)) for the ((deleted/entertainment)) Company Headquartered in Miami Fl. He had bought a Morgan 25ft sailboat which he kept stored moored at a marinia on Key Biscayne Island (the same one President Nixon had his retreat on) We were all on my dad's boat to spend the night & then to sail the next morning early due to tidal conditions i believe. That night present were myself(13), my brother(18) his best friend(18) my cousin from PA. who was attending the UofM(20) her roommate(unknown age) my mother(50) and my father(53)the boat only slept 5 internally so all the older kids were going to sleep outside on deck near the stern. I remember we were all sitting aft talking and it was dark, it's always darker when you are on the water and the miami skyline always twinkled and had an orange glow due to the city crime lights they used on the street lamps. Now we were all used to seeing the planes that buzzed the beach towing the makers and the tourist helo's that took ppl for joy rides and even the Goodyear blimp, but what we saw that night was most definetly not of this world. I don't recall who noticed it 1st, but we all got to watching a single light that seemed to move very slowly at 1st & then stop, starting from the South Miami area and moved in the direction of North Miami/Hollywood, at 1st their was only 1, then 2 then 3, soon we had a hard time keeping count, these objects would start out white & then change to orange and sometimes pulsing. At times their would be 7 in one area and another 3 in another spot further to the north. These objects would almost increase their radiating light intensity and then slowly almost fade  and in some cases just disappear only to reappear in a different location either north or south of their original position. We took turns looking at them thru binoculars, they were orange with a black hexogonal line pattern on them, but seemed not to have an outer edge due to the glow. I remember getting a frightening chill down my back while looking at them. As i recall, at the peak, there were upwards of 18 of these objects at one time, most centered in the area of the Miami International airport. The event lasted along time, i'd say 20-30 mins at a minimum. During our experience, our flashlights would not work nor our radio, i also remember my dad pointing out how our magnetic compass was just wildly spinning. It was weird, all we could do was sit & watch and i felt so small & helpless. I also recall that the next day in the Miami Herald a story about them was printed because the airport had had to be shut down because these things interfeared with the landing of planes and that they had shown up on radar at the airport, i also remember my mother telling me that 2 fighter jets had been scrambled from Homestead Airforce base to intercept these objects (which i can only assume showed up on their radar) and that when the fighter jets got close, they all disappeared(which would explaine the end of our experience). I am ((in my forties)) now & a father, i served in the U.S. Navy as an Operations Specialist ((technical field)) for almost 8 years and held a Secret clearance. I spent many months at sea looking at the night sky without man made interfearence and i have never seen anything like this remotely similar. These objects moved too fast for conventional means and were not man made objects, i'll take that to my grave. I to have also looked for similar accounts of this incident on the web, but have yet so far been unable to locate such info. I hope that my corroboration of seeing this event gives the other report on this the creedence it deserves. I swear on my family name and as a man that the above account is turthful & honest to the best of my ability. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As his oldest sister was driving North on Anoka County Road 5 they all noticed cars pulled over to the shoulder on each side of the road near the 167th Avenue NW intersection. Fearing an accident had occurred she slowed the vehicle down as they neared the intersection. However, to their surprise, no cars seemed to be damaged and the occupants of the parked vehicles were standing outside gazing up into the Western sky.  Just about the time they passed the crossing, ((witness)) looked out his passenger window and saw what appeared to be a large disk shaped craft which he estimated to be around the size of 2 Rambler homes (250-300' in diameter.) It appeared to be about a half mile away near a farm and estimated about 160' in the air. He became very afraid and began screaming at his sister to turn around, get out of there and head back home. His sister obliged when they also saw the craft and turned around the vehicle. To his dismay however, they stopped the vehicle and got out to get a better look along with the 5-10 other vehicles now lining the shoulder. As they watched, the craft hovered for what seemed like 1-2 minutes and made no sound. Suddenly in an instant it moved about 2 miles South and stopped for a few more seconds before disappearing out of sight toward the Anoka area.  After the object departed, ((name delted)) again begged his sisters to get back into the car and go home. They did and upon entering their house, told their parents the story. After calming ((witness))  down and discussing the object, the eldest sister called the Ramsey Police Department to see if any one had reported the sighting. The dispatcher confirmed that other callers had also reported seeing the unusual craft in the same area during the same time frame. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-08-24T00:00:00,,

In 1975 I was returning to my home town of Albany Western Australia with three friends. About ten months earlier we had headed off in a car on a working holiday around the country. Most of our time away had been spent in the city of Brisbane, Queensland. Brisbane is on the other side of the country from out starting point. We had stopped for the night on the Western Australian side of the Nullabor Plain. This is a large dessert area that separates Western Australia from the Eastern States, and at the time the almost straight road was mostly unsealed. We were really in the middle of nowhere.  It was early morning. It was partly light, but the sun was not fully up. As we were packing up sleeping bags etc, (two of us had slept outside the car) one of the group said ""If thats not a flying saucer, then what is it?"" We looked up and there was an object moving slowly across the sky. It would have been below low cloud hight and had a bright look, as if it was reflecting the early morning sun, which we could not yet see. If it had kept moving across the sky I may have explained it away, but it didn't. Shortly after first seeing the object, it stopped. Not directly overhead of us, but at a slight angle. It sat there without moving for about two minutes. We heard no sound whatsoever. After about two minutes it moved back in what appeared to be exactly the same direction it had been coming from.  I assume we must have watched it till it had moved out of sight, but for some reason I can't remember that. I remember clearly one of the group saying ""lets get out of here"" and we got in the car and left. In my presence, we never spoke about what we had seen again.

This will require a rather large investigation to cover Maryland-Virginia-South Carolina-and New York Mufon Investigators-maybe more-the story is potentially large and unique-though I havent written to Budd Hopkins I feel it is an investigation that may be worthy of his expertise. Confidentiality is requested as we begin to take steps to come face to face with this investigation & results.You may contact me through my e-mail & advise as to the best way to begin this investigation-I am at present contacting family members to discuss and seek approval for whoever wishes to discuss this case.

It was stationary and the circumference had a constant solid glow- from the angle I was viewing it - it looked almost like the ""tick"" symbol  or ""nike"" logo. I watched it for several minutes unsure what it was then noticed that it shifting position where it leveled off to a horizontal position and could see that it was conical in shape and metalic coloured. I could clearly see a reflective metalic-like surface.  I asked several other guests if they could see the object which they could once I pointed out its direction. I then noticed a 747 pass behing the object which by my perspective made the object appear extremely large however I could not acurately scale it as I was unsure of the distance between the two object however the object was in the order of 20 times larger and I estimate between 5000 feet between it and the 747. By now all the pool guests were looking at the object and we watched it for atleast 10 minutes. I can tell you we were all transfixed and stunned. The object was so large and non-earth looking that we all seemed to be shocked into immobility and awe. We then noticed a warping or heat-wave like effect of the sky immediately behind the object and then it disappeared. We continued to scan the sky as we could not rationalise how the object had disappeared and were looking for it.  I was in the USA for a conference and was totally coherent . I have never seen a ufo or had any real interest in such phenomena however I have a applied science degree and assure the reader this was not any optical phenomena.

Hi Brian!!  Now I'm scared !  I went back out tonight after talking with you took my bearings to the northwest skies from my home in ValCaron. I'm writing in case something would happen. It came back as bright as ever in the northwestern sky again I thought its got to be a planet because that what it acts like but still moving faster than the earth's rotation.  Looking through a set of binoculars I studied it for a while this time no colors just a bright light (white). This all started at 9:30 est. while watching which you couldn't see with the naked eye two pieces broke off the white object and moved one directly north over the horizon and 1 between north and the white object. With the naked eye they looked like distant stars. Looking through the binoculars they both changed colors like a twinkling star (red, blue, white). I couldn't believe my eyes.  Then the scary part came along, just below the north object on the horizon a red light (I thought it was a tower light moved straight from the ground moving its way up to the north object in the sky. While the object moving from the ground 1/2 way up it changed from red to white, bright white, so bright that it lit the sky like a ray or beam of light straight up (like it came from one from a Mag flashlight. It did not meet with the north object, it made a B-line to the northwest light. By the way, while the red light was going up I screamed at my wife to come out and see this. She witnessed the red light going up and it turning into a white light. She then ran inside to get the video camera. We weren't ready for this and panicking at the same time. This took approx:.5 minutes to happen (red light to white light.). All I know that they all ended going directly south a great rate of speed.  I really hope someone else seen something happen to-night. I have a feeling that something is definitely happening. One sighting on Saturday and one on Tuesday. I'm 50 years old and I haven't seen one that I couldn't explain. Its 12:19 a.m. and I'm still shaking in my boots from this one. Still no noise, and yes the dog stuck real close to us. I could smell something in the air like flowers but they haven't started to grow here and the trees are just budding. One thing I forgot, at first I thought the red light going up was fireworks because that is what it looked like until it turned white and wasn't coming back down.  Again I hope someone else seen this and I'm glad my wife was here to witness the event.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

I then decided to drive in the direction of the lights and fueled up my car at the Sunoco at the corner of US 92 and Combee Road. After that I regained sight of the objects and turned onto Reynolds Road in order to keep the objects in view. At this point two more objects appeared to the south of the first two objects. These objects were close in angular separation. Upon reaching the stoplight at CR 540A, I noted several cars parked about 200 feet within the road that leads to Travis Vo-Tech center. Then turned east then turned into the PCC/USF campus in order to have a safe location to view the objects. It was noted that there was a red pickup truck located in the western most parking lot situated in such a way that the occupants may have been observing the objects in question. At this point the objects were about the brightness of Jupiter and had an orange-red color. The best color estimate would be that of the plume of an Atlas booster. I noted the car of a PCC employee that I know and decided to try to get him to witness the object. At this time he was on duty as the night security guard. I walked into the security office and told him what was being observed. He stepped out and observed the same lights in the east that I had. Five other employees also observed the lights. One I know personally and four others I do not know. The lights now were separated by approx 20 degrees of arc horizontal. The other two ! lights that were to the south now were not visible. The light then faded to invisibility. After the pair faded, another light approx. 10 degrees above the set that faded came into view. Once again lights to the south came on and were visible through the branches of nearby trees. The lights were observed through a pair of 7x35 binoculars. The light showed no structure. The lights faded again and the first pair came on again. After several minute, the lights faded and they were not observed from that point forward. At the time the wind was blowing roughly out of the east to southeast at a speed of about 5 to 10 mph. At first we though we maybe observing the burners from hot air balloons, but soon noted that the objects did not move over the period of the observations. Also the objects appeared as point sources, but they did exhibit some twinkling. We also did not observe structure. We made some other guesses as to what we were observing (flares dropped during military activity) but could not come up with an adequate explanation at that time. The Avon Park Bombing Range is about 30 miles to the southeast of Lakeland, the objects could have been military activity? I am an amateur astronomer with 22 years of observing time and have a BS. in Physics, the other observers had varied backgrounds.",2004-06-04T00:00:00,28.047227153284673,-81.9588497810219

There were the usual satelitte sightings, a few meteors, and numerous airplanes.  Facing approximately due south, I noticed a satelitte about 45 degrees off the horizon, moving south-southeast. Another satellite traveling apparently in formation with the first appeared, and then a third appeared.  The three formed an elongated triangle and were very visible with the naked eye.  I did use my binoculars to track them however until they faded out one at a time, as most satelittes do.   At their brightest, they were about the same brightness as the stars of the Dipper - which is very visible overhead at this time of year. The shape of the triad did not change as they traversed the sky.   There were no blinking or strobing lights, and no sound. I am a private pilot and am familiar with aircraft.  The stars in between these points of light, we clearly visible; in other words, it was not a solid object. It is possible these were NOSS satelittes but I have not yet found corroborating info.

My daughter and I were out on our deck. She is studying cloud formation, and weather prediction, so we routinely watch the skies daily, and nightly. The sky was clear, although it was a bit hazy, as the sun did not hurt our eyes to look up. I pointed at 2 objects in the sky, and she soon located them as well. They were very high up, as I am not good with distance, I would say higher than I have ever seen a bird, but yet when I saw them I said ""look at how high those birds are"". She had said that they don't look like birds, as they were shining. We did not hear any engine sound, and observed that these objects were flying in circles around eachother in perfect sync, slowly. After watching for about 5-8 minutes, these 2 objects left their circular pattern, and one turned away flying straight North, which as we watched went directly above our heads, and the other followed within 30 seconds of the other, again staying in perfect sync, and distance of one another. Once these objects were directly above us, we could see a different angle of them, and noticed that their southeast corner or side was shining as the sun was shining on them. It was at first thought to be white, then we noticed it was a silver color when the sun hit them. I have seen very few birds fly that high, and this was even beyond that. We live over a direct path of airplane flight, and during this time not a single airplane was in the area. We also live in a flight area of what I believe to be Military airspace, as the Military base is not far from here. I can just about guarntee that this was an unidentified flying object.

The gathering I focused on formed into four orange lights in a perfect horizontal line.  From my peripheral view I could see other gatherings moving.  Then they faded out.  They were in view for probably 6-7 seconds.  From then on, I watched 2-3 blinking lights move around the whole horizon, ending up back in the southern sky.  At one point they stopped blinking but if you focused, you could see the object still there.  It would appear like a satellite at that point, except that it changed directions at times.  Then it would start blinking again.  After about a half hour, they were gone.",2004-10-27T00:00:00,44.4229,-89.5369

We were driving on the interstate a bit after the sun had already set, and I was leaning my head on the backseat passenger window just gazing out into the sky. My father was driving, and my mother was in the front passenger seat. I soon noticed a tiny white light traveling in a sparatically upward pattern. I dismissed it as a plane, but soon realized that the craft was changing direction far too much to be any kind of passenger jet. I followed it silently as it changed direction instantly several times, trying to keep focused on it. I soon told my mother, and she noticed the craft too. We were both astonished by its irregular motion, and it soon dissapeared into the distance, as if it had suddenly shot away from us, instantaneously. But, seconds later, it re-appeared, the light was still at the same opacity, but it had re-appeared in a location far from where it had disappeared. We were both a little frightened by the reality of the situation, but it didn't cause us to jump to conclusions or anything else of that sort. We were still on the interstate, and we had told my father of the craft, but he was busy driving and was not able to get a look. My mother and I followed the craft as it seemed to stop dead in the sky. No longer than it had been motionless, it began to give off what seemed tiny little explosions. It looked like the craft was kind of popping bright shimmering fireworks. It looked much like very dim artillery shell-style fireworks blowing up right off of the craft itself. We watched this happen several times, 8-10 times. We could even see would seemed like the little embers from these explosions floating downward toward the ground. The craft continued to kind of spontaneously combust, and eventually began moving once again in its sparatic movement.

I tilted my head back to relax on my lawn chair and notice a bright object in the sky.  It was much to early for a star to be out and no it was not a satellite.  Satellites that I've seen don't stay in one place they move consistently across the sky.  My first thought was it was a balloon, being that there a skyway over my house, a passenger jet flew over.  The object was appeared to be 1000s of feet above the skyway.  Just eyeballing the comparison, it was way to big to be a balloon.  Then I thought a helicopter? Some romantic person enjoying the sunset? Nah, helicopters don't fly that high.  I took out my only camera which had black and white film, took of the auto focus and aimed in the direction of the object.   It was difficult to see through the lens, however very easy to spot with the naked eye.   I used the branches above me to get a bearing where the object might be, as now it was slowly moving and stopping across the sky.  From a SouthWest to a North Direction over Santa Monica.  I didn't know what to do or who to call, strangely I sat back and let the object move out of sight.  When I got the pictures developed, they appeared blank!  I could not believe it!  However when my friend scanned them in through photoshop he adjusted the contrast so it was only black and white.  Suddenly right were I remember taking the picture the object appeared!  We zoomed in and noticed it appeared the have a triangular light side, the dark side however we can't see.  Perhaps there's a process that can be done with the negatives?  When I was younger a couple of buddies and I entered an X-Files competition and we faked a couple of saucer shots using fishing wire, the good side to that is I can spot a fake UFO shot almost instantly.  I don't know what's in the picture, they are not the most glamorous set of U.F.O. pictures ever seen. ((initials deleted))",2004-09-29T00:00:00,34.0464,-118.4481

There was another white light just to the right of that, which I assumed was a star or planet. However, a few minutes later, I saw a series of lights in the same area of the sky that behaved oddly. I had traveled about five miles farther north, and it seemed that the lights I witnessed were now closer to me, i.e. somewhat larger and brighter, and a little higher in the sky. First, there was one light that seemed to be stationary, but appearing slightly larger than Venus on a clear night. What got my attention was that suddenly a second light appeared beside it, separated by a little distance, then a few seconds later a third light appeared, the same size, brightness, and distance apart, so there were three in a very straight alignment, parallel to the horizon. Next, the light on the left end of the formation dimmed and went out; it took about 1/2 second to fade out, it didn't just blink off. As soon as it had gone out, a fourth light appeared on the right end of the formation, so there were three again. It was exactly the same size, brightness, and distance apart as the others. After a few more seconds, they each faded and dimmed out, one at a time, in sequence from left to right. After that, nothing.

I saw it out of my drivers window and across my field of view at the corner of my eye to where I had turned my head completely to the left to look out the window because it was something not normal. I saw a small intensely bight object flying horizontal at a slight parallel angle of travel to my vehicle which it was traveling at a faster rate of speed. It was hard to discern the true distance or size as it was so small seemingly softball size in relation to my depth perception and traveling above the housing/tree line. The object was traveling faster than my speed, creeping across my field of view for two seconds and my eyes and head following it to the front windshield pillar when I quickly turned my head slightly look at my wife in surprise asking her if she sees that and pointing with my right hand while driving with the left and looking at the object, as I did that I see the object accelerate extremely fast at now seemingly a 45 degree angle where previously parallel to my travel. The acceleration was very linear and extremely fast, with acceleration far faster than an unknown aircraft I saw at Andrews Airforce base which was clearly an aircraft, greenish-grey which was made little noise, slowed, turned, hovered, and accelerated to a sonic boom.

The light of the object was intensly bright with greater intensity with a unusual white-ish color at its center to where you could make out a inner sphere with an outer intensity lessening to a faint white yellow-ish/orange color and to its edge of intensity of a greyish color. The light intensity did not light the sky or leave a smoke trail, nor a light trail as it accelerated. There was enough light at dusk to see. There was no outline of a larger aircraft, it did not strobe, it was not a spark or flash, it was very low to the ground, it accelerated in speed and was not a shooting star or a stationary object and there was no noise I could hear coming from it from inside the car.

I have made a couple of reports within the last week or so from College Station and am glad to see them finally posted but must disagree with the evaluation that they are merely stars. Last night as I was coming home right after dark I saw what I thought was an airplane. I refer to them as mosquitoes because they have at least six or eight white lights that extend from them. I was about a mile from my house on a big hill where you can see for miles. I saw the first and then a few hundred yards behind was another and then another. This was to my left and then to my right was the same thing. And as I watched in dismay they all went straight towards the direction of my house. And trying to be scientific about all of this I thought OK what a coincidence. Then I watched several of them dropping toward the ground until they went behind the trees. Then two of them that were still in the air turned off their (running lights) and became these yellowish/orange balls that I have been seeing. And yes I was freaking out and no I was not drinking. And the worst part was I had to go home right by there. My house is surrounded by thousands of acres of tall thick wilderness so anything could be out there. I started watching as I turned on my road and sure enough about halfway down I could see through a small clearing some sort of blinking white lights which were on or near the ground. When I stopped to look they turned off as if I was seen. And not no but hell no I did not go to see what it was. Later that night I could see a glow back there like from a town but there is no town in that direction. I could hear what sounded like machinery which reminded me of an oil well pumping station. But to my best knowledge there is not a well back in that creek bottom either. So I went inside and pulled the covers over my head and hid. I have been seeing and filming things nearly every night for about a month and have no explainations. My friend at work said maybe they are some type of military helicoptors or something which would be fine as compared with the alterenative. I only know that I hope it is one of ours and not one of theirs. But I suppose they mean us no harm because I have definitely been seen watching them......I have video but am unclear where to send it. ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

A friend and myself decided to go catfishing at the ""salt creeek"" in Ashland NE. I was a very beautiful night with clear skies . We hung out late in hopes of catchin a big one . Around 3:30am we decided to take off , fishing was slow that night . We were heading back toward omaha on highway 6 .Just after we had crossed the bridge by the creek , my buddy riding shotgun notices something very strange and tells me to look up .  To my surprise , I notice 4 flare like objects slowly descending . One was well above the others , all of wich were no further than 1000 yards away . Its seems to me the bigger one may have been triangle shaped .  The other 3 that at first glance looked like flares descending slowly as if they were attatched to parachutes . Then all of  the sudden , the 3 smaller object starting movinging around in different directions . 2 of them seemed to travel off to the west , and one seem to come straight down .  Behind the trees ,the entire area in the field was lit up like a football stadium at night . At this point , I could hardly keep the car on the road . We turned back and decided to further investigate . I found a country road , that was closest in the direction of  the crafs . we were driving up this dirt road , west toward farm area . Between us and the creek , around 3-500 yards away , we could see this glowing plasma ball like object , kinda bluish white , and green at times , howevering in the tops of a tree .Almost blinding to look at . I remeber there was also another witnes that was driving a 84 chevy s-10 pickup coming towards us . we were both coming at each other  maybe 5 miles per hour . And it was obvious , this guy was withouth a doubt looking at the same thing . After this guy passed us , i figured what the hell , ya only live once , we pulled off road into the feild and got out of the car . Mind blown on what we were seeing we started walkin toward it .I do not remember any noise. Within a couple minutes of getting closer , it started getting super foggy . Visibility began to get poor . The illumination of the of object grew dimmer and dimmer . all the sudden it was gone , vanised . We waited for the fog to clear and could not find even a trace of evidence , i wished to god I would have had a camera. we still discuss it from time to time , and the last couple of years I've been keeping my eyes on these reports to see if anything else was reported around that date , or in that same exact area . I guess im posting in hopes of finding more info on what we saw . The funny thing is , after talking about it all these years , we realized that when it was over , we were driving home at sunrise . Not sure if we lost time or not , it is possible . We are going to conduct further investigation this year with camera (digital , and completely mechanical ) . I will post updates if we find anything . I will also try to get my bud to post as well , in case there is something he saw that i didnt .  One thing is for damn sure , they were without a doubt aircraft of some sort , but definitely not of this world .",2004-04-27T00:00:00,41.0665,-96.3786

From 151st to about 135th consists of driving through forest preserve. I was behind the steering wheel that night. As soon as we began heading North, I noticed a super-bright, white light in the sky that was not far off in the distance. I asked my friend what he thought it was. He replied ""a star"" but no star is THAT bright. As we proceeded on our way, I noticed the light never seemed to move. We approached the intersection of 143rd and Harlem and encountered the light, which was actually shining from the object. It was dark and cube-shaped; like a huge, black box floating in the night sky. We could see it's outline in the air, It was darker than the sky. We got stopped at a red light and we both stared up through the windshield at the craft. It had the singular light that was beaming down onto the roadway. This thing was huge, it was like a perfect square building that was floating. All the sides appeared to be smooth. It was moving south in the air under 10MPH and made NO SOUND as it moved. When the stoplight turned green, we proceeded on our way, rather dumbfounded. We were both about 18-19 years old and had never seen anything like this before. I don't think we knew how to react. We were just saying to ourselves, ""OK, that was different...""  Also, perhaps worthy of note, 143rd and Harlem in the general area of Bachelors Grove Cemetary, one of the most haunted places in the Midwest. It's about a 2 minute drive east of the intersection we encountered the craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-04-27T00:00:00,41.6322,-87.7423

I was young when it happened (6th grade) I believe it was during spring break (honestly can't remember though.) I was with my friend sitting on a hill directly infront of my house. We were just sitting there for fun and as we were sitting there we noticed a bright light streak across they sky at a very high angle, perhaps 70 degrees. Neither of us could tell whether it was in the atmosphere or in space. It seems very strange when I look back on the event but my friend started talking to it. ""If you are a UFO then streak to the left"" and it did so, causing a white streak from right to left. We could not, however, see it when it was stopped, only when it was moving. I was very frightened, but stayed. Eventually both of us were setting rules, ""you can pick us up but only if you bring us right back and to this time"" because I had seen the movie The Flight of the Navigator before. By the time we had set down the rules we said ""you can come and pick us up now"" or something along those lines. There was a vertical streak that came from way up in the sky which took less than a second to reach the ground. We couldn't tell whether it was a large craft that landed far away or a small craft that landed near by. At the time however, we believed it was a large craft that landed in the forest further infront of my house. Either way, both of us were so afraid we went to our homes. We had also mentioned that if they did not pick us up to burn the grass we were sitting on. The next day when we went to the same spot there was no burnt grass, but there was dried out grass everywhere. I honestly can't say that it wasn't there before though.

I was a graduate student in neurobiology at the time and my mother had come to visit me at my apartment for a few days (she is a teacher).  One evening, around eleven o'clock, we were standing on my balcony looking up at the stars before retiring to bed.  My apartment balcony faced southwest, and it was a very clear summer night.  We were standing by the railing, engaged in conversation while just enjoying the view.  As I was looking around, I noticed a what first looked like a star moving in a straight line from southwest to northeast (it seems to be moving in a direction that would eventually pass directly overhead).  I then noticed another point of light very close to it.  When I first noticed the two lights, they were at around a 50 degree angle to the horizon and were approximately thumbs width apart.  I pointed them out to my mother.  At this time I assumed they were satellites. I have seen satellites many times before and these appeared like them.  They were moving slightly faster than other satellites I have observed however.  As they moved closer to being almost directly overhead, they suddenly did something no satellite would do.  Both lights began moving in a completely erratic manner.  They slowed, then began forming loops in the sky, weaving to and fro and forming circles and zig-zagging manouvers with smooth precision.  We continued to watch until they passed out of our sight beyond the roof of the apartment building directly overhead.  At this point my mother and I both looked at each other and didn't even need to speak.  But when we did, we both wondered what in the world we had just seen.  They seemed the brightness of a star or satellite, but moved in a completely different way.  There was no sound, no colour change (the lights were pinkish).  They were very high up, they were not insects, birds, airplanes or helicopters.  I have been interested in astronomy for years, have taken several university courses on the subject, and I have observed comets, meteor showers and even a fireball or two.  What my mother and I saw that night neither of us could explain, and we still wonder about it to this day.  I was listening to Coast to Coast AM last night and heard Mr. Davenport implore people to report their sightings, so I am doing so now.

While taking a break from paperwork in my garage office (it was a very clear, crisp, fall day) I was keeping track of these huge praying manti that were looking for sunlight on the eave of the garage when I noticed what I immediately thought was a door falling off of a jetliner.  It was just east of due north and 60 dagrees above the horizon and it appeared to be falling at a downward angle drifting eastward of straight down.  I was at first convinced it was a door from a jet plane, then realized it was much too reflective-mirror-like to be a painted surface.  As I started to calculate where it would land, it stopped dead in the air, instantly.  I then realized several things; it was much larger and farther away than I originally thought, and the shape of it was in reality 2 pyramids base to base, with mirrored surfaces.  The diamond shape appeared to be revolving, in place, at about 60 cycles per second (a rough guess), and was oriented vertically,straight up and down.  Just as I was trying to guess the size of it (about the size of my index fingernail held at arms length) some of the few small clouds that were in the sky drifted in front of it, it then started ""falling"" again.  It was then I realized it was not falling at all, but it was moving across the sky as a satellite would at night, it sparkled and moved in that easterly direction, getting slightly smaller, until the tree line at the horizon obscured it.  When it was gone I was dumbstruck and tried to reason that I had seen a large satellite in the middle of the day?  If so, it had to have been huge, and have the ability to stop instantly, and the diamond shape was absolutely unmistakable, it was easily seen with the naked eye.

My son & I were visiting my mother that weekend, she lives in Dawsonville, Ga. We left her house at about 6:10p.m. to 6:20p.m. on Sunday night as we were returning home to Alpharetta, Georgia (my son needed to be in bed by about 9:30p.m./ he was 9 yrs. old at the time). We had been gone from my mom's house for about 15 minutes, we turned on Shoal Creek Rd. heading towards the city square of Dawsonville. There seemed to be almost no traffic on this winding country road. As we rounded a lazy turn in the road, my son & I witnessed, at VERY CLOSE range, what appearred to be a ""Black Triangle"" shaped craft. It was barely at tree top level (approximately 100 feet)directly in front of us. It was floating,kind of rocking in a bizzare manner, slowly from left to right. I can only compare this to a ""Puppett"" on a string. This object was floating, almost dancing,& appeared to be turned up on its sides. The sides were un-equal in length (I think it would be classified as an ""Isosalyes Triangle, math teacher would be proud).Anyway, we were in a state of shock from what we were witnessing (I assumed this later that night). In each corner on underside of craft, were dark blue/neon type lights. These lights were not overly bright at this time. They seemed to be casting a blueish hue, towards the center, where we observed what I can only describe as two straight lines, one a little higher than the next,similar to the number 11 with half-square parenthesis on each side of the vertical 11 lines. The square-like parenthesis were off-set from each other, the one on the left side was higher up than the one on the right. Me or my son, either one can still draw this perfectly. It looked perhaps like some form of insignia. The craft just floated right in front of us, across the road to the other side. as soon as I intially saw this object, I swerved off the road & slammed on the brakes. We were not going very fast anyway. This object was approximately 200'ft. directly in front of us & about 100'ft high. This all! seemed so damn surreal! As this object/craft floated slowly to the other side of this road, we just sat there in my truck (Lexus RX 300) observing this obvious un-earthly vehicle. I say this because of the movement,shape, ect.. When it reached the right side of the road,(where we were sitting), the craft seemed to just ""blink-off"". It was gone, just like somebody turned off a light switch. There was no apparent acceleration, it was literally there one minute & gone the next. At that point I pulled my truck back on the road & we continued our trip home. The really strange thing was we didn't say ""anything"" to each other the rest of the way home,which took us about 30 - 35 minutes. I pulled into our driveway, opened the garage door, pulled truck into carport & we just sat there staring ahead, facing the wall in the carport with the truck still running. We sat there, silently, for maybe 5 minutes, when all of sudden at the same time we both slowly turned towards each other and asked,""What the heck just happened""? We did not immediately talk about this. For some reason, I told my son to go inside the house & draw whatever he saw. I did the same out in my truck. I went inside & then we compared drawings. We then realised that we had indeed witnessed the exact same thing. This drive normally takes 45-50 minutes. However, when we got home I noticed the clock in my truck, it was 8:40p.m. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We would like the witnesses to provide a graphic of what they witnessed on that date.

As I was just about to enter back into the house I was extremely compelled to stop, turn around, and look upwards into the sky facing East. As I stood there looking into the sky for over a minute this overwhelming feeling was getting stronger so I decided to trust this ""gut feeling"" and keep looking. I can't remember exactly how long I was standing there all together, maybe 5 minutes, but I stood there like a rock to satisfy this overwhelming feeling. Eventually something did happen. This large ""ball"" of neon-green looking object appeared coming from the South traveling in a Northbound direction which also left a flame trail of some sorts behind it. It appeared to travel a few miles from the point in which I first noticed it and may have been coming down at a 5-10 degree angle? At first I was convinced that it was some sort of meteor but then it stopped in mid air for a few seconds. As it stood there in the air it made all sorts of colors and during these color changes I was able to make out some sort of circular shapes. It also had something glowing ""around""  and ""within"" the fluctuating colors. This ""something"" is best described by looking at a neon-green style Plasma ball. I'm not even sure green Plasma balls even exist but those who know what a Plasma ball is will get the idea. While it was doing this color changing thing it changed direction from going down to the ground traveling Northbound to going up in the air traveling North and then Northeast. It also appeared to be traveling faster when it took off after pausing in the air. It was now obvious that this was no meteor! Unfortunately all I have is a sketching of it that I made within a few minutes after the experience. I still have the sketching and will send it in for better reference. I sure wish I knew what was going to happen instead of just getting a ""feeling"" of looking up. I probably would have had enough time to get my video camera! The colors from this thi! ng were unlike anything I have ever seen so far in the skies. Regardless of what this object was it has become the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in person. The whole experience now feels like some sort of spiritual experience, strange stuff......",2004-04-27T00:00:00,41.6995,-87.8366

My great uncle was shocked by what he saw, he told me that he saw a little man (believing that man to be a midget) dressed in an sliver-gray flight suit, the man was very pale (as if he was not out in the sun much) with white hair.

We were swimming in the Briargrove subdivision swimming pool (off Westheimer Rd) one summer day in 1957 or 1958. Somebody said something like ""look at that"" and we saw a silver object shaped like two pointed ""moon"" hubcaps stuck together, slowly decending in what appeared to be a spiral, although from our vantage point it was just going back and forth. There was a tall fence along the west side of the decking around the pool and as the object descended several of us climbed up on a bench that was attached to the fence so we could see over it. I soon left the bench for the high diving board to get a prolonged view. The object was probably south-southwest from the pool. As the object got closer to the ground it passed BEHIND one of those water towers that looks like a golfball on a tee. That water tower was (probably still is) about 0.5 to 0.75 mile away so the immediate impression was that the object was 30 to 40 feet in diameter minimum, as it was not possible to tell how far behind the tower the object had passed. The object appeared to be about one third the diameter of the spherical part of the tank. The object continued it's decent until it disappeared behind a treeline. I did not believe in UFO's at the time. We discussed the matter and concluded that if it was a UFO we would read about it in the paper the next day, but no story appeared. I think there were about 8 or 10 people at the pool that day. The only person I can remember by name was my friend ((name deleted--initials ""BR"")) who also lived in Briargrove.

We were both 18 yrs old. It was probably around 10 p.m. This area was like a very large open field; today it is probably built over with houses.  We drove off the paved road (two lanes) onto a dirt road and maybe an eighth of a mile further on the dirt road went down into a large natural bowl, some 20 feet below the upper part of the land. From where we stopped we couldn't see any houses and no evidence at all of civilization. It was a typical Sacramento landscape of oaks and scrub brush. I remember that it was a moonless night.I turned off the engine and we sat and began telling ghost stories, scaring ourselves.  But after a few minutes my friend said, with great fear, ""Let's get the hell out of here."" I was very scared, too and immediately turned on the engine of my VW bug. As we started forward, looking to my right toward my friend, I saw a light outside the window, at a distance.  It was round and I thought it must be a motorcycle or a car with one headlight burned out. It began to move as we did. The light began to come down in a steady swooping motion as if it would intersect the dirt road where we were heading.  I practically screamed to my friend ""What's that?"" She saw it and got even more scared, told me to hurry.  I floored it, got to the other side of the 'bowl' and drove up the hill to the top. On the top, on the dirt road I drove as fast as I could, maybe 30 mph and when I looked in the mirror this light was chasing us. It looked like it was about ten feet above the road, maybe higher. It was still the size of a headlight.  In just a minute or two I was at the paved road. The light disappeared and we sped away.  The next day, during daylight, I went back to the scene to try to figure out what had happened. Was it a motorcycle, a car or what? I stopped my car where we had been the night before. Looking toward the hillside where the light had originated I saw a small creek not too far away but the creek basin was loaded with mounds of smooth rocks left over from old dredging operations; these mounds were easily 8 ft tall and extended many feet across to the hill. The hillside itself was covered with scrub oak. No road, no path; nothing that would have made it possible for any motor vehicle to have so smoothly swooped down towards us.  I seem to remember that next to the dirtroad where we escaped there were telephone lines, poles. I had wondered if the light had been ball lightning, but the weather was clear, no clouds.  Neither my friend nor myself ever had an explanation for this curious and scary event.  We were both college students at the time. Neither of us thought at all about UFOs (except for science fiction) or the paranormal. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))",,38.6845,-121.2223

We were to young, or naive, at the time to be overly concerned.  We were excited at first, curious and playful as we watched it move.  But our ""child’s perception"" kicked in as we playfully skipped from streetlight to streetlight... and when dusk caused those streetlights to come on, we realized the object ""seemed"" to move with us (child’s perception).  We then began to get frightened and ran from street light to streetlight until we got back to my Aunt's house, at which point we immediately told my Aunt that we had seen something.  As we talked we all saw the object through the kitchen window.  We all watched it until my Aunt became nervous and closed the drapes (about 5-7 minutes -- I cannot recall which direction the kitchen window faced, but I believe it may have been S.W. as I remember my aunt's back yard always having sun in the afternoons).  She then got each of us a piece of paper and pencils/crayons, put us in different rooms, and told us (including herself) to draw what we had seen.  When she gathered us all back in the kitchen and compared our drawings... they were all exactly alike.  My memory of the object isn't that clear these days, but I do remember the object having a domed upper portion, flat bottom, numerous lights of multiple colors circling the lower edge, that dimmed and brightened, but never went completely out.  The object also emitted an odd humming sound.

Our ship was the westernmost in the formation. Approximately a mile, or perhaps more, further to the west, the bridge lookout and I both spotted a very bright, bluish light coming from somewhere low in the sky.  With binoculars, we could make out a rather large, circular shape, with what seemed like portholes around the lower perimeter.  Inside of this circle, near what appeared to be the forward part of the object, was the bright, bluish light, that appeared to be at least as bright as our carbon arc signal/search light, which was rated at twenty million candlepower.  The light was shining directly down into the ocean. Soon, two officers-of-the-watch and the Commanding Officer were all looking at the object through binoculars.  At first, we all thought it might be a United States military helicopter on some sort of maneuvers, but we were well out to sea, and none of the 'Notices to Mariners' (sent to all ships at sea), indicated any sort of military exercises, save ours, in that area.  Furthermore, no helicopter could be as large as this object appeared to be.  By now, about ten minutes had passed. Inside the beam of bluish light emanating from the bottom of the object, I personally noticed a vortex, or 'waterspout', (a waterspout is about the same as a tornado, with water inside of it rather than debris) swirling between the ocean surface and the object, and it was my thought that the object was taking on water.  I observed this phenomenon for approximately a minute, perhaps longer. The Commanding Officer ordered me to train the big carbon arc searchlight on the object, and to await his orders before switching it on.  I laid my binoculars aside and trained the light.  The three officers then took positions as far over the side of the bridge as possible, to avoid the glare which would reflect from the superstructure of the ship, rendering their binoculars useless.  I was then ordered to turn the light on, which I did, keeping a close eye on the object. Of course, I was partially blinded by the aforementined glare, and all I could observe was the bright bluish light.  It seemed that within a few seconds of opening the shutters of the searchlight, the object simply disappered.  At the very least, the lights which had been visible around the object went out, including the bright light aimed at the ocean. The Commanding officer then 'broke' radio silence and ordered the operations room personnnel to turn on the Sperry radar, set it to a twenty five mile range, and make exactly two 360 degree sweeps, and turn it off again, which they did.  I would guess that two 'sweeps' would have taken another minute.  Nothing showed up on the screen.  The officers then held a brief conference amongst themselves, and that seemed to be the end of the matter. The next day, on a whim, I looked in the ship's log, and found no mention of the sighting, and I joked with the lookout that we had seen a 'flying saucer'.  In those days, 1957, the term UFO was just gaining popularity. Many years later I thought seriously about what I had seen, and then the issue of Crop Circles began to appear in the press. Here are a couple questions.  First.  Could it be that the object was taking on water to replenish a hydrogen supply?  Or even as potable water for themselves?  Second.  As all crop circles seem to have similar characteristics, that is, the grass, or crop, is all neatly laid out in one direction, stems bent but not broken, and in a perfect circle, could it be that whatever made the 'vortex' or 'waterspout' mentioned above could also make these neat, precise, geometric shapes?  I believe so.  If that is the case, why hasn't someone else come up with the idea?  I mentioned that I have only begun to think about UFOs seriously, so maybe I missed a report somewhere that provided a plausible explanation for how these patterns are made.",,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

Lit by full moon, totally silent, vanished without trace On a very clear and warm Friday evening, I was driving my best friend home from our college library. Upon parking in front of his house on the SW corner of Quedo Dr. and Kelvin Ave. in Woodland Hills, I got out of the car (facing east) and my eye was caught by something moving under the full moon which had just risen.  I thought at first it was a large owl, but it quickly became apparent it was a brownish-metallic saucer hovering in a herky-jerky fashion over a residential area with no lights on and absolutely making no sound.   Since this stealthy object was being well illuminated by the moonlight, we were able to observe this object with utter clarity and awe for about 5 minutes whereupon this thing stop; momentarily shudder; then vanish from sight.  It was as if it sensed us watching it and left.   I estimated this UFO to be appx. 300 Yds. away and 100 Yds. up, and about the size of a school bus.  It had a small dome with a few portholes or windows which may have been slightly lit.  It is of note that the air was highly static and the hair on our arms was sticking up.  I also guessed that the craft was over the proximity of DeForest St. @ Natoma Ave. Although this occurred over 30 years ago, I hope it is of some relevance to report this now other than to get it off my chest.  This was quite an eerie experience; in fact my friend got so scared, he panicked and ran to his house where he hid in a corner of his room under a blanket for a full day.  Afterwards, he refused to talk about the incident and got very angry if I brought up the subject, so I refused to report it without his cooberration. I was in complete control of my senses that night, and later spent 6 years in the Marine Corps. as an electronics specialist in an A-4 Skyhawk squadron; and have seen most every type of aircraft; but nothing like this one.

Presently, I am a 31 year old female with two college degrees.  I was a senior in high school during this encounter.  My boyfriend and I were parked along side of a country road talking.  We saw what appeared to be a bright street light, but then it moved. We watched it hover above a farm house and then a tree, radiating a bright white light from the bottom of the craft.  Then it moved towards us slowly.  It was about 15 feet from us and we were scared to death.  The craft was a gray silver metallic color.  In the middle was a band of lights.  The lights turned on and it was like the most profuse pinks, purples, reds, blues, greens.  The lights were astounding.  Then the lights stopped.  We could see the shape of the craft, where the lights came from and on the bottom there seemed to be a golden dome that was transparent in nature.  We assumed the bright white light over the farm house and tree came from this transparent dome.  We watched the craft hover with a slight hum, but nothing loud or distinct in nature.  Then the craft started moving away from us and it disappeared over a line of trees in the distance.  I was to afraid to turn the car back on because I was afraid of it coming back.  I had my face plastered to the windsheild watching this amazing site.  I'll never forget the bruises my boyfriend left on my legs begging me to start the car and leave.  I wonder if it were just some new aviator craft from the Grissom Air Force Base or was it some governmental project unbeknownst to the public, but what I saw with my friend that night, was nothing that the public would take lightly.  I've never reported my sighting until now.  I will never forget my experience.

So, I was driving eastbound on 94 and just passed the Tecate cutoff when I noticed what at first appeared to be a low-flying jet transport aircraft. It was rather low for the area, maybe about 6,000 feet above MSL.  However, it was very long in relation to its width.  If you could visualize a tall telephone pole you have an idea of its proportions.  It was moving west, straight and level, with the long axis of the body parallel to the direction of flight (it was flat). I thought that maybe it was an old stretch DC-8, but it was skinnier than that.  I then thought I was seeing a reflection off the curved side of a regular transport, but I then stopped my truck to look closer and I didn't see any evidence of reflection.  Further, I didn't see any rudder or wings.  It was too far away to see any markings/windows/portholes, but I certainly should have seen a rudder.  I watched as it proceeded to the west and was apparently several miles away when it looked like it turned slightly to the south.  Once again, I didn't see any wings, which if it had them I would have seen as it banked.  I would guess that it was at least 200-feet long with a rather bland gray color.",2004-07-25T00:00:00,32.5925,-116.5855

We had just passed The Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant. (We were taking the 8 to Gila Bend then up to the 10 freeway to cut off traffic)I noticed the 3 Oval shaped objects to the right of us for about 20 mins when I suggested to my friend that he video tape it. (we just happened to have the digital video camera with us)  We were traveling at about 85 miles an hour and the objects remained on the passenger side the entire time.  We finally stopped and decided to video the 3 objects from a stationary position.  At approximately 10:50 PM, we stopped along the side of the highway to videotape the objects when we noticed that they had broken their formation.  The three objects which were traveling in a ""V"" formation were now only two.  I got some really good detailed footage of the two objects since the digital camera I was using has 240X digital zoom. As I focused in on one object to get more detail, the other one took off. What happened next I failed to get on video  but we also saw what appeared to be a rectangular shaped ship.  (Or a portion of a ship which was siver or gray but it was only a partial view)  For those star trek fans out there it appeared to have a holodeck look to it.  Like when you can see a portion of the holodeck when a majority of it still held the particular hologram it was projecting.  It was also masked behind what looked like clouds.  This occured for a few seconds then it too dissapeared.  A few seconds later the last ship also appeared to vanish. This ocurred about 10:52PM PST.  We then got back in the truck and continuerd to drive when we noticed that they had appeared back in the horizon.  This was at 11:02PM PST, we pulled over again to video the objects in which all three were back but in different formation all together. Two of the objects were side by side and the third was now quite a distance from the others. We continued to capture the event until 11:04PM PST when we finally got back to the drive to Phoenix.  I managed to get some great footage of the sighting and am amazed at the detail of the objects captured.  They changed not only dimension during our filming but also it seemed that they changed in composition.  What appeared to be a fireball one second changed to a flashing orb like object to finally almost a gaseous compostion, in which you can see it is definately a rounded object but also that their is definate light and that they are traveling in a circular motion.",2004-07-25T00:00:00,,

I noticed that something was not quite right about these stars because they were moving.  The stars kept shape as they moved acrossed the sky from the South to the North, and the color was of that of a standard star.  The speed was constant, and no odd movements were made by the three stars.  As I watched; there were no similarities to the star that would point out if they were high flying aircraft.  No blinking indicator lights, or contrails coming the passing object or objects.  I also took note that if they were satelites, it is almost impossible to see them in the city, not to mention in a formation as well.  With growing up in an aviation family, and have seen many aircraft at and from many altitudes, this was quite odd.  As several minutes had passed, by the time the object had come to about 60 degrees off the horizon, the star like lights disapeared. Not much after I as seen the strange formation of moving stars, I was standing outside try to call some friends to see if they had seen what I had.  Now standing in the front yard, looking to the North.  I noticed that something very bright was now moving acrossed the sky.  It was moving from West to East and was about 20 degrees from the horizon.  It traveled to slow to be a jet, and did not make any noise.  The object was so bright that it illuminated a small low flying cloud as it passed through it.  No sudden movements were made as it traveled from West to East. No other aircraft were flying that I could tell as well at the time.",2004-06-04T00:00:00,43.19457232704402,-89.20325974842768

I was shocked to see a post on here from Euless Tx around the same time I saw something in the sky, so I am filing this report.  I went to visit my dad in the Hurst-Euless-Bedford area for dinner on Labor day. We went outside and we were just talking in the backyard. I was sitting on the concrete and looking up into the sky, around sunset. Suddenly I saw what appeared to be a star at first, shimmering and white, only it was still daylight. I thought that maybe it was just the first visible star in the sky at night, so i looked around to see if other stars were visible. There were none. As in the other post from euless, I too was directly under the DFW International Airport flight line. There were many planes flying in from the South, going North.  I shrugged off the light/sphere as a star, and continued talking to my dad, when I happened to glance up again. The sun was shining through the clouds and casting an orange/red tint on everything, including the planes in the sky. That was when I noticed that this object glimmered just like the planes, as if the sun was casting a reflection onto it as well. At this point I called my dad over to take a look, and just as he was walking over to do so, it blinked off like a light bulb. It simply vanished.  I have no idea what it was, but for a couple of days, I thought about it, found my way here, and saw the other Euless post. I would guess that the object was at least 5000 ft in the air. It seemed to be higher than the flight path of the planes, though I am certain that they would have seen this too. It was white, but not extremely bright, just bright enough to catch your eye. It would be impossible to guess the size, other than to say it appeared small in the sky compared to the planes.  This entire event lasted about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, but in the last glimpse of the object, when the sun hit it, I could see definite shadow, and shape, which is why I started doubting it was a star at all.

A beautiful night here in Wisconsin.  I had spent the early morning installing solar patio lights, and my wife wanted me to come outside and view my handiwork first hand.  After viewing the great job I did installing the lights, she looked up at the clear sky and said...its beautiful, look at all the stars!..     I then noticed one object that was moving at a VERY high rate of speed.   Its altitude was very high.  I am a pilot with over 12,000 hours experience.   I know the characteristics of aircraft and how they behave.   This was no aircraft.  My wife and I both watched the object as it moved from WSW to ENE....and then it turned 90 degrees left (North) and maintained the same rate of speed. It made the turn------------- instantaneously.---    I mean like a 90 degree turn that you would draw on a piece of paper.  No aircraft that I know about can do that.  As a member of AMSAT,(www.amsat.org) I also know satellites and how they perform.   Satellites don't make 90 degree turns either.  There were no NAV lights or strobes, just a rectangular structure that was dimly lit...not a glow.   In fact when it went by, I pointed and showed my wife and said look honey a satellite...and then about 6 seconds later in the blink of an eye.....it turned 90 degrees North and disappeared from view within about 20 seconds. I am no stranger to the night sky.  I have built homemade telescopes and have enjoyed the stars and messier objects for at least 15 years.  The ""seeing"" or turbulence in the air was non existent as none of the stars appeared to ""flicker"".  Our position in observing the object: We were facing North, looking up between 75 to 80 degrees towards zenith.  If I had to estimate the altitude, I would say..Low earth orbit, as for speed, I think it would have crossed from horizon to horizon in about 14 seconds. After the object made the 90 degree left turn, North, the object never decreased in Luminosity, but with distance in the atmosphere, the amount of ""air"" we were looking through, made the object shimmer.  So to try to make this description easier, My wife and I picked up the object on its trajectory at the 75-80 degrees from the zenith...and after its turn North, it shimmered out of view at about the 40-45 degree point from the horizon.  Unrelated to this sighting, I have seen 2 other unexplained sightings.  One a black triangular object with white lights on each underside corner, in Plattsburgh, NY in 1993 on the shore of Lake Champlain, at an altitude of approximately 100.  Each of the white lights was drawn-- in and out-- towards the center in a circular fashion.  The lights did not propel downwards but just lit up&.sort of like the lights on the old disco floors. Those lights were circular in dimension.    Since I was outside at 0230AM&.hanging a discrete HF antenna (dipole) in the trees behind the apartments, as it approached there was no noise, and no moon. I became very frightened and ran back towards the apartment building approximately 200 feet away, through about 2.5 feet of snow. Plattsburgh, NY receives lots of snow.    As I got to the back entrance door&the lights extinguished and the object moved North, at a very slow speed.   I did not know to check for missing time as I was unfamiliar with the term at the time.  The other instance was when I was flying a between KSYR and KPLB (Syracuse and Plattsburgh, NY) also in 1993 at FL250. That object even turned its luminosity on and off, with our selecting our landing lights, on and off.  Boston Center even acknowledged, no traffic within 200 NM and NO night Aerial refueling in the Military Ops area just NE of Syracuse and up into the Adirondack mountains. (KC-135s with Getty call signs) So the captain and I never repeated the story to the company or anyone else.  But we found it to be very odd.  The Unidentified object left our 1'oclock position at a high rate of speed toward our 6 oclock position.  I never saw a structure, but the light trailed away a rapid speed. Weather that night....We were on top of an overcast layer....no moon.  Anyway, I have had some interesting occurrences.

Late last night my girlfriend and I were sitting on our balcony, which overlooks Banderas Bay in Pto Vallarta, Mexico. I observed what at first I thought was a very bright star. After it caught the attention of my girlfriend also, we had a closer look. It was definitely not a star. This thing was changing colours, every colour of the rainbow actually. At first it looked like just red and white but when I got it on video, it is definitely much more. Looking with the naked eye, it seems to be one object, looks somewhat like a bright star blinking rapidly. When I looked in my binoculars, it looked like 2 objects very close to each other. Moving very rapidly and wildly. It looked more like some kind of weird electrical force than a UFO, but definitely nothing I nor the people with me had ever seen before. I got out my video camera and zoomed in on it. On video, it shows as one ball of light, changing colour and moving rapidly in every direction, like the movements of a bee or some kind of insect. The binoculars may have been splitting it into 2 or maybe they got a closer look at it and it is actually 2 objects. Whatever it was, it was not from this world. I got about and hour of it on video. It lasted for well over 2 hours, I ended up waking 2 other people that were here and they say it too. When we went to bed at 5:00, it was still there. It is now the following evening and I don´t see it. I just looked at some of the case files on www.ufocenter.com and found one with almost the exact description back in May, also here in Vallarta and also over the Bay. It said that some of the locals know about it and apparently it has been there off and on for years with no explanation. Shouldn´t someone look into this? It is defintely a very odd phenomenon.",2004-12-03T00:00:00,,

We took the highway from San Francisco which was our origin and made the most direct route to Lake Tahoe.  I do not know the name of the highway.  I had just returned from a long stay in Hawaii and answered an ad on craigslist.org-san francisco posted by a business professional seeking someone to drive up to Lake Tahoe with him and save on fuel.  We must have been about 30-40 miles outside of Lake Tahoe and it was dark in the sky already.  The time I gave above is an estimate.  We left San Francisco around 5 PM.

We were heading North, or Northeast and in that same direction, high up in the sky between, but definitely much higher than the two mountains we both saw a large, bright neon green fireball suddenly appear and then quickly vanish.  It streaked for a few seconds, possibly leaving a slight green trail, like a tail of a comet.  The business man I was with did not want to talk about it and neither did I because I was quite scared.

I at the time was testing my wings as an OTR truck driver. Partly because I made descent money for a twenty two year old, mostly because I was able to see many things I wasn't sure I would ever get to see otherwise. As a team driver at the time I typically drove at night, usually 9:00 pm to 5:00 am. Of course this was a great time to watch the sky as I often did. Strangely enough I was driving through Mississippi on a very sunny summer day. It was strange because; I never drove during the day and I was in a state I had been through only a handful of times in my short lived driving career. My driving partner at the time was sleeping and it was getting close to the end of my shift. Still very early in the morning I was driving north on I-55 heading home to Nashville, TN in a very desolate part of Mississippi, close to Durant, when I glanced up. There in the bright blue early afternoon sky I saw three very small dots sitting in a triangular formation. I say sitting because there was no movement whatsoever. The objects were so small I thought they must have been miles up. I continued to watch the objects as I drove up the interstate and they remained perfectly still in a right triangle configuration. I thought it was so odd because I had the thought that it could be a real sighting, but it was almost surreal. They seemed so far away and they were so small I wasn’t sure what to think. I have no pictures to document what I saw but, if you saw three of the brightest stars in the night sky shining that brightly through the afternoon sun forming a perfect triangle, that’s what it was. As opened minded as I am I had always been skeptical about the existence of e.t. life, but watching these objects made me really feel that there was something possibly alien or otherwise unknown hovering above me. My sighting went on for a total of about ten minutes. ! During the last few seconds of what was a very wonderful, but rather uneventful phenomena the objects suddenly moved straight up at a rate of speed I could not begin to judge. They literally disappeared in less than a blink of an eye, but I absolutely saw what appeared to be some type of mechanical movement something not at all natural. It was amazing and I so wished I had the opportunity to get pictures as I was driving. I had somewhat doubted the whole experience, but within about a minute of the objects disappearing the strangest thing happened. Five Air Force jets, and I’m not sure what model, but fighter jets were doing flybys at and around the interstate. They circled within five miles of the interstate for a few minutes then disappeared. That incident certainly sparked my interest and belief that something possibly threatening and likely not human exists. Recently I was driving through a neighborhood close to home when I noticed a rainbow in the clouds. While observing the rainbow I shifted my sight about 45 degrees to the right when I noticed the same strange object. This encounter was much briefer and there was only one object I could see. My friend Keith was with me this time and I tried to get him to look, but when I looked to find it again, it was gone. I’m certainly glad to know there is a website dedicated to discovering the truth about UFO’s. I totally and whole heartedly believe that there is a lot we don’t know, but I think we are on the verge of finding the answer to the age old question: Are we alone?

It is about a 15 min drive from Grimsby to Hamilton, and as my 2 friends chatted away, I kept watching this bright star.  It struck me funny as it seemed to be stationary, then go slightly lower in the sky and then up, and when it looked like it moved slightly north of the highway and then back to the other side, that's when I said, what the hell is that and my 2 friends noticed it.  I had been watching the light for a good 7-8 min before speaking aloud.  We all watched in silence for a couple a minuits as we neared the outskirts of Hamilton.  It was on the left side of my vehicle and the closer we got, the higher in the sky it seemed.  I then realized it was hovering way above the large chimney stack of a recycling plant about 3 blocks south of the highway.  the chimney is about 6 storeys high and on any given day, there is a wisp of smoke coming out and the winds grab right away and it changes direction almost as soon as it leaves the stack.  What I saw, was a huge column of smoke coming out, several times wider the the mouth of the chimney and going straight up, maybe 40 storeys and this light seemed mostly in the top part of the smoke which made it strangely reflective(like lights in a fog)on this clear night.  As we were now almost parallel with the chimney, I was pressing my face every couple of seconds against my window trying to look at this and it was now the thing was almost straight up(and I was still driving and could only glance every couple of seconds). There was only the sound of my truck engine. The funny thing is, I told my self that some construction company was building some huge structu! re behind this wall of smoke, beside the chimney, and that's where all these lights were coming from(but, there is no huge structure in the area and the chimney is the tallest thing). At that moment, the highway turns 90 degrees, and that was the last we saw of it.  One of my 2 friends saw 3 lights on top but what I remember the most was, when right beside it, looking at this incredible volume of smoke coming out of the chomney stack and hiding the entire bottom of this huge circular object but on the edges were all these different colors reflecting off the smoke and the smoke was rising thick and perfectly vertical at least 40 stories and, I had been watching this, light, for the entire time as it grew in size the closer we got.

The unacceptable movements of the craft are what keep me so skeptical.

I, however, cannot believe this report as again, the craft was moving in such ways that cannot be explained by our modern day aircraft.

To give an idea of where they are in the sky i'd say between 45 and 60 degrees up, and the lights will sway left right a few times and up and go real low. My first thought after watching this the first night was a helicopter and i pushed it to the back of my mind.  The next night i saw again this light, again noticing it because of the off color it was and when i stopped to watched it did the normal up down and side to side then in shot off stright up and was gone into the night sky. Of course after this it had my full attention and I brought it to the attention of my running partner after this. It was the following night and again I saw the light and stopped this night having feild glasses with me. I looked and couldn't get a good focus nor could he but, we both could see the strobing lights of blues yellow a purple ect.

The camp was held in Santa Monica / Malibu mountains. This camp was only a Friday to Saturday night sleepover, returning late Sunday afternoon.  At the time this event happened I was about 10 or 11 years old. Most of the kids in the camp were a similar age, give or take a couple 3 years up or down. In any event this would make the year about 1966 or 67.  The night that this sighting happened, I and a small group of kids my age was walking back to the camp sight, which was a ranch where we bunked. I and a bunch of other young campers had just come from a scary story telling sessions by the camp counselors.  We had all sat around a camp fire, maybe 50 - 60 kids as they told us these stories. When the session broke up we all headed back along the trail by which we had came . This was a tree line trail where the trees, pine I think, were a least 75- 100 or so feet high, maybe even taller.  The elevation where we were at in the mountains was about 6500 feet. I remember this because the counselors told us the air was going to be very thin up where we were going when started the trip. It was very dark, but you could see by the star light okay. We might have had a flash light, but of that, I'm not sure of.  What happened next though I am sure of. I was walking back to camp with about 6 or 7 other boys about my age. The rest of the group with the counselor were spread out on the trail in front or behind us at some distance, but none were close enough to been seen, but could be heard. Suddenly, some one in our group spotted a bright light in the distance through the tree line.  We all thought it was a star, but someone said it way getting bigger. As we watched this light get bigger and bigger, very quickly, say in about five second or so, it went from looking like one of the stars in the night sky to a giant dark triangular shaped craft zooming directly over our heads in what appeared to be 2 - 3 hundred feet above the tree line.  It was huge. It was close. It made all most no sound, but it could be heard, like a whooshzz sort of sound, but definitely extremely quite for  how close and large it was. The bottom of it was line with circular colored lights, I believe red, yellow/white, blue and may be green. They seemed to be flashing a bit.  As it passed over our heads we tracked it. Even though up close we only got a good 2-4 second look up close at it from front to back you could see all the detail in it. It was big like a football field. It disappeared in the distance in another three to five seconds, looking like a star again and that was it. We all turned to each other and said  "" wow, we just saw a ufo!""  Strangely enough I don't recall us talking about it to much back at camp and I don't even recall if I ever mentioned it to my dad. But I can tell you this, to this day I can still see it in my mind as clearly as if it happened yesterday. I know what I saw.  As a side note about 15 years ago a friend of mine gave me Whitely Stribbers Communion book and told me I should read it. I really had no interest in it, but one night I felt strangely compelled to start reading it. I suddenly came across a passage where he starts describing the object I saw that night. I have since come to find that Art Bell has seen the same object. The thing that is most interesting to me was the time frame when I saw it, the mid 60's, and where, the Malibu mountains. I mean that still pretty close to a big city.  I have never seen anything since, but I have had two freakish events I kind of relate to that incident. The first is, I was house sitting a place in Mar Vista California around the time I started reading the Stribber book. The girl whose house it was, was a film editor. Before she left on her trip we were partying a little at her house. In the bed room she had big sliding doors. Now I admit we were a little drunk but she swears she saw a ufo looking up from her bed through those doors while we were talking. She got very scared. And for some reason, I to seem to get unnaturally scared.  For the next week as I house sit at her  place I could not go to sleep before dawn. I was terrified every night.  The second event was about 5 years ago. I thought I woke up and saw a gray alien, the ones with the big eyes standing by my side of the bed. My girlfriend was asleep. I got the distinct impression that he (why do I think it was a ""He""? ) was surprised I woke up. I got mad and I punched him in the face, then I suddenly fell back to sleep. When I woke up the next morning, I thought that was a strange dream.  Some how I've always thought that these event's were connected, but the first one is the only one I can be sure that happened.",,34.06816860465116,-118.8163988372093

Anyhow, my father went over and came back and talked with my mother and then took off into town to I guess get help. While we waited the fire had gone out. My father came back with the local constable and they walked around the site. We didn't go over there as my father had said no. A little later on another guy came up and it was then my father came back over. We all asked questions but he didn't seem to know anything. I do know he stayed up late talking to my mother. I guess he had gone back over there while we were sleeping because the next morning he had a cylinder, kind of like the ones you draw blood with, filled with this green/blue/silver metal looking liquid. He showed us how when you shook it up the liquid vanished. After about 30 secs it reappeared. Pretty neat huh? He said it was all over the ground and hadn't seeped into the ground at all. Later on that day more people showed up. They seemed like workers from the nearby aluminium plant and they had some heavy equipment. They, or other workers stayed for a couple of days at least. The next day a helicopter showed up and some guys in white shirts and ties got out. I kinda lost interest as I was opening Christmas presents and stuff, plus we couldn't go over there or see it from the road anyway. So I'm not sure how many people actaully were over there. After about 4 days everything over there was over. Me and a friend from down the road went over and the entire area, get this: Had been planted over. You could tell because the grass was a different color! There were still tracks and stuff from vehicles but if you didn't know there was a crash and fire there you would never know it. Wondering what happened to the container of liquid? It only seemed to last about two weeks. It still dissapeared when shook but the more you did it the less would reappear.

He lives a few short miles outside of Scottsville, Kentucky.  This man is still alive today, and he is in his middle 70's now.  He has always told us this same astonishing story over and over again many times over the years, and his story is always the same with great detail involved.

While this story is really bizarre to say the least, I do strongly believe that it actually happened.   I have seen UFO's myself, so I can relate to his unique experience.  This is no lie on my part either-just the truth.  According to this man, one night back in 1972 (estimated year), he was sleeping in his home when all of a sudden his children came into the house from outside yelling for him to get up.  Thay were terrified about something outside and wanted him to come and see it for himself.  They yelled at him telling him that he would not believe it.  After he had finally awakened, he at first noticed that the inside of their house was really bright and lit up for some reason.  He realized that something was causing this to happen from outside.  His dogs were in an uproar too.   He hurriedly got dressed and went outside with his family to see what was happening.  To their astonishment they could clearly see off in the near distance a large glowing disk proceeding to land out in a field directly in front of their house.  The disk had different colored lights rotating all around it-sort of in a swirling motion.  It did land, and it just sat there for half and hour or so glowing brightly.  He and his family just stood there in shock at what they were witnessing.  After they had observed this huge disk for the lenght of time mentioned above, the disk then began to lift up slowly from the ground and just flew away at a tremendous rate of speed.  The disk never at any time during this sighting made any sound at all either.   As a believer in UFO's, I did want to share his story with you.  What this all means is a mystery to me.

This last one seemed to co-related to day of century days and day since age indays since our birthdates --6-11-23---8562---9-24-55---20355 days added together 28917th day of century and age in days of father and son 28917. Look at Majestic 12 dates---Notice any dates ending in a 62 or 00. 36524 divided by 1/2 18262-Then go forward or bacwards every 100 days. Notice if you use a 1658 day algorithym added from 18262 you will eventually come to an even 36500 days! It is also strange that if you take 1658 day from the 1st wtc attack of 2-26-93 you will always come to 9-11 0f any year except  leap year years. 1658 days separated the Kennedy brothers death. Chech your ufo cases and see how many sightings occur with century dates ending in 62 0r 00. I would also look at century day dates ending in 04--adding this 1658 will land you on a date ending in a 62 for example 22762-Figure what the month day and year this corresponds to. This could be being used in time-series statistical calculations. These ufo sightings I reported--but not officially to the UFO Flying Saucer Investigating Committee,on 9-5-80. A ((name deleted)) was the main person. Then 6 days later an unmarked military green helicopter flew over low over the spot where the copper ray was over a power line at 12:15p.m. Thank you.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,41.0979,-81.4258

Now I'm 46. I have told close friends of this, and they know I've never taken one drug in my life or even smoked a normal cigarette! I was taking my friend home way out Westport Road. At that time, it was different, undeveloped except for a huge Ford Truck Plant and some apartments.  All along the way it was just land, with huge power lines on tall poles draping over a fairly twisty road in places.  After taking her home, in my Mustang, I noticed what I believed to be a normal helicopter coming down...down...then it got so darned near to those big power lines that it scared me! I didn't want its propellers (though I saw none) get twisted into those lines, so I stopped immediately. I wasn't going that fast since the road twisted into a sort of curve there anyway, with a guardrail there, and power lines above. No lights were there, only my car lights so it was pitch black otherwise, out in the country. It came so low near my car I wondered if it was a police helicopter looking for someone...I had stopped so I rolled down my windows and turned off my air conditioner. I could not hear it and it was BELOW the second draping power line. That is too low for any craft to be near a street, so I thought it was dangerous. Then it darted back up--way up in seconds. It was unreal how fast. The thing was cigar shaped in that it was similar to a plane or a helicopter body but it was lit up and also shone a light down on the ground. It wasn't directly on me but near me. I thought a Police 'copter made a mistake and was looking for someone but when I heard no engines or whirring propellers it was mysterious to me. I wasn't even thinking of UFO's! I went home and followedit in the sky with my eyes and it began to come nearer and then go out higher, irratic for a plane and a 'copter can't go that high I don't think! I went home (35 minutes trip) and it followed me all the way home, till I got into the driveway. At one point in the road where they are a crossroads, I actually turned out my lights and then went up the hill and thought they lost me but they just went up high. When I got to my yard and parked my car, I stayed in the dark car a minute looking up in the sky as it ""looked"" for me. While it was up in the air a minute I ran into the house and told my mother who said it was probably a helicopter looking for someone. I said it was so strange it would follow me that long. All night I had this dream I couldn't stand where I was ""downloading"" all this 'simple' information like: what was my weight? Height? Size? Who were (names!) all of my relatives, what was my education, religion, heritage, you name it. This was before computers and stuff, and the only way to this day I can describe it is like in my dream my whole 'data' was downloaded. Maybe the whole thing just gave me this dream, yet in the dream it was very annoying to answer all these simple questions so painstakingly for what seemed hours. I've never seen anything weird before or since. I have never smoked, drank anything but an occasional drink because I don't even like it, and wasn't on any medicine, didn't need to be, was perfectly healthy and happy and normal.I have never taken ANY illegal drugs either. I know what I saw wasn't normal. One other funny thing is that to this day, twenty years later, when I think back on it, I picture myself going TO my friends apartment, yet it was that stretch of road coming BACK that I saw it....weird.

At about the same time, I was a in security of a Minuteman Complex assigned to Francis E Warren AFB, Cheyenne, Wyoming.  It began one night by our MCCC (Missle Combat Crew Commander) asking my partner and me to step outside and look straight up and report back to him.  Above us was a formation of eight objects.  Their altitude was high enough to prevent any real description but their formation.   When I reported back to the MCCC, he told me our findings were what he expected.  He told me that Cheyenne Mountain had just told him of eight UFO's over our location.  I might note, that I later was told that Tinker AFB in Oklahoma City had eight UFO's reported over them the following night.  The various sightings continued for almost a 30 day period.  At one time, we had a two man security crew posted at one of our silos.  When teams such as that, were posted,  they were equiped with a rather top heavy vehicle.  Usually a 4x4 Dodge Power Wagon with a camper mounted .  Because of this, when they were parked on the site, they would tie them down with guy wires to prevent them from being blown over. It was reported to me, a UFO hovered over the silo and over the teams vehicle.  It seems the vehicle began to shake as though it was being raised.. The guy wires prevented any further movement..  During that 30 day period, ranchers were driving the sheriff of Laramie County a bit crazy.  They were reporting UFO's and missing cattle.. I heard, sometime ago, that a member of my Air Police squadron had informed Mr. Bell of a landing site they had tried to preserve but were prevented from doing so.

I was assigned to maintain and operate a small 24 hour diesel power house at this very powerfull search radar site called Yoza Dake Air Station. We were loacted at the southern tip of the island and there was a Army Hawk missle site near us. One night me and a co-worker were coming out of a NCO club that was our late night mess hall as the regular mess hall closed at 7 pm. We had a Okinawan waitress that came out side with us as she was beginning to clean up the NCO club and she was coming out to get a mop bucket and a mop as she did almost every night. When we came out of the door she shouted out in Japanese ..OH My God. (OK Sami Yo).. and she ran back inside the NCO cluub. We were very astonished ourselves in the very large red/orange colored light that appeared at 25 -30 degrees above the horizon on the eastern side of the mountain top. We asked each other what could this light be from as it was not usual to see any light on the east side of the mountain as the Naha Airbase has a glide path on the west side of the island and our radar site. We asked each other who had a camera in the barracks which was only about 50 meters away. My friend ran to get his 35 mm camera and I stayed and observed this light alone for about 5 or 10 minutes. The weather was pretty humid and there was a slight misty rain earlier, but it was not raining when we saw this huge bright light. While I was waiting for him to come out of the barracks I was walking towards the rear door of the barracks and watching this light which is very bright. The intensity of the light seemed to stay steady. and it did not move at all and then it suddenly disappeared befor my co-worker came out of the door with his camera. We asked our radar observers that was on duty that night in the block house if they saw any boogies on the radar screens that night and they said no. But later after many questions some did admit the radar observers were! tracking this and some other boogies. Later after this incident one of the senior radar observers said they have logged many unknown boogies there over the years in a daily log book. We both talked about this openly with the 80 plus  staff on the radar site and some were open to discussions but most said they could not discuss these boogies as they were instructed by their officers to remain quiet about boogies. A very well known radio personally who was in the Air Force then was also there at this time. He was moonlighting as a DJ at a local NAHA radio station there that we all listened too called KSBK. He is the host of After Dark on the weekends now. I remeber there was newspaper articles in the local dailies as this light or lights were observed in many places that night and it scared alot of people. The KSBK radio station had radio news stories about this light that same night as we went back to barracks and listen to the DJ as the station received alot of call in reports. I visited the KSBK radio station during my 18 month stay there and I was able to meet the current weekend host of After Dark. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

Table Rock stands at an elevation of about 1000 feet above the valley floor and looks out over the city and eastly toward Mtn. Home.  The airport was near the top of the ground horizon, with what was to become freeway I80 running along the rim and out east past the south end of the main runway of Gowen Field.  We could easily spot approaching aircraft, watch it circle before landing and touch down.  We could even see how the aircraft would then taxi from the end of the landing zone back to the terminal.  The end of the landing ztrip is separated by perhaps 4 or 5 miles,  and in those days was simply open desert with very few buildings.  The area roads were well know to us and the headlights of autos followed a well established pattern.  Distance across the valley to the rim from Table Rock was perhaps a few miles, and then a few miles further over spaserly settled rural area to the Airport.  We could time landings at about every 8-10 minutes at that time of evening.  We all were amazed as one of the landing lights, which had a different color spectrum to it--still just a small circular light source, descended from the right of the landing pattern, onto the runway, and at the point all aircraft would slow and turn back to the tower, this light continued across the end of the landing zone, out across the desert, several miles out onto I80.  It turned onto the route of I80 headed east and followed in the same line of travel as the rest of the traffic towards Mtn Home 45 miles east.  This same thing happened a couple of times that night.

And, sure enough, by 2 or 3 in the morning we had spotted a couple shooting stars and at least one satellite.  Soon after the satellite sighting one of us spotted what (at the time) appeared to be a very slow, low flying plane.  However, as we observed it we realized that it was somewhat unusual in that it wasn’t making a sound on that calm, clear early morning and it was pulsating red, green, blue and yellow lights on and off.  Not flashing, but more of a fade in and out intermittently.  The blue would fade out and the yellow would fade in, for example.  I remember that we couldn’t decide whether it was a small plane or a helicopter and we had plenty of time to discuss our thoughts on it, as it slowly passed.  The plane flew over the practice football field behind Columbus High School while we watched from across the street. (I believe Columbus Drive).  It came in from the south heading north and then it must have moved slightly east/northeast after it passed by our location.  When it shifted east it just happened to go right over my parent’s house and it seemed to stay at the same altitude throughout the entire time we observed it.  Now, UFO’s and flying saucers were not even part of our discussion until the object passed over my house and in front of the full moon.  Needless to say, we were astounded and exclaimed, ""Did you see what I saw!"" at the same time.  I pressed ((name deleted)) to go and get his Dad’s camera.  Which he did, not before waking his parents to share the amazing news.  His parents were none to pleased to be disturbed and by the time he returned the object had disappeared behind trees in the distance.  Well. We had the rest of the wee hours of the morning to compare notes and here’s what we saw fly between us and the full moon.  The best way to describe it would be by comparing it to a coffee cup (minus the handle) placed upside down on top of it’s upside down saucer plate.  It was a solid black silhouette in front of the moon for a second and a half and then it continued on and eventually out of sight. but not out of mind. :^)  We both were pretty much pooh-poohed by our parents and our friends were merciless so, we never discussed it with each other since.

Mr. Davenport, I am a 52 year old man. I'm not sure this fits in this arena, and it has taken me more than 35 years to come to grips with this; Sitting in my apartment at my parents watching the news, I heard my dogs barking a lot more than usual for the badgers that ran around my area. Then they stopped all at once. I remember feeling my hair raise up and stay there, like a static generator was next to me. I got out of bed and went outside to see what was going on and saw nothing unusual. Coming back inside, I went to bed watching the news. Less than a minute after I laid down, a voice (somewhat mechanical sounding) said; ""I want you to come with me."" OK. I'm scared now. There were a lot of strange things happening in this time and I was thinking I was being sought out by some cult or something.  I got up and went into my closet and got my .38 pistol and went back outside. I still saw nothing different. The voice again said: ""I want you to come with me."" This time it was less mechanical sounding and more gravely. My dogs still weren't barking, but they wouldn't come with me around the property (~5 acres). My bitch aussie growled at the next shed and wouldn't come closer than about 25 feet. The voice came up again saying the same things and still the gravely voice.  I went to the apartment and closed and locked the door and called my dad in the next house. He told me I was dreaming but would meet me outside and check the place out. We checked the house, the shrubs around the property and the sheds. We found nothing. The dogs STILL wouldn't come with us to the sheds, but were playful and jumping round us until we got to that shed. There was nothing in it that we hadn't put there.  There were some barefoot prints in the dusty ground about the place. They did not look like human prints, and didn't look like any animal I had hunted or seen. They weren't very clear because it was real dry and quite fine silted soil.  There were some strange sounds like a high pitched whistle that came and went as my dad and I were moving from the shrubs to the sheds. But we didn't see anything. I have no memory of anything after that. Not going back into the house, not getting back into bed or saying good night to my dad. He has no memory of anything beyond our checking the sheds.  More than an hour passed from the time I went outside the first time and the time I came back inside.. The news was over and Johnny Carson was on TV when I came back. This property inspection normally took about five minutes to do. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))",,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

The craft was soundless and completely devoid of any light source except for an amber basketball size mass of swirling energy that seemed to posses electrical properties. The amber ball of swirling energy was located underneath the faintly silver rim of a UFO and was located nearest me along the rim. The craft then emitted a red cone-shaped beam from its underside seemingly searching for a landing site. Moments later, the craft paused and a string of red lights began flashing back and forth in a 5-4-3-2-1, 1-2-3-4-5- pattern around the objects midsection. The first craft was then joined by a second craft that flew in from its right side. The two crafts then dropped below the treeline and out of sight. Minutes later, two jets and a single column of helicopters approached the UFO hotspot from the east. After several minutes the Air Force jets and choppers left the area. At approximately 1:50 am the craft to the left rose up from the exact location that it had disappeared below the tree line nearly seven hours earlier. The object displayed the same pattern of red flashing lights around its middle. Then it shot straight up, paused and then the red flashing lights began to fade as the UFO took on a more luminous appearance and reminded me of a star as it just hung there in the dark, starry sky. Then, the eastern horizon lit up with orange and white colors as a Minute Man 2 missile rose up and within moments began its arc downrange the Eastern Test Range over the Atlantic. The luminous UFO then began zig-zagging across the sky, then performed a falling-leaf pattern, and all in one continuous lightning-swift motion. Then the UFO shot to the left and seemed to draw very near the rapidly climbing missile. Then the UFO darted to the right, paused then shot off to the right again and vanished. I waited until sunrise but I never got to see the second craft leave the location of which it had apparently landed nearly 12 hours or so earlier. The above UFO sighting was the first of numerous other sightings that happened in the same area over the course of the next nine months.",,,

We thought a helicopter had flown too close to the lines that were supporting the tower, which is what my father, who was driving, initially exclaimed. As we neared, we saw it wasn't a helicopter, but was a dark ""kite shaped"" object, flattened, with the longer pointed end directed ""forward"". The lites were underneath and moved around. As we drove even nearer, it began to follow or fly nearer to us, and we saw that it was huge, like maybe the size of a football field! It flew about the length of itself above us, sometimes faster and ahead (so it was visible to the front in the windshield) and sometimes in back, for several minutes as we continued down the road - dad had speeded up but I don't know how fast. At a certain point it was behind us and then suddenly swooped upward and away in seconds shooting into the sky. We were pretty freaked out. My sisters (2 younger) were with me in the back, but only vaguely remember it. My mom is not too willing to admit it either, because of her religious beliefs.

This was long before the paranormal was widely accepted, and there was no knowledge of this reporting entity. The report that follows is actually two seperate incidents that occurred within a short time of one another, within 1/4 mile of each other on the same farm. As a farmer one must always be aware of the conditions of your farm, and everything on it.  You must stay aware of your field conditions, your water supply, and the condition of your livestock. You also keep an eye turned to the sky for your weather reports.  While checking the fields and livestock one day, my father noticed three large patches of green grass in the northernmost field on our farm. This field was the most secluded part of the farm,sloping down toward the north, away from the nearest roadway over 3/4 of a mile away,and tucked in between huge areas of timber 400 acres to the east and north, and even more meeting it, and wrapping all the way around to the west, stretching on to the south.  The patches of grass were round,smoothly round, not irregular, and roughly 6 feet across.  The patches were in a perfect triangle shape with approximately 15 to 20 feet between circle. At this time of the year in southwest Missouri, after a long hot summer there is no fresh green grass, with most of the field turning quite brown by this time, and having been grazed down short by the cattle, and sheep.   These patches however were dark green and lush, like fresh spring grass,and stood out in sharp contrast with the field around them.  There had been no water available other than rain fall, and this was pasture land so it was never fertilized.  This same phenomenon was seen in this same at slightly different locations on two or three other times in the years before and after this event.  I have no explanation of the cause, but the reports I have been hearing in recent times of the frequent sighting of triagle UFO's struck a chord with me, triggering the memories of these unusual triangles in the grass. The second incident took place in the field immediatly southeast of where the circles were seen slightly later in the same year, in mid October.  When we went to the farm to make our daily stock count, and field check we found what had been one of our sheep.  I say it that way because the sheep, 100-120 lb ewelooked as if it had been hit by a giant lawnmower, or as I used to tell peoplel like she was cut to pieces then dropped from a great height. She was scattered like when you take a hand full of confetti,hold up your hand then suddenly open your hand and let it drop.  This was not an animal attack.  Running a large flock of sheep teaches you the signs of that. Coyotes will attack a single sheep then eat the parts it wants. Dogs run through the flock slashing, and killing as a game often eating nothing. This ewe was very different.  There was no blood at the sight, the skull was completely missing, as were the hooves,and heart with most of the rest just looking like it blew up.  This was a one time thing,with investigations revealing nothing,but there were wide reports of animal mutilations in the region at this time. I report these incidents here due to the proximity to each other, and the fact we had previously had a good  clear UFO sighting over this area, of probably 30+ minutes in duration, and being seen by my extented family, of aunt, uncle, cousins, and grandparents, as well as my immediate family of four.

I cannot explain it, but they were the type of lights that I have never experienced before.  They were so bright and I am amazed that no one saw them (not that I am aware of).  But what frightened me the most was the strange sound.  I wish I could explain the sound, but after twenty-six years, I am still shaken by it.  I ran home as fast as I could, rang the doorbell so that my mom or dad could open the door.  I was way too shaken to use my house key.  Anyway, my father answered and he could tell by my face that I was scared to death.  I told my parents and my dad ran up to our 3rd floor and looked out the window.

Because I used to look at the pics of a mistery book my mom had, I knew what I was looking at, a space ship floating in the distance but close enough to see its light structures. With curiosity I keep observing and notice the object is getting closer to me, infact the whole structure of it is visible; so, neive as I am I wave with a hand to say ""Hi"".

We run back outside after turning on the lights in the house. With  mom, maybe also for turning the lights on, the UFO keeps coming closer a little more, then it slows down its pace until it stops and just floats in the air as if it wants to be admired. It is about 300 yards straight in front of us but slightly higher, we can see its lights, like windows, or engines? After a while ( and to mee it seemed a very long time) it gradually but really slowly (as if it does not want to intimidate us) moves away from us, while we keep admiring towards the right side. It does that until it is not visible anymore for it disappears in the distance behind our building. When it was gone we went back inside and before going back to bed I looked at the clock 2 am, wishing never to forget this event, so I believe it was around that time it occured. The next morning my parents fearing unknown consequences, not knowing whom to contact either, decided not to mention what happened; but after such a long time, with my mom, we decided at least to mention this just to let you have a record of the occurrance, because in our opinion telepathic ability on their part was possible ?

I went out to the edge of the meadow, to where my tent was pitched, to watch the stars for a while before crashing myself...  After a while standing there, I saw a very bright/white saucer-shaped object come flying slowly over the tree line at the East side of the clearing, moving from North to South.  I was facing East, and the Moon was to my rear...  I couldn't really tell how big it was, because there wasn't really anything to judge it by...I couldn't tell how far off it was, only that I saw it over the tree line.

They just started yelling back ""what...what""...and I just kept yelling ""get out here now""...by the time they got out...it had already flown South down below the tree line...so I had them stay out for a while to see if it would take off again...but we didn't see that happen.  It was totally silent...no engine noise or anything...  The object was white...white like a florescent light...with clear/sharp edges.  Curved on top and curved on the bottom, lines meeting at each end to form sharp points.  The next day, I asked the trail crew chief if I should file a report and he said ""no""...so I didn't.

I am not sure of the year or the exact time but I know it was between the time I started driving and graduation so that gives me some time reference. At the time this happened, we were both in high school.  My friend and I were driving around our neighborhood. It was cool out but not so bad. I was riding and I had my window down. As we came to a stop sign near our elementary school, I looked up and saw what I thought was a plane. I said to my friend, ""Damn! That plane is really low!"" She peered out of the front window and said, ""That's no plane!""  Just as she said that, I realized that despite it being very very low (we could see the lights on it) there was no noise. It hovered over the school and then took off to the west at a leisurely pace. It was in no hurry. We followed it with no problem down the road about a mile or two and then made a turn towards town. We could still see it without any trouble. Then, it started to descend into a clump of trees. That area had been a house but the house had been torn down due to it being right near a toxic dumpsite. The area was fenced off but we knew we could get in there if we wanted.  We started to turn up the dirt road/driveway and then we came to our senses. There were no lights from that area, just darkness. We turned around and she hit the gas. We talked about how they probably could hear us now and we both yelled out that we were going home and we weren't going to bug them.  As we squealed into my driveway, we started yelling out the windows for my parents to open up the garage door. When they didn't hear us, we scrambled out of the car and ran screaming up to the front door. We were really spooked by what we had seen and didn't really care that we were not acting like the cool teenagers we were. I knew my mom wouldn't doubt me as she had seen a UFO back in her college days in Nebraska. We told her what happened and then we never spoke of it again.  I remember it like it was just yesterday. It looked like a plane but then I noticed it had no wings. The lights were similar to a plane's ... the red and green but I remember they were really really big and there were three in a line on each side. There was no sound, no noise, no vibration and had it been a plane, there would have been because it was so low. It was shiny but I don't remember it being any color in particular. As it landed, it was going down fast enough that it should have kicked up a lot of dust or a cloud of some kind but it didn't. As it landed, the lights, which had been steady up to then started to ... like blink in a pattern. Red white green down a line. Once it time to land, there was no glow from the area .. just darkness.",2004-08-11T00:00:00,43.2824,-73.6341

I believe it was late spring or early summer in the mid 1980's (possibly 1984-1985). It was shortly after 5:00 p.m. on a bright cloudless evening. The sun was in the west and the sky was still blue. I saw a shiny metallic object about the size of a lower-case ""o"" flying east to west, north of my location. At the time, I was relatively knowledgeable about many different types of aircraft. Brookley Field was and is still an active airport, and there were military airshows held there occasionally. The first thing I noticed was the object appeared to be reflecting the light of the sun, it did not appear to be producing it's own light. There was no contrail. It was travelling steadily due west. I first assumed it was a high-flying airplane. It then, without slowing down, stopped in mid air. I thought it may have been a helocopter, but it was higher in the sky than I had ever seen one before. I moved over to where I could see the object and a tree for purposes of verifying that it had indeed become stationary and to use the tree for a reference point. While I was observing the object, another object appeared to come from the first object. This object was slightly smaller than the first, and it moved off in a southwesterly direction from the first object. It was similar in appearance to the first, shiny metallic in color. it seemed to go from a dead stop to a steady pace with no transition speed noticed. There was no contrail, or smoke behind this object either. I observed this object until it was out of sight to the southwest. The first object then continued on to the west, again going from stopped to its previous speed without any transition. It continued due west until it was out of site.

They were brighter than normal stars I thought so I observed them just because it was cool. Then I noticed they appeared to do a clockwise rotation very quickly around the moon back to there places they were at.

The stars kept doing the same rotation and it was very fast and I know that that is not normal.

The color was degrees of brown colors. I stood up and punched my hand to be sure I wasn't dreaming. After a few minutes the craft began to disappear starting by its front (I mean from the direction it was heading to) just as an eraser was erasing it from the sky. When it was erased completely I went to the street and asked the neighbors about wither they saw it. No one saw it.

I thought little of it since there is an Air Force base near the school and I have seen airplanes fly out of the base under cover of darkness and escorted by quiet helicopters before.  Later on I began asking people who are familiar with military aircraft if they had seen or were aware of the type of aircraft I had seen that night.  They all said no.  The craft were different than anything I had ever seen before in that they seemed to be flying at a speed and height comparable to a regular aircraft when approaching for landing, made absolutely no noise, and had lights which moved around the bottom of each craft in a broken triangular pattern.   The lights were white.  I saw no landing type lights in areas where I would expect wings to be.  I could not see a definite shape to the crafts, only the shape of the lights.

About a min. goes by and then we were thinking maybe it's headlights on a plane but, the (plane) was travling pretty slow. About another min. goes by then, we noticed something really odd as, it was getting closer. The White light seemed to give off a shine to the ships underbelly. It was then when we noticed that the ship was not a helicopter or a plane. It was round just like a saucer. Then the ship stoped. Then White light on the bottom of the ship started to change colors. From a White light to Blue ,then Red, then White again. The light was changin these 3 colors and they were picking up speed. Then from a dead standstill the the ship darted off in an up rightward slanted postion in the sky. It was one of the most amazing things I have even seen in my life. The ship was gone in the blink of an eye..literally. My friend and I were in shock by what we had seen. We discussed the event and realized we had just seen a flying saucer.

It was but 4 years ago, sometime in early June of 2000. Me and the family were packing our camping trailer, because we were headed to South Dakota on a camping trip. Our camper was parked in the backyard of our house. We have a small cludder of trees right behind the house, but nowhere near to blocking my view of a strange object moving against the SE wind in the sky, almost directly above me, as I was standing next to the camper, loading some silverware and misc. items into the camper. As I had finished, I looked up into the sky, searching for any storm clouds, as it was windy that day, yet pretty hot and a bit humid. The weather forcast recently had described several showers in our area, therefore I was searching to see if we were going to get poured on while packing. It was 2:30 or so in the afternoon, and as I was searching the sky, I saw a small circular object, the color of white, moving against the wind. The wind speed was about 10 - 15 mph, heading SE, with sudden strong gusts, which leaded me to guess a cold front was moving in, with the present warm front already in the area. The object was far out into the sky, near the clouds that I had seen. Some of these clouds were rather thin, but a few large cumulonimbus clouds could be seen headed our way, near Big Creek lake. This object was definately not an airplane or satellite, because it moved in strange patterns. It also left a very very faint trail as it made sudden bursts of speed. First, it moved at a steady pace going North, then it would suddenly jerk towards the West. As I watched for 2 minutes, the object seemed to be making strange, sudden movements in the sky, the slowing down  to almost a stop. It almost looked as if it was zig-zagging in the sky, but at incredible speed. Its speed would change dramatically every few seconds. Within 3 minutes of watching this object, a few clouds came by it, and it seemed to do more of its jerky movements, then it slowed down again, only this time whipping around one of the clouds. As the cloud that the strange object had hidden behind passed, the object had dissapeared, and then reappeared just left of its original location. I was so amazed at this, I quickly made my way into the house and got the camera. I came back, and the object was still there, making slow movements, and then sudden jerks in the sky. I took a picture of 2 of it, and had my parents send the film in right away. The strange thing is, I never got these 2 pictures back, as I remember my mom bringing home the set of pictures, and I could not find the snapshots. I was furious. The object was again, circular, white color, and was rather small, as it was far out into the sky, perhaps the same altitude as the clouds. After I had taken a picture of the object, it came to a stop, and then again whipped around another cloud. I waited for it to pass, but as I searched, the object had dissapeared. It never reappeared.

I  was out walking, right at dark.  I was talking with some friends when I looked up to the West and I saw a light coming East.  This light was up very high, looked like a star. I pointed it out to my friends and we watched it. It was going East very fast, and all of a sudden when it got overhead it was going North as fast as it was going East. This light did not turn, just changed directions. When it went North it continued to move around zig zag with the very sharp direction turns. Two more lights came and joined this light. These direction turns continued as the crafts moved around. The first light went NE over Mt. Whitney area, went back and forth a couple of times. The other two stayed over the San Joaquin valley, in the North.  The lights traveled back and forth, then one came South and went SE.  I told my friends to watch the North I was going to watch the one in the South.  The two to the North seemed to be exploring.  The one to the SE went to a point and stopped.  It set there for about a minute and then it excelled in very great speed going straight up.  I  watched and it got to where it was only a pin prick of a light.  It stayed there for a while then all of a sudden it came back down as fast as it had gone up to the level where it had been, and it stayed there for a while.  The two in the North continued moving around and then all of a sudden they came South and the one in the SE joined them and they went South together over the mountains toward the Pacific Ocean - Ventura area - and disappeared.  We never did see them return.  Later at about 22:30, that night, a very bright object fell from the sky in the North, it looked like something very big had entered the atmosphere was burning.  Within a matter of minutes after this some military jets came from the East and circled around.   I am not sure about the date; it was August 15 or 16 and I am sure the year was 2001, I should have written it down. I marked the date in my mind about a week later.

Through the trees, slightly towards the west, where I usually see Venus in the evenings, I saw a bright, yellowish light flickering through the tree branches. I watched for a few seconds trying to determine if it might just be Venus I was seeing and realized that this was something different. I stepped out onto the front porch to get a better look. I had to crouch down to get a view of it without the obstruction of the tree branches. As I watched, the light grew in size and brightness and changed to a ruddy color. (At its largest, it was twice the size of Venus). It then began to drop what looked like blobs of red light toward the ground. It did this for about ten seconds at which time its intensity dwindled down to a pinpoint and the color back towards yellow. After a few seconds it became very bright and red and again rained down several large blobs of red. Another couple of minutes and it winked out completely. The only sounds I heard were from a jet flying over in another part of the sky.  As a veteran of the Army, I've been on night laneuvers where flares were employed to light a battle area. With a flare there is always a crackling sound and smoke while it is deployed. There was neither smoke nor sound with this sighting. Nor was there any excess illumination caused by its presence. I've never seen a flare grown small then large again the way this thing did.  A report from anyone else who saw this or a possible explanation would be welcome.

A lady called me from Prince George, B.C. to report a sighting that she and her mother had. The first witness to the sighting had been laying down with her young son when her Mom came into the room and said she could hear what they thought was a kitten crying just outside their home. So the two ladies went outside to have a look for the crying cat when the porch light suddenly went out.  One of the ladies looked up into the sky and towards the west and noticed a light traveling through the sky heading in their direction which was towards the east. She thought it may have been a satellite or a airplane. But the light was far to low in altitude for it to be a satellite and there was no sound or any flashing lights so she ruled out a plane of some kind.  As the white light approached closer and over top of their home it grew much brighter, extremely bright she said. The object continued it's flight towards the east and at one point the ladies Mother saw another light coming towards the one they were already watching, but the second light was traveling from the north and heading to the south. As both witnesses watched, the lights met up in the night sky and blinked out as they crossed each other's path. The woman told me they just disappeared.  The first light was observed for approx: three minutes and the second light was observed for approx: 1 1/2 minutes before they both vanished. No tail was following behind any of the lights.

As he drove closer, it became apparent that the ""fire"" was not a fire at all, but a large moving object. He came to a crossroad near his home and he stopped and exited his car to get a better look. Upon exiting, he described that the object was moving from the north and toward him. He stated that the ""fire"" which he thought he was seeing turned out to be three huge bubble shaped lights on the bottom of a giant triangular craft, moving straight at his location quite slowly, maybe 40-50 mph and at treetop level. He became afraid and started to run but then realized that there was nowhere to run to.The craft passed directly over him and he stated that the lights which were burning brightly, lit the bottom of the craft and he could plainly see rib-like structures evenly spaced across the object, having the greatest definition along the centerline of the craft. he also stated that the object covered the entire sky and appeared to be several hundred feet wide and also equally long. The craft was described as being highly reflective, metallic. As the craft passed over him, he states that the sound seemed to reverberate through his body, described as a low frequency throbbing hum. The witness also stated that his skin seemed both to be tingling and burning .

Last Saturday (02 Oct 2004) I was at RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) base Amberley watching the model planes before the big guns came out. I saw past a model plane and spotted a clear sphere in the direction of Denmark Hill as viewed from a little north of the old control tower e\west of the main strip. It seemed far away and was traveling east-South East straight and level flight. Its size was 3mm diameter as measured with the fingers at full arms length. Its height was about 20 degree above horizon. Its appearance was of a glass ball in that I could see the complete spherical outline with the left side being slightly brighter. This agrees with where the sun was (not sure of the time as I did not take my watch that day, however the program (I have a copy) states that the model aircraft were on from 10:41am to 11:05am.    Here is more on the actual sequence and timing of my observation:    Spotted it while looking at a model (large model, 1-2 meters across) from a distance of about 50 meters. I stopped following the model (from left to right) and watched it intently for about 5-8 seconds and then I deliberately looked away while closing and rolling my eyes. Looked back; I could not see it straight away: perfectly clear sky;  nothing to focus on anywhere so I strained and then I caught it (10 seconds later) again, now it was smaller and seemed further away and was blending into the blue of the sky. It only dawned on me then that I had my 35mm SLR and a 200mm lens with me so I quickly opened  the bag, fitted the 200mm (took about 15 seconds) looked up and tried and tried to see it again but could not. I raised the camera up and looked through the lens (only slight advantage for the eyes in object size but screens out side light) but to no avail.   What a bummer! If only I had prepared my camera upon arrival I reckon I would have caught it and at a size that would blow up nicely!      My feelings are as follows:  It was not a balloon due to its straight and determined flight path, its speed, and its size which is difficult for me to work out though it gave me the immediate impression that it was large, say 3 plus meters across. This impression was formed due to my experience of observing aircraft at altitude and distance (ex RAAF and keen follower of Air Force displays) and my rather good view over the Amberley area from my street in Sadliers Crossing. It seemed rigid, as if it was a solid globe structure. It did not immediately cause me to think it was unusual as I have seen much in the way of junk flying around in the sky especially paper and plastic bags! It was the fact that it was so straight and purposeful in flight that grabbed my interest.     Logical answers.  Nuh. Can’t think of any.  And I’ll tell you what it reminded me of, early in the peace - that shot of the ball flying across the fields in the crop circles documentary that is available on DVD! Except the object I saw was much clearer than the one as presented on that DVD and traveled dead straight!    That’s it!!!",2004-10-27T00:00:00,,

Oct 2nd. 3:23 - 3:30 pm. St. Louis, MO. Object hoovering in the sky with flashing light. I was walking the dogs with my lady friend when I just by chance glaced up into a clear blue sky when I noticed an object flying from what I would say was the North heading roughly south-southwest. I noticed it due to the massive light source it was putting out. At first I dismissed it as a reflection off a planes hull. I looked up at it again and noticed that the light was still flickering even though it was in motion. I know that when you see a reflection from an aircraft, its really only from that angle. As it continues to move the reflection should change until the craft no longer is at the angle for the light to reflect. As this object continued its path, it was still flickering a very bright light. Originally when I noticed the object, it was to the right of the sun and even after it passed and was now to the left there was still this very bright flashing light. This is the reason why I continued to watch. If it were a reflection from the sun, it would have long since past the point of reflection. Anyway, as I watched the object and since it was so small I would say that is was well above 40,000 feet, but the weird thing was that there was no con trail. I continued to watch it and as I did, it began to slow down. I would say that this object had crossed 2/3's of the sky when it came to a stop!. I could not beleive what I was seeing. My lady friend had seen it moving but continued walking on the trail and didnt see it stop as I had. I tried to find someone who could verify what I was seeing, but the only person around was about 100 yards away and he had his child with him so I didnt want him to think I was some nut. Anyway, I ran with the dog to catch my friend. There was a short distance where I could no longer see the object due to a wooded area. I wanted to catch her so that I would have a witness to the craft stopping in mid air. I caught up to her and had her hurry though the wooded area to the clearing so that we could both see it again and upon arriving at the clearing, I could no longer locate the object. There was still about 1 mile or so of trail that we had to walk and I looked in the sky to rest of the way. I cant help but to think that if I had stayed where I was originally at, I could have seen what happened to the object. I dont know if it just took off on the same course or flew further into the sky or what. I know that this sounds crazy and all, but that is what I saw. This took place at Jefferson Barracks Park in South Saint Louis County. If anyone else has seen anything like this, this past Saturday please respond. thanks for your time. Also when the object was stopped or hoovering or whatever you call it, the light was still flashing in the same manner I first noticed it. this is my first time reporting or even seeing anything that I could not explain away. Please help",2004-10-27T00:00:00,38.62382493417588,-90.30852769878884

Also, it was perfectly quiet.  I went back in, and got my wife to come out too, so she brought our son and 1-year old daughter outside (I had to make sure that I wasn't the only one seeing this).  My wife and 4-year old son saw it too (my wife was pretty awestruck, like I was... my son was just freaked out).  It may have been one of the freakiest things I've seen.  The whole thing, from when I saw it to when it was too far for us to see, probably lasted about 5-10 minutes (I wasn't really watching the time).  Whatever it was passed to the south of us... most likely just to the south edge of Lincoln.  It didn't change direction or anything like that.  Thinking about it, it looked a lot more like flashbulbs in a dark stadium than strobes.  They were flashes of white light, but the certainly didn't strobe from the same place.  There was absolutely no discernible shape or pattern that we could see.  I couldn't say that there was any opacity to it in any way.  With no noise, and no shape... not much of anything remarkable other than so many white flashes of light, and such a large area.  It was very strange to us.

Sighting:  Thursday Evening, September 9, 2004. Very clear sky, stars easily visible, single-engine plans and one helicopter clearly visible during sighting.  I'm a 37-year old (male) design architect that has lived and worked in downtown Kansas City,Missouri for 14 years for the same company.  I live with my wife and 3 year old son near Raytown, Missouri, a 30 minute drive from downtown.  On the evening of September 9th, at approximately 11:30 PM, I was leaving my office to go home.  I park my car in a free-standing parking garage (3 story structure) immediately to the northwest of our office building.  To the west of our office building, in a two block area, is the downtwon Convention Center, Exhibition Center, and Municipal Auditorium.  The Exhibition Center is a prominent feature in the KC skyline with its large suspension structure and four stainless steel ""futurist"" sculptures artifically lit from within and below (refer to attached images).  These art pieces were erected in the mid-1990's to crown the Exhibition Center and symbolize Kansas City's aspirations for a bright and progressive future.  Naturally, working downtown all these years, I tend to take them for granted, but on the referenced evening I happened to look up at them while walking to my car.  I noticed a number of small point-sources of light moving above and behind the main sculpture on the east-most pylon.  At first I thought the light objects were a swarm of bugs attracted to the sculpture lights, but it became clear (even from my vantage point on the ground) that the light objects were too big and solitary to be swarming insects.  I stopped and looked more critically now thinking the lights must be the under-belly of pigeons or some other large birds illuminated by the sculpture's lights as they flew over.  I almost walked away and went home at this point but just before I turned to go I noticed the light objects didn't dim or disappear into the darkness as they moved away from the sculpture's light array.  In fact, some of them got brighter and grew in size as they moved away.  This peaked my interest so I decided to go up to the top level of the parking garage and get a better look.  Sure enough, from this elevated vantage point, I could clearly see as many as ten illuminated objects moving in random patterns what appeared to be directly above the Exhibition sculptures.  I still thought these might be birds so I watched carefully for any unusual behavior.  My first observation was to try and determine if these objects were self-luminous or simply reflecting light from the street or sculptures.  Without question, they clearly demonstrated they were the former.  This became most apparent when some of the objects made hard, angular cuts, they became much brighter and changed color (from a bright white dot to a larger arc of yellow and orange light).  Then the light would diminish and sometimes simply disappear. It's important to note this light behavior occurred over, behind, and away from the sculpture lights.  No obvious connection could be made between a reflective object and the sculpture lights given their changing proximity to the Exhibition Center. In most cases, the light objects were roughly twice as large and bright as any other fixed light in the night sky.  When they cut at sharp angles or accelerated, their light intensity and relative size grew to roughly thre to five times that of any fixed light in the sky.  Because it was such a clear and cool evening, I feel very confident about the accuracy of these comparisons.  In addition to demonstrating self-illumination, I also observed these objects manuever in patterns no normal aircraft (and, frankly, no bird) could possible duplicate.  The objects moved with a mixture of chaotic zig-zags, dips, jumps, straigt-line accelerations, stationary pauses, collision course acrobatics, etc. etc.  This activity was sustained and though apparently random, demonstrated intelligent control.  At one point (around midnight) a single-engine plane, presumably leaving the downtown airport, made a straight line path through the light objects.  At this point, I would estimate six to eight objects moving in the area just over the Exhibition Center.  From my vantage point, the plane appeared to be a few hundred feet lower than the objects (which assumes the objects were a few thousand feet in altitude).  However, it appeared as though the light objects moved farther apart as the plane entered my field of view.  Then, they resumed their dance back over the sculptures.  Several other small planes came through the same area, as did one police helicopter, but the objects didn't adjust their position for these craft.  I literally watched this go on for a solid hour totally amazed by what I was seeing.  Taking their self-illumination, changing illumination, and manueverability, I had to conclude these were not terrestrial-based craft or animals.  Clearly, these weren't ballons, ball lighting, or swamp gas either.  They were something I can't explain.  All I could think was these objects are playing with each other whatever they are.  Like some nutty game of high-speed cat-and-mouse, they looked like kids let out to play.  That's the best description I could come up with.  And more importantly, they decide to play with unabashed clarity over one of the most visible monuments in a populated city.  You couldn't miss them if you tried, they were that close and that visible.  To get a better look, I got in my car and drove a block south to a large surface parking lot that is a bit higher in elevation than the top of the parking garage and less affected by street lights.  I thought this would help me determine the actual position of these objects relative to the Exhibition sculptures.  From this position, I could sse the objects even better.  They were indeed flying directly over and to the west of the Exhibtion Center.  Some of them would dart off in all directions and disappear, only to reappear near where they disappeared.  Others continued this amazing light display during acceleration and hard turning.  I could see the color changes much better from this darker position.  When the objects intensified, they looked like what you see when a rotating steel blade heats up due to friction.  They had a pronounced rim of orange light that lasted a few seconds then they would turn yellow or white and I also noticed a little bit of red.  I could also tell the light pulsated softly as they moved in a linear direction.  I heard no noise from these objects which is odd given how fast they were clearly moving.  On a whim, I grabbed a flashlight from my car and ""signaled"" toward the moving lights.  I don't know Morse Code but I thought if these objects are guided by some intelligence, perhaps they'll see my light and signal back or do something to let me know they see me (foolish, I know).  Seeing a grown man flashing a light in the night sky might give some pause to think I'm nuts, but this was an extraodinary event.  I did this for about 30 more minutes and decided to go home.  The lights were still zigging and zagging as I drove away, still pulsing and blinking out of sight.  It was quite the event, I'll never forget it. ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS)) Peter,  I just confirmed with a really good pair of binoculars that the objects I saw the other night over downtown Kansas City are in fact birds and not unexplainable objects.  I'm terribly sorry for jumping the gun and making a report that turned out to be something so simple and quite natural.  Please disregard my sighting.  I'll be more cautious in the future.

My son got our telescope out to get a better look, the object was definately closer than we first thought, maybe 20-30 miles which I know is very difficult to judge at night. The light continued to change color probably twice a second from red to green to light yellow to light blue and repeated.  The light was stationary in comparison to our deck, the treeline, and the stars for 10 minutes or more, then it began to slowely move to the north and west and was visibly moving in comparison to the surrounding terrain and stars in the sky. We were able to view this for another 10-12 minutes as it moved north west until it was obscured by the neighbors trees. It was about twenty degrees or so above the horizon and was brighter than any surrounding stars in the western sky. The light never pulsed or faded, it remained brightly illuminated but continued to changed color as previously described which is what caught my attention and thought was so odd. I'm a private pilot and airplane owner with close to 500 hours logged in the last two years approximately 50-75 hours at night.  I am familiar with GA and commercial aircraft anti-collision markings at night as viewed from the ground and while in the air.  I have also been on active military duty for the past 18 years and am familiar with military aircraft markings and operations.  I have to say this was deffinately not marked like any civil or military aircraft that I'm aware of to date. I would have placed its location or direction of movement near Brandenburg Kentucky or perhaps slightly to the south west. The weather conditions were clear with a slight haze and no moon. I called Louisville tower watch supervisor to see if they had any aircraft in that direction on radar, they did not.  I also called Godman Flight Operations (Ft. Knox) to see if we had any military activity to the west of post, again the answer was negative, though he did say that the Brandenburg 911 office called the previous week asking the same question due to some calls they recieved from residents complaining of bright lights in the sky. (No further information was available).  I have no idea what we saw, but I know that planets don't remain stationary, brightly change color, then transition across the sky from south to north west against a stationary background. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded quite credible to us.  He is a retired member of the military.  We suspect that he may have been witnessing the very bright star that currently is in the western sky, which gives off a very prominent chromatic display, although that is just a guess.

When we were about 6-7 miles north, of the city, I was looking up in the sky watching for the usual airline traffic from the airport. I used to live in Sioux Falls not too far from the airport and loved watching the planes and am well aware of all types of conventional air craft. The day was clear and sunny with just a few lines of whispy clouds. I was watching one jet fly over, east to west and then another came along also, east to west. A little higher in the sky, I noticed a bright round, white,light like a nickle at arms length and, I am estimating about 60 degrees off the horizon to the south and a little west of the city. It was very bright and appeared to be flashing though, it could have just been the reflection of the sun. At first I thought it was another plane but it didn't appear to be moving and didn't have a contrail as the other planes did. I asked my husband if he saw it and he said he did. It appeared to be moving in and out and above and below the clouds and would fade out from time to time. When the second plane came over, I noticed another light of the same type lower than the second plane and on the same course. It disappeared after about 5-10 seconds, the other one was still visible. I pulled to the side of the road to get a better look and try to get some pictures. It disappeared as we drove on, then, it reappeared and I pulled off onto the off ramp and drove down another highway looking for a gravel road so I could park and watch it. It was still in the same place in the sky and still doing the same things. By the time I had found a gravel road, it appeared to be higher up but still in the same place and barely visible, then it was just gone. I did notice another plane come from the airport, circle around at a lower altitude in the direction of the light but, don't think this pertained to it.",2004-12-03T00:00:00,43.54381423001949,-96.72227173489279

I previously reported seeing objects that appeared to be stars that were low to the ground and when magnified they appear to be some type of energy balls that rotate and pulse and glow like a welding machine. They seem to be motionless to the naked eye but on video can be observed to slowly arc upwards over time. I also have seen strange vehicles which could be normally explained as some type of airplane. Last night I saw one of these orange hovering balls over some nearby houses and when I stopped the car to film it dropped to the ground like a spider on a web. Then when it saw I wasn't leaving it rose up and started flying slowly away. Anyone else would have said it was just a plane but when I zoomed up on it you can clearly see that it is 3-4 of these little welding balls traveling together not in formation but as one unit seemingly fused together electromagnetically or something. It is beyond all of my comprehension of how this is possible. But in slow motion you can clearly see them individually but moving as one. And kind of pulling at each other as they go. This craft moved away from me just above the horizon until it vanished from view. As I drove away I could see it (light up) again and start circling back to where it had started from. In the 2 inch video window of my camcorder all you could see was a light but on the TV screen at home it is plain to see and as it vanished it seemed as if the spheres broke apart and went in different directions. As I drove along I could see these things almost everywhere. Noone seems to believe me even with the video and laugh it off telling me to watch out or I will get a probing. It is alarming to say the least and it is just like what people had said they had seen but had no proof. I have the proof that the ""Truth is Out There"" as they say on the X-Files.

At approximately one AM, as we sat on the beach with a third individual, we saw what we believed to be a satellite moving from southeast to northwest in the sky.  In the dark skies away from Ukrainian cities, satellites can easily be seen tracking across the sky.  This appeared similar in color and in speed as it crossed the sky, until it began doing 90 degree zig zags and altering its speed several times, occasionally coming to a near stop.  It had to have been very high or very far away, but it was obviously very fast and very mysterious.  This incident was witnessed by me and two Ukrainian friends/acquaintances.

While observing an unusually strong display of aurora borealis I noticed an object traveling from east to west approximately 45 degrees above the northern horizon. This object traveled across approximately 90 degrees of visible sky before I lost it behind ground clutter. The best description I can give would be a plastic coat hanger with the hook at the top removed, leaving a flattened triangle with rounded corners. It appeared to be either clear like acrylic with many small lights inside, or perhaps a light gray that matched the background sky color with a highly reflective surface in which case the many small lights may have been reflections of ground lights. I have been an aviation buff for most of my life and this was no aircraft I have ever seen. While the shape was reminiscient of a hanglider there was no ""swooping motion"" typical of ""kites"". Since there was no sound it couldn't have been an ultralight either,they use very noisy small engines and this was silent. The movement was straight and level so must have been powered flight. the size at arm length appeared to be about three inches wingtip to wingtip and about one inch nose to tail. While I can't say the exact distance from me I have the impression this was about the size of a small private aircraft which would give it an altitude of a few hundred feet, certainly low enough to hear engines or see someone hanging below a hanglider. Speed would be hard to estimate, but it only took five or six seconds to cross my line of sight, much faster than any private plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

From my position driving my truck down the highway-the commercial aircraft and object were approx 45-50 degrees above the horizon and my estimations were that the object was at the same altitude as the commercial aircraft, approx 1000- 2000 ft behind it( less than a mile) The 2nd objects speed and distance remained constant for the duration. There was no vapor trail behind the 2nd object, and the commercial aircraft did emmit a vapor trial 3-5 miles long.  As they proceeded westbound the reflections changed slightly  - and I was left with the impression the object was much smaller than the commercial aircraft and was spherical in shape.   Eventually as they proceeded westbound they dropped below my feild of view ( Large hill just west of Calgary ) I have a 25 year background in aviation including over 5000 hrs of flying and found it very odd to have two aircraft flying formation and to have only one emitting a vapor trail at such altitudes. My hobbies include astronomy and following the USA Space Programs and I am familiar with Planets-satilites- the Space Station -Shuttle re-entry  and most things which we see in the sky.  This was something very different than I had observed before. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-04-27T00:00:00,51.04237871352785,-114.05744246242263

I was a clear delta or Chevron shape that was a deep black in color.   It was extremely small in size, perhaps no larger than a small car. I watched this object buzz across the valley and then make a turn back around and head back over the valley.   It circled again and then took off at a tremendous rate of speed, much faster than any other object that I have ever witnessed.   At this point, I realized that I had seen something that is quite unusual. Part of me believes that this object could be some sort of drone that is used for the security of our VP Dick Chaney who has a house in the area.   The only thing that would make me waver from this conclusion is the rate of speed of the object.

This place, later would also be used as one of the Olympic event sites. My siting occured almost directly across from what is now the Trapper's Loop by-way across the back of Mount Ogden. The road ends in a tee onto the main highway and there is a campground almost directly across the road from where Trapper's Loop comes down off the mountain. We were camping at this camp- site as we had for about 5 years as my ex-wife's Grandma lived just down Ogden Canyon from our yearly campsite. My ex-wife's mother, her husband, my sister-in-law and my ex and I would go up to this campground so they could go and visit Grandma more easily. At the time my ex-wife and I lived in Farmington, Utah and it just made things more simple to go camping so the women would have acess to Grandma. At approximately 1:30 pm on the afternoon of August 15, 1986 while sunbathing, I offered to go to our campsite to fetch something cold to drink. Where we were swimming was a converted boat ramp. Converted to swimming while Fish and Game had moved the boat launch down the shore a little way because of increased use by swimmers. The launch had origianlly been carved out of the bluff / canyon that Pineview Lake was claimed from. So, the ramp did about a 130' semicircle down to the lake, with the campground up above about 20 to 30 feet. As i was going up this old launch ramp, back to get sodas, my head had just cleared the depression of the ramp and I could look out into the campground and across the highway to the foothills. These foothills are farms mostly, and grazing land that then just continue up as part of the backside of the Wasatch Range east of Ogden, Utah. Anyone familiar with northern Utah would know immediately where I am talking about, as Pineview Reservour is a major play place for fishing and boating. At any rate, as I was looking into the coumpground and across to the hills, which are no more than 250 yards away, I heard an explosion. Like to when a farmer is blowing stumps. And so thinking I had heard a farmer blowing stumps looked closely at the hills to see if I could spot  any flying dust and wood in the air. I was convinced it was a farmer blowing stumps. As I scanned the hill directly across the street a cigar shaped craft approxiately 100 feet long and possibly 30 feet thick,  that looked as burnished silver, but intensely bright even in the full August afternoon sunlight that Utah has at that time of summer, was just leaving the creast of the hill I was looking at. This object just seemed to appear in the sound. I was absouletly stunned. I said to myself, Oh my God there it is. I watched the craft glide perfectly silent, out over the valley floor no more than 500 feet away from me as it headed in an east direction toward the Trappist Abbey and towards Evanston Wyoming over the mountains east of the campground. About 5 minutes agfter spotting the object which was moving slower than any flying craft should be able too, I heard another very large boom and the craft seemed to shimmer, like when one sees a heat mirage. All around it the air moved like that and it picked up speed. Then it started to fly about as fast as a conventional helicopter, still headed due east. About 2 or 3 minutes later this object seemed to stretch out to basically over the horizon, like Star Trek's going to warp. It actually looked like a rubber band strtched out forever and in a huge explosive boom, this thing was gone. Booooom! Gone! Just like that. The perfection of the object is what struck me at the time. It was very litteraly, beautiful. The metal glowed without flaring sunlight off it's shell. I was in nuclear weapons during the cold war from 1971 through 1974 in Europe so this daylight event I have described was not and I mean not, the first time I had had daylight sightings. It was not the last sighting either. I have two sons who became avid skywatchers, also. it is truly interesting, Peter, that when people take the time to look at the sky, they will witness something inexplicable. Peter, I now live in Aberdeen and would like to help in your quest for disclosure and knowlege. I hope you sense that I am no crack pot and it has taken me many years to report this one event.  I have listened to you on the radio for years and have wondered if you could or if you actually would accept an offer of genuine concern and interest. I don't even know if you will see this report or if you want assistance. I have better things to do than have my motives questioned. So, if you need some certain help, I offer this to your endevour.

About 1/4 of a mile east of Las Virgenes road (heading east on Mulholland highway) I noticed a red light in the sky south of the road. This light stayed far away from me but kept pace for awhile. The light then very quickly shot north from where it had been and stopped directly over me and at the same time my motorcycle engine died causing my motorcycle to stop. It happened so quick that I remember looking up and noticed a ring of red lights glowing and absolutely no noise at all. I also noticed that whatever I was looking at blotted out the stars and was very large. I estimate that it was about maybe eight stories above me. I also remember kicking the engine over on my motorcycle but it would not start. The object stayed above me for awhile and then still making absolutely no noise shot straight up into the sky getting smaller and smaller until it disappeared. As soon as the object was gone my motorcycle started when kicked over and I continued home. I have not told many people about this incident and to this day am not sure what I saw.,2004-12-14T00:00:00,34.11886554621849,-118.67330336134454

I had taken the dog outside, I stayed on the second floor deck, and looked at the sky. It was overcast, the kind that gives off a daylight glow. The small craft came over, just above the tree line.

On are around Saturday October 15, 1993, as I was sitting in my living room talking to my dad, I happened to turn and look out the front door toward the west. It was approximately 3:30 pm in the afternoon on a beautifully clear fall day, I happened to notice what appeared to be a black object moving toward the north at a speed I would guess to be from the distance from where we were to be about 100 mph. It appeared to be about 500 feet above the ground. I quickly ran out the front door to get a better look, as my dad followed behind me. As we viewed the object from the street to get a better view, I shouted back to my wife to bring my binoculars out. When we arrive on the street, the object had almost slowed it's forward motion to a stop, and started a slow but steady upward motion to the south / southeast, but a more stright up motion than anything. As we were viewing this object, another object came across moving in the same northerly direction, about the same speed, but this one did not slow down or change direction. The objects appeared to be black in color, and from what I could see, ( as the objects appeared to be about a mile to a mile and a half from where we were ), each looked to be like two very big "" black donuts "" overlaping each other with something attached inbetween. They made no noise. The had no lights. The color was more than black, it was like the absents matter. My father and I viewed this one object through my binoculars until it accended out of sight, as a small black dot thousands of feet toward the Gulf of Mexico which is about 50 miles from our hometown. The rest of the story..... I call the Regional airport in Lake Charles, (a larger town just east of Sulphur) and ask to speak to someone in the control tower. Well to make a long story short, I was told that you could not talk to them, and So I then asked the person who had taken my call if he could ask them if they had spotted anything unusual on their radar. He called back to inform me that "" even if they had, they could not tell me ""!!! But,they did give me a UFO hotline number to call. Well, I  called  and got a recording to leave information...which I did. I never received a return call on this. I guess in all, the most disturbing thing about this to me was the fact that it seemed that my dad, wife and my mother and I were the only ones that saw this that afternoon. The people that I told about it acted like "" yea sure...."" ???  Since then, I have been very selective with who I share this story with. NUTS right ??  My dad nor myself use alcohol or smoke. My dad is in his seventys and I in my fiftys. At the time I saw these, I guess one of my real concerns was that these could be some kind of remote controlled bombs floated in from the Gulf of Mexico, as we do live in an area with oil refineies and other plants. Of course, this took place before 911 in New York City and the government was not as alert as they are now.

Did you see it? I don't know the exact date or year for this, I apologize, it has been about 10 or 11 years as of this posting.  My husband went outside with the dog & saw a craft in the near distance. There were several lights that shot out of it in a loop form & then they were gone. He came inside to get me, by the time we got back out there it was VERY strange. This is around 3AM & we saw the lights that shot out just as they returned & seemed to go back in the ship. They moved VERY fast. The clouds slowly rolled back & opened up as the large craft came closer passing over Casey's. The large craft had no lights at all, it was totally dark, like blacker than black. The sky was a deep red (like a sunset)but the clouds themselves were stilldark. The craft seemed to stop & hover over the area on the other side of 58 from SkyVue (at that time it was all field there, now there is a duplex/4 plex housing). It came in so slow, you would have thought it was going to fall out of the sky. It did make a very slight sound while hovering, but I can't really describe it. It wasn't a hum. but it was very quiet & ONLY made noise while it hovered. We just stood there watching, didn't really say anthing to each other, I think our brains didn't know what to think. But it sure wasn't the way we would have ever expected to react. It was almost like we were frozen in that moment of time. When the craft left, it moved as slowly as it did comming in, traveling E-NE. And the clouds seemed to roll back into place behind it returning to a normal 3AM night sky darkness. As it floated off (it went so slow it was like what I would expect out of a floating object, not a flying one) it went right over 58. But as soon as it was behind our house & out of our view, we silently & slowly walked back into the house, sat down & basically just sat there saying nothing, as if we weren't supposed to talk about it or just didn't know what to say maybe. Which to this day is very strange for us, seeing a UFO is something we would have expected to talk about between ourselves for years, until this actual sighting occured. After this sighting, I spent a couple weeks being unable to sleep. I would fall asleep ok, but every night around the same time of the sighting, I would be woke up by a VERY bright white light through the bedroom window. And when I awoke, it was like I had been awake for hours & had just sat up, vs. wakeing up.  My husband is retired military, we know what a stealth is & this WASN'T a stealth. Yes the military base was still open back then, but this WASN'T from there & they had no air traffic during this night. And the lights that came out of it & went back in were a combo of changing colors. But we are sure they were ships too, because the moved with purpose. We never talked about it much, every time we started to we felt as if we were in a extreamly mellow state....sorry very hard to explain the feeling.  Many years later they came out with Independence Day with Will Smith. The way the clouds roll back in the movie is exactly what we saw...we instantly looked at each other in disbelief. But still said nothing, it's like some major secret to us but we don't know why. This is the first we have said of this night & I still feel like I'm saying something I shouldn't. But typing feels different than speaking about it.  If anyone else has possibly seen this that night we would like to know...PLEASE post it we beg of you. The town just seemed so dead that night. No house lights on inside or out & not one single car on the road. Granted Raymore is quiet at night, but the quietness & darkness was very ""A"" typical.

We kept watching it as we drove and it seemed to get brighter at its core. When we were able to we pulled off to the side of the highway. There were two other cars pulled over as well watching the green mass. We got out of the car and joined the small group of 7 other observers. The green mass had formed into a gian white brilliant ball of light. It remained as a single ball for about a minute and then suddenly two smaller balls emerged from it. One on either side of the larger ball. The two balls returned into the large one and then four balls came out, this time two on either side then they too retracted. Next three on either side came out and then went in. This pattern repeated until there were 8 balls on either side of the large ball. Then it started the pattern again but in reverse going backwards from 8 to 1. Once it completed that it started all over again. When the eight balls were on either side of the larger ball (for a total of 17 balls of light) it spread across the entire visible horizon. It repeated this pattern for about (or what seemed like) 25 minutes. My friend made a comment about how it was amazing to see but getting boring with all the little balls going in and out.

As for the sighting goes. About ten of my closest friends and myself were at my house having a barbecue. It was a summer night and hot down here in Brownsville, Texas around 9:30pm. Well we all had finished eating and were sitting around having a nice conversation when my friends girlfriend yells out, ""Hey, look, a shooting star"". Everyone looked up to see what looked like a regular really bright star. This supposed star was traveling at a constant slow speed, in what looked to be an East to West direction. We all started talking about it and debating whether it was a falling star because it had no burn trail whatsoever. Still staring at this object, we all pretty much concluded that it must be a satellite because of the constant slow speed, perfectly straight flight path and never burnt out like a falling star usually does. A couple of friends got bored of seeing this object and looked down at each other to continue talking, while the rest and myself stayed staring at this thing. In one split fraction of a second this object Zoomed the opposite (180 deg.) direction from what now was a West to East direction at enormous length of space in just, like I said, A split second. We all were in awe. The ones that stayed staring including myself let out this ""Whoa"" sound grabbing the attention of the other friends that had turned away. Suddenly this ""star looking"" obect started making these incredibly, incredibly fast zig-ziag maneuvers. At this point, all ten witnesses were now watching. We all looked at each in amazement. I can not emphasize on how fast this object was. I'm talk about 90 degree turns, among other angles, zig-zags and zooming the opposite directions in a fraction of a second then haulting at such abrupt stop. I still get excited right now just typing this out. It was such an amazing experience. Then all of a sudden this, now through our eyes we had labeled it a UFO, shot straight up towards space and disappeared. There is NO WAY! on earth a human can withstand such sonic speeds then coming to such abrupt stops...NO WAY! Just as soon as this UFO disappeared, it reaappeared at a different location of the sky. It started flying the different zig-zag patterns again, then shot back up then reappear. It continued this pattern for the length of which was fifteen minutes. You know, it was weird, but it was as if it knew that we were watching and was taunting us. It then shot again straight up toward space and never reappeared again. The best part of this entire experience is that we are very good friends and we all saw the UFO and there is no denying it. Oh.....one more thing. Two of my friends out of the group of ten that witnessed this UFO had the same experience a year before at another friend's outdoor wedding reception. The only thing that I regret was that were weren't prepared with a camera or video camera. That's ok though cause several of us saw it.

As a young boy in Ohio, on a clear summer day, I was standing in our front yard and my mother and grandmother were talking. I looked up to the south. From my position you could see about 50 yards across a vacant lot, then a raised railroad track, which blocked any other houses or sceenery. What I saw very clearly, just beyond the tracks and about, 200-300 feet high, was a huge craft, floating silently and slowly from west to east. This craft was about 80-100 yards long and 30 yards wide with 6 spheres connected by smaller cylinders. A sphere at each corner of the rectangle and a sphere in the middle of each longer side, all white to silver in color. I was amazed but not scared. I really had no idea of UFO's at that time. I pointed and looked back to my mother. I looked again and it was still moving across the sky. I looked back to my mother and grandmother to get their attention but they were having a serious conversation and did not acknowledge me. I looked back to the object and it was already fading out, and I watched as it simply dissappeared. I looked back and forth to mom and the sky and I didn't really know what to do. I don't know why I didn't shout out, I felt a bit paralyzed or mesmerized. What I do know is from that day on I started acting very much more mature, and became disinterested in kid stuff, and grew to have a 160 I.Q. and seem to have an amazing grasp of the inner workings of the world. I'm not saying that was even a result of this encounter, but something changed that day. I never talked about the sighting until years later with friends. And many years later I saw a craft with this same design in some science fiction movie, the name I don't know. The point being, I have drawings I made of the craft from 30 years ago, long before I could have possibly seen this design, and it begs the question did the movie's designer, accidentally design my craft, or have others seen this and made reports of it that could have been copied. I will include a drawing if possible. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))",2004-06-18T00:00:00,,

My job was to be the ships eye's ( very boring really )I had just pored myself a cup of coffee and lite a cigarette and picked up a pair of binoculars as I headed out on to the deck of the bridge, I walked to the edge of the bridge and looked over the 4' steel railing down towards the flight deck all was quiet, no movement. then I thought to myself boy I can see all the way down to the bow of the ship ! sure is bright out tonight, I turned and looked up to see a 3/4 moon...nice nite! I leaned against the railing and set my coffee down and begain to scan the horizion from port to starboard, ( no waves, just flat smooth water as far as the eye can see) At that elevation of almost 180' off the water viewing distance is about 20 miles on a clear night. As I look from starboard back to port along the horizion line, out I would have to guess at about 8 miles was what looked like the reflection of the moon on the water but it looked kinda funny, so i pick up the binoculars and focused in on it. what I saw was what appeared to be a bright light but under the water! I then walked over to the ships squak box(inter ship radio)hit the switch, leaned in and said ..Con sigs ! a second later a voice cracked back Con I, I said Con I have a contact baring 210 off the port beam, can you confirm ? The voice said stand by sigs. sigs..Con ! I said Sigs I Sigs we have negative sonar contact ..do you have visual? my reply was afirmitive Con I have visual! The reply was stand-by Sigs ! I turned picked up my coffee and heard footsteps behind me from the ladder leading up from the bridge. Within 10 minutes, I had the captian,the XO, the flight boss and what had to be 8 or 10 officers from IOIC ( ships Intel.) All on my bridge. For the next 20 minutes we all watched as this thing moved back and forth across the bow of the ship at what had to be from 60 up to over 100 miles an hour cutting a zig zag pattern back and forth in front of the ship all this under water! at one point it stopped directly in our path and allowed us to come within about 4 miles of it. Suddenly it pulled away like we were parked and disapeared into the depths. Standing in the background behind all these officers I kinda felt out of place, so I retreated to the signal shack sat down at the desk and begain to fill out my log on the preseding events. Just as I was finishing up my report,a Lt.stepped into the doorway of the compartment and said the XO would like to see you.. and bring your log ! As I followed him down the ladder I was thinking I'm in trouble for something! He opened the door to the captains quarters and in the room were no less then 6 officers. The look on there faces was not good. The first to speak was a comander I did not recognize. his words seemed funny to me in the context of what had just happened. He said ...What do you think you saw this evening ? my responce was.. I have no Idea sir ! He said.. Well these events are currently under investigation by the navy and you are hear-by ordered not to speak of these events to anyone, not to your section chief, your division leaders not even to your buddies.. do you understand ? I said what events sir ?.... He looked at me with a very serious look and said ..very well you may leave your log on the desk on the way out, your dismissed I said.. yes sir! turned and stepped out into the hallway as the door closed behind me. I took two or three steps stopped and put my back to the wall and just slid to the deck. A Lt. stepped out of the room and I jumped to attention and stood there in front of him, he said all inquiries concerning your log are to be fowarded to the XO's office , Is that understood ! Yes Sir ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  We have spoken with the witness, and he seems to us to be quite credible.

I saw a light through the trees to my right(north) and stopped on the Harpeth River Bridge. This is a rural area and back then there was almost no other traffic. It was night time. I'm really unclear as to the month or day of the month, but there were no leaves on the trees and it was warm because I was in a convertible Corvette with the top down. I turned off my headlights and walked to the guard rail and focused on the light which I had seen through the trees. I was looking northeast and saw that the light was a crisply defined, pure white globe about 30 feet above the river and moving at south west toward me and following the course of the river. It was moving at a speed of less than 5 mph and less than 100 feet from me. I could have thrown a rock and hit it. It was only about 4 feet in diameter. I knew right away that this was not a naturally occurring phenomena, but was an object made by some being. I assumed immediatetly I was in the presence of an alien craft. I stood there and decided to raise my right hand and WAVED! at it with a goofy smile on my face. It came a few feet closer to me and then changed direction and headed to the northwest away from me, lifted over the line of trees 300 feet from me, and  went back down behind them and I was no longer able to see it. I will always believe it changed direction because whatever very small entity inside it saw me standing there on the bridge with my hand in the air. I guess I am one of a small number who suprised a UFO. I drove around the area the rest of the night, but saw no more of the object and never reported it, but I think about it often as it changed my life. No one will ever convince me that I did not see something from another world or another time. Whatever it was, it was very interested in the river itself as it was following the course of the river exactly until it saw me. This is an area that was inhabited by prehistoric indians and ! there are 3 indian mounds south of the bridge within sight of the location so I have wondered over the years if the pilot of the craft was doing a little historical research, but of course I have no way of knowing. It made no sound whatsoever and there was no wavering in its movement. It moved as steadily as if it was on a track and never changed its speed at all. What struck me the most was that it was moving toward me and then instantly away from me with no change in speed. I forgot to mention that it was as bright as a street light and the light was coming from within the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

While observing the planet Jupiter through a telescope that night, I noticed a very tiny pink dot twinkling right next to the planet.   My sister-in-law was visiting and we were out in the back yard checking out the planets and stars.  I told her to look at that little ""star"" next to Jupiter.  It had not been there on my last turn to look through the scope. We took turns observing it when all of a sudden it started moving and I exclaimed,  ""It's not a star, it's moving.  It must be a plane but I have never seen a plane that high up in the sky.""   She took her turn to look and the thing was moving fast.    We shortly could see it quite clearly without the scope and we stood out in the yard with our heads up to the sky watching this thing zoom through the sky.  Some of my neighbors noticed this and heard us and came out to see what the commotion was all about.  It kept getting bigger and bigger and came right over my house and hovered.  It never made a sound but it was huge. I had a 4-bedroom ranch house and the thing was as big as the house.  We all stood there awestruck, no one saying a word, when I finally said ""what the hell is it""?   One of my neighbors was an older man and he said, ""I was in the Coast Guard for 25 years and all I know is it's nothing of ours."" \ I ran into the house and called information to get the number to Scott Air Force Base.  I called them and a man answered.  I told him everything. I asked him if anyone else had reported this and he said ""Hey, lady. What are you drinking""?   I told him I wasn't drinking, that there were 6 other people besides myself who were with me and I didn't care if he believed me or not.  He said, ""Calm down, lady, calm down.  We have had lots of reports tonight but we don't know what it is. We're checking it out.  There is nothing from Scott Air Base that fits that description.""   He then proceeded to take my name, address, phone #, etc. and said that someone would be contacting me.  No one ever did call or contact me in any way.  I slammed down the phone and ran back outside to join the others.  The thing was still there.  It was huge, had a domed top and windows (I guess) all around because we could see light coming from the inside.  It looked metallic against the night sky.  It just sat there hovering, not making a sound and finally started to move slowly away and then instantly (like woosh) shot off and disappeared.  After it was over we just milled around, talking.   We were just shocked.  It was an awesome, unforgettable experience.  I have asked myself a thousand times why no one thought to go get a camera.  To tell you the truth, I didn't even think about a camera that night. I don't think anyone else did either. We all just stood staring at that thing and there wasn't a sound out of anyone until I wondered out loud, ""what the hell is it?""

My energy was especially intense so it seemed like the mountain top was a good place to go to campout, meditate and relax. The weather was beautiful and there was not a cloud in the sky. A handful of early arrivals and people who lived there gathered on the porch of the main house by the trees. We played music and sang as the sun set and the stars began to appear. Then something happened that was the most unusual thing that I have ever seen. A phenomenal bright light appeared over the tree tops between the garden and the house.  Amazed and curious, I walked out from under the porch and trees to get a better look. ""Look at that light!"" I exclaimed to the others as they began to notice it too. It was awesome!  We found ourselves looking at a huge, round, pure, white light as big as a mansion, hovering over the retreat.  One of the men who lived there grew afraid and went into his house.  I was feeling so euphoric that nothing could have frightened me. The rest of us watched silently or whispered comments to each other.  There were no other sounds; no breeze; nothing but the white light against a dark sky. I made it a point to remember this moment in every detail. At first the light was very close, just above the tree tops, but gradually it began to expand and move up and across the horizon toward the west.  I could see was no spacecraft. It was just ‘light’ which began to fade in brilliance as it expanded.  Gradually the ‘light’ individuated.  Where once was a solid ‘light’, millions of individual ‘lights’ became distinct. They covered a full quarter of the sky. The lights got farther and farther away until they faded out of sight. Aside from a few comments by the others who were watching, there were no other sounds. Neither the sound of a breeze blowing across the sky nor the rustling of leaves could be heard, for there was no wind. I saw no clouds in the sky and the moon was not yet up. I was now so dark out I had to use my flashlight in order to find my way to my sleeping bag.  I would like to hear from the others who saw it with me.

I recently came across this photograph again and scanned it in to my computer, something I did not own when I first arrived in Gilroy; enlarging it for a better view I was intrigued by what I was looking at particularly the straight angular bar at the bottom. I believed that there was a seperation between the two objects in the photo but on showing it to a couple of friends they suggested it was connected, the blue in the middle was the sky reflecting on to what must be a very shiny side of the object. All the more intriguing, as this was not what I had taken a picture of. I had been working in my kitchen when from outside a white flash caught the corner of my eye turning to see what it was I noticed what I at first thought was a white plastic bag that the sun was giving a brightness to as it was being carried by the wind. There was no wind this is July/ August in Gilroy Calfornia, as I stood watching trying to figure out what it could be this brilliant white object hovered for a few seconds maybe as long as thirty seconds at times then it would all of a sudden be in a different place in the sky, skipping in zig-zag fashion extremely fast, impossible for anything I had previously believed could travel at such a rate. It would be in one position then literally in a flash a position distant to its original. I watched this erratic zig-zaging and hovering for maybe six minutes. The object seemed to be getting closer as it appeared to be getting a little larger each time. I ran to get my camera, returning the object was closer and larger that any time previous and just hovering. I quickly aimed my camera and hoped I had captured something the object simultaneously disappeared. As you can see there was no no expanse of brilliant white light but the object you see.

I was about an hour or so from reaching moosejaw. With me was my mother, and two sisters. In the distance ahead, I could see what looked to be a fog or smoke. I asked my mother if she could see it as well, and she to saw it. I thought that It may be smoke from a brush fire. As the car entered the smoke, or fog, I noticed that there was no smell to it at all. I found that to be very strange. If It was smoke, you would have smelled it. All of sudden on the the left hand side of the road, in the ditch area, appeared what looked to a spinning fireball. The center of the ball was a darkish orange, the outer part of it was like a lighter orange, almost yellow. All of us seen it, and were very shocked by it's quick appearance. I was not to sure what to think about it. But my thoughts of wonder, soon turned to fear, when I noticed the ball was about two feet above the brush in the ditch. So including the depth of the ditch, this ball was hovering about six feet off the ground. There was no fire, just a hovering bright ball, letting off a myst of some sort. It wasn't a hard decision, to step on the gas, and get away from that area as quickly as possible. If that wasn't strange enough, what happened afterwards was beyond crazy. We had cleared the haze, or myst, what ever it was. In the distance behind me, I could see in my rear view mirror, two head lights. I remember thinking to myself, did they see what we just saw? The next thing I knew, the headlights were right at the back of the car. I thought again to myself, this guy is movin. So i moved as far to the right as I possibly could, to let him pass. Along side of my car, came a black semi trailer. No markings, with blacked out windows. This truck pulled in front of the car, and reduced it's speed so quickly, I had to slam on my breaks. I though maybe he had experianced some problems or something. So I went to pass him. he swerved right into the lane I was going to make the pass in, almost hitting the front of my car. When I reduced my speed and went back into the right hand lane, the truck did the exact same thing. Out of no where, from the top of the trailer, two lights appeared, they looked like what may be dock lights, that a semi driver may use to back into a bay. They were bright, and hurt the eyes. Then from the top and sides of the trailer, a unknown substance was being released towards the car. I remember not being able to see, and almost bringing the car to a complete stop. The substance cleared, and to my surprise, the trailer was right in front of me, with no more bright lights. I remember switching lanes, and speeding as fast as I could past the truck. I looked in the mirror, and saw the headlights behind me. When I took a second glance back. They were gone. We soon after pulled into the truck stop in Moosejaw. I remember getting out of the car, and waiting for the semi to come up the highway, it never did show. As I said at the start, we were an hour or so out of Moosejaw when this happened. When I looked at my watch in the truck stop, nearly four hours had passed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-08-11T00:00:00,50.44846994609164,-104.61783369272237

Anyway, I left work in Midtown Atlanta and as I approached my truck I looked up at the sky, hoping it would clear by night and noticed in a clear area first 3 objects that were stationary in a triangle formation and then a 4th object that was nearby them and to the south of the three. I saw these objects as I was facing the west and they were to the NE of me, pretty high up. They where all alike, silver spheres and intially were stationary. They looked like many of the objects in home movies objects seen in Mexico. I framed them against a tall building to see if they were moving and they were not. The wind was moving the clouds at a pretty good rate so I didn't think they were ballons. They seemed above the clouds. Then, one by one, they slowly moved to the south. As they started moving and with all the cloud cover, I lost them pretty quickly. I wished I had a pair of binoculars and the next week I put a pair in the truck. The next week, looking for the objects as I was heading to the parking lot, I saw a similar object that with the naked eye looked like a silver sphere. It was lower and moving faster then the first objects that had seemed to almost drift. Through the binoculars it looked like it had a small red tail. The only thing I could think of is that it was a helicopter. But the original group seemed too high for helicopters unless they have pressurized cabins. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was sitting in my front room by a south-facing window a little before 9:30.  I was alone as it was a Wednesday and my wife was with her quilting group.   A bright greenish object streaked into view moving south and was visible for a few seconds until it disappeared over the horizon to the south.  The object had the appearance of re-entering space debris from my location.  The speed was constant and the direction of travel never changed from my vantage point.  I assumed it was a rocket booster or satellite burning up in the atmosphere, as it resembled a re-entering Russian booster I had witnessed some years previous.  I mentioned the object to my wife, and the next day heard reports that it was space junk and dismissed the sighting as such.	   I later attended a talk by Peter Davenport and he asked me to file this report, with the best possible recreation of directions and elevations for his records.  In doing so, I wish to state again that from my perspective, I observed no unusual behavior of the object and I remain somewhat skeptical of claims that these sightings are anything other than events easily explained by familiar events.  At the same time, if I can in any way clarify an event with hard data I am more than willing to contribute.  What follows is the data to the best of my recollection.  Directions and elevations were measured with as Brunton pocket transit, a $200 compass that I used as a geologist. At the time, I was a HS physics/chemistry/astronomy teacher.  Because the location of viewing obstructions in the house is fixed, I feel that the angles and directions are good to within plus or minus 10 degrees.  I wished that I had used the compass that night when all was fresh in my memory, but I feel good about the numbers that follow. Apparent direction:  due south. Bearing when first seen:  145 degrees true. Elevation when first seen:  30 degrees  Bearing when last seen: 180 degrees true. Elevation when last seen:  0 degrees (at horizon) . Speed seemed slower than a meteor and there was a width to the trail.  It was not just a narrow streak.  I stepped outside and listened for a few minutes afterwards and no sound was heard. Hope this is of some help in piecing together this story.  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and confirm that his credentials, as described above, are correct.

Coming out of the forest I glanced back and saw that white light above the trees, moving quickly to the right and holding it's position there, rising as we moved further away.  The weekend after that my ""No, dude, what the hell IS that"" friend held a party, so another friend who was with us and I went down that road at dusk to see if anything truly WAS there.  Nothing.

I am slow in reporting this, but after seeing the info concerning the objects(spheres of light)sighted in Mexico, I felt compelled to write about what I had witnessed. The night/early morning of my sighting was the night we invaded Iraq. I had been on the computer most of the night talking with friends and following links about what was happening world wide. I was upset about the war,and at about 1:30 I finally turned the computer off and walked out onto my back deck, which faces directly South. As I stood there breathing in the cool night air, I was looking up at the sky, just thinking about the war and such. Over to my right,Southwest, at about 50 degrees, I saw a trail(pieces)of fire shooting off to my right into the night sky. My first thought, someone is shooting off a flare of some sort? (I live in the country miles from town and city lights)...then directly in front of me 90 degrees, between two large leafless oak trees, Two side by side orbs or spheres of light came on...they just seemed to turn on....if you held two 24"" peices of circular paper at arms length, that was how large they appeared in the sky. They seemed very close, or were extremely large. I have seen planes with their landing lights come over before, but, these spheres of light were nothing like that. They were perfectly spaced(like headlights)...the light was a pale white/greenish yellow, a non color really...and there was no illumination coming from the light...I stood there just staring at them, wondering how long would they last,what were they...they were not moving, there was no sound coming from them...then just as quietly as they had turned on, they turned off. Fading to the blackness of the sky. I stood there for maybe 10 minutes or more to see if something else might happen. Nothing did. The next day I asked a friend who was in the military if he had ever heard of government flares of that sort, he told me no, he never had. Thank you for letting me post this.

The light seemed to hover and move vertical down slowly then back up. I faintly remember the light fading from its normal white to a sort of red and back again. I came to a parking lot of a resteraunt and pulled over and got out and called my dad for some reason to tell him about it. The light seemed to move inward almost directly in line towards my head, as if coming directly at me.

On July 4th just after 9:00 PM my family and I returned to our home from an outing. Since my brother and law and I had our children with us, we decided to stay outside to view a local fireworks display.  There were several neighbors doing the same in the vicinity.  After a few minutes of viewing I noticed one group of neighbors standing 10 feet away looking up in the opposite direction of the fireworks display.  I followed their line of sight and noticed two red points of light flickering in the sky.  What struck me at that moment is that these lights appeared to possess the same characteristics as the lights that I had seen on two previous occasions (single point, bright red, same intensity).  Both lights were located in roughly the same area as the single red light my family and I witnessed just after 12:00 AM New Years 2004 (I called several family members away from our party to witness that event) and a single red light I witnessed some time in the early morning hours of October 2003.  During the New Years sighting I watched a single red light slowly move from south to north and to nearly overhead where it then stopped and stayed stationary for 15-20 minutes.  The light subsequently disappeared.  During the October event I drove 3 miles west in an attempt to align myself directly under the light.  I did this in an effort to try to ascertain what exactly it was. I eventually positioned myself to what I perceived as being directly under it, but still could not make any real determination as to the type of aircraft I was observing.  It too then disappeared abruptly within 20-30 minutes of initial sighting.  July 4th's lights appeared stationary at about 75 degrees above the horizon west of our position. For the majority of the sighting there were two distinct lights approximately one fists distance from one another.  They appeared to remain equal distanced and didn't produce any sound.  Unlike the previous sightings these flickered. There were private aircraft in the area and on one occasion a small aircraft passed slightly east and under the lights as it continued on its the downwind leg for Gillespie (KSEE, small regional airport in the vicinity 2 miles north).  I would estimate the small aircraft was flying at 1000-1500 AGL.  These lights seemed much higher and both the small aircraft and unidentified lights were unaffected by one another’s presence.  Some minutes later the north side light dimmed, flickered on and off in random pulses, almost like it was struggling to stay lit, then disappeared entirely.  The south side light continued to flicker for an additional 5 minutes and then it too disappeared.  The final light disappearance strangely coincided with the conclusion of the fireworks display.  It seems too much of a coincidence that two of my observations occurred on holidays and during what most would consider the peak period of the holiday.  I live in a densely populated, brightly lit suburb in east San Diego.  I have 2 small regional airports within 15 miles, and MCAS Miramar is 10 miles northwest.  I have been on the MCAS Miramar air base several times and the installation has never struck me as a special projects installation.  It seems to me that any sort new platform testing from Miramar would be unlikely considering the base's proximity to greater San Diego.  Perhaps some type of new surveillance device related to homeland security?  The lights had to be noticed by many this time.",2004-07-25T00:00:00,32.80505052631579,-116.91756842105264

We watched a couple of satellites go over head, the first one faint and normal speed and the second one much brighter and faster (I'm not sure if it was the ISS but it was very bright for a satellite).  Both moved in straight lines directly over head.  At this point, we noticed another 'satellite' following in the same flight path as the first two.  All of the sudden, it took a hard turn to the left (not 90 degrees but a fairly fast turn) went for a short distance, curved back to the right and continued  curving right and then left for several more turns a bit irradically (going straight for 1-4 seconds between turns).  The speed of the object didn't seem to change at all during the sighting as the turns were all fairly smooth.  By the time it went out of sight, it had veered off 45 degrees from it's original flight path.  I'm certain that it wasn't either a low flying or high altitude air craft and at the elevation that satellites fly at, the G forces within this object must have been massive.  I have another witness who watched the same thing I did.  Sorry there isn't much more to the sighting than that but it freaked the both of us out as we couldn't think of any known explanation.  Is there any similar reports to this sighting and does it have a rational explanation?  thanks!",2004-07-25T00:00:00,39.1839,-120.14680000000001
