I can't be certain of the exact time.  My camera says 4:10 pm but I know that is not accurate.  My best guess is that it was around 7pm but could have been later.  I walked out onto the front porch to plug in the Christmas lights and looked up at the moon when I noticed to very bright white lights to the left of the moon.  They were brighter than the stars around them and looked like lights on airplanes as they approach the airport (which is near our house) or even like low flying helicopters.  The only difference is that they did not budge at all and they were not accompanied by the red and blue flashing lights that are visible on aircraft (especially on aircraft that are flying directly at you - which these would have had to have been because of the visibility of thier ""headlights"" - let me stress again that they did not seem to be moving at all). I called my seventeen year old daughter out to look at them and then called out my husband who stated that they were probably planets.  The only problem with his theory is that they seemed to be very similar in brightness and size which doesn't bode well for the planet theory.  And frankly, they were just too bright.  I've veiwed planets before while taking astronomy in college. My husband went back inside to watch tv and my daughter and I snapped a couple of pictures with my camera but gave up after feeling like we couldn't get a successful shot.  We went inside, reluctantly accepting my husband's planet theory.  When I went back out several hours later to unplug the Christmas lights the ""planets"" were not visible anywhere in the night sky. Today I was watching a UFO show on television and decided to go ahead and report my sighting.  The only think I know is that I can't identify what I saw.

I was driving home with my two younger brothers on the night of 10/29/09 and the time was approximately 8:45 pm. or 20:45  Eastern Time, and as I turned onto my street, I looked up in the sky and saw 8 spheres of light.  I slammed on my breaks and just stared at them trying to figure out exactly what it was that I was looking at.  I had never seen anything like it before in my entire life.  It was hard to tell if the lights were one or eight different objects. The lights were white with a yellow tint to them and were in a perfect line with one another.  There were no distortions or imperfections to the spheres at all, only a small halo of light surrounding each one.  They were spaced out evenly and had the appearance of having a curvature formation to them like a saucer or the such.  They also were approximately 17 to 20 times greater in size than the largest star that was near the lights (in the night sky).  The lights were approximately 45 degrees to the horizon in the southeast direction from my position where I was stopped in the road.  I would say that the lights were about half a mile away from where I was.  The lights were near my family's property and were a ways up in the sky too. Then, just as suddenly as I had seen them, the lights started to go out one by one.  There was a bit of rotation to them as they went out.  I tried to see where they had gone, but there was nothing in the sky.  The only visible objects were a couple of far-off airplanes, the moon, the stars, and clouds.  There were no smoke trails as from a bottle-rocket or other firework product. There was absolutely nothing left after the lights disappeared. I drove around on the back roads for about ten minutes looking for firework trails or an aircraft or anything to explain the situation.  I also kept looking in the same spot where I had seen the lights, but nothing appeared there again.  I finally went home and stood outside for around twenty minutes looking for anything that may be an answer to this phenomenon.  I never saw the lights or anything that even resembled them again. Witness 2 - 11 years old  I saw a curve of 8 white lights in the south-eastern sky.  Then they went out one by one evenly.  Then, we drove down [our road].  We saw nothing that could have caused them.  We drove down another road and didn't see anything else. Witness 3 - 9 years old  I saw 8 white balls of light in the sky.  They went out one by one.

A few moments later the light made a turn to our left and headed do west out over the Pacific Ocean and gained altitude. Just at this moment it seemed to break apart or drip debris. Looked very much like burning embers falling from the object and fading as the fell. Both my son and I felt that this must have been a burning aircraft up until it turned and gained altitude as it headed out to sea.  We see a tremendous amount of air traffic (civilian and military) here as well as occasional launches from Vandenberg AFB. This was very definitely not either!

I’m sorry if report seems scattered, I’m very excited because this is only the second time I have witnesses something this unusual and have been fortunate to have a witness so I don’t feel like I’m just crazy or ""seeing things."" I'm sure you will have many reports on this because it was 4th of July evening and many people had to be outside. Thank you for having a sounding board for this sort of thing because it is kind of embarrassing and intimidating to report such things.  And it is nice to have a place to go and see if others saw it to confirm it more so.  Or maybe get a sane worldly explanation.

While there, I witnessed an object travelling from the east at a slow speed, at a relatively low altitude (higher than a sea place off Lake Union, lower than a jet taking off from Sea-Tac, if that makes any sense). I could not make out the general shape of the object, but did observe that it had one large red light, and a smaller orange light next to, and seemingly behind, the red one. The object executed a shallow turn, gradually heading south. It suddenly appeared to stop, and hovered for several seconds. About this time, an identical object came from same direction, following a seemingly identical flight path. It also stopped, and hovered slightly behind the first object. After it began to hover, a third identical object came into view, and fell into formation behind the previous two. The three objects hovered in what I can only describe as a loose crescent formation, for at least 30 seconds. Shortly after the appearance of the 3rd object, I stuck my head in the apartment and told my roommate they should come and see this. They came outside, and witnessed a good deal of the event. Sometime after the 30 second mark, the first object floated upwards and disappeared. Following this, the remaining objects moved closer together, and almost seemed to touch one another. They then separated, hovered for a few more seconds, and finally drifted upwards and disappeared as well. I would estimate the entire event, from the appearance of the first object to the disappearance of the latter two, was about 90 seconds to 2 minutes in duration. Though, frankly, it's difficult to say as I was more than a little surprised to be seeing this, and thus wasn't paying attention to the time. These clearly were not fireworks of any kind. Also, the lights on these objects were not consistent with what I've witnessed on traditional aircraft. There was no white/clear light, and none of the lights on the objects blinked or flashed at any time. They were also silent, and seemed to have a slight ""wiggle"" in their movements. There's a lot of air traffic in my area, so I see planes and helicopters every day. I feel safe in saying these objects were very odd, in both their behavior and appearance.

I stopped looking at it until my friend pointed it out to me which made me inspect it more closely. It appeared at first to be a bright red football shaped light  hovering in one spot but by its light I could see a matte black object in the shape of a large oddly shaped airplane. From the point I had first noticed until we both started inspecting it maybe 5 minutes had elapsed with this object which appeared to be at least 50 feet long and wide hovering in one place but as soon as we both looked closer it appeared to get dimmer until we realized it was because it had left at such an amazing speed that the bright light just appeared to get dimmer. it took off at a 30 degree angle headed directly away from us and up into a completely clear sky until it disappeared from distance.,2009-08-05T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

Rotating discs with colored lights seen ongoing for 3 weeks in July 2009 over N California,Redding,CA,2009-07-05T01:00:00,disk,03:00,"Occurred : 7/5/2009 01:00  (Entered as : 07/05/09 01:00) Reported: 7/29/2009 4:47:21 PM 16:47 Posted: 8/5/2009 Location: Redding, CA Shape: Disk Duration:03:00",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71396.html,"Rotating discs with colored lights seen ongoing for 3 weeks in July 2009 over N California Beginning late in the first week of july, a number of brightly lit and multicolored discs were witnessed in the vicinity of Redding, California.  The discs were situated approximately 25-40 miles from the area of witness and clustered at the north and west coordinates in small groups, sometimes stacked on one another.  Near Mount Shasta and in the general vicinity of highway 5 is the most prominent location for these discs in the last 3 weeks.  They have also been seen due west over the rugged mountains of Trinity County at approximately the same distance away from the witnesses.  A rough estimation of the distance away is 25-40 miles and elevation above the ground is estimated at 10,000 to 25,000 feet.  All sightings have occurred right around 01:00 hours and most have persisted until 03:00 hours or later with the witnesses all having seen their fill by that time. It is the duration of constant hovering combined with the entirely unusual colored lights that! makes a very convincing argument the objects are not helicopters or airplanes. All four witnesses were satisfied with this conclusion and have agreed their is no ""normal"" explanation for what has been seen. In particular about the craft, they look to be rotating discs oriented horizontally or sometimes tilted at an angle of around 30 degrees. The discs emanate four flashing colors of bright light identified as green, orange, red and blue. The lights flash in a rotation around the perimeter of the discs in an obviously attention getting and unnatural display. The discs have been best described as ""Simon"" electronic games in the sky rotating. The ""Simon"" is a game that is still available and consists of four colored lights arranged around a circle that are hit in succession to form a pattern. Surely most people can recall one of these from a television ad at least and visualize the same four colors flashing around the edge of a disc hovering in the night sky. There are sometimes but not always accompanying craft but normally one flashes more brightly than the others or the others seem to hover near or above a main disc.  The discs do not make fast movements but have been seen to move drastically in the sky in a period of only 15 to 20 minutes.  Witnesses would see and identify the disc, then go indoors for a short while and come back out to see the disc had moved a hand's span in the sky in only a short time.  There has been reliably one disc in the northern sky near Mount Shasta and also similar discs in the western sky over Trinity County, a bit south of Whiskeytown reservoir.  One of the first sightings involved the disc in the northern sky moving in very small rapid circles side to side but maintaining the same altitude.  Almost like the tip of a pencil drawing small curly-Qs over and over in the same place.  This was much more pronounced than the usual ""shimmer"" of a star in the sky that results from the atmosphere refracting! the light. The discs were definitely making rapid circling movements while rotating their flashing lights constantly. These sightings are complete textbook UFO instances, lasting so long that one has plenty of time to view the object and make a very detailed observation.  These objects are definitely not standard aircraft and resemble nothing seen before by any of the four witnesses. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.

They moved very slowly from south to southwest.  I know they were not planes or helicopters, they moved too slowly.  I do know a little about astronomy, the ISS and space shuttles.  I make it a habit to know when the shuttle is orbiting with the ISS and watch for it.  Point being I could tell these two objects were very high in the sky and did not seem to be within our atmosphere. This lasted about ten minutes.  When I noticed them they were almost in line with each other.  One was on the left, the other to the right but a little below.  The one on the right moved very slowly from the right towards the bottom of the other while it was motionless.  Once in line straight up and down, they both traveled from south to southwest very slow then slowly faded away as you would see the shuttle do when it leaves the reflection of the sun. What I thought was interesting was that they faded away while moving to the west towards the suns light.  It also may be that they only appeared to move to the west.  It may be possible that they were going deeper into space. This occurred in the town of Campbell, Ca.  I am hoping someone else saw the same thing from a long distance away.

The light would occasionally dip, hover, rise back up again, and quickly fly off. It's main pattern seemed to be flying in circles over one particular spot near the horizon. I believe that it's possible someone is flying some sort of model plane or helicopter from a baseball field, which is under that part of sky I witnessed the lights flying above. This ballpark is near Poinsettia Ln and Ambrosia Rd in Carlsbad. My concern, if this is the case, is that the lights are extremely bright and too close to Palomar Airport. They are not the normal red and green navigation lights, which could confuse other pilots landing and taking off from the nearby airport. Even if this is a normal plane, which I doubt due to it's behavior in the sky, these lights were much brighter th! an a small plane would be from that same distance.

We went outside for a cigarette.  It was dark outside and overcast.  I live in a small suburb community a couple of miles from town, there are not a lot of street lights around here, so the street is not well lit.  One strange thing that we noticed was that all of the dogs in the neighborhood were barking.  We first saw the object to the right of us.  At first the object was an intense neon blue light, bar shaped at first.  The object would hover and cruse just below the overcast clouds line circling us, flying slowly and changing altitudes.  Its movements were smooth quiet and squared.  The light would change its shape, having a few different light patterns on the craft.  When the craft seemingly noticed us it put on a display of unnatural and impossible maneuvers; Moving from a dead stop to unimaginable speeds in an i! nstant, making 90 degree turns at high speed, then coming to a complete stop, all the while moving without a sound. I told my wife to get the camera so we could take a picture.  She ran into the house to grab the camera but every time we tried to take a picture the craft would pulse and the battery power would be drained. Then we would mess with the camera and it would come back on with battery power but when we tried to take the picture again, the same thing would happen. Finally when the craft was at its furthest points away from us we could get a shot of it, three in total. When we captured it, the craft would react. With the first snapshot, the flash failed to flash, and the craft returned and put on a display of its maneuvers, then continued to circle us. The second snapshot again with no flash. The craft came right in front of us, banked its angle and exposed its shape to us. All I could tell was that it was pure black with blue lights. The bar light turned into severa! l individual lights fading off and on. I could see that it was! triangl e in shape. I couldn’t easily see the shape because the craft was dark and I was too focused on the lights. Then the ship would again start to circle us. Still when the craft was close to us it would turn our camera off. So my wife handed me the camera to see if I could get it to work when my wife screamed, “O my god look at that!” I looked up at the craft; it had a beam of light going to the ground with a red orb returning to the ship. I didn’t get to see the whole event with the orb because I was looking at the camera but my wife witnessed the whole thing. The orb returned to the craft and it began circling again. I gave the camera back to her she got the third picture; the best one. The third time the camera flashed. The craft turned to face us and closed the gap of distance from where it had been, to where we were. It sat just above the neighbor’s house. We were looking at what I believed to be the front of the craft. The craft fired a pulse of light towards us and I cou! ld feel a surge travel through my whole body, and my car was popping as if the sheet metal was warping. Then the craft began to circle again. We noticed that the phones were now working again and I was able to talk to my parents and franticly tried to explain to them what was happening. I thought we can’t be the only ones to see this so I ran across the street to get the neighbors outside to see this as well. I knew they were home and I could hear them in there. I was franticly knocking on the door and ringing the door bell, but no one would answer. Soon enough a car was pulling down the street it was my wife’s mom. We yanked her out of the car to see it. Then three minutes after she arrived home, the craft was gone. It disappeared in the overcast clouds. After all of this excitement I noticed that where the craft was flying it had opened a hole in the thick overcast clouds that took a few minutes to fill back in, revealing the night sky above. In total the event lasted abo! ut 30 – 40 minutes. This has been a very emotional event for m! e and my wife. We both had bad migraine headache for the next two days and my life has been permanently changed.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,36.688524576271185,-121.62845480225988

I was laying in bed, looking out the eighth story window of my dorm. It was a completely clear night, with no stars or clouds in the sky. I noticed a bright disk of light. Though very far away, I knew that it could not be a plane because it did not move, initially, it just hovered for ten to fifteen minutes. The object also flashed different colors, in no specific pattern or sequence, and the colors appeared to be green and red. This object seemed to be accompanied by another object, but this second object was smaller than the first, and was not as bright either. Its color stayed the same green the entire time, and did not flash sporadically like the first. Both objects were in perfect alignment the entire time, hovering, when they both began to gain altitude at a slow rate. I am currently still looking at them now, and they are hovering at the same higher altitude as they were ten minutes ago. Another reason that these objects could not have been aircraft was because two very obviously airplanes passed by the objects, at a lower altitude and had a blinking white light, that blinked at a regular pace, like all airplanes flying at night. I am a college student, who is rather interested in this subject matter.  After watching numerous shows and reading numerous accounts, I would consider myself somewhat knowledgable on the subject.  What I saw tonight was not normal, and resembled other accounts and videos that I have previously seen. I was not able to take a picture or video of the account, and even if possible, the objects would not appear clearly because of the distance. As much as I would like to believe that what I saw was merely a star or aircraft, it did not resemble either. The irregularity of the blinking of the lights, and the rapid change of color from green to red and back, seemed very paranormal. Though I do not have hard evidence supporting this claim, I hope it will be taken seriously and maybe even confirmed by another resident of Farmville, Virginia.

Not having my glasses on at the time, my first thought was that the moon was still out and was really bright.  I put my glasses on and immediately recognized that it was not the moon, but very similar to a very bright star exceptionally far away.  I then just layed there observing this ""star"".  Upon observation of approx. a few minutes, it appeared that this ""star"" was in fact moving in a back and forth movement, to the right and then left.  Being that I observed this through a rectangular skylight, I did have borders from which I could tell that this object was in fact moving.  At that point I called to my wife and asked her to look at this.  As she looked at it, I asked her if she could see it moving.  She said that she could, and at that I said I thought it was a UFO.  She responded ""coming to get you""?  She then went back to getting ready for work and I continued to watch, even having to reposition myself as this object had gotten to far to the right border of the skylight.  After a few moments passed, I then noticed this light start to diminish.  I assumed cloud coverage as it seemed to come in and out of light.  It then disappeared.  To me it appeared that this object went up as opposed to going any other direction.  I continued to watch for approx. 15 minutes longer to make sure that cloud coverage wasn't hiding this light.  My honest opinion is that this light was far to high in the sky to be a helicopter.  I thought of trying to contact the Onondaga Co. Sheriffs' Dept. to inquire if they in fact had their chopper in what would have been the southwestern sky, but I didn't want to lose sight of it by going to the phone.  Also, I took note that there was not on other star in the sky.  I am sending this message out in the hopes that maybe someone could look into this, or that maybe another report was made about the same thing.

As the object turned different colors it seemed to hover in one place.  It would then slowly do a somewhat figure eight pattern or a circular movement pattern and would at instances seemingly accelerate very quickly and then slow back down and then just hover in place.  It kept doing this and I went inside after about 20 minutes.  I came back out hours later and it was gone.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

I noticed something small, bright (reflecting light) and spherical in the sky outside my window.  It remained in a stationary position just inland of the coast. From my position I estimated it was pretty high, as the Long Beach air traffic was flying well below it.  Yet for ten minutes it did not move, so I ruled out balloon and blimp.  I tried to record it with my video camera, but the reflectivity of the object and the distance of it made recording impossible, it simply wasn't registering in my view finder...  As I put my camera down it began moving slowly toward Seal Beach (Naval Weapons Station) direction.  By 16:15 pst it was out of my visual range.  There was only one object. My background is irrelevant to the sighting.  I am not ex-military or law enforcement, and I have only seen a UFO one other time, with two friends in 1994.  Turned out to be a prototype for a DRONE the military was testing over the neighborhoods of Lakewood, CA. So this could be anything.  I am simply reporting it.  Hope someone else out there got a better look at it than i did.  Perhaps the pilots passing underneath it?

It had 4 very dim red lights on each end and was solid black. This was at night. It moved with no sound at all. passed over my head and was out of sight in about 30 seconds. Im not sure if this was because it was moving fast or because the lights were very dim. I called the police dept a couple of days later and there was no reports of this thing. I was the only one that saw it. There were no FAA lights just 4 very dim red lights on each corner and the craft. I think it was one structure because I could not see between the red lights and the lights did not change in formation so it was solid and seem to be moving slow and did not go up higher or go lower. It was moving as a public airliner plane would be moving at 30,000 feet but the UFO was much closer to the ground. I would have never known it was there unless I was looking up. The next day I talked to some people at the gas station and a couple of customers were telling me that they have seen red glowing UFOs in my city and others close by at night too but not a brick shape like I saw but round like a saucer with red lights also. At least Im not the only one that has seen these things around here. But they said they never saw a brick shape UFO. Also it was not as high as a public airliner would be. Only maybe a 1000 feet more or less above the ground. This is my first UFO sighting.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,32.78108911564626,-96.62069489795918

The aircrafts would head in the direction of the suspect UFO and would go above and below it and circle around it.

As there are several airports nearby, I usually ignore aircraft passing overhead. However, this object was unusual in that it displayed a very erratic sequence of strobe lights, which appeared to flash in quick sequence as a cluster with an irregular outline, go dark for about 5 seconds, then start up again. I saw a irregular outline of this object as the cloud level reflected city lights around the object, subtending about 1 degree in diameter. At this altitude and lighting conditions, I can normally see wings and tail on aircraft. That said, I would completely dismiss this ""sighting,"" except for one odd detail. As I tracked the movement of this object, the cluster of strobes would sometimes appear clearly outside the previous location of this object, giving the impression the object was quickly darting from one position to another. I thought this was a perceptual illusion until this odd behavior repeated 6 times, but I'm still baffled.  The nature of these strobes appeared as a very quick, erratic sequence, no geometric arrangement appearing to change color almost too quickly to register. These may have been orange, blue, yellow—and quite different from the static red/green position lights seen on wing tips, and I normally don't see strobes darting around on aircraft.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,37.379397360000006,-122.02147768

There was a hovering light on top of the hill (Poinsettia Lane & Black Rail Road) which lasted about 5 minutes long. This sighting was the 2nd time. The 1st was last month between 2400-0030 hrs. by my colleague in which we both have the graveyard shift security in the church at Poinsettia Ln. He had told me about his sighting & therefore I kept a watchful eye on the exact area. Behavior of the object was identical as was observed by my colleague. The top of the hill is about 400 yds  from my location  In which Poinsettia lane intersects with Black rail Rd. There are 3 street light posts which illuminate at the top of the road/ hill. I noticed a bright light half the size of the street light hovering, circling around 200 yds to the right side. It changed to a blue & then red blinking light. It would just circle from on top of the street light to 200 yds  to the right where there is a tower, it would dip down back of the tower & then go back & forth to the top of the road where the street lights were. I walked to the parking lot & informed the pastor who had been parked waiting in the car for a couple of minutes as he was early for the day. I pointed to where the UFO was hovering, we both watched it then I proceeded to walk closer to it about 75 yards to see if it had a sound. There was no sound. It was more like a small object as if it could be a remote control toy.  Its behavior was similar to a firefly hovering around. I noticed it couldn’t be an airplane or a helicopter since there is an airport in the left far side of the hill.  Airplanes often land & take off but I could later hear them. I later lost sight of it because I attempted to walk to  another person at the parking lot which slopped down. As I went back towards it the object was gone.  This took place just before sunrise, it was still quiet dark. The hovering speed would be around that of a remote control plane.

To my left, (east) moving slowly from left to right (north to south) a black triangular shaped object was flying over the Hy Vee Store.  There was a single row of 5-6 round green lights on two sides of the triangle, underneath the object, forming a V pattern.  The lights were not pulsating or rotating.  I could see the object's shape clearly, as the glow from the Hy Vee parking lot lights illuminated the object from below. It was a dull black against a clear black sky and the stars were visible.  Although I could hear noise from the air conditioning system and traffic noises from Center Street, I did not hear any noise from the object.  Within 4 or 5 seconds, we lost sight of the object behind the trees near the theater.  I asked the actor if he had seen anything and he answered in the affirmative.  I asked if he had seen anything like that before and he said he hadn't.  I asked him to describe it to me and he did, much as I describe it here.  We were too stunned to run out past the trees to follow it further.

The GPS located that we were between Panoche, and Mendota. I was sitting in the passenger side of the car, while our car headed north on the interstate. There were only 2 passengers in the car including myself. From afar, we both noticed some kind of craft that appeared to be a helicopter or crop duster. At first the craft would pulse light similar to an airplane, then the whole thing would light up, followed by the appearance of three distinct separate lights. This light pattern: pulsing light, to sustained bright light, to three linear lights, continued for about a minute, each individual stage lasting a few seconds. The craft made incredibly low figure eights over the interstate; its’ distance above the ground roughly tripled the height of an overhanging freeway exit sign. At that point I still could not make out the body of the craft, as all I could see were incredibly bright lights. The craft kept making figure eights over the interstate, flying over both north and south lanes, making low and sharp turns over the fields that surrounded the road. As it continued to figure 8, it no longer followed the light patterns, but was simply three linear lights. I thought ""Wow, what a cool plane. This is something,"" up until the point when I looked to my left as the craft made its turn back towards the interstate and the three individual lights began to interchange and rotate, changing its linear form into no form; disconnected and spontaneous. Each of the three lights seemed to act independently. As I witnessed this, I knew it was not a crop duster, or helicopter, or normal airplane. This time when the craft came back across the interstate and into the surrounding fields it sank so low to the ground that I thought it had disappeared. I thought it was gone, but out of no where it rose up to my left directly above the car, this time it's three lights made the shape of a giant triangle whi! ch we we re able to clearly view through our front windshield. While the giant triangle flew over us, the three lights that composed it’s shape shifted back into three linear lights, transforming the craft and changing it’s direction from straight up, to straight out towards the east as if the pattern of the lights controlled and shifted it’s movement. Shocked, I rolled the window down to see if I heard any noise, but we were driving around 70 mph and there were so many cars and trucks on the road that we could not hear anything.  As we continued driving forward, I turned around in my seat to watch it fly away. It appeared to look like a normal plane now (pulsing and flying steady) with an exception of the occasional bright light that would be sustained for a few seconds. Overall, what shocked me about this craft was the way it flew so low and turned with such ease. It did not appear to be flying, but almost floating. In addition, the interchanging, shape-shifting lights that initially appeared as three lights in a linear pattern did not calm my suspicion that this craft was not a normal airplane or helicopter. By the maneuvers that I witnessed, it would have to be one ridiculously talented and daring pilot to be able to pull off such stunning acrobatics in the air.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

First off this is not a hoax.  Anyways, this happened when I was out in the desert of Kuwait near FOB Yankee.  It was around 2100 and I was getting ready for bed.  I layed down in the cab of my 7ton truck on my back and looked up to the sky.  I've always had a fascination with astrology and I looked to find the big dipper which was really big tonight. Anyways, as I was looking at the constellation I noticed a bright, white light in the sky that was moving.  It didn't have any blinking lights and it was bright than the stars around it.  I figured it was a satellite or something so I just watched it move.  All of a sudden, the object slowed down which I thought was odd.  After about a minute the object sped up again.  Then for no reason it slowed down for a second time.  Another minte or so passed and the object sped up again.  The object then slowed down a third time. Then, for no reason at all the object started to disappear from where it was, getting smaller and smaller and leaving what looked like an after-burn trail.  This was all going on for about seven minutes.  Coincidently as the object was disappearing, two jets (which looked like military jets) came into the area that the object was in and circled the area for about five minutes or so and then just left. I thought it was odd that the object I was looking at disappeared as soon as the two jets came into the area.  This occured around 21:07.  After that I was talking with one of my buddies about it and alal of a sudden I got really tired.  I then went back to my cab and layed down.  And for no reason it felt like I could lift any of my limbs.  It was like I was a dead weight and it was the strangest feeling I've ever felt. I woke up about an hour later with a jump, kind of like when somebody sneaks up from behind you and scares you.  It was the weirdest feeling because I don't remember falling asleep at all and I was wide awake when I did wake up.  I don't remember a thing from when I layed down for a two minutes to waking up.

I know you know where this is going, ha ha. Too big to be a radio tower, and stationary, so not an airplane. I, of course, used these two anchors of logic to dissuade me from what I thought I was actually seeing, but it was when I made out a chassis that my foot hit the brake and I slowed to a crawl.... it was wobbling... I started screeching all kinds of disbelieving profanities and I KNOW someone else saw it because as I was swerving off the road I saw another car wandering off to the side of the road as well, and they quickly passed.  It was triangular, dark and metallic, very sleek and smooth, with three white lights at each vertex and a concave red light, and it seemed blurry because the darn thing was wobbling a bit. I forced myself to look at the road and was surprised to find an unnatural glow around myself and the car, and as it grew brighter, I brought my eyes upward and caught it above my windshield and I craned my neck and promptly began to panic because the craft was now above my car, silent, higher up in the air but still too close for comfort, 500 feet perhaps.... I'm a horrid judge of distance....  It was at this moment I smelled, yes I know.... sulfur.... something like sulfur, so strong I held my hand over my face.

I was looking up at the stars and was looking for meteors. I scanned the whole sky. I looked to the east at about 22 degrees to the east and about 12 degrees to the south from where I was standing from an over head view I suddenly saw four yellowish lights in formation of two even followed by two even. The third was between the first two and the fourth was equidistant as the first two.  The formation looked like this:  xxxxxxxUxxxxxxxU   xxxUxxxxxxxU  The U's represent the objects.   There was no sound and they had to be at least 6 miles up or more. Since it was night it is difficult to tell, but planes at less than that give sound. They were moving at 1/2 meteor speed across the sky. Nothing moves that fast. Aurora is mach 7 from what is documented to the public(replacement for blackbird). I just called the airport and talked with some personal as I was writing this. They say you can hear planes at 40,000 feet. There was no sound. The covered the sky 12 degrees from the overhead to 55 degrees or more in about 1 second.  The airport called me back and said they put it in the log.  I will also be contacting the FAA, not for an admission from them but to let them know of the incident.  We either we have something that moves at mach 25 plus or it was not of our earth.  This was not a natural formation of any kind.  I have seen hundreds of meteors of all kinds and some people might classify them as something but I knew they were not.  After reporting I went back outside and looked up.  I saw a plane very clearly cover the same space.  I could see the wings and it was not coming in for a landing but was moving across the same area but much lower.  There was no sound so this passenger jet had to be 35,000 to 40,000 feet or more.  It took over 40 seconds to transverse the same space at a lower altitude.  Say the passenger jet moves at the standard speed of 500MPH.  1/2 of 40 is 20 for 1000MPH, 1/2 of 20 is 10 for 2000MPH, 1/2 of 10 is 5 for 4000MPH, 1/2 of 5 is 2.5 for 8000MPH, 1/2 of 2.5 is 1.25 for 16,000MPH.  This was the distance covered but the altitude must was much higher.  There is indeed only two options here.  I like science.  I aced the geometry regents exam in high school.

The obvious explanation is that there was some water/ice crystals between myself and the sun. I went in to get my camera to see if I could take a picture.  I took five pictures from 18 mm to 55 mm at slightly different angles, using automatic and A/DEP modes on my Canon EOS Rebel XT Digital camera. I saved the three most interesting images, taken about a minute apart starting at 13:46.  When I looked at the images I noticed a really unusual part to the first image only. It looks like an old Mercury Space Capsule on reentry, only upside down from my point of view. I printed the pictures including two versions of the first one with zoom. Unfortunately I only used the 3 meg resolution of the Canon’s 8 meg possible so the zoomed images are pretty fuzzy.

After playing with the dog for about five minutes I asked my daughter to help with the groceries I had brought home.  She took 3 bags into the house and went off to do something else.  I stayed outside as my mother pointed my attention to the ¾ moon rising in the on this gorgeous evening.  I acknowledged the moon, which was rising between two trees and was 40 degrees above the horizon, but then I noticed a very bright object almost directly overhead.  It was very bright, as bright as the moon, and was approximately 80 degrees above the horizon.  As I looked at it, I noticed it did not seem to be moving at all.  Also, it did not seem round-it looked rectangular in shape though it was very small and distant.  I’ve seen the space shuttle in the sky and, to me it looked like that kind of object-something definitely in our orbit, however, it wasn’t moving.  I pointed it out to my mother who acknowledged seeing it and asked her to keep an eye out for it as I went inside, dropped off grocery bags and rounded up my binoculars.  This took about 3 minutes.  When I came back out it was still there and still very bright.  I gazed at it some more with the binoculars and also gazed at the moon.  I also gave the glass to my mother who also took a look.  This went on for about 5 more minutes.  As we were talking about it I got distracted and looked down at the dog who was running around the yard.  I turned around and looked up again, and it had completely disappeared.  Within a span of about 7 to 10 seconds, it was nowhere to be found.  I couldn’t believe my eyes.

I had stepped outside onto my back 2nd story porch for a cigarette and stood and admired the sky and stars as I do everynight. A particularly bright object that appeared to be a star or planet caught my attention and I proceeded to stare at it. The object was stationairy and appeared no different looking than a bright star so I quickly dimissed it. The object was stationairy from the time I came out onto the porch and first noticed it (10-15 seconds). The object was directly East of my location and situated high in the sky, about 25-30 degrees off of being directly vertical over me and at a 70-75 degree angle in the sky off the horizon. I was about to look away and stare at another patch of sky when I noticed that the object started moving to the North. It moved slowly and at a constant speed in a straight line at a constant altitude, which made me think that maybe it was an airplane coming to or from DFW airport which is very close. But the object appeared to be at very high altitude, higher than I've ever seen a plane fly, and as I scrutinized it I could not see any blinking lights that distinguish aircraft and are usually visible at any altitude. The object was a solid and constant sphere shaped light that again looked similar to a bright star. It quickly became obvious it was NOT an airplane but I still didn't think UFO. So then I start thinking I'm seeing a satellite or something go overhead in orbit. I continue observing the object move East to North across the sky expecting to watch it (thinking its a satellite) arch across the sky. But after 8-10 seconds of slow moving predictable flight the object began to move erraticly and looked to be gaining altitude because the object was getting dimmer and dimmer the higher and further away it got from me. The object also began to accellerate, slowly at first while it zigzagged but then it really started picking up speed! I mean at the high altitude the object was at, for it to move that fast across the sky it must've been doing incredible speed. I have never seen something accellerate so fast! As the object accellerated it climbed near vertical and, well, ""ascended into space"" is the best way I could describe it. It did NOT continue travelling across the sky, it accellerated to unbelievable speed and went near vertical and appeared to rapidly climb out of the atmosphere. IT DID NOT just disappear behind some trees or over the horizon, it went near straight UP and disappeared overhead as it accellerated away! When I saw the object start to move like gravity didn't effect it, and move as unbeilveably fast as it did, an icy ball materialized in my stomach, and I felt genuine fear rush over ! me like a wave, when it became obvious that this could not possibly be a plane or satellite. I saw it, it's real! Total event time 25-30 seconds from the time I came onto the porch and witnessed the object stationairy (10-15 secs) start to move slowly (8-10 secs) and then zigzag, climb, and accelerate upward near vertical until out of sight overhead (3-5 secs).  NOTE: I live within 10 miles of DFW airport and I see dozens of planes fly overhead everyday. I was born and raised here 24 years and have always seen and been used to aircraft going overhead every couple minutes 24/7, 365.

My 16-year old daughter was in the car with me. She noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of us and asked if it was the North Star. I looked for a few moments, then told her that no star was that bright. I then racked my brain to see if any planets were visible this time of year. The light was approximately 250-300 feet above ground. As we neared closer, we could see that rather than one bright light, it was actually two white lights and two red lights that were blinking intermittently. I said to her, ""Must be an airplane."" As we neared even closer, I wondered out loud to her, ""But airplanes don't hover."" The lights were remaining still in one spot directly in front of us. We could see, too, as we neared, that the lights were lower than first appeared, or perhaps had moved closer to the ground. The lights were not moving at all, other than blinking. It seemed odd and also apparent to me, that at my snail pace of 30mph, I was actually ""catching up"" with whatever it was. I told my daughter that we would find out what it was in a few seconds, because we're going to pass right under it. The object was still hovering in one spot. What happened next is unimaginable and outlandish. We passed under the object, which took 2-3 seconds at my drive of 30mph.  As we passed underneath, we could see that the object was triangular with round corners, the body was metallic, and corner of the triangle had a brightly colored light.  One light was green.  One light was red. I believe, but can't be positive, that the third light was white.  Directly connecting the large corner lights were smaller red and white lights that blinked in a row. The front of the triangle (the longer side) had an amazing glow from it, as if from interior lights.  We passed under in absolute shock. As we passed it, we both turned to each other and shouted. ""That was a UFO!"" My daughter said. I quickly pulled into a side street and turned my car around, in an attempt to catch back up to the object.

I watched the light move slowly east for about a minute.  (I REALLY wish I took a picture of it now)   I went into the store for about five minutes.

There was a slight wind out of the south, the light did not seem to be affected by the wind as it moved east then west, it stopped and moved slowly, there was no sound.  I drove home for about 3 minutes and when I parked my car and got out I could still see the light.  It was still moving west and was lower in the sky since I had moved about a mile north of it.

There was a low, fog layer, with the base about 300 feet above our head. The object was directly beneath it. It was also lighting up the fog above it. If I stick my hand out arms length, I would say it was about a nickel size in diameter. It was round and had a brilliant amber color. There were bright, LED looking lights, glittering throughout it. I couldn’t tell exactly where the lights were oriented on it, but they were brilliant. There was no sound and it was moving very, very, slowly S.E. to N.W. I watched it for about 30 seconds. At arms length it moved just a few inches in the sky. The car behind us pulled up next to our car and asked if we were OK. I said, “We are fine. We are looking at that light”. I pointed up to the object and saw that it was rising/fading into the base of the fog layer. The person in the car said, “Oh” and just took off. We watched it for just 15-30 seconds longer and the light disappeared in the clouds/fog. There was no sound from it.

She described the exact things I was seeing. It continued to hover there and I called several friends to get some one else to acknowledge this ""object"", but no one answered. We then drove down to our local Shell gas station/convenience store to get the cashier to verify the sighting of this object. She hadn't used binoculars before and could not really get a good look at it; she did state that her son had seen a UFO a couple days earlier, though. I called the local Police and the cashier called the Highway Patrol to see if anyone else had reported anything and they both said ""no"".It was not in the sky when we got home and we did not see it leave, fly or disappear; We called this number provided by the Redding Police Dept. and the recording gave us this web site address. The entire incident lasted approx. 40 minutes I am including sketches of what we saw, with descriptions and will email it ASAP.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,40.611439423076924,-122.35183557692308

Hi, I'm an area manager for a small chain of stores in Mt. Pleasant and Charleston County, SC.  Well yesterday, 11-1-09, I was driving home to North Charleston from one of our stores loacted in Mt. Pleasant.  I always take the 526 home to North Charleston.  It was just before sunset yesterday and as I was driving I saw the strangest thing in the sky.  It looked like a black rectangular object that wasn't moving, way up in the sky against the clouds.  I thought ""what the heck is that?"" and had to keep driving but I did slow down some.  There is no safe place to pull off the road once on the 526.  Well I kept watching it and watching it as I drove.  I believe I saw another craft of some sort up way, way above it and to the right of it and this smaller, harder to see craft may have been plane shaped.  I began to think things.  I thought that maybe there was a helicopter or plane towing something. But I really didn't see a tow chain or rope of any kind between the two, but that's what it looked like.  Now my immagination went wild and I want to say it reminded me of the Star Trek Enterprise pulling the borg cube with a tractor beam! Seriously, I thought well there must be a logical explanation.  I thought the airforce might have been doing some scientific experiment and may have dropped or pulled something from behind a plane or helicopter as a weather/wind experiment or something like that.  I thought well maybe one of those planes that pull an advertisement sign behind it like those I see off the beach when I go to Daytona. I just don't know anything.  Now I want to believe that it was a spaceship from outerspace with extraterrestrials on it.  I really, really do!  All I really know for sure however is that I saw something in the sky that didn't seem to be moving at first, like a black, rectangular window against the white clouds way high up that day.  Then I saw the other thing, the maybe plane shaped craft.  Now the black object either turned and narrowed, or as I drove foreward I saw from a different angle and it narrowed.  I believe they started to slowly move and eventually I lost sight of them because I entered into my own neighborhood and trees blocked any further view of them.   As soon as I got home yesterday I wrote to MUFON and a representative from MUFON called me last night.  Today I told my boss about the incident and I even tried to contact the Charleston Airforce base to ask if they had anything unusual or unexplained on their radar over North Charleston yesterday, but I cou! ldn't find an e-mail addy that would do any good.  I watched and looked at the thing for a good fifteen minutes on my way home on this 526.  There were plenty of other cars on the road and I'm surprised nobody else noticed, if they did, they didn't post a report about it.  Well I'm a definate believer.  I'm convinced!  I am not a skeptic.  I believe in UFOs and in extraterrestrial life.  I've seen too much not to be a believer.  I sure intend to keep on watching the sky!",2009-12-12T00:00:00,32.87719179487179,-80.02638717948719

I decided to go jogging at a local High school track on 11/01/09 at about 6:30PM. I jogged and walked the track until about 7:45 PM. I decided to lay down and stretch before going home. It was a cool and clear night and cool night with a bright full moon. I laid down on my back to stretch and was looking up at the sky noticing how clear and pretty it was. I noticed 3 stars in a triangle pattern that stood out from the rest, nothing seemed unusual about that. But as I was just gazing up at them  I noticed 1 of the stars or what appeared to be a star start moving to the right. It started moving very slowly, so slow in fact I thought my eye’s were not focusing well or it was just me. But I then noticed the bright star to the right of the object (a planet more than likely because it was so bright) was staying stationary. NO other stars were moving. The object moved very slowly, I then started looking for blinking lights thinking maybe it was a plane coming in at an angle and then turning or something. But as it moved very slowly to the right it slowly started to fade out. And it then disappeared. I viewed it for at least 45 seconds. I thought of everything it could be because I am a skeptic.  At first I thought maybe it was the space station, but I ruled that out because I have seen the space station before and you can see it from start to finish and it moves much faster than this object was moving.  We have a Navy base that trains pilots in single engine prop planes and I seen three right after this sighting and they all had blinking lights and even at the slow speed they travel they still traveled faster than this object. I ruled out everything, even space junk. Because when I started looking up all 3 stars were not moving. Then one of them started to move very slowly to the right and flickered as it faded out. It just vanished in the night sky. I heard no noise, because when it flickered out I thought it might be an after burner on a jet. I have not other explanation other than it was a UFO. Note: I live in the city where the lights are bright and you can’t see most of the stars. But this object was as bright as the Planet to the right of it.

July 5th.  Approximately 5:40 PM, Harrison City, Texas - outside the city of Hallsville. We were expecting a storm to run through the area, it had not started raining yet and the power went out. My wife headed outside to watch the storm, as I shut down the computer equipment and turned off backups. I went out on the front porch which has a fairly good view of the North. We like to watch storms roll in from there. It was still day light out and the clouds were fairly high and white at this point of the storm. Just after the first or second lightning flash went off I saw something through the trees. As it moved into view it moved at a steady flat pace just below the clouds. It was in view for about 20-25 seconds, long enough for me to grab my wife and run to the other side of the porch for her to see it before it was hidden by trees & clouds. I am not an aviation expert but I'll describe what I saw comparing it to common items seen in the area. Holding my thumb and forefinger out at arm’s length it was about 2 inches long. A Cessna plane that flies over frequently at a similar distance would be about a 1/4 inch or smaller. I was able to see it very clearly at first as it was below the clouds and I could see 2-3 lights in back and the same amount up front. I saw the body of the object fairly clearly; it was a pipe or a tube shape. The angle it was at, I'd expect to see wings or more of the object, but there were none. It is uncommon to have aircraft fly this low in the area and when they do, it is usually small private jets and Cesena type aircraft, all of which can be distinctly heard before being seen. This object made no noise and traveled at a speed (once again comparing to a Cessna), would be about 4-5 times the speed of a Cesena, possibly more. It's very hard to put a size/distance to it. As it moved across my line of sight, it entered the lowest parts of the clouds still fairly visible. The lights front and rear seemed to pulse, possibly flash, but it could have been because it was going through the translucent clouds. The lights were all white front and rear. It was traveling West to East approximately 5 miles North of Highway 80 and I saw it East of FM 450 travelling toward Marshall TX. The object I saw had 3 maybe 4 lights that appeared to be round, the number of them was not something I was paying attention to at the time. What I was trying to remember is that the space filled with lights was equal front &/or rear was approximately 1/3 the total distance of the object.  At no time did I see any wings, or tail fins, or any other color of lights but white front and rear. That is about it, not sure what it was but it was nothing I have ever seen before.

On July 6, 2009, around 1:00am, I woke up to tend to my infant son in another room who was crying.  When I returned to my bedroom, there was a bright light solid blue light shining onto the carpet on the floor in my bedroom.  It was in the shape of a semi-circle.  It almost looked like a half of a spotlight shining on the floor. I am not good with measurements but I think the diameter was probably 8 inches long (maybe the size of the top half of a small personal pizza.) The light was still and did not move.  I did not hear any noise outside.  At first I thought maybe it was a car headlight.  Then I realized that this explanation was not possible since our bedroom backs up to a heavily wooded area and there are no cars around.  Our bedrooms are also on the second floor (we live in a townhome) and the blinds  were halfway down so there was no way a light could project into our room and shine onto the floor in the shape of a semi-circle. I began looking around to see if I could find the source of the light.  I could not see any blue light coming in through the window, but I decided to look out of the window anyway.  As I took a step forward, the light on the floor disappeared.   When I looked outside I did not see anything or hear anything.  I looked for planes and or helicopters that might have had search lights but I saw nothing in the sky.  The whole episode lasted approximately 30 seconds or less.  Today I called the non-emergency police number to see if there had been any other sightings of this light or if there had been any search helicopters in the area. I was told there were no other reportings of any lights but it was a possibility a helicopter was in the area.  However, the dispatcher was unable to confirm whether there was a helicopter in the area at that time.  I found the incident VERY unsettling!

Northeast to Southwest or reverse.   Depending upon atmospheric conditions the light may appear bright white or blue .. again also depending upon the aircraft. There is also a famous Vineyard in the area and the owner employs a Lear Jet in his travels - often flying low.  No noise is heard until the aircraft is close or passes overhead.  The local airport is nearby and low approach speed maintains an optical illusion of a non-moving object when approaching HEAD ON to the viewer.. Lexington also falls under a main sky route hub between Greensboro/Winston-Salem and Charlotte and it is not unusual for heavy air traffic .... the planes often employ landing strobes .. but the actual ONCOMING path makes it appear stationary until they get overhead and then one can see the FAA required aircraft lights (i.e. green/red .... varied blinking lights, wing lights, etc.) . Many others have seen similar objects and mistook them for ... Unidentified, until that typical jet noise ""catches up"". I am not sure if this applies to the above situation, but may be a possible explanation. This evening I have seen many .... heavy air traffic ... some small aircraft ... strobes are flashed when they are approximate to each other.  TWO in particular were unusual and did NOT follow the normal flight route; however I had assumed that they were the result of heavy inbound/outbound air traffic (Holiday) and may have been put on a ""holding"" pattern.  The night was very clear, the aircraft did NOT make noise, but assumed (again) the sound would follow.  It didn't; however the movement was consistent with usual flight speed with no deviations from a straight course, nor any change in speed.  Both objects moved from NORTH to SOUTH, EACH about ten minutes apart - EACH taking about ten minutes to cross.  The ONLY thing unusual were that there were NO FAA lights .. just a solid white light.

I was in the middle of thinking how unlikely it would be to see something again, when I looked up and there it was again!  This time it was even a bit brighter than before.  Same, no blinking lights, no  sound.  Flying from northeast to southwest, only this one had a more southerly direction. I actually walked down the road about 500 ft to follow it's course.  I could clearly see it shining through some trees before it moved out into the open.  Very  whitish light, similar to a spot light on a helicopter.  NO NOISE!  It appeared to stop and start a couple of times and then blinked out again!  It could have been miles away for all I know, but based on the very bright clear light it was producing, it seemed much closer. I would estimate that it was no more than a miles distance at the very most. I am aware there is an airport on the north side of town.  I am also aware of what airplanes look and sound like, as well as helocopters.  I lived in L.A. and saw police helicopters all the time.  And there are no blimps or hot air balloons around here.  This was making zero noise with NO blinking lights. I even checked a satellite tracking site to see if there were any flyovers scheduled for that time and saw none.  The international space station was somewhere over Hawaii at the time and flying from west to east.  So I ruled that out. Not sure what it was, but I already know they exist so I'm not freaked out.  Just wanted to see if possibly anybody else has seen something in my area.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,39.77638902439024,-121.82759634146342

I mean directly over top of our house. It had several brightly colored lights on the bottom and it was the size of a jet liner. I would think that I would have herd the craft but I didn't hear anything. If a plane would have been flying over head at that altitude it would have shook the house with the force of a hurricane. I didn't hear nothing, didn't feel nothing, and if we had not seen it I would have never even knew it was there. It was as if it was just gliding along. This did not scare me at all.

On that road back is a area that has a urban town for the army to train in.It just hung there.....I thought it might be a helicopter with it,s landing light on....But no it was way to bright....plus there was a weather warning out because of the high winds.  So nothing should be flying.  What happend next convince me that this was not a conventional type of Aircraft. The ball of light started to move towards the high right NorthWest,as it did i could see the very fast moving clouds by its very bright light, and as it ascended into the clouds they filtered out the brightness and i could see the shape of the object....it was a perfect white ball and i watched it as it slowly faded out of sight.

My sister and I were standing on the front porch of her office, enjoying the unseasonably warm and clear weather.  I noticed the apparent reflection of sunlight off an object in the air Southwest of our position, traveling in a Northerly direction, at what appeared to be roughly the same altitude and speed as commercial airliners. I called it to my sister's attention because the reflection was much, much brighter than I had ever seen from an aircraft at that altitude and it left no contrail as other aircraft were doing that day.  My sister said ""Wow, that looks like it's vertical."" (i.e., oriented perpendicular to the Earth's surface, rather than parallel, as an airliner is.)  We watched it for 15-20 seconds, during which time it traveled about the length of my index finger (held at arm's length, maybe 8-10 degrees of arc), then just disappeared. What made this sighting unusual was that after the reflection disappeared there was a brilliant flash of light further along the approximate track of the object.  This flash occurred maybe a half-second after the reflection first disappeared, but the gap between disappearance and flash was about  the same distance as the object had traveled during the initial (continuous) observation. So, during the gap between disappearance and flash, (using the formula Distance/Time=Distance per UnitofTime) the object seems to have accelerated to somewhere around 400% of it's initial speed in less than a second.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

I have reported these crafts 3 different times to three different organizations! This makes # 4.   But no one will take me serious.   I HAVE VIDEO AND LOTS OF IT, THEREFORE  I HAVE PROOF!!!!  But  these amazing air crafts, just keep showing up!!!!!! I have looked at many reports and to my surprise , A lot of people are reporting the same thing.   Flickering lights that emit multi colors, and then the light orange ones that  don’t  flicker. The light orange ones are different!  They slowly dim down and  move and then slowly light back up.  They  move the same as the flickering ones though!    A LOT OF PEOPLE  ARE SEEING  THE SAME AIR CRAFTS!!!!   From the east coast to the west!!!!  If your reading this please contact me!!!  I will show you!!!!!   EVERY NIGHT THE SKY IS CLEAR THEY ARE THERE!!!  	  Some nights they are more active then others.  And on  02/18/10 they were  active and flickering brighter than ever!!  I’ve seen them so much now that  I  always assume they are there.  And when I look, sure enough there they are!  I always confirm it by waiting for them to move.   I have 6 rough hours of video edited down to 2 hours.  Plus on the 18th of Feb, I taped some more!!!!!!  You can see the movements on tape but its hard to see, because I believe these crafts are hovering possibly outside of our atmosphere.  Making them who knows how far away!!!!   But you can see the movements on tape and a lot easier with the naked eye!!!  On 02/18/10 I had to get out my video camera due to the fact that, I’ve never seen the multi colors so bright and vivid before!  On this night two of them where unusually bright and vivid, and these two looked liked identical twins, both flickering at the same rate and everything!!!!  Then there was 1 normal  whitish one flickering out in th! e distances.   But when I got my wife outside to look she was also surprised that the colors where so noticeable, but then she pointed out that the  orange one that was almost straight above us,  was dimming down.  And when I looked I saw it dim down and  move around  erratically and then stop and brighten up.   Just to repeat its self and dim down again and move.  It did this over and over again.  They  make all kinds of weird turns, stops, loops, dips and zig zags.  There is no craft known by the general public that is capable of what they do.  I have lots of theories about  who they are and what there doing , and  how they do what they do.   But I need help bringing this to light!!!!!!!  I need more witnesses, and a lot better camera!!!!!    WE NEED TO BELIEVE AND HAVE FAITH IN EACH OTHER!!!!!!!!!         I would really love to  meet up with anyone  and show them what I’m seeing.

On 2/11/09, there were storms with high straight line winds, up to 65 mph in some places, in the Cincinnati area.  As the storms were moving out of my local area, I noticed some mammatous clouds, and went out to the entrance to our garage at about 5:45 pm,  to take some photos of them.  The garage faces a little south of due west.  I was using a Nikon D80 with a zoom lens, Nikon model DX AFS Nikkor 18-135 mm 1:3.5-5.6G ED, with no filters.  The clouds were coming straight towards the open garage, and there was a very light rain falling, so I was standing slightly inside the garage to minimize water drops on my lens.  After taking some photos to the west, I stepped out of the garage and looked back to the east, where there was a faint rainbow, which I also photographed, along with some tall clouds to the south. I noticed nothing unusual during the photo shoot, but when I went inside, downloaded the pictures to my computer and looked at them full-screen, the cylindrical object was evident in a picture taken facing due west.  At first, I thought the object had been blown into the air by the strong winds, and only made jokes about its possibly being a UFO.  I didn't remember ever having seen images of cylindrical UFOs.  But after about a week, I got curious, and found numerous web sites with images of cylindrical UFOs, which is what I now believe the object in the photos was. There was a second photo that showed probably the same object, less clearly.  It was taken from the same position as the first, but facing southwest.  The second photo was taken less than 2 minutes, but longer than 5 seconds after the first.  The first photo was taken at 1/180 of a second, the second at 1/100 of a second.  In the second image, the object appeared to be somewhat larger, but the lens was zoomed in slightly compared to the first. I am not aware of any other potential observers of this object.  I saw no objects first hand, only after displaying the photos on my computer.

It was completely dark..no aircraft lights at all and completely silent.  If, I held out my arm, it would take my entire hand to fully block the object. It blended in perfectly to the night sky.  It was more like watching an invisible shape blocking the sky behind it as it moved.  I watched the object travel from west to east until it disappeared in the distace and darkness (about 15 seconds).  I don't believe that anyone could have seen this object unless you just happened to be looking dir! ectly at it, as I was.  I feel kinda freaked out because, #1.  I definitely saw this. 2.  Because I know that I definitely saw this, what was it?, and what is it doing?  This is not a joke.  I am someone who knows the value of the scientific method.

The objects on the side of the craft “fluttering wings” started moving more rapidly before the craft darted off.  It changed colors constantly and was very creepy.

As we proceeded to get closer, the light, we noticed, was actually 2 spot lights.  At that point we thought it was a plane, the lights being the 2 wing lights.

I know that a plane's wing lights flicker, but they don't shoot across the plane's wings!  At this point, I was sure it was an alien craft.  I kept my eye on this thing the whole trip, and as we came to the stop light, we were directly beneath it, as it hadn't moved the entire time we were driving.  I actually rolled the window down and looked up into the sky to witness yet another light, which formed a perfect triangle with the other 2 light! s, and was sitting still in the sky as of yet.  I said to my friend, ""This is a UFO, an alien craft!""  As I said this, the craft then (after 15 minutes of keeping my eye on it) began to move slowly with the wide end of the triangle as the front of the craft, shooting lights and all, and headed south toward the Monee/Peotone area.  I took my eyes off of the craft and then immediately noticed 6 or 7 more identical lights in the sky around the Frankfort/Mokena/Tinly Park area.

It just looked like it was on a straight path. There were no other lights on it and there was no “tail” like a comet. I continued to watch it until it literally faded out. It became almost a translucent grayis/silver color then faded and disappeared. October 6th Monday night about 7:10pm, I was out in the yard with my dogs and I noticed another light. It was a very white light, round and it appeared as if the light were on a craft facing me, however it didn’t appear to be moving in my direction. It was traveling more North to South, and appeared to stop and go, it did this twice but very briefly. I looked at a star that was by the moon for comparison, and it was about the same size. I watched the light for about 2 minutes, then it just got smaller and smaller  and was gone. As it was getting smaller, it did not appear to be going faster. Note: I’m checking satellite positions for this region and time periods. There is a small airport nearby, but no sound was detected.

It was dusk, around 8pm.  Beyond Barometer mountain a very brightly glowing amber light, as bright as a sodium commercial fishing light, caught my eye.  I guess I thought it could be a plane at first but it struck me as odd so I kept an eye on it.  The light was motionless against (on? Hovering above?) the top of a mountain where I knew there were no houses. I blinked my headlights and pulled over at Speedee Kraft, closer to the foot of this mountain, to watch the light be joined on the same horizontal plane by two red lights and a very faint white one, then alternately blink off, then reappear seconds later at the TOP of the mountain as one light (it struck me as one light/source for some reason, not separate). I would estimate the light to have been maybe 200 feet in the air at its lowest point, and less than half a mile away from me.   I know there were no sounds associated with this sighting since I got out of the car and watched it for fewer than five entire minutes, then drove home where I was expected.  The lights blinked off whenever I framed the scene with my camera phone. The lights continued on when I got in my car.  I noticed oncoming drivers on the road going very slowly and some pulled over, possibly watching what I had witnessed. The lights traveled too fast to strike me as a light attached to people on foot.  It could have been someone plaing with a toy helicopter, but it was so quiet and I think I was close enough to hear it if so. There are no houses or structures on that mountain.  It is clifflike-steep and is carpeted in thick, 6 foot and taller bushes.  I went to the mountain the next day and did not see any trails or structures.

However later I witnessed something else that might possibly be related. After I finished with the report I returned to the living room to watch some TV before going to sleep. While I was sitting there a extremely bright white flash of light (1-2 secs in duration) illuminated my entire living room. This happened at about 12:40am. At night I always keep the blinds on my windows open, and this flash of light was evenly distributed and completely lit the room during the flash, so much so that I remember squinting because it was so bright. The light did not sweep across the room in beams as a car's headlights might, but it EVENLY light the room in an intense white light. It was like night became day, literally. Immediately following the flash my two dogs became very agitated, pacing around and whining loudly. So I get up and quickly go out onto my back porch, where I had observed the incident earlier, wondering what the hell that was. However, I could observe nothing either in the sky or any traffic such as cars or other people up that might explain the flash. My dogs seemed to quickly spot something down by the fence, though it was too dark for me to see anything, because they went tearing off downstairs and outside after something barking like crazy. After a few seconds they stopped and came back upstairs and settled down. I also went back inside unable to explain where the flash of light came from, what caused it, or why it was so intense or perfectly dispersed evenly through the room. I went to bed a short time later and at about 1:45 am 7/11/08 as I lay in bed with my eyes lightly closed trying to fall asleep, another bright flash of white light, identical to the first, illuminated my entire bedroom (again I sleep with my blinds open). It was so bright I saw it even with my eyes closed and openned them in time to confirm the flash of light for a second time. Again my dogs, who were sleeping too, became extremely agitated again (more so than I have ever seen them, and more so than the first time) and began pacing around the bedroom whining and I could tell they were nervous/scared. This time they didn't run downstairs barking after anything. It was almost like they were trying to stay close to me. Their behaviour was really strange and both times coincided with the two flashes. So I get out of bed a little spooked, because I just saw this flash again and my dogs were really agitated again. I looked out through the blinds and again could not see anything that might have caused the light. No cars, no low flying airplanes, no neighbors up, just calm darkness. After the second flash startled me out of bed i wasn't taking any chances, I made sure my guns were ready to go and I had a very difficult time going bac! k to bed last night to say the least. I really don't know if this incident is related to the one I had earlier or not, but I thought it was still important to inform you just in case. I can't explain it, but just tell you what I expeirienced. It was really weird, and it didn't give me a good feeling at all. I mean the room in both occassions went from being totally dark to COMPLETELY and perfectly illuminated, like the brightest day ever, and then went away and darkness returned. Just two quick bright flashs of white light(1-2 secs) about an hour apart from each other. I have no idea, completely stumped and a little shaken. Never seen anything like it. I just can't get over how intense and evenly distributed it was, and how it completely bathed the inside of my house in bright white light. It went from being total darkness to intense illumination that let me see the two rooms I was in completely clearly for 1-2 secs and then back to total darkness!",2008-08-12T00:00:00,32.9516,-97.1515

The Kurseong police took the object in its custody in the presence of the Kurseong BDO Mr Manish Verma today. The administration has contacted the Air Force authorities at Bagora near Kurseong for the identification of the object. The object landed near the house of Mr Hari Kumar Chettri at around 6.30 p.m. yesterday. “The object was hot glowing orange when it fell with a thud. Its heat turned the tin wall of my cattle shed red,” Mr Chhetri, said. According to the Kurseong BDO, the object has changed colour after cooling down. “The object is not more than 15 kg, is blackish in colour and has several concentric rings,” Mr Verma said. “What is curious is that the object did not create a major crater although it fell from the sky,” he added. Curiosity prevails in the area about the identity of the object. Many believe it is a part of a satellite. n SNS ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

When I was waiting in the van for my friend to come back from inside the house, I decided to take out my camera phone (LG Viewty) and take some snap shots of my lovely face. Then, coz I was still waiting and wanted to fill in my time with something, I turned on the video camera. When I did this, I saw a black dot on the viewing screen; it was moving around a bit like it was floating, similar to the way a balloon would float if it had found an area of sky of equal pressures. But when I looked at the sky where this black dot was on the viewing screen, I couldn't see it. It was obviously there, I could see it on the viewing screen. But I couldn't see it with my eyes. I triple checked between the viewing screen and the sky! I could only see it through the viewing screen. Also, I could see it rotating spherically along every axis as if it were an inflatable beach ball hovering above an air vent; the type you see in Techniquest, and its shape was changing from spherical (round) to slightly oblong (squeezed round) and back again, as it rotated (the image while recording was much clearer than the recorded image which has been pixelated). I zoomed in next which was the obvious next step, and I wondered if it would do anything a bit strange. It moved from one point to another in such a way that cancelled out the possibility of it being a balloon. You can see from the slow motion video that the object arcs to the left and down, creating a circular motion before moving up and right, coming to rest in another place. Then after it bobs around for a bit, it creates exactly the same arcing circular motion as before but in the opposite direction, zooming away from that place to another off screen. Can you see it coming back onto the screen as I'm getting out of the van? I didn't even see it zooming away the first time as my mate was distracting me asking me something, and I was looking away from the screen. I'm just so glad I got that shot!

Due to the clarity of the skies, witnesses had difficulty in determining scale and altitude. It was estimated to be about the size of a quarter coin when compared against a human hand held up in comparison. The witnesses were quite certain that the object remained motionless for several minutes, as if hovering.  During the event, they saw what appeared to be a commercial airliner flying near the object at a much higher altitiude. The object was a third smaller than the aircraft as it transited the area. The object displayed no movement, appeared to be light colored, with a haze around it. The object reportedly changed from round to a tubular or cigar shape.  No noise could be associated with the object.  Witnesses appeared to be credible, lucid and sober. This area is very populated with commercial aircraft.

I was between Spalding Rd. and Holcomb Bridge Rd around 2 pm.  I saw a large rectangular object about 50 x 100 ft. in length and width but no discernible thickness and was maybe 2-300 ft. in the air.  It was difficult to determine its speed (since I am not familiar with the speeds of flying objects) but I would guess around 100 mph. The object was very white in color. It was traveling East to West and would have been somewhere above Peachtree Corners Circle (maybe a little further North of that). I watched it for approximately 2-3 minutes before it disappeared behind some trees that blocked my line of sight.  As I moved further South on the road I kept looking for it but I never saw the object again.  This was not the 1st time I believe to have seen a UFO.  Around 1963-65 I was at the construction site of Durham Memorial Baptist Church on Freedom Drive in Charlotte N.C.  Further West on Freedom Drive (maybe 2-3 miles) I saw a large cigar shaped object (definitely not a blimp) hovering in the air for 10-15 minutes. It was many feet above the ground, but at that distance it was impossible to tell how high.  It was much, much longer than a blimp and had short stubby wings.  It had an iridescent glow that varied in color - pink, blue, red, green - the colors were undulating (mixing, washing back and forth over the object).

My initial thought was that it was a weather balloon. I was fascinated, stopped filling the containers and picked up my binoculars from inside the house. The object moved slowly so i visualised its path, moving from north-west to south-east. Looking back at what i thought was a solitary object i observed at least 20-30 similar bright objects moving slowly in the same direction, but in a random pattern. I called to my wife, who was upstairs,but by the time she realised what I hoped she would see as well, the objects had disappeared. My initial reaction was that what i had seen would be easily explained. I telephoned RAF Benson in Oxon. who informed me that they did not think it was anything weather related, but they gave me the telephone no. of the headquarters of the meteorological office in Exeter. They were interested, but could not offer any clues as to what i had observed. I have looked on various websites to see of anything similar has been reported, but again no luck.

Around 04:45 this morning, I let the dog out in the backyard and saw this very bright star. That was my original thought, that it was just a very bright star. It somehow grabbed my attention, obviously, or I would not be writing this. This is a small town and very dark at night to where you can always see stars in the night sky, any given night, so that is normal, and yes some “stars” appear to flicker as this had seemed to do but in retrospect to the others around it from a “distance” appeared as looking as a star. It appeared to look that far away, so I thought. So I just could not stop watching it...and then, I could not believe what I was seeing. It began moving up and to the right REAL slow, I mean REAL slow and a trail of white light came from behind it and in its appearance it still remained as to look as a star would as it moved up and to the right. I was thinking to myself, I hear no chopper blades, so it can not be a chopper. I was trying to equate logic to what I was seeing while watching it. The fact that it was moving that slow is what really shocked me about it. So I had to see what this thing was, It was cold as I stood there from inside with the back door open, and had no shirt on and ran to the couch to put it on. Why is this important, well because of this I did not see it “turn” towards the direction of my house and then when I came back it was flying over the house at a slow speed. A speed to me that if a plane was moving that slow it would not have the propulsion to really fly. It was in the shape of a triangle. It made no noise whatsoever and it was so smooth as it was moving. It was like a bird, slow and just gliding through the sky. There was a BRIGHT white light on the left of the triangle, in the middle there was a small BRIGHT white light which blinked only white in sequence and on the right there was a HUGE flashing BRITE white light. And then as it passed over I ran to the front of the House to watch it out the big bay w! indow an d I saw it fly off into the distance through the darkened clouds and it was gone. Then I recorded my description in audio on my cell phone, and then I went outside into the backyard again replaying what I had just seen. Then I hear and see a small plane off in the distance about the same height this triangle was and I was thankful, because I could hear it, I saw the red light blinking light on it and I could analytically without question differentiate the attributes of both the triangle craft and the plane. There was no red blinking light on the triangle craft and as I stated before NO noise. I am still in a shock status here and I am hoping that someone else here in this area saw this thing and can confirm it. Shalom",2009-01-10T00:00:00,27.6387,-81.4048

On this evening we observed a smooth silver oval object flying silently along the top of the mesa.  It moved at a rate slower than a weather satellite or a commercial jet, and left no contrail. We had been looking at the planet Jupiter to the southwest, and commented that this object was larger than that, with a brighter magnitude.  We watched, thinking at first it was a meteor.  But the object traveled horizontally and left no tail. It traveled along the mesa top approximately 300 feet at a steady rate and then vanished, disappeared into a cloudless sky.

This object was also a silver oval, and descended at a similar rate of speed behind another mesa to the south of our town.  When I first observed this object it was approximately 300 feet above the horizon, shining like a star, but with smooth margins. I watched as it descended at a slow rate behind the southern mesa, taking about ten minutes to go behind the rim.  I thought it was an odd meteor, dismissed the sight, and went about the day.

They described two objects, one bright red the other white, neither one blinking. One sitting still white the other circling. I always carry binoculars with me and was able to locate the two objects they described. The two objects were directly overhead, very high in the sky but their exact height was difficult to determine as there were no clouds, blue sky and no other aircraft in the area to allow proportion.

This is the first of the two encounters experienced this month by me, the only two in my lifetime that I am aware of. I am a full-time student and the other witness, my father, is employed full-time. I have not inquired further into any UFO experiences he has had but nothing has ever been mentioned. He is a very logical thinker and it is a crucial part of his profession. He cannot explain what we witnessed but does not hold any beliefs of it being extra-terrestrial. It was approximately 8:00 PM here in Bainbridge Island, WA when the incident occurred. A more specific date and time can be traced if you were to examine what was on television at the moment, which was a Los Angeles Lakers game being broadcast on TNT. A rainy night that me and my father spent watching the game, in a room with large windows taking up the majority of the wall. The view leads into a landscaped garden which extends into a wooded area. Past this area that extends a few hundred feet is another backyard that is not visible due to large trees. A timeout occurred in the game and my father took the opportunity to get a drink from the kitchen. As he stood up and started to exit the room, an intense bright light flashed to fill the entire room. The light came from directly in front of me and appeared to me to have come from somewhere within the landscaped area. The flash was described by both me and my father as similar to a camera flash, and that is what he thought it was at first. I suggested lightening but we both concluded it wasn’t that due to the lack of thunder and way it shined. It had shined into the room as if it was a flashlight, and by the time we had decided what it wasn’t, the TV switched from the game to a test emergency broadcast. It stumbled between that and static till it settled on an address being given by President Obama. Me and my father were confused and both had a strange feeling when a minute later an unmarked black helicopter flew over head with it’s searchlight on. A few minutes later it sw! itched back to the game on TNT with no explanation of the emergency broadcast test. Things continued as normal after that.

At exactly 20:05 hours on the evening of December 5th, 2008, I was in my back yard walking my dogs along with family cats.  Only lights on was backdoor light.  Dogs were running around yard as usual.  What drew my attention to object I witnessed, was one of my cats, who would normally stay distance from me, ran towards me and stopped right by my right leg.  She sat down and was looking up over the roof of house.  I looked at the cat, thinking she was probably just looking at plane lights or maybe a bird so something.  She kept looking, so then I looked up to see what she was seeing. What I believed I saw at first, was a mass of bird flying over, and more than likely geese, since the formation was sort of looked liked a shape of geese migrating.  But then reality hit me.  It was moving at approximately 10 to 20 mph, almost parallel to my street, but when I focused on it, I then could see, that it had mass, and structure of a wedge shape.  It was close enough that I could get a base size from comparing it to the roof of my home.  The overall length was approximately 100 to 150 feet long, and height was approximately 7 to 10 feet, and it was only 100 to 200 feet from the ground.  I was looking at the right lower quarter, from bow to stern.  There weren’t any lights or any sound what-so-ever emitting from the craft. The right side was visible because of the lights of homes and a few street lights carried to that height.  I also had a small private aircraft flying at one to two thousand feet at about 2 miles southwest of our location, so I could get some variable and we have high pecan trees which also gave me some comparison to height from the ground. What was apparent, the side wasn’t a smooth surface.  I say this because you could see dark and then somewhat lighter shades.  This to me could have been either two assumptions:  1.  The surface was painted, as we do some of our military aircraft, so it will blend in with the sky (clouds lighter and darker) or 2.  the surface had angles on it which would show lighter for the parts protruding out and dark for the area that was indented. This is similar to our stealth aircraft for displacing radar.  The light of homes and street lights were barely hitting the surface of the object but it was enough to make out the details. I yelled at my wife, who was inside.  When she came out, the object had only moved ¼ of our block down the street.  I tried to have her follow my arm movement to look down the length of it to be able to see it.  By the time she was in sync with my movement the craft had gained some altitude and was moving away.  The rear of the craft seemed sort of blunt, not the shape appendage you would expect from a tails of an airplane.  It then moved away out of sight, not at an accelerated rate but at a constant speed. My background is journalism.  I’ve spent over 6 years on U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and 6 years on Navy Air Stations, documenting Navy fighters and bombers in flight.  I also was piloting Cessna 150 and 172 aircraft years ago when I started pilot training, so I’m used to aircraft design, determining what you visually see before me in order to navigate and anything associated with flight.  And being a photo journalist I’m very good when it comes to attention to detail.  I wasn’t mentally rattled and didn’t lose my composure but the event left me with allot of questions.   A male friend of my wife at her work, who lives in north Dallas County saw something similar, same design, but with more than one object just a few months ago.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

First off, I'm not assuming this is extra-terrestrial.  I think it might have been some kind of rocket, and am primarily looking for ways to check and see if any known launchings were taking place on November 6, 2009, at about 6:50 pm CST near Oklahoma City.  I don't know how to look for that kind of information, since searches online aren't bearing much fruit.  I was driving home with my boyfriend, and for about seven minutes, we drove towards a little pink dot near the sunset.  From far away, I asked my boyfriend what he thought it was, and he guessed maybe Venus.  However, as we got closer, the object got significantly larger.  We only traveled about two miles, so I don&#8217;t think this thing would have been particularly high in the sky.  When we saw it at its closest, it appeared to be two white streams being emitted from a single tiny black dot situated above the streams.  That dot flickered orange frequently.  I&#8217;d pass it off as a jet using its booster from Tinker Air Force Base, but this object did not appear to move.  My boyfriend said it looked like it might be moving slowly upwards, which would make sense if the streams were coming from thrusters.  Unfortunately, I had to turn the car at that point, and we couldn&#8217;t see it anymore.  It had gone from near the horizon to almost directly overhead as it got larger, and once we turned, it was obscured by the car roof.  I rushed home, which probably took about five minutes, grabbed my camera, and ran back out...  But we couldn&#8217;t find it again.  I saw an airplane flying on the horizon near it, when it was still too small to distinguish the streams.  The plane was much smaller than the shape, even then, and looked farther away.  I could also see the plane moving, while I could not observe the object moving.  It seemed terrestrial to me, maybe a rocket taking up a satellite or something.  I just don&#8217;t know where would be close enough to launch something like that, for it to be close enough to visually change so significantly in size after driving only a couple of miles.  If there is anywhere I can check records of what&#8217;s been launched when and where, I&#8217;d really like to check out whatever it was that I saw.  Location information:  When we lost whatever it was, we were facing West and turning South on N 122nd and Memorial in Oklahoma City.  Image information:  I couldn't get a picture, but I did a couple of quick illustrations.  The first shows the shape from far away, when we first saw it, and the airplane behind it.  The second shows how it looked when we saw it at its closest.  I don't see where to attach them to this, but I will email them to the address provided.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,35.47186177914111,-97.52630349693251

I went out to take the garbage July 6 2009 Monday night out and saw a bright light that looked like a star that was sighting in the sky.The light was still non-blinking. Then the light started moving on a North east direction.It looked like it was going down for a swooping movement. This was lower then the clouds as I watched it pass under NOT THROUGH some clouds.I would say where it was between me and the moon it was close enough to hear if it was a plane or jet..because I have seen planes and jets at that distance and heard them also...This was not...no sound..no blinking and the light was yellow to bright white.It did not leave no trail..and there were not many clouds in the sky as it was pretty clear with a huge bright moon.I was thinking of calling the near town airport to see if they had anything land or noticed a blip on the radar...n but did not. I also have seen satellites go ever but this object was way to low for that type of sighting.This light was not moving like a meteor or a any of the space Debre either that would be entering the atmosphere and it was not burning up either.

It was moving entirely to fast to be a plane and also moving to slow to be a shooting star. It proceeded to change its course to direct west and straightened its course, then went out immediatly. After about 30 sec I noticed a much brighter and continuous white light bigger than the first (about 3 times larger.) and also much lower and closer, moving at about the same speed as the first, heading in a north west direction. It proceeded to ascend also and then abruptly faded out like a shooting star about roughly a mile from my position. This was not a shooting star.

It was about 11:33 PM. I looked up overhead and spotted a brilliant orange object, somewhat circular in shape.  It was about half the diameter of the holes punched in three-ring notebook paper held 30"" from the eye. I estimated its altitude at 25K feet or higher.  From my position near the intersection of the Shasta View Drive and Tarmac Road, at 40*34'49N X 122*19'26W, the object appeared to be at 85 degrees above the horizon to the SSW.  Judging by its altitude, it was probably directly over the southwestern margins of the city limits of Redding, California. At first, its coloration was steady and unchanged; the object was stationary.  But as I watched, it began to change shape, with several smaller orange objects coming from it, rapidly separating from the main object to a short distance then momentarily flashing and winking out, never to be seen again. This happened about  four different times. The main object would alternately appear as a circular shape then dim slightly from a bright orange color to a bright red and back again, and as it did so, it took on the appearance of multiple spheres clustered together; very much like the oft-cited theodolite camera footage shot near Area 51 some years ago. But then the large object quickly winked out itself, going from bright orange to red, then to a brownish hue and vanished completely. It was completely out of sight for about a second and would suddenly flash and reappear in another location a short distance away, where it again stood motionless.  This on-off-on and sudden relocation event happened about six times.  Held at arm's length, these ""jumps"" would appear about three inches from point to point.  At an altitude of 25,000 feet altitude or more, this represents a jump of about a half mile or more, (transitioned instantly). I debated whether to run and grab my high-powered binoculars, but was afraid that the object would disappear before I could return to view the phenomenon.  The object moved in several directions in this disappear-reappear sequence and finally, as I was on my cell phone yelling for my girlfriend out in Palo Cedro to go out and look, it began moving in a south easterly direction and vanished just as she was just stepping outside. The sighting lasted about three minutes. I saw the International Space Station (ISS) pass overhead moving in a northeasterly direction about an hour earlier, so I know this was neither a sighting of nor mis-identification of that. After checking with the administration at the Redding Municipal Airport, I was told they have a recently installed ARTS-3C radar system that is ""slaved"" to the TRACON System at the Oakland Bay Airport, but they have no provisions for recording the returns locally.  I checked the internet for live radar feeds, but I guess there aren't any available to ""mere civilians"".  Maybe it might be possible to find out if there is some ATC radar tapes that could be examined for a signature on this.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,40.611439423076924,-122.35183557692308

One of my cats had been gone for a couple of days.  He did that from time to time, but after three days I became worried and called for him off and on throughout the day.  Early the next morning just as the sun was beginning to rise, I noticed something dark in the grass near the road.  The form was not there the night before.  Since he was a black cat I thought that he might be sleeping there.  I began walking down the driveway calling his name.  I had a flashlight and shone it on the dark form in the grass.  At first it looked like a pile of leaves, but as I walked around the form I could see his face.  He was covered with live oak leaves.  We don’t have live oaks in our yard, but there are live oak leaves all over the ground of the empty lot across the street. The sun was getting brighter and I could see that my cat was missing a lot of hair and I could follow a trail of tufts of his hair that led back across the street to the empty lot.  It looked like he was dragged across the street with his tail pointing away from the lot making me think that he was dragged by it.  There aren’t any dogs roaming the neighborhood, but I looked at his tail which had become almost entirely hairless to see if there were any bite marks, but I saw none. My cat was missing his left ear and it looked like the ear had been cut off and was still bloody.  I could smell that he was decomposing, so I went to get a shovel to pick him up to be buried.  As I turned him over and his mouth was wide open and full of maggots.  All of his body was covered with maggots, except the ear that was bloody.  I don’t understand why the maggots wouldn’t be in the ear. I would not think any further than it being a wild animal attack, but with no bite marks and the ear was cleanly severed from his head.  I have reported several sightings including the circular object that was in our neighborhood and followed my car down the street, so I suspect that this may not be so simple a death.

At first I noticed an orange light travelling from the NW slowely cruising towards the East. The bright light dimmed and got brighter at random. It then stoped and hovered at an unkown altitude. With the naked It did not have a shape other than looking like a bright star or airplane with landings lights down at a distance. I did attempt to take video with my camera however it was too dark to do so. However I did take still pictures in ISO mode that reavealed more than I expected after zoom-in. The first picture shows a clear half circle shaped object. The second a posibly distorted image of the craft-- hard to discribe. Then a third picture resembles an object exploding from each side with a unaffected center.  Now I mentioned 10 objects, and here is a bizzar twist. The main ship released mulitple other craft or objects... they dropped from the bottom of the main craft, each dropping hundreds ( there was a red beam or gas emitted from each smaller craft as they fell)of feet before flying away in a controlled manner in a North direction. I know it sounds crazy!  The main craft then simply dissapeared. After the sightings I proceeded to take a picture of a planet (jupiter maybe, similar brightness to the object)or star, I took a picture of an aircraft flying in the area, and finally the moon as a reference or comparison check for a technician. Other large commercial aircraft were flying around during this time. Perhaps there are reports from pilots or other! viewers. Upon request I can send digital copies of the image for analysis.

There were no other lights surrounding it, no noise and as many airports operate in this area, planes are easily distinguishable from this.

I immediately noticed 3 diamond shaped light configurations in the northwest corner of the sky towards Newport Beach, CA.  I of course stopped and just stared.  They were moving very fluidly, counter clockwise and then clock wise, back forth with no apparent set pattern- like kites would do.  The lights were a very bright light blue. They would go completely off and them come back on.   I couldn't make out exactly what type of craft they were on.  I watched for about a minute and then two of them disappeared and just one remained.  I saw it go behind a cloud and then reappear...so they had to be at least at cloud level.  They were quite high in the sky because I was seeing them way over trees and building tops.  I knew immediately that what I was seeing just by the shear movement of them was not an airplane, helicopter or military craft.  I was already running quite late so I got in the car and headed to meet my friend, while I was driving I tried to hang my head out the window to see the remaining object.  I wound up right under it when I got to the intersection and could make out a faint outline of some sort of a craft that looked grayish.  I was a little worried at that point, realizing I was right under it.  Then the traffic light turned and it was above my car so I could no longer see it.  I called two friends and tried to get them to go outside and se if they could see it as well, but didn't reach them in time.  Southern California is a big place with a huge population and I'm quite sure lots of other people had to see this as well.

As we parked our vehicle in our driveway and stepped out we both noticed an extraordinarily large bright light in the sky just below the cloud ceiling.  The size of the UFO/light in relation to distance in the sky was larger than several passenger airplanes combined. We were facing due south and we looked up – it was approximately at 120 degrees angle (if 90 degrees is zenith). The light was already moving extremely quick, far faster than any airplane.  The best description of how bright the light was relates to the science experiments done in school when burning magnesium.  This light was not a flare, was consistently bright, did not have a chemical trail and left no sound/wake. As soon as we noticed the single, very large, bright light, it took approximately 1.5 seconds and it moved due south at a high velocity.  Within that 1.5 seconds it had moved from our position we noted to a point in the horizon we could no longer see – it had in essence disappeared.  The best description of the velocity is similar to watching either star wars or star trek when the ship moves to hyperdrive/warp speed. Yet, there was no sonic boom typical of high velocity aircraft.  The time of the incident was 6:15 pm according to our cell phones.

We've left the century of anxiety, and entered the century of incompetence.

Anyways, Pete, I saw some ice sculptures being made in front the Capitol building in Concord. Leonardo DaVinci couldn't have improved on those ice castles. Then I understood where criop circles were coming from.  The original website is on the web, and I'm too tired to search for it, but those guys show exactly how they do it.

Their destination points alter around 15 to 20 degrees.  They can be seen through the clouds (the temperature is 60.9° with the threat of rain). He said he was watching a movie about a tornado in New York and preparing a late dinner when, ironically--the wind suddenly picked up which alerted him to look outside.  He said he noticed that the wind was blowing so hard that the tops of the trees were almost touching the ground—that is when he said he saw the orbs and called me: Ok, he’s going out onto his balcony, he said he sees an Air Force jet plane moving at high speed that just disappeared at the point in the clouds where one set of the lights came together. He says that he can definitely tell the obvious difference between the plane and the orbs because of the landing/strobe lights on the bottom of the jet—the orbs do not have such lights.  Plus the jet has an obvious light pattern as opposed to a solitary point of light like the orbs. He continues to watch until. . . 9:45pm—Ok, now there are only 4 lights left. . . 10:27pm—all the lights are now gone. . . We are finally able to discuss this sighting and have come to the conclusion of the possibility that the lights might be something sent up by the Air Force to seed the clouds. . .?

There was an object over the skies of Las Vegas, in the the South East part of the city. The object appeared to have a saucer rim, which surrounded a sphere on the top and bottom of the object. This object performed several different aerobatic maneuvers that are impossible for any type of fixed wing aircraft. It hovered for periods of time, some ten to fifteen seconds. It moved on all three axes. It would move to the left and to the right, as well as up and down and backwards and forwards. I am a student with a passion for aviation, so I know that this could not have been anything civil or commercial. This object also emmited lights. It would be white for most of the time, but it did change several times, most notably in the spherical portions of the craft. IT would turn to like a purplish-pink color, and then back to white. I first observed this object when driving my car to the gas station, but never made it there. When there was a break between houses, and there was n a clear line of sight, I noticed a lighted object hovering near the South Point casino.  After a few moments, I realized that it was stationary. I pulled my car over and began to observe it for several minutes. It then started to move slowly to the left, then to the right. It began to fade, but then its color intensified. At which case I drove home. From there, my mother and my two cousins were outside, startled by the fact that there was an Unidentified Flying Object in our presence. It continued to change colors, and then fade as if it were shrinking. We continued to observe the object for ten minutes before it moved out o view. I am a nineteen year old college student attending UNLV. I also have a knowledge of aviation and astronomical phenomena. I do know that this was neither a civilian aircraft or an astronomical event. Also, this is not the first time I have observed a UFO. It has occurred two previous times, once in New York about eight years ago, and the other was back in March of 2008 by the UNLV campus.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

I assumed it was a motorcycle pulling onto the road off an adjoining dirt road. I watched it for about a mile in my mirror then all of a sudden a second light appeared stacked on top of it. I looked at my passenger and asked her to look back and see if she could see it too, because no vehicle has lights that are stacked like that. She looked back and saw it as well so I knew I wasn't crazy. The top light went out and the one light was left as we kept watching. As we kept driving we watched it and it seemed to gain immense speed and seemed to be 20 feet (MAYBE) behind my car and then backed off really fast and kept playing this chasing game for a few miles. Then as soon as a car approached in the other lane it would go dark. Every five or ten minutes it would reappear after another car passed in the opposite lane, but only 3-5 cars passed in the other lane our whole 3hr. trip.

I've spent a lot of time observing satellites, stars, planets, meteors and aircraft, and nothing has baffled me like this. I was outside my house smoking a cigarette, and I decided to move a lawn chair out into the yard so I could look at the sky. It was the perfect summer night. All I could hear were crickets, and the skies were clear. I was looking about 40 degrees up to the east, and that's when I saw it appear. It was such a shock to me that I can't tell if it rapidly decelerated to a speed at which it was visible (Who knows?) or if it just ""turned on its lights"". I literally jumped in my seat!  We've all seen meteors, they reach a point at which the friction and pressure of the atmosphere builds up heat which produces incandescent light that we see for usually no more than a fraction of a second. If this was a meteor, then I'm Santa Claus. It was already moving when it appeared (like a meteor), but its brightness didn't fade (the lights did pulsate, however), there was no rapid descent, and I was able to follow it to the horizon. Fireballs have been visible over several states before they either impact the ground (or someone's unfortunate car), but this object wasn't as bright as Jupiter, it left no trail, and nothing was seen breaking off of it. I could be one of the lucky few who have witnessed an earth-grazing fireball, but I doubt it. Here's why: the object had red and white lights, but not lights as you'd expect to see on an aircraft. They weren't points of light; rather there was a center that was brighter than the periphery around it. That's the best I can explain it. The center part wasn't even that bright, but the smooth glow of the light around it really set it apart from anything I'd ever seen. This object definitely had some size to it. Let's assume this was something entering the atmosphere. From my point of view, the apparent size of the object was no smaller than a commercial airliner at cruising altitude, possibly larger. I'm no expert on which altitudes objects start to glow at as they enter the atmosphere, but it’s definitely more than 40,000 feet, making this thing at least as big as an aircraft, if indeed it is something entering the atmosphere. There are lots of variables involved, but that seems logical to me. As meteors have not developed stealth technology since they are essentially rocks, I would have to imagine that this object would appear on radar if it was nothing more than a very large meteor. The object was moving northward, possibly to the NNW. It made no sound whatsoever. If this was an aircraft, it would have to AT LEAST be going mach 1 at roughly 10,000 feet. That's as slow and as low as this thing could have been going. The higher up this thing actually was, the faster it was actually going. Common sense, right? I should have been able to hear something if this was an aircraft. B-2's and F-117's are pretty quiet, but they're also subsonic. All I know for sure is that I saw something extremely unusual travel from 40 degrees above the horizon in the eastern sky to the northern horizon in about five seconds or less. The time at which the event took place eliminates a satellite in low orbit being illuminated by the sun, so either this thing made its own light or was glowing from the heat of entering the atmosphere, possibly both.  Please call or email me if you have any questions, or if I'm flat-out wrong about something. Thank you for looking into it for me.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,32.156058730158726,-94.73838253968255

I am a writer, metaphysician, and former professional journalist with the Hearst Newspaper Corp, CBS and NBC TV-news affiliates and would not joke about something like this. This is history being made!  ************************************************************  (my nickname),  Okay, I was just out there again. The sky was real clouded up, but not like normal clouds! More like how chemtrails are, a trail that swells up and gets fatter as it spreads out.I could see two of them, and yes, definatly what a dogfight would look like!  What I (we) saw earlier looked like a very large triangular shaped craft with several white lights around it and one red light. But they were blinking or rotating. The other ones were very small in comparison to those.Because it looked like they were flying right at them and then they would turn away sharply then the big craft would sort of chase it and then shoot out the opposite direction really fast.At one time we counted 6 of the large ones.  I am so glad my step-dad was there to see it too, I would of thought I was seeing things and not ever told anyone else. But I know what we saw!

If so, this mirrors what a few people have seen using expensive, military-style, night-vision scopes. They actually had a show on Coast-to-Coast about this several months ago, but I've never heard of anyone being able to see something like this without night-vision equipment. I know this sounds like something out of Star Trek, but the U.F.O.s must have had their cloaking systems down?  Remember how I told you recently that there are good E.T.s and others? Well, some who are supposed to be in-the-know say they have been fighting around the Earth lately because, believe it or not, and again this sounds like something out of a Sci-Fi movie, our planet supposedly is the site of the last struggle between the Light and the dark.  You, (friend's name), may have witnessed the opening salvos of the open Battle for Planet Earth.  Is this real or what?  Wow! You have witnessed history, Jeanne, and I have been able to tell the world about it. This really is something else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What else can I say?

It had (I saw) 4 lights two yellow ones (normal) and two blue ones. The way it was maneuvering told me that it is not a plane, although it could have been(unlike any I have seen before). Quite exhilarating, mostly cause of the movement. I said to my friend: ""hey look at that plane"". Cause it was a specific craft and I wanted to hear him agree with me that it is a plane so that I don't trick myself into thinking I'm seeing something else. He replied: ""dude that's not a plane it's a space ship"". I stick with my story that it was a UFO and not a space ship. It could have been a plane or a space ship but I had no evidence of either. Only thing I saw was something I've never seen before. I saw it disappear behind the buildings(about 30 meters tall the buildings) and then I turned right into the street where I was to drop my friend off. At this point my car is going parallel with the craft, but I do not see it. I ask my friend where it is and he replies there it is in front of us. It appeared as if it had gone straight following a course it took just before it disappeared behind the buildings. Now I saw it in front of us at the same altitude and with the distance being aproximatelly 100-200 meters, flying off. I could still see the lights, 4 of them in a row and a half sphere like shape of the craft, but I couldn't make out the front and what I saw of the craft was dark and unilluminated. First thing I saw was 4 lights under the craft, but after it flew away slowly I saw 4 lights at the back of it and in a straight line. Hard to describe. The flight movements were kinda like that of a fighter jet, but it was done slowly it seemed. I was smoking marijuana all the time before then, actually for 7 hours straight, I think it's important to note.

Rate of speed was such that the object took 15 minutes to travel from a point directly above me to a point @ 45 deg. N-NW where I lost sight of it due to haze in the atmosphere and wispy clouds moving in (very quickly the sky changed from nice and clear to grayish and scattered clouds). The clouds came in from W-NW moving E-SE. I don't know if the wind at higher altitudes ever travels in opposite/different directions than the wind at lower altitudes. If it does, then the object could have been a balloon(s). If it was traveling against the wind then I don't know what it could've been. I've never seen a satellite travel from SE to NW, but maybe there's one that does. I did manage to snap one photo but it only adds confusion since the object in the photo appears to be four orange lights arranged like a + (plus sign) but so tightly packed that the general shape is circular.  I don't know if this is what it really looked like or if this is some ""digital camera anomaly"" or a result of being improperly focused. Anyway, I just wanted to put it on record in case anybody else saw it. Not a real big deal. Just a flying (silent) object that I could not identify. PS. I did notice that when my camera was struggling to focus just before I pressed the button fully to snap the picture, the image in the viewfinder did all kinds of funny stuff, it showed a faint crescent shape that expanded and then a flash of light and then as it shifted the focus out toward infinity I just snapped it because I didnt think it was going to ever find it.

The moon was to the East as well mostly covered by the clouds.  The sky for the most part was clear however.  These bright randomly flashing lights seemed to be generally in front of the moon, in the clouds and in the clear sky as well.  Within a fairly small area of the sky.

It seemed like a small electrical storm, random like lightning, but there was no streaks of light, just flashing dots of light. Not only in the! clouds but in the clear sky as well. Much brighter than any star. I was quite baffled as to what it could possibly be.  As they randomly flickered for maybe two minutes they quickly moved South and out of sight.  Faster than anything that I have seen move across the sky. Well almost like a falling star without a tail, but multiple flashing lights. I found myself so entranced by the lights that I drifted lanes on the highway.  There is no chance that it was a satellite, or any airplane (not even the fastest conceivable), or a falling star, or an electrical storm, to high in the sky to be anything man made.

Evening of 11-5-09, I was outside smoking again, talking to my brother, and another triangle, a bit lighter in color this time (as the background sky was lighter,) flew right over me from due north to due south, between 300-400 feet AGL.  Width was an estimated 25-30 feet wide, and again, the bottom of the craft seemed to blend with the background with uncanny similarity.  It's like watching a triangle shaped  ""Schwartzneggar Predator"" pass overhead. This one was a bit different from the other (which had no lights, no noise, and a bit darker to match the night overhead) as once it went overhead and I was looking at the rear, this time there were two very, very, very faint circular glows on the rear. If you've ever seen kid's phosphorescent stick-ons to where they're just about completely faded out in the dark - that's about the same color, type of glow, and lack of intensity.  Glowed just enough to barely make out.  Again, absolutely zero noise. This one blended with the sky once past overhead really quickly, unlike conventional aircraft that you can watch for many seconds as it drops toward the horizon.  This ""camoflage"" really works well. I'm 59 years old, and except seeing two F-4's on full afterburner chasing a brilliantly shiny no-wing thing very low and over this same town in about 1966, these two events are the only things I've seen my entire life.  Two triangles, a tad different, traversing the same area, and both were in the ""winter"" when the skies were very cool and clear. Last year's triangle track would have carried it over the northern portion of the runway at Hurlburt Field. This one was going due south, only a couple miles of the Gulf of Mexico. Damnedest things I've ever seen. Gentlemen, we (somebody) has some very fine top technology aircraft that don't use jet engines, entirely soundless, blend with the backgoune night sky, and if they don't cross your field of vision, you won't see or hear them.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,30.438377777777777,-86.6292269005848

I was instantly shot down by him saying no thats not it as he points to the south of where I was looking, it was another light, bright orange moving very fast.

We all decided that was the space station, but then moved our eyes back to the bright orange light having no clue what it could be.  My gramp was in the air force for years and he said he'd never seen anything like that, It then move out of our view over the tree/city line.

At around 7:40 pm CDT, I drove to a corner store, about one mile from my house, for a package of little cigars and a coke to see what remained of our first ‘white Christmas’ in 83 years (before I was born!). As I returned to my car from inside the store where I had visited with the owner for a few minutes or so, something caught my eye low in the due northern sky: a yellowish/white broad light that was not shining at me, or out in front of the object, but was ‘glowing’ downwards, but not casting a ‘beam’ of light! I thought, how strange, but then the brisk cold air got to me so I hurried on home to see if I could get a better look at this, thing. Less than five minutes later, or, about 7:46 to 7:48 pm CDT, I parked my car at home and walked to my porch and looked up to the lower southern sky and saw this HUGE rear end of what could not have been an airplane, as it was only a few hundred feet off the ground, and the rear lights were perfectly huge!  There were four of them, two yellowish/white and two reddish/white, perfectly circular, spaced one after the other (white, red, white, red) in a roll in shape with a red blinking light in the middle or, possibly in the bottom area, when I thought it was likely an airplane, but I heard no sound whatsoever. What I was looking at, that was gliding so slowly that if it had of been some known aircraft; it would have fallen from the sky, seemed to me to be the rear end of a triangle-shaped UFO I have seen graphics of and some videos of from eyewitnesses. These lights were not bright, did not give off a ‘brightness glow’ nor were they hard to look at, yet they were soft in their illumination. The huge object was almost hovering as it was gliding so slowly. I watched it moving towards the due south, and I know where the due south is from my front yard, having a compass watch that I calculate with every season, plus I know my star charts, being a former Navy SeaL and navigator. These four lights were perfectly round and did not blink at all: only the small red light blinked in an odd manner unlike the belly lights found on traditional aircraft that blink in a continuous series as a warning. I know this from having once worked for Delta Airlines as a Fuel Service Agent. This little red light would blink real fast, and then stop, and then blink real fast a few seconds later, and stop. I was very awed, despite my past in witnessing and videotaping such oddities we call UFOs, standing out in the 30F odd degree cold night air, as I truly believed that I was seeing the rear end of a triangle shaped UFO gliding southwards, ever so slowly. The area where the large lights were located was a perfectly boxed-in area, or squared off with the lights within. Now, I had my camcorder just inside my house on the coffee table, as I had been taking footage of the very rare snow that we had gotten yesterday afternoon, 12/24/2009, for the first time since 1926, as the TV news had related. When my camcorder came to mind, the object had traveled farther away to the due south, although I thought I could get some footage of it. I decided to watch it instead, as if I had of gotten footage by that time of watching it for about four minutes, it would have been seen as simply colored lights that I described above in the cold night air, becoming smaller as it traveled slowly away. CONCLUSION:  This object was too huge and flying too low and silently to have been any known, earthly aircraft! Because of the placement of the huge circular lights to the rear of the object; rule out any earthly aircraft. These were not ‘fixed winged lights’ that shine out in front of airplanes, as this object was heading away from me to the south, plus the fact of its slow rate of speed and freezing night air; rule out a horizontal hot air balloon of any type based upon little to no wind and the object was moving in such a fixed position that it did not vary even slightly!  I affirm that the above is true and correct as I have described.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,32.349870833333334,-97.37565833333333

At first I thought that the lights were just a really clear constellation, but despite their brightness in comparison to other objects, they were also hazy as if each had a fog around them. Each time that I would look back at the cloud ( I was driving in the same general direction each time) I noticed that something about the formation of the lights would change.  For instance, there would be three lights in stead of five or one light instead of five.  Eventually, there were no lights left in the circular pattern around the cloud, and then the cloud seemed to become brighter than before.  By this time, I had pulled over at an overlook point which provided a decent view of a portion of Medina Lake and turned off the ignition, and I could see that the cloud that I had been watching was over the lake.  I watched as a bright, small line of white light stretched out in the center of the largest point of the cloud (the cloud was comparable in shape to a large turkey baster, with the activity taking place at the “bulb” of this cloud “turkey baster”).  The light was a perfectly straight line that then shrunk back to nothing.

I and one of my brothers were visiting our brother in Reno, Nevada over Christmas.  His house is in the Cold Springs Valley area!  I stepped outside his garage to have a cigarette, on the side of his home.  It was still dark outside, but with a faint glow of the sun just barely starting to lighten the sky.  Not knowing exactly which direction his house faces, I will only suggest that I was on the east side of it at this time!  Being a believer of this type of thing, I always watch the skies in the hope that I will see something, and this time I did!  I was looking upwards, and I had high thin clouds to my right, but the skies were mostly clear.  I looked to my left more, and caught a fain object shoot past my field of vision at a very high rate of speed!  And I mean fast!  As I said, maybe only 2 seconds of viewing time!  What ever it was, it was not at an altitude to be lit by any sunlight because there was only a hint of lightening of the sky at this early hour!  And I saw it for such a short time span, than I can't even tell you what shape it was, either!  It was there, and then gone!  It's size I would approximate as being about the size of a pencil eraser, held about 8-10 feet away, looking straight on.  I went inside and told my brothers about this and one suggested that it might have been a bird!  But this was way too fast to be a bird!  And the other, which I tend to partially agree with suggested that it might have been a meteor!  The one problem I have with this is that I don't know a great deal about celestial bodies, but this seemed an awful lot closer to the ground than a meteor!  I would say no farther than 7-9,000ft above me!  I tried to follow it's path, to see if it would reflect any light from somewhere, but, nothing!

At about 2:00 AM GMT, I was awake on the transatlantic flight at the time the cabin lights were dimmed and many people were sleeping and there was very little to no activity going on. I looked out the window at the stars, and noticed three bright red lights overhead in the one- to two-o'clock position in the sky. Thinking this was a reflection of cabin lights, I cupped my hands over my eyes to block out any reflecting light. The lights were bright and clear overhead, so I then immediately thought these were outside lights. I looked down over the wing lights, and noticed that the right wing light was white; since I couldn't see the tail at all from the window, I realized these were not tail lights. In addition, they were overhead, where I had to actually look up from the window,! so I realized these lights were neither part of the plane nor were they land lights, since this was over the ocean. As this was also in the middle of the non-eventful flight, the cruising altitude had not changed, so the three red lights in triangular form must have been at the very least, 60,000 - 80,000 ft. high. The lights also had a blinking pattern which uniformly looped over and over for the ten-minute sighting: the two left side lights blinked once, followed by the top right light; then the two top lights blinked once, followed by the bottom left light; then all three lights together blinked in unison. This pattern of blinking was happening during the entire time. In addition, unlike seeing another plane in flight, these red lights were stationary - with the Delta airplane moving away. It was like seeing bright blinking lights on the ground - but in reverse. The blinking lights were above and we were flying below, moving more and more out of view. After about ten minutes, the stationary blinking lights were moving out of view as the plane moved further to the ""left,"" or east. After they were out of view, the view out the window looking in same direction was pitch black; it was then, when I realized this was clearly not a reflection but an actual set of lights in a triangular form, blinking in patterns and 'hovering' over the North Atlantic Ocean.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,,

My fiance and myself stood on the sand at Ocean Beach last night (February 12, 2009) for over and hour watching a large glowing orb (UFO) in the sky over the ocean. I watch the planes come and go out of San Diego almost every night and this extremely bright orb got my attention immediately. This isn't the first time I've seen something like this, but this was the closest one. It was extremely bright. So bright that I couldn't make out any detail and it looked kind of fuzzy with bright short streaks surrounding it.  I first noticed it around 8pm or so, and watched it for over an hour come a bit closer, go out, move a bit up and down, horizontally, and in seemingly random directions. It would slowly go very dim, then extremely bright. This was in our atmosphere and not out in space. When a cloud would cover the UFO, the cloud appeared to be glowing from within, then the light would turn into a very dim pinpoint. When the fast moving cloud would move, it seemed the orb ""knew"" and would quickly turn bright again, just after the cloud had gone.  I heard a military helicopter (and living in SD, I know what one sounds like) going toward the orb, then what sounded like a military fighter jet. The helicopter seemed to have turned its lights off when it got close the the orb, but I could still hear that it was there circling around. The jet seemed to have no lights on the entire time. I watched for as long as I could, but I was cold and went to my car.  I would look at it once in a while to see if it was still there at it would have moved its position a little. Eventually it had disappeared. I did not see how it ""took off"" or if the light just went out. This orb was near the flight path of outgoing planes. I know they must have seen it.

After a few minutes, I noticed a small white dot in a slightly different area directly overhead where you could see blue sky.  I took two pictures of the dot.  At the time my only thought was that the dot seemed to be too high for an airplane.  The airplane I saw and photographed a few minutes earlier was nowhere near the white dot. The dot made no sound, but it was moving slowly westward.  It seemed like it sort of faded into view, then I spotted it and took two photos, and then it sort of faded away.  My mom was with me at the time, but she assumed it could have been an airplane, but it seemed awfully high in the sky to her too.

We have lived in our current area for just over 20 years. As I walked down our driveway after taking the garbage cans to the road late in the evening, I saw a very bright light in the western sky. The light was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and appeared stationary. It caught my attention because of it's brightness, clearly much brighter and larger than any stars in the sky. I initially thought it might be a passenger jet with landing lights on as we are on a glide path to the major airport to the east. After 5 - 10 minutes of observation it was clear it was not a plane. It did not change position in the sky, however the light appeared to fade and return periodically. After 10 plus minutes of observing I went into the house and asked my wife to look at the object with me. It was cold and she did not wear a coat so her observation was limited to about 3 minutes. She confirmed it was not a star or a plane and that it appeared stationary. I then picked up my binoculars and viewed the object with those. I was able to determine the object was round or oval, had multiple flood or spot lights emitting the light I saw, and appeared to have at least one red and one green light. The white lights were spread across the oval/round diameter of the object in such a manner as to appear to be ""wall to wall"". As I watched with the binoculars, it appeared the object was turning in some way as the white lights would nearly disappear and then reappear. This occured approximately every 3 to 4 minutes. I never heard any sound associated with the object. Unfortunately my video cam was not serviceable. I watched the object for approximately 25 minutes in total, and during that time it never moved. I was then becoming cold, there was no apparent movement or action with the object so I came inside. I have not seen the object again since that evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

I saw another set of lights less than a few hundred feet behind it.  They just glided (for lack of a better description ) over the interstate.  I didn't think much of it at first until the second set of triangle shaped lights came to a sudden stop on the tree line just to the right (south) of us on the freeway.  We pulled off to the shoulder, I flew out of the car, and it was gone.  Silent and instantly it disappeared, as my buddy and I watched.  I documented it on my map and wrote down where we were at, so when we stopped for the night we could see of there were any small airports nearby.  As it happens, nothing but a lake and a state forest in is that area of rural Arkansas.  It was about seven miles west of Russellville on I-40, a few miles from a nuclear power plant. The objects came from the north side of the road at approximately 9:40 pm.  The object I saw first was triangle shaped, with a solid white light at front and the lower right corner, and a solid greenish colored light on lower left.  It flew relatively slow and continued its path over the tree line.   The second craft was similar, following extremely close behind and had solid white lights on all three corners.  It made a dead stop less than a a hundred feet off the shoulder of Interstate 40.  It hung there for what seemed like 30 seconds, maybe shorter. ((ADDENDUM #1 OF 2--FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC WEBSITE)) Mr. Davenport,  I would like to comment on a sighting dated 2/12/09 near Russellville, Arkansas.  I live very near to the described location of the reported sighting.  Based on the description furnished by the witness, I believe what was observed was a flight of three C-130 aircraft from the Little Rock Air Force Base.  These aircraft fly directly over my home every night with out fail between 8 and 10 p.m..  The usual flight path is from the northeast to the southwest.  Along this flight path, the aircraft pass approximately 3-5 nautical miles west of Arkansas Nuclear One (the nuclear plant metioned in the report).  Additionally, the aircrafts' usual approximate altitude is less than 1000 feet and display the lighting characteristics described by the witness (on one occasion they were so low that they momentarily blocked the signal to my satellite television receiver).  My personal opinion on the reported hovering of one of the aircraft is that if the aircraft is observed flying directly away from the observer it could appear to be motionless or hovering, as I have personally observed this with these aircraft on several occasions. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this comment.  We will post it, such that it is posted together with the original report.  PD)) ((END ADDENDUM #1 OF 2)) ((ADDENDUM #2 OF 2--COMMENT FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS, AND SOURCE OF REPORT)) I just made a report about a recent sighting. While  I was on the website, I decided to look at my old posting from Feb 12, 2009. A response was made and I believe the response to be wrong and demeaning to my story.  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68848.html  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69646.html I grew up my while life on Sugarbush Road, which runs parallel to the Selfridge Air Force Base runway, here in Chesterfield, MI.  I have seen nearly every type of military aircraft make its way over my house in one form or another.  The C130 has ALWAYS got my attention when they would fly over because they were very low and VERY loud.  They would fly so low you would think that they were skipping over the trees.  So I am VERY familiar with the C130 and how they look in the sky, be it day or night.  That being said, these were NOT C130 aircraft that we saw.  They were MUCH larger than any aircraft I have ever seen.  Also, I have NEVER seen a C130 fly right on the tail of another C130.  It was so close it was like it was being towed by the other one in front.  Regarding how the ""it can look like it was hovering"" comment, I understand when he meant, but that is not what happened.  We were already coming to a very fast stop on the shoulder.  The van was pretty much at a stop already when we saw it/them hovering.  I think the response to my report is uninformed and based on what he ""thought"" we saw.  He did not see what we saw when we saw it.  We stand by our story!

I witnessed what I would describe as a green ball of gas passing through the sky towards the ground. It did not accelerate or change direction, but merely fell toward the ground and disappeared behind the mountainous/hilly landscape.  It was foggy outside and dark so the object was bright in the center and the color dissipated from the center (bright in center, fading on the outer edges). I couldn't tell how far away the object was, but it was large to the eye and easy to see.  It appeared large enough that the object would have struck the earth's surface, and it was definitely enough to startle me.  It was moving very fast and did not leave a long trail/tail of fire like I would expect from a meteor, but I'm no expert. The object caught my eye while I was outside with a friend. I looked over and, as I saw it falling through the sky, I pointed and said something like ""((deleted)), look!""  Unfortunately, my friend did not see it as it disappeared rather quickly. I'm not convinced this was anything unnatural from a cosmic perspective, but it was certainly unusual and I would like to know what it was.

In the year of '86 my family and I saw a very huge lighted aircraft hovering above highway 32 west of Ashdown. It was during the school year almost at dusk. The remaining daylight showed what I remember as a huge craft that looked like what I seen off of Star Wars. It was going as slow as we were, almost as it was floating. it stayed with us until the turn off of Old Richmond Road. It was like it was using the road also. I remember yelling to my Father to follow it. He looked as he seen a ghost as my Mother told him no. Other cars and trucks were driving fast to follow. I remember that like it was yesterday. It was posted in the Little River News and also aired on the local 10 o'clock News. Stories were told for a long time until suddenly falling silent. The morning of 2/24/10 I just left Texarkana, AR from shopping late night I felt like riding some old back roads and listen to my newly installed sound system that is very loud. I did not want to disturb the! working class town folk, because I know how it feels to wake up to loud music on a work day. I cut down the road that leads behind our paper mill, Domtar. It is just a little North of the town Ogden, AR. I hate to admit this, but I got a little lost down further I drove. It has been years since I have driven that route. I got turned around several times and seemed like i went around in circles. I knew what community I was in just not were exactly i was. A while after driving very slow on the gravel road I felt like I was being followed. That is because I have noticed a light that seems to stay the same distance behind me when I travel down Highway 32 going East towards Asdown. It always originate around my parents home community of Arden. It seems not only to follow me from there on that road but stays a good distance behind me on every road I take leaving from that area. I have driven out to the wooded area called Gum Flats, which is a very wooded area that covers a lot o! f land from Foreman, Ar to Wilton and Ashdown, AR to see if I ! could ca tch a show like i did when I was 9 years old. I did not think to try crossing Highway 32 and covering the South part of the area. It is very different almost like a marsh like swamp land with its fair share of large remote and hard to get places. This stretch of land is between Ashdown and Foreman is covered with crops and cattle farms. A very large if not more is very remote and has lots of wildlife including lots of water beds and creeks that leads for miles. When some of it felt familiar I got fed up and started to feel like I should stop these kids or so called buddies from playing these jokes on me. I have only been without a job for a month but i started to ride the old back roads again a lot to ease my mind and plan my future. I figured my friends was doing a little joke to keep me on my toes. I guess I was wrong, when I cut down a narrow road and turned around very quickly, it was almost a little bigger than one lane. Being far enough down the road that had a fence r! oad on both sides, I should have caught a glimpse of the back end of any vehicle if it had turned around like I did. I drove very fast to catch them but did not see or hear any sign of a vehicle or people present. I knew that there had to be something following me because when i went down a long straight road that had a street light at where i started the road that left a perfect light on the road i saw on down a shadow that broke the light and moved a little left and right. With no trees to do this and still being straight I new they were behind me fixing to fool around again. I never heard a sound when I stopped and killed the engine no gravel crunch, no sudden stop and slide that is when I realized I told no one that I was there. Feeling like a fool i started back on the road and saw a shadow in the distance like a house or barn with a yard and cars. As I got closer I saw a reflection of a dull metal gleam from my headlights. It was like a normal reflection off a metal b! uilding but shinier and the shine seamed to go away and come b! ack. I t hought I lost my mind and should call a local friend to help me get home so i could get to bed. When I got close to the house it had a dull brown or tan color that could not have any kind of reflection. In middle of that what i thought would be me mentally breaking down finally going mad like my girlfriend has been accusing me of being when I told my Lighted Jokes Following story, I realized I knew the bridge I was driving upon.I took the side road that is numbered County Road 9, which I have been on many times also have a few friends that live on and near the rough road. Feeling frisky and Awaken I turned my Stereo full blast on the best song I cold find on my Flash drive that had the loudest base also when this flash drive is in my player it has a bright flashing blue light that is random flashes. Grabbing the New L.E.D. flash light I bought earlier I turned it on and shined it out side in many directions randomly and switching directions very quickly. I also was driving n! ot straight but from one side to the next staying kind of centered on the road, like i was bouncing from one ditch to the other. Slowly getting closer to the houses that live closer to the highway 32 which this road leads I came around a curve that is not sharp 2 lights flashed on almost like the flash light i played with and the flash drive that was flashing. My first thought was I was seen acting a fool on the road by our local Wildlife Officers of the Law making sure our wildlife friends was not being harmed by poachers out of season (great job fellas!) After seeing two I noticed they were getting brighter, when all of a sudden 8 to nine more flashed on creating a shape that looked a lot like I have seen before but did not grasp at the moment. I still blamed my good buddy for taking a joke to far, so I went toward the lights thinking they where in a tree stationed waiting on me. It was not to far away when i saw no tree and this Huge U.F.O. floating above me it was like ! a stealth camo it was dressed in because all i could see was t! he brigh t lights and what looked like its paint or body of the vehicle was bending light so it looked like the sky around it. when I stopped the car and turned off the radio it also stop approaching me it was huge like a large non perfect oval hole in sky with lights. I wanted to get as close as I could to touch it, when I drove a few more feet the lights went out and I still saw it there like it was trying to hide with the camo paint job that reminds me of the movie Predator, where I still saw its shape but it tried to blend in the sky. I saw it glide slowly to the field to the right and what I thought land, without having a great light I could not say for sure. I stopped and started to get out so I can see what I can learn about this thing that haunts me. Without emotions or feelings I was full of a urge to finish this 24 years of wonder. Then thought to myself what if something happens to me no one would know because I did not inform any one about me being lost and driving all ov! er these back roads. I sadly left and went down to my friends with a thought of finding out what that is if I even have to walk for days in the marsh, camping and getting cold, wet, and finding out why it messes with me. Maybe I am at the right places at the wrong times and they feel threatened by me. First question my buddy got was if he was involved. He looked like he got pale and told me no, and if I remember one night about 4 or 5 months back when me and my brother visited we went to a old property and he saw lights above the trees move around and we did not listen or look cause we thought he was playing. ""well same lights"" he said and seen them off and on around the same place. The way he talked with his tone I did believe him. Next day i rode with him and my brother to my cousin's house to get a stove. I only would go if I could see this road in daylight. He drove faster than I liked, but I saw the grand scale of how much wet lands I would have to cover to end this my! stery. Moving the stove I fooling around told my cousin I know! you are involved. he said ""for what"". I said Causing the lights to flash in front of my car. He got scared and was loudly say those things are for real many times and said it was about midnight the night I saw them when he was scared by them back in the house and went to bed thinking he was seeing things.      I do not believe in the other worldly aliens. I like Sci-Fi but outer space beings do not make me think they came to earth for deserts, swamps, and cattle to probe. I have seen many aircraft flights that were over my parents home were we lived since I was in 2nd grade. They have been large and small copters with many jet engine aircraft making the same path over the house. I was even Nearly Knocked off my feet by a Bomber I think was a F-1 it was big and very loud it flew right above the ground at tree top level. With many bases around and lots of remote land that maybe no one can reach. Our Military Force may have a very quiet stealth machine that has new camo like armor and! super flight abilities. I would like to know why we have not seen one in combat it seems like the tech has not changed since i seen 25 years ago or that of what I researched. the lights from the early 50s is the same shape and size. I know i am not the only one to see this ship. I am not scared to tell my story, because I want to put it out in the open and I will find this thing or many things if it is one of many that breaks off from a larger ship to do test runs in isolated areas using its stealth shell and flight controls to see if it can be spotted by civilians who drive or live in these areas. Also my vehicle did not get shut down by e.m.p. at the time we were face off, but the day after my electrical systems started to act up. first my radio was reset of all my settings like the battery was unhooked or reset. my electric windows and locks did not work also my transmition will not go in gear. When I checked engine over my battery was leaking acid like it exploded from! a short. I now am without a ride so I am even more ready to f! ind this thing and face it to find my answers as well as what other would like to know.  If any person like my self know any more info that will lead to the closure of this mystery please help and tell of your encounters.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,,

The Array  The first time I caught one of these sphere’s on camera ( 5.0 Megapixel Digital ) was on Christmas 2009. I have always been fascinated with the night sky, so I was taking pics as usual. After that I came inside and uploaded the pics onto my computer and was amazed to find several round sphere’s a long ways up over my House. So, I zoomed in the pic and there was this disc looking sphere, greenish on the center and fuzzy white around the outside. It also appeared to have area’s of exhaust coming from several spots around the orb. The following night December 26, 2009, I took about 50 or 60 more pics and was again surprised to see many more of these round muti-colored orbs. There appeared to be human-like occupants inside the craft, I could tell because these things are transparent. Today is March 7,2010 , every single night since then I have seen MANY different size and shaped crafts, several of them appear to be VERY large. In the photo’s you can see people inside, also what appears to be computer terminals and flat screens, with people sitting or standing around them. Also, you can see what looks to be  ( plasma warp drive’s) or something. I have seen these on clear nights, cloudy night s, in the rain, in the snow.  One time I was observing a couple of them hovering way up overhead, and it seemed as soon as I took a picture and my flash went off, they took off, it looked like a shooting star, it took off so fast, my brother happened to be standing outside with me during one of these events.  I can go outside on any given night and capture these things on camera, sometimes I have to take a couple pics, then its as though the flash attracts them and then there’s anywhere from 1 - 20,30 of them. I have many pictures, I haven’t really wanted to report them because there is such a stigma attached to this topic.  I know what I’ve seen, I have proof on film, and they’re not blurry images, you can clearly see thses things. If I take several photo’s in a row , pointing at the same spot, they are never in the same spot, they are definitely moving. And there is like a roaring sound like multiple jets flying in circles, and then sometimes, no sound at all.  They are very beautiful crafts, and super fast. My wife has seen the pictures, but doesn’t care, she tells me I’m losing it, even though she can clearly see the pictures. She’s the type of person that ( just wants to live her life) and doesn’t want to be bothered with them.  I tell her she needs to pay attention, we don’t know what these things are capable of , where they’re from, Are they extra-terrestrial, or Secret Machines made by our very own Government. That’s another reason I have taken so long to report them, I don’t need no trouble from no Government Agency, or Black Op Project  messing with me and my Family. I will share the photos with you.

It remained visible  out the side window  “as if traveling in pace with us” this could just be a trick of distance, but  it remained visible to us while we stopped in Yuma for a snack,  and on till we passed El Centro Ca.  It never changed its Altitude or distance, to any extent visible to us, but did remain out the passenger window till about 1600, and we were going into the foothills.

I am walking home from work and looking up at the stars as I usually do as it is dark when I finish work.  I use a head mounted light intensifier to aide in my walking. This light intensifier magnifies the stars and makes even the most dullest of them bright. The weird thing is of this is that I noticed that one of the stars was moving, so I dismissed it as a plane, but it started moving in the opposite direction so suddenly. I removed my head mounted gear and gazed upon this light which to the naked eye appeared to be an orangey colour in the shape of a three pointed equilateral triangle but the sides were not straight, they curved to the three points. It was a bright light that moved west-east then back and then moving back again west-east it then started to get smaller as if it were moving away. It did not however move away across the sky when it got smaller its positio! n was fixed and it got smaller and smaller until in a little puff of orange light it disappeared and even with my intensifier it was not there anymore, there was no sky bound movement at all. This lasted in total for about two minutes but is still to me the most prominent evidence that we are not alone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I remained scanning for quite some time that morning. 06:03 EST Looking out at Orion, I noticed a star-like object moving through the constellation.  As the object approached the Belt area it got brighter and brighter; To the point that it was brighter than Jupiter or Venus, for that matter.  It stayed that way for 10 seconds or so, then it began to dim in luminosity as it cleared the last star of the belt of Orion.  It became as dim as it was when I first noticed it in the sky moving in the same direction.  I watched this object for some two minutes in total, as it faded towards the horizon.  I figured that I just saw a satellite.  It got brighter when the Sun reflected off of it…Or so I thought. 06:12 EST Like the first object, there was another.  Following the same path as the first.  Only this one did not increase brightness.  Note:  These objects did not follow the usual air traffic flight paths through the Pittsburgh area.  The sky was clear enough to see strobes from aircraft at 60,000 ft.  From my perspective, these were not aircraft. 06:23 EST With daylight approaching, looking up facing the southern sky, a triangular shape flew overhead at incredible speed.  It was as fast as an incoming meteor, but this thing changed direction from southwest to west.  It headed towards the horizon where the first two objects faded away.  It made no sound.  There were no lights of any kind.  There was enough light from the twilight of morning to ID its shape. Just thinking about how big it had to be boggles my mind.

As I was returning to my car, I noticed a flower pot on another small deck which juts out from the living room of his house about 12-15 feet above the driveway. The flowers hanging over the pot looked pretty against the bright blue cloudless sky, so I shot four pictures in a row of them, from about 20 feet away, using a telephoto lens.

I noticed an ""spot"" in photo one (of the four I shot of that scene) when quickly scanning through the photos as I transferred them from my camera to my computer. Since I hadn't noticed anything in the sky when I shot the photo, I thought maybe the ""spot"" resulted from a ""glitch"" in the camera. I made a copy of the photo at full size and enlarged it in Photoshop, then enlarged the section with the ""spot"" in it again and ""enhanced"" it using the Photoshop Unsharp Mask filter at the following settings: Amount-500; Radius-25; Threshold-15.

The object appears appears golden/golden-red in color and to have sled-type runners or pontoons attached to its underside.

It seemed stationary at first, then it started moving very slowly side to side...as I kept looking, I could see what first appeared to be an airplane coming in from the left, but when I looked at it closer there were a series of white and red lights that were flashing side to side - it was small from my angle, but I could still tell it wasn't a plane. It came in fairly near to the first bright light and stopped in mid air, then started getting brighter and brighter like someone was turning on a light switch. They both stayed stationary, and alternated between dimming and getting stronger. Then, out of nowhere, a light just flickered out of the darkness and appeared, creating a triangle - one that started moving slowly in formation, all of the lights together. Then it changed shape a bit as each light moved, and a couple of them flickered out...weirdly, though, the one bright light was still there (it never went away until the very end). For the next hour or so, more and more ships or whatever they were would come in...at one point, there were five of them, all really bright and at all different levels of the sky. These ships, again, looked like airplanes at first - but they would change direction, go directly vertical in the air, and also stop completely and become stationary. Many times, the lights would also descend below the trees so that I couldn't see them, making them too close to the earth to be a plane. Occasionally they would all go away and I would think that it was over...only to look back out a minute later and see another triangle. About an hour and a half into this, I went out to the hallway of my dorm and called 5 more people in, all of whom saw the same thing. So with me and my roommate, that makes 7 witnesses that I now know of, and I think they were going to! tell mo re people as well. The climax was near the end, when there were actually five lights that made a large V-formation, two on either arm near the top and one in the center. It very slowly rotated, and then the lights went out. This just stopped happening about five minutes ago...actually, wait - I just looked back out again and there are two more lights back in the sky, with the same pattern as before.

Hello, I am reporting a series of lights my wife and I saw in the Gainesville/Haymarket Va area. Between 8:00-8:30pm my wife and I were traveling in our car near the Gainesville/Haymarket Virginia area when she said ""LOOK,what in the world is that,look how fast it's moving"" I stopped the car, look out her window and saw an extremely fast moving light heading west. We didn't hear any sound and the light was a interesting one. I can only describe it as a circle with a reddish light on the bottom that slowly glowed brighter as the light sped away in a westerly direction. The light was moving at such speeds it's hard to describe it accurately. I estimate it at approximately 100 feet off the ground and covering 10-15 miles in just seconds, I would assume there has to be regulations against such speeds at these lower levels. The light was moving from east to west and in a flash it was out of sight over the Bull Run mountains. If that wasn't enough excitement for one night we encountered another light just minutes after seeing the first. As we proceeded on from the first sighting, approx 3-5 miles, heading toward the Manassas Battlefield, we encountered another light. This light was also moving east to west but was neon green in color and noticeably much smaller. The light was also close to the ground, it couldn't have been higher than 100 feet and again moving at a speed faster than anything I have ever seen. As with the earlier light, it was headed toward the Bull Run Mountains and in a flash it was gone. I am a avid astronomer and know this wasn't a Meteor or any other type of natural light phenomena. I am also a very practical person but I quite can't wrap my head around what this was. I wanted to report this to you in hopes maybe someone else in the area saw the same thing we did.

The object was emitting a yellow-orange pulsating glow and was the size of the moon.  It was at around 20000  feet  off the ground.   Having seen many satellites before I realised this was of foreign origin.  It was at too low an altitude to be a commercial plane and the wrong colour lights were there. After about one minuet the object passed my house and was no longer visible.

My observation lasted for 25 seconds, doing the count in my head during the sighting. I used my cell phone to check the time of day the moment I spotted the satellite.  I was standing a few hundred feet east of Hickory Ridge Road between Bone Road and Sackner Road at the time and generally looking to the southwest.

I was sitting outside at a picnic table, facing due east, atop a hill overlooking Laurel Lake in the Berkshire Hills of western Mass., and sipping a cup of coffee while watching some birds flying in the clear blue sky. A metallic sheen caught my eye, and I looked to my right to see a relatively small object (maybe 2 feet to 5 feet in diameter?) flying toward me from the south.  I immediately knew it was something unusual, as it was moving in a strange way—“sliding” on its axis back and forth, back and forth, like a rocking chair—in very precise intervals.  And it did this even as it cruised silently from due south to due north with a straight, level, unwavering trajectory and pace.  My first thought was that it was a child’s Mylar balloon, but when it flew directly in front of me, perhaps only 200 feet in front of me and maybe just 100 feet above the ground, I got a very good look at it, and it seemed much more solid than a balloon.  Also, it moved very deliberately, consistently, and not entirely in alignment with the wind (which, I checked online afterward, was about 10mph from the south/southwest).  I can’t completely rule out the possibility that it actually was a balloon, but I don’t think that it was.  When I got a good look at its shape, it seemed like an oddly flattened, concave oval, with a slight depression in the center that was colored flat white, while the back side of the object was colored cerulean blue.  There was also some part of it, perhaps the sides, that were metallic silver and reflecting sunlight very brightly every time it rocked.  It was this bright, shining glint that initially caught my attention, and it’s also what enabled me to get up from the picnic table, walk around a building and some trees, and continue watching the object on its smooth, straight, northerly trajectory until it disappeared behind a distant tree-line about a mile away.  (The whole sighting lasted maybe 2 minutes.)  I’ve had an abiding interest in UFOs since the early 90s, and I think I may have seen one near Seattle in 1995.

My 9 yr old daughter pointed out an object hovering over the city.  If we looked straight up it was just a little to the East about 10 degrees from high noon.  It looked like a reddish silver pearl.

At first I thought maybe I was seeing another lift off from Vandenberg airforce base south or here about 35-40 miles.  But after 2-3 seconds I knew it wasn't since there was no ""trail"" of thrust rockets.  And sice the base is due south of my house, it couldn't have ben a lilft off because it was going from left to right, east to west, between the cresent moon and venus ( or jupiter).  Also. it was going on a downward angle from my vantage point about 15 degrees I would guess.  All I can say is that it was a fireball of sorts, orangish in color, not blue or white.  And, it was going relatively slowly compared to a shooting star.  In the few seconds I saw it, it had moved accross the sky about 8-10 inches at arms length.  I don't know how many degrees that would be.  All I can say is that if you stetch your arm out and point to the sky,move your index finger about 10"" and that's about how far I saw it travel.  The size is also hard to judge or determine.  Again, if you hold your arm out like before and make about a quarter inch gap between your index finger and thumb, that would be about how big it was.  It was ""on fire"" and flickered then disappeared, not much of a trail.  I thought  afterwards that maybe I saw a plane crashing, God forbid!",2009-01-10T00:00:00,35.1212,-120.6193

This is a routine procedure I perform in cold weather to keep the water circulating to prevent freezing (in lieu of winterizing). After switching on the motor, I noticed in the western night sky a very bright light slowly moving eastward. Since we live about 20 minutes from a regional airport, I at first didn’t think this was unusual. However as I watched it’s motion, I noticed it had no blinking aircraft lights. As I continued to stare, it suddenly halted movement and then began to move backwards. Eventually it stopped completely and became fixed (now appearing as the brightest “star” in the sky). At this point I ran inside to get my video camera and to notify my two young children of what I had seen.  When we came back outside the object was still there, but was now accompanied by a second star-like light (albeit less bright) off to the lower right.  I began to record as best as I could through the backyard tree limbs which somewhat blocked my view.  Eventually the cold weather forced us indoors, where I continued to film through my upstairs screened-in porch area.  For the next half hour or so my children and I watched in amazement as the two objects alternately moved closer to each other, then moved apart.  In addition they would continually fade in and out, at times becoming completely dark (appearing to us to disappear completely), then suddenly reappearing in full brightness.

Occasionally, the pattern broke off in to what appeared to be random movements and then returned to the pattern.  At one point 2 additional identical light shapes appeared in the sky, joined the criss cross pattern and disappeared shortly after. At first the lights were visible in the sky to the south and east of me, but at one point moved north and west for a brief time, continuing in the same pattern. But then returned to the south and east of me and remained there. The sky was partly cloudy that night, and the lights stayed behind the cloud cover.  So when I first saw them, I thought they might be the kind of spotlights that you see in the sky at big events.  But these were different because there was no beam of light from the ground that you usually see with those. And they were moving exponentially faster than the typical spotlight in the sky display.  They were also not ciruclar like the spotlights usually are.  When the 2 light shapes were moving through the sky, they would occasionally change direction, appearing to basically turn on a dime at incredibly high speed.

It was a bright blue day not a cloud in the sky. I Was Talking To My Friend On The Phone Lying On My Bed. my bed is against the window running parallel with it.  It was like 10:30 am Sunday morning December seventh 2008. I Happened To Look To My Right Out The Window which is west towards Dunnellon or the golf of Mexico. I Noticed Three Round White Circles That Were Stationary. It Looked Like They Were In A Triangle Formation. Kind of Like The Blue Angles in the air shows. At First My Mind Didn't Register What I Was Seeing. I Kind of Thought Are Those Stars In The Day Sky? They Were Stationary For About Another Three Or Four Seconds And Then All At Once They Started Pulsating. It Was Like They Were Mirrors Flashing and reflecting The Sun big and Bright And Then small dull White Circles again. It Seemed Like Every Time They Would Stop flashing Big And Bright They Would Shrink Or Implode On Themselves. My Friends Daughter Who Is 13 Happened To Be Over At The Time. She Was On The Computer In The Living Room, So I Excitedly Screamed Come Here Quick, Quick, I Think I See A UFO!!! Well, She Didn't Run Fast Enough And When She Came To The Window They All Disappeared. I Got Really Mad At Her at first For Not Coming Fast Enough And Missing It. She Kind of Gave Me This Face Like ''whatever'', so I Told Her To Keep Looking Just In Case And All Of The Sudden They Reappeared. This Time They Got Huge, And Then really, really small again Pulsating And Weaving In And Out Of Each Other. It Was Kind of Like There Was An Imaginary Person Juggling Them In The Sky. I Couldn't Tell If They Were Changing Size because They Were Actually Changing Size, Or If They Just Were Getting Closer And Moving Further Away At High Speeds. Then They All Went Different erratic Directions But Continued To Pulsate. It was like they were playing a game of tag with one another. This lasted for about five or six minutes until they disappeared again. I kept watching just in case. Well sure enough, two to three seconds later they came back but this time there were only two of them. They were a lot bigger and brighter this time and were flying erratically again. Like it was some kind of a game. There was also a commercial jet going north to south in they sky at the same time that was pretty close. The whole reason I even noticed the plane amongst all the chaos was I thought ''Man, I wonder if the people in the jet can see this also?'' It seemed two be so close to it. Well the craft that was closest to the plane seemed to wait stationary again until the plane passed it by like three or four inches in the sky. as soon as it got just enough away from the plane to build up momentum it shot straight across the sky back in the direction of the plane it let pass. faster then I have seen any other thing fly in my life, but comparable to a fast shooting star. I started screaming oh my god it's going to hit the back of the plane. Right when it was about to collide with the tail of the plane ''which it had no room for error because I couldn't really see the sky any more between either object.'' it went straight up at a perfect lateral angle, Excelerated so fast, and then both objects disappeared completely. Know keep in mind I am still on the phone at this time my friend on the line who was almost deff from all the screaming, and the thirteen year old was historical and  in tears. She keep screaming I want to go home know I want my mom know, know, know! I just keep saying I'm so glad I am not the only one who saw it! So I decided to call the local law enforcement being this thing almost hit a plane. But they had not much to say but ""It could have been an air show being held today.  My response was ""is it a costume for a plane to chase down a commercial jet at an air show?"" Especially after 911 right? I lived like not even a Quarter of a mile away from the Dunnellon air port and they fly trick planes all the time. I know they have strict regulations and air spaces. As close as I lived to the air port at the time they were not even allowed two do there tricks over my property. I also living in Florida have seen all kinds of planes, jets, helicopters army air craft of all sorts. again nothing has ever moved like that. Not that speed, not that shape, not that erratic. Not until today. All I can think is UFO. I hope this brings comfort to anyone who saw the same thing.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,29.153170016207454,-82.11931701782821

The object looked at first like a flying wing.  But it had more than one wing.  It had wings which changed shape, position and in number about once or twice a second not in a mechanical way but almost in a random way.  The wings also were colored in sections and these sections continually changed like a prism changes in the sunlight.  They would also stay one color in the wing and then a new wing shape and direction sprouted and a new color came up.  Sometimes there would be two or more stripes of color in the same wing until the new shape came in.  When this object was the closest to me I could see a streaky gray plasma type cloud hanging from it like a tail.  The bottom of it came to a point and there was movement in it like a swirling effect from bottom to top.  As it passed overhead the plasma tail became invisible to me. The object left my view as it passed over the rain canopy I was fueling my car under.  This event up till now has taken about 60 seconds. I had paid with a credit card so I didn't have to go in and pay.  I pulled the car around and out from under the canopy and stuck my head out the window to see it again and it was still up there drifting away and now looked slightly higher again.  The plasma tail was visible again.  It was still heading slowly in the same direction but still seemed to wander slightly unaffected by the wind speed.   I watched it for another 20-30 seconds before it left my sight.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

It was while my daughter and I had driven into the McNeil High School parking lot to pick up my son after school that my daughter observed a strange object in the sky.  She asked me what it was as it was getting closer to us, and I looked at it carefully before responding because I didn’t want to make more of it than was necessary in case it was an identifiable craft.  However, upon close inspection, I could not see a tail fin or wings on what appeared to be a cigar shaped object, slightly larger in the front, and made up of two colors, orange and silver.  The object was moving from a West to East direction in a fairly straight line, about 2 miles up in the air.  I opened the car window to get a clearer view, and did not hear any sound.  There was no contrail or anything else to suggest this object was “normal”.  It was moving about the same speed as what you would expect an! airplane, except it looked much smaller than a plane, and as I said, did not have wings.  I managed to snap two pictures out of the car window (no glass or obstruction of the shot) which I'll be happy to send to you as a reply to acknowledgement of receipt of this report.  The camera used is a Canon PowerShot SD890 IS Digital Elph.

As I reached up to close the camper shell's back window, I noticed a bright light almost directly overhead. I also noticed it was moving slowly to the Northeast. It was brighter than Arcturus, which is also about overhead at this time, and brighter than the usual aircraft which fly overhead, so I listened for the sound of a jet, which usually accompanies 'normal' aircraft that fly overhead. Although many are high altitude flights, the sound still should have been audible by that point. There was no sound, and the single point of light was not blinking, so I thought that perhaps it was something other than a commercial or military flight, perhaps a very reflective satellite - although I'd never seen one this bright - and started counting about 5 seconds after it passed the zenith. I continued counting and moving across the street as it went behind pine trees to observe it until it disappeared over the mountains to the Northeast, at an altitude of about 15 - 20 degrees above true horizon. The heading (ref'd to true north) was estimated at about 40 degrees. The speed seemed very steady throughout the sighting. Altogether the sighting lasted for a count of 127 seconds, from just past zenith to disappearance over the horizon. It took about 10 seconds to gather my tools, go inside and check the time on an 'atomic clock', which showed 20:33:45. There was no sound from the object at all, the apparent brightness was approximately between that of Jupiter and Venus in the early morning sky and did not fluctuate much, if at all. There was no discernable blinking light, just a steady white color. It did not change noticeably in brightness from overhead to disappearance, as a commercial or military flight usually does - i.e. when the forward lights are blocked by the rest of the jet or plane. The sky was clear of clouds, and although the sunset is 'officially' at 19:40 at this latitude, the mountains su! rroundin g the valley give us a sunset at about 19:15 and dusk lasts about an hour . A few of the brighter stars were just visible. Moonrise was a few minutes ago at about 21:20 (from my position).",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

I got the directions wrong to his cabin and was heading West on Highway 54 at about 11:00 p.m. CST right on the outskirts of Camdenton Missouri when I noticed a large sphere on the left hand side of the highway above a commercial building (it was South).  I thought it was a large dealership type balloon at first, but it started moving very slowly across the highway in a zig zag style fashion. I immediately slowed my motorcycle speed down to about 10 mph, as I was transfixed on the object and could not keep my eyes off of it.  I thought it was maybe a hot air balloon ride as I got closer and thought it was amazing that they had hot air balloon rides so late and so low to the ground in the Ozark hills. It was a spherical type object but was not static in shape...it was hard to identify what it was for some reason. I couldn't see any type of hot air balloon basket, but for some reason I felt as if I was being watched while riding on the bike. I kept wanting to pull my bike over to take a picture, but was too amazed at the object that I didn't for some reason. It was large (the size of a small house) and floating about 150 foot above the ground...it was reddish colored with a glow (I thought the glow was the fire for fire for the hot air balloon). It passed right over the top of me along the highway and was hovering along the right side of the highway (the North side). I was trying to find a place to pull my motorcycle over so I could take a picture, but trees were getting in the way, but I could still see the object for another 10 to 15 seconds or so. I finally found an open spot with no trees to take the picture and within seconds of getting off my motorcycle, the object faded extremely fast heading in a 45 degree angle. It was literally gone within a few seconds, but there were no obstructions or trees for it to dissappear b! ehind. I t couldn't have been a hot air balloon because of the exit speed and how low to the ground it was. It was definitely sphere-like. The whole experience lasted only a minute or two, but I have tried to rationalize what I saw almost every minute of the day since then (It was 6 days ago). The professor's cabin who I was staying at knew what I had seen, as he had seen the exact same type of object hovering above Lake of the Ozarks 3 years ago in late fall 2006. We are co-workers at a University...both professors. He told me that I could come forward with his information as well. Him and his wife both witnessed the object hovering above Lake of the Ozarks for about 5 minutes...they could not believe their eyes...and were also so transfixed that they didn't capture it on film. He informed me that he kicks himself all the time for not taking a picture or video, but for some reason he was so mesmerized he didn't move. The fellow professor and his wife never told anyone but relatives in the past...but him and I have talked for hours in the past 6 days to try to rationalize what we saw, but there is no rational known explanation of the object, how it moved, it's size, shape, and aura around it. I have never been an avid UFO follower and was not looking for a UFO...it found me...and I completely believe and now intend to spend my summers investigating this phenomenon (as a professor my summers are fairly free). I will help you in any way I can...I am 100% CERTAIN that I witnessed a UFO...as a lawyer and professor I am very skeptical without evidence...but the evidence was literally about 150 feet right above in front of me...it was the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed in my life.

They were fuzzy and dull and looked as if they were moving. I decided to see how close I could get to the lights and I started to follow them. After several miles of following the lights in the sky I could see a cell tower through the trees. The cell towers lights were the same colour as the lights in the sky. When I got to the base of the cell tower I could see that the lights in the sky were the lights from the cell tower reflecting off the clouds in the sky. The clouds were moving and it was the moving clouds that made the lights look like they were moving. Any way has anyone been photographing the Moon lately?

Just my contribution, what I saw. ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS, SUBMITTED 27JL09)) Dear Mr. Davenport, you might remember me, the one who reported the ""Banana Shape Formation flight"" across Vienna.   I was busy in finding a 2nd person who saw the same.  In this case it should be very very easy to confirm the same sighting, because a formation of 50-100 objects in such a shape is very very unique. On the local web sites, news papers etc.  I found nothing. On youtube some videos: ""Lots of UFOs in Vienna on July 9.""   But those are single points or maybe 2 points moving in the sky.  Could be anything.   Final line:  I was unable so far to get a 2nd person on a different position to confirm the fomation flight, to do a triangulation.   I found on youtube one Video (UFO footprint on moon) which represents a similar ARC as I saw. Recorded in July. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qen_C6aYSKM   So, my question to you is:  Do you know a European good reporting site, where I could post the sighting, and where others could respond then? Unfortunately there is so much trash in the net about UFOs; 99.9% is unusble, and wasted time to read. (and very timeconsuming)  In case I get a 2nd person to confirm the sighting, I will let you know.    Greetings from Austria ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2)) Peter, no problem for the short message. I will just let you know what is the current status and how it continues. 1. Since what I saw was so unique, not only a few moving dots in the sky, I am motivated to continue investigating. 2. Visibility of the formation from my position to the west is unlikely, because it UK/London it is at 9:00pm local time too bright. And the objects have been too small. 3. Hot Air-Baloons? A German specialist from CNAP told me: that these objects where just those chinese burning baloons. (definitively not because - 4. Asked at the ZAMG (Central Station for Meteorology and Geological Dynamic in Vienna) about wind direction and speed on 7/9/09 22:00. It was 9m/s in 1200feet, direction from 270Deg (WESTWIND) (Baloons, Paragliders etc. do not fly against the wind) 5. US-Army Jet Fleet from Iraq to UK. Very unlikely that 100 Jets, in 60.000 feet (where they do not make much noise).   PENDING: I am checking, at which elevation at 22:00 local time Geographic position 48N 16E, the sun is still visible. I beleive, since the stars where visible, it should be above 50km (150.000feet). In that case, 100% NO for Jet transfer. They travel max. at 25.000m   6. I expanded the trak of the observation now to the EAST. (286 Deg was the heading). 7. The track crosses exactly the Black Sea, north of Turkey. 8. My colleague in Istanbul told me, that he got in tough on June 15. with lot of People of the UFO-Conference in Istanbul (Erik v. Daeniken, ... and many others) 9. My colleague will forward the immage I reconstructed to those people. He said, that since Jun 15. they observed a massive amount of objects above the black sea! Same as in 1999, where a large earthquake killed 60.000 People in North or Turkey. (official numbers are 20.000). 10. 1999 and July 22. Solar Eclipse causes with very high likelyhood heavy earthquakes. This is in relation with UFO observation.    Final line:   In case I will get any confirmation of this unique observation, I will let you know.  It could be the largest amount of UFOs observation in a single case ever. Worth to continue.   I have attached a reconstruction how the sky looked like. See the many tiny dots in the middle of the picture.   Sorry for the lengthy email.

Unsure of what I should do, I bolted into the house to get the binoculars so I could see more detail.  I yelled at my parents that there was something in the sky as I ran toward my bedroom.  One of them said that the TV news had reported that a meteor had been spotted.   By the time (2-3 minutes) I made it back outside, the object had d! isappeared.

It was a warm summer evening, around 7:30 P.M.  My husband was home and my babies were in their cribs sleeping.   I went to the bathroom window to remove my clothes off the clothesline.  I had to stand on the edge of the tub to take in my clothes, and in the far off skyline, I noticed a very large orange sun which meant it was going to be very hot the next day.   I stopped what I was doing and looked at the sky, and  admired it.  Often in the daytime, when hanging out my clothes, when it was clear out, I could actually see the top of the Empire State Bldg.   Anyway, as I looked at the skyline, I noticed blinking lights, and the object was zig zagging coming closer and closer.  It was quite far away, so it was small, and the closer it got, the more curious I became.   I went into the hallway of our apartment building and went up to the roof.  As I watched the object get closer and closer, I called out to my husband and he came up to the roof.  As the object came closer, we could see it was silver and it looked like there were lights of different colors going round and round, like the top of a police vehicles light.   I ran down and got my neighbor and she came up and we looked up in the sky.  As the object approached us, it kind of tilted and it then looked like a round shaped disk, and the sound it emitted was a swishing sound.   It cam around and went to the left of  us, and it stopped.  When it stopped, the swishing sound stopped and their was a humming sound like a motor.  I noticed windows in the center of the object, and what we thought were different colored panes, was instead, there was some sort of lights changing colors and it was rotating inside of the craft.   We noticed then two rods, on each end of the craft.  They were facing downwards.  We looked up mesmerized and we asked each other if we could figure out what it was, and we were just dumfounded.   After what seemed like 10 or 15 mins. the rods disappeared and the object which had become an oval shape took off zig zagging and wit! hin seconds it disappeared from sight.  When the object took off, the motor stopped and there was a swishing sound.  We were dumbfounded.   We went down to our apartment, my neighbor who didn't speak English, but Italian, I spoke with her as that is my language and she said she never saw anything like it.   My husband went into one room and I in another and we both drew what we saw.  We drew the identical thing.   We decided to call the Civil Aironautics Bureau, and they kept me on the phone about an hour asking me questions.  They asked me not to call the newspapers or the radio media.  We didn't call anyone else nor did we tell anyone else.   The very next day, we looked in the newspaper to see if there was any article of what we saw the evening before and there was none.   We we eventually moved away to upstate N.Y.  This was in 1963.  After living there awhile, one evening we watched T.V. and saw a program which showed a couple who claimed to be abducted on board a UFO, and they had been hypnotised and they described the object.   We could hardly believe our eyes when we saw the same object we had seen that evening in the Bronx.  We then knew we had seen something that was from outer space, a UFO.   From then on, I know in my heart that there are space vehicles of other planets.  I no longer feel those who  report UFO sightings that they are imagining or not being truthful.   Thank God my husband had been home that evening and saw what I did, for it he wasn't there, he wouldn't have believed me.   This is the truth, and even though it was a very long time ago, it is something I will never forget.   One more thing, when the object took off, it went into the direction of Orchard Beach.

As I was about to get into the car, I saw a bright reddish-orange light in the sky moving slowly.  It was a shape of a circle.  My boyfriend was going to go home at that time and was about to leave.  I told him to stop the car and to look at the sky.  I asked him if that was a plane and he told me it was a small airplane.  But, I was thinking that it could not be a plane at all because it was moving too slowly and usually when you see airplanes at night you would see that it would have a blinking light and a sound passing thru.  This bright light I saw didn't have any sound and it was moving too slowly to even be an airplane. It was moving silently in the sky.  Plus, it was a bit cloudy at that time and this thing was flying low underneath the clouds.  My uncle was also out! side and it caught his eye.  We all were looking at it the whole time.  All of a sudden, that reddish-orange light I saw in the sky stopped moving.  Then, I told my boyfriend,""is it just me because now that light just stopped in the sky and now it looks like a star, but it doesn't even look like a star.""  Then, my boyfriend told me it wasn't just me, he also saw that thing move earlier and now it just stopped.  My uncle was also amazed. At that time, my sister was loosing her patience and was calling me to get into the car. I continued to look at it for another good five minutes.  It could not be a meteor or a comet.  It could not be a star because it wasn't twinkling at all. My mother also wanted to come to the grocery store and I looked at her and told her about what we were looking at in the sky.  As I was talking to my mother, my uncle yelled, ""wow, it just dissapeared that's really weird.""  Then, I looked back in the sky and it was really gone. WEIRD!

I was out alone snowmobiling, at about 7:30 at nite, when I stopped to view some faint Northern Lights, when I was South of Fairbanks, Alaska, about 2 miles, clear sky.  I noticed  an unusual star formation of 5 shiny objects, in a perfect Pentagon pattern.  That is what caught my eyes, as there were a tremendous number of stars visible, due to the very Clear Arctic sky.   After some 2 minutes or so, I saw them all converge, at the same time, into the center of the Pentagon, at an upward angle, leaving a shiny trail behind each one, like a flash.  After several seconds, after they formed what appeared to be a single object, the single now larger object left up an upward angle into space, at an amazing speed. leaving what appeared to be a streak of light, until the object got smaller, and smaller, then eventually disappeared in some 5 seconds or so!   Amazing!   The objects appeared to be silvery shiny, and very small, for altitude,  I would guess some 15 to 30 miles!   I wish I had a digital camera!   How the objects went from a Pentagon formation, into one object was amazing, all moved at the same time, and converged at the same point, all together, then after a few seconds, the now larger silvery object, traveled out into space at about a 80 degree angle, very fast, leaving just one solid streak of light as it accelerated away. I have done a lot of work on Weather Balloon systems, Radiosonde Tracking Systems, called WBRT's, for many years, and have tracked these many times as part of my job.  I have also seen several visible rocket launches on experiments by the Univ. Of Alaska, ESSA, etc., in tracking Aurora Borealis, Northern Lights.  I had a good background of electronics, radio, and radars, etc., and Weather Observations. I have talked to Eskimos in the Arctic, at Point Barrow, Nome, Kotzebue, and Barter Island, of some of their sightings over the Arctic Ocean.  This was the first, and only time, I have ever seen anything so unusual, that I could not identify.  I have worked extensively with certified Weather Observers at many airports, and very familiar with Weather Observations, etc. Now, I am retired from NOAA NWS, having worked on their new WSR-88D NEXRAD Doppler Radars, with their towers, having Fiberglass Panels, in the shape of a Pentagon!  This has always been a reminder to me, of that nite in Fairbanks, back around 1969.   I wonder if anyone else has seen a formation like this, in the shape of a Pentagon??

They were arranged left to right, two close together, one single, two close together.  The spacing of the three sets was about the distance from your index finger to your little finger when held at arms length in front of you.  The lights moved together slowly from west to east (left to right), as though they were attached to one object.  I could see there was a mass there, but being night time I couldn't see what it was clearly, despite the full moon overhead.  It just seemed to be a darker area in the sky where the lights were.  The lights moved slowly and disappeared behind some trees to my right, just off the roadway.  They appeared to be at a lower altitude because of how quickly they went behind the trees.  Then I lost sight of them. I am a licensed pilot (Airline Transport Pilot license) and know what an airplane looks like.  With these lights there was no red flashing beacon, no flashing strobes, no colored navigation lights.  I thought maybe it was some high altitude jets going by, but again, no strobe lights.  They stayed perfectly seperated too.  Maybe a plane from the local airport, but it was moving slowly and steadily, and at an altitude that I could only guess was below 5000'.

Somewhere close to the midpoint of our trip the entire sky lit up with a teal green light (the EXACT location is somewhat of an estimate - I used the GPS on my Blackberry to mark the location on Google Maps but I guess I didn't save the location as a favorite and lost it). I don't know what I was thinking at the time, but I must have thought it was a shooting star or lighting or something along those lines because as soon as the light in the sky faded I leaned forward so I could look up. I scanned the sky fairly quickly left to right and right under the headliner (I'm estimating 60 or 70 degrees up from the horizon) I saw a greenish light fading out. It appeared about the same size as an average star in the sky aside from its color. As soon as I spotted it, it was already fading out (I watched that particular spot in the sky for 2 or 3 seconds max).  I leaned back in my seat and I didn't say anything immediately until the driver said something along the lines of ""what the ____ was that?"" or ""did you see that?"". He described the light in the sky nearly identically to how I did and after we talked about that for a moment I realized that it didn't just light up in one spot like a flare or shooting star, but it lit up the ENTIRE sky. We were riding in his Expedition so we had plenty of surface area on the windows around us, but I couldn't fathom what would have lit the sky up to the point where I saw it out peripherally as well.  Also, I guess he leaned forward before I did or locked onto the object before I did (I don't know which one as I wasn't looking at him or paying any attention to his movements because I was completely focused on what was going on) but he saw the object moving horizontally across the sky before its light faded out. He said he leaned forward just enough to see it moving (from his perspective) about 2 inches under the point where the headliner and top of the windshield meet and it moved in a line almost completely parallel to this point.  The sky was slightly overcast but I did notice that stars were fairly visible at that time. We were in the car another 90 minutes and I distinctly remember the sky being almost crystal clear when we got to the cabin at Lake Cumberland (we were fairly high in the hills there and had a great view). There weren't many cars on the road at the time (Highway 127) but I did notice a car that was about 300 yds up ahead tapped their brakes a couple of times as soon as the sky lit up.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,37.7909,-84.8946

He said by the looks of it, it seemed to be about a few miles away, which would be adjectent to where I was driving. Also, upon sharing the story with other friends they too said that they saw the sky light up blue while driving about 12 miles from where I was driving at the time of the sighting. They also said the sky lit up bright blue and then went away. Another friend living about 35 miles from where I was driving saw the sky light up too.  He also said it lasted only seconds and was just a part of the sky not the whole thing. These sightings all happened at the same exact time during the night, at about 12:30 a.m. on Saturday Febuary 14th, 2009. We all were in agreement that it did not look like northern lights nor did it look like lighting of any kind that we had ever seen.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

As I got out of my car I was looking at the Eastern part of the sky, which is very open from my driveway and this night was particularly clear. I instantly spotted two faint glowing orange lights off in the distance out of the Northeastern part of the sky that were headed South. The two objects, which had what I would describe as a fiery glow, were moving in formation, with one apparently leading the other and at a slightly higher altitude in the sky from my vantage point. The objects were traveling at a steady pace and appeared to float across the sky. I could not make out any sound coming from the objects, and to my knowledge they did not make any noise. I ran in to my front yard to try and track the two objects as they glided across the sky and disappeared behind my neighbors house. I ran to my side yard and around the back of my neighbors house, but the objects had vanished.

Even as I watched , it suddenly seemed to grow in size and intensity, moved ‘up’ in a way that I cannot really put into words (a sort of beaming, if you will) for a little distance at normal speed, then disappeared abruptly.

On 10-8-08 at approximately 0130 hours my girlfriend and I were walking our dogs at the park and I noticed what a clear night it was. I looked towards the South East over Henderson, NV and observed a bright white light which seemed to be moving slowly from side to side. The object was approximately twenty-thousand feet up in the air. I told my girlfriend to look up at the lights and we observed blue, green, red flashes as the object appeared to be spinning. We observed the object move very slowly in various directions almost as if it was floating around the sky over the Henderson urban-sprawl. The object had a brownish-grey cloud around it at all times and the light it emitted had illuminated the cloud around it, which seemed to follow it wherever it would go. We stayed at the park for approximately an hour, and marveled at what we saw and the changing lights. We decided to drive in the direction of it and ended up at a housing development near Silverado Ranch and Eastern. I believe it was called “South Fork” off Eastern Avenue. We parked in front of  various houses that were in the South East area of the housing development itself and it appeared to be very close to our vehicle compared to when we were at the park. It made no sound itself. We both stared at the lights which were still green, red, white, and blue at times, but it was mostly white and the colors would come and go. At one point a red laser type light emitted from the craft which seemed to be a smaller light than the others and a different color red that circled around the craft which was spinning. I told my girlfriend looking at the lights was becoming difficult because they were so bright it hurt and she agreed. I flashed my hazard lights, as we were in my vehicle, and when I did this on two occasions the lights became more active and the small red laser light would almost answer back to us and seemed to shine in our eyes directly! The dogs with us were whimpering and whining. The unidentified craft seemed to be getting c! loser to our vehicle. I was looking at the clock the entire time in the quiet neighborhood and I never lost any time during the sighting. At one point my girlfriend says it ""looks like a disco in the sky!"" She also described the white portion of the lights as “like a starburst“. I could make out the shape of the craft in only one instant and it appeared to be bell shaped, however the lights made the craft appear to be disc shaped and spinning. The cloud cover around the craft did not look like normal clouds almost as if the cloud was emitted from the craft. At the housing development we could hear helicopter sounds but we did not see any helicopters and I thought this was suspicious. This object was not a helicopter as it did not have small red flashing lights on the tail but large multicolored ones. During our sighting, we both agreed about what we observed and we shared the exact same reactions to the UFO at the same time. We drove up Easter, a little more South up towards the “Anthem” area, which actually is up the mountains of the Valley and parked. We could still observe the UFO from our vehicle however it appeared to be more East of us and also appeared to be rising in altitude slowly. We came to the agreement that we had actually driven around the UFO, which made me to believe the object was large however not very high in altitude. Other things about the sighting were we observed several shooting stars during this sighting in alternate areas of the sky than the UFO. At one point in the sighting we observed white beams shoot out from the craft. We also observed several smaller orb craft around the craft during the sighting. Because I did not know the exact distance of this craft it is difficult to say the size but I did get the impression it was possibly a mother ship as at about 0530 hours it was high in the sky and only white light when we got back to the house with the smaller craft possibly following it up. This craft seemed to be a pyramid shape at times as it gained altitude. This is my first UFO sig! hting an d we shared it together, as it was her first as well. We felt like we had a connection with it and hope others saw it that very early morning. We did not have a camera in the vehicle and we did not want to run back home to get one in fear we would lose track of the UFO.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

I was walking across the bus park at Skagit Transit, heading for my assigned vehicle to perform my AM pre-trip prior to making my morning run from Mount Vernon to Everett, Washington.  For some unknown reason, I happened to look upward.  There I saw an object dimnly silhoutted against the night sky, moving in a straight line, south to north, in a steady and totally silent manner.  The body of this object seemed to be black, or some color slightly darker than the night sky behind it.  Its shape, as best as I could tell, looked something like a bat-wing, except the pointed parts were on the leading edge.  On the underside of this object there were two equal-sized, circular openings, which seemed to be filled with a swirling, phorphorescent vaporous substance of some sort.  It looked to be both vaporous and energized in some manner.  It was not like anything I have seen before.  These were definitely not lights; not in the sense that we think of lights.  The object had no other lights or energy sources which I could see.  These two ""wells"" took up about half the area of each side of the object. There was absolutelyl no sound associated with this sighting; not even the ""woosh"" of the air being disturbed by its passage.  It was totally silent.  The object crossed directly above me, headed on a general south-north heading, and then disappeared into the pre-dawn darkness.  The total time I observed was probably between 3 and 5 seconds.  Long enough to get a good look and discount any possibility of swamp gas, weather balloons or an early-morning stars or satellites. I spent over 20 years in the Army; almost three years in combat.  I have observed a wide assortment of aircraft in a wide assortment of applications, under a wide range of circumstances and conditions.  I have extensive exposure to many types of military aircraft, including, AH1, UH1, CH47, OH1, C113, C123, C130, C141 and C5A types.  I have observed night-time air strikes and close air support operations both day and night, and in all kinds of weather.  I have flown in and am familiar with CH47, UH1, C113, C123, C130, C141 and C5A aircraft. While assigned to Fort Lewis, WA, I lived in military housing directly under the approach paths for aircraft incoming to Grey Army Airfild for over eight years.  My point being, this observation was well outside the range of my experience and significantly enough to warrant my making this report. What could this have been?  Why was it here?  What was its mission? Where was it going (and where did it come from)?  And, most weirdly of all, why did it allow me to see it??",2008-10-31T00:00:00,48.5323,-122.3184

If you had any reports from Houston last night (July 13 2008) of an object traveling directly northbound, I saw an unidentifiable object. Bare eyes, no scope obviously. Completely circular, traveling straight north. (I am on the west side of houston texas). This object seemed to be uniformly spherical, it seemed to have a glow to it, but not a bright one. But it was a consistently uniform light. The light did not change brightness, did not have any sort of beacon or blinking as a plane or copter would. And It seemed to move from the southern most point of the horizon to the northern most pointin about 10-12 seconds. (this has to be an incredibly fast speed, as planes and jets take many minutes to pass the entire sky. Definitely not a satellite, as they are much slower. And definitely not a meteorite as I have seen many, and they seem to disappear half way across or down the skyline w/ a greenish color.

I didn't know whether to wake up my parents or call my friends to check it out. I tried to call a friend of mine, but he did not answer.  I decided not to wake up my parents, because they would have just said i was crazy and told me to go back to sleep.   I didn't want to lose sight of the object either.  Anyway this object just stayed in one spot the whole time, i did not see it fly vertically.

The size was huge, it looked almost as big as a full moon does. In conclusion i want to say that i saw something tonight that i have never seen before in my life.

It dimmed rather quickly from it's brightest point and there was a hazy blue-white glow in the sky where the sighting ended.  My eyes were temporarily affected by the brightness – I couldn't see as well in the dark for several seconds – this is how bright it glowed.

It is the God's truth if I ever told it.  Another witness saw the same thing as I did at the same time that day.  I have waited for many years to offer this report to somebody, somewhere, anybody, who will hopefully understand where I am coming from.  No we are not crazy nor were we drinking.  I work for the U.S. Government now and I still today cannot comprehend exactly what we saw that day.  Years ago I worked in a Wal-Mart store as a Sales Manager, and one day I saw something inside that store that shocked me terribly, and that I shall never ever forget.  It still haunts and puzzles me today.  Neither will my other witness that I shall call JM.  JM was a Sales Manager for Wal-Mart like I was, and we were both standing inside our Wal-Mart store at around 1:00 PM after lunch when all of a sudden an older man, in his late sixties to early seventies, walked directly between us and never said a word.  He just stared at us both.  He had grey hair and wore a redish plaid shirt of some kind.  JM and I just stood there shocked at what we saw, and when I tell you ""what"" we saw you will be shocked too.  We both just stared at him and our jaws were dropped open wide.  You see, this man looked ""exactly"" like an older President John F. Kennedy.  We both saw it for ourselves.  But that wasn't what shocked us the most.  The man had a long scar running all the way down the right side of his face and into his skull.  This ""whatever"" had been shot or injured with a huge wound all the way around the right side of his skull.  The scars were there to prove it, and he had been sewn up with many stitches.  We were both shocked and stunned to say the least.  The man passed us and then I finally said to JM, ""Did you just see what I saw?""  And JM said, ""Yes, but I don't believe it.""  We then went looking for this man and he was simply gone! in an instant.  We saw an individul that day who was an older! JFK, a spirit, MIB, or an alien.  This President John F. Kennedy man combed his hair the same way JFK did, had the visible scars on the right side of his head were positioned the same as JFK's were after he was assassinated on November 22, 1963.  I have seen some of JFK's autoposy photograhps.  The facial features were exactly the same too.  He looked at us both as if he wanted us to notice him.  I hope you will not think that we are ""cooks"" of some kind.  I have seen several UFOs and other strange things before, and I ""did"" see this too.  The UFOs are real, and I have seen the proof.  I wasn't looking to see anything strange that day either.  I am a Christian, and attend Church regularly and I believe in Jesus Christ.  We know for sure what we both saw that day and it still lingers in our minds.  As a Historian, I have heard several stories about JFK and his knowlege of UFOs.  This man, whoever or whatever he was, makes me wonder.  This is a very true and accurate story-it really ! happened.  I do wish to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution at seeing this!

I have seen mother ship docking; the ship was larger inside than it seemed outside. I have seen hand held ray guns that erase memory using a static electric beam. While attending elementary school I drew pictures of the same UFO and Ray gun many times. They were nice to me. In later years they answered every question for me and showed me what I did  not know. I'm so old is why Im telling. There is a lot more but who cares, this is enogh for free thinkers. This is my record.",,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

I have revisited this moment many times throughout my life and have yet to fully understand what it was I saw.  I only know that in the fifty years I have lived, I have never seen anything like this since. I lived in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, in town called Oakwood.   I believe it was the fall of 1967 when I had this encounter, which would put me at about 8 years old.  This phenomenon occurred in the middle of the night after having returned to my bed from the bathroom. After laying back down I noticed a bright, round, moonlike object about a mile to the west and coming closer.  I was so unsure of what I was witnessing that I went to the window to get a better look.  I watched for a couple of minutes as this bright object came closer.  It was now several stories above the tree tops above our neighbor’s backyard. It had no sound and no discernable outline, but only the color of light.  It was round, about 30 feet across, and moving rather slowly.  I had to move to the other window that faced north to our backyard.   I thought about calling out to my mother, but thought that by the time she awoke and got to me, the object would be gone.  Just then the light went out.  It didn’t shoot away or disappear, it just went out.   It wasn’t replaced by a black outline against the sky.  I looked for several more minutes waiting to see if it would light up again or see some outline moving against the sky.  Nothing. I wasn’t scared, just a bit confused, so went back to bed and fell asleep. The next morning, before going to school, I sat at breakfast and told my mother what I saw.   She didn’t have much comment over the subject, so I didn’t push the topic. That day in school we had show and tell.  I remember sitting in a circle to the left of our teacher.   As we went around the circle, I wondered if I should tell about my night.  I did.  To my surprise the teacher didn’t think I was making up stories.  Instead, she said on her way to work she heard on the radio that there had been reports by others who had seen this strange object. I will always wonder what it was, who it was, where it came from or where it went.  I have never seen anything like it to explain away what it was. I have recalled this account so that it might conjure up a memory for someone else that may have seen this around the same time and in the same area.

There was a barge facility approximately a mile from the main plant that was unmanned.  Every two hours some one from the maintenance department had to go to the barge area for a fire watch and sign a log.   On this particular night, I decided to ride in the van with the two maintenance men to the barge dock.  The road was straight as an arrow and not paved.  When we were about halfway back to the main complex, the maintenance man driving stopped the van.  I got out of the van from the passenger side and the other maintenance man sat in the van listening to the radio. As we talked, the other person suddenly said ""what in the hell  is that""?   As I turned to see what he was talking about I saw nothing but stars and the outline of a mountain across the river.  It was a clear night but the moon was not visible.   Initially I saw some flashing stars on the horizon changing colors as they do when they are first visible.  I said ""What""?  ""All I see are stars"".  He said ""no""!  ""To the right"" and pointed.  As I looked further to my right, I saw the large shadow coming straight toward us.  It was so large I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It had no lights and was shaped like a perfect triangle.   It passed directly over our heads and disapeared over the horizon of a different mountain.  It had a flourescent appearance and shown a greyish black surface.  It made no nise except for a gliding sound coasting it seemed through the air.   The other maintenace man in the van jumped out at hearing our talking about the object and saw it briefly b! efore it disappeared over the horizon.  I felt weird and had chills over my entire body.  We were freaked out and decided we would tell no one because it would make us seem crazy.   As we started to get back into the van, we heard a noise and it was two military jets following the same path as the triangle.  As they passed over head they broke the sound barrier and the ""boom"" echoed across the valley.  It then dawned on both of us that the triangle and the jets had come from the direction of the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Al, about 30 miles away.   I had read about flying saucers and UFO's but at the time of my sighting, I had never heard of a flying triange.  This thing had to have been over a mile wide.  Who would believe that?   Now that others are beginning to report the same, I decided to report what I saw that early morning. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the time of the sighting is approximate.

I never knew anybody was taking official reports.  Sorry for the delay, I heard about you last week.  I've been telling this story to anybody with an interest.  There's more than one encounter, I'll start with the first one and keep adding.  I'm 62, this happened when I was 40, and it continued to happen.  My last encounter was 1991 and I sort of avoid being caught in this again. My family is from Roswell NM.  My grandfather's sister ((name deleted)) and her husband had a ranch there in the early 1900s.  My dad's family lived in Las Vegas NM.   My grandfather worked on the railroad there.  He died in an accident, and my father was 12, he went to live with his Aunt in Roswell.  He knew all the native American teenagers.  They all grew up together.  They took the horses to the mesas and camped out a lot. My dad used to visit every summer, he loved the desert, only he wouldn't drive at night.  The night desert spooked him.  My dad couldn't wear a watch, the hands would spin.  We sort of accepted that as a crazy thing, never paid much attention to it. While we were crossing the desert with my dad in 1954, I had an incident.  I was about 10.  We got to Gallup NM, and I bolted from the car and ran - My dad couldn't figure out what was wrong.  I was hysterical.  I remember it to this day.  There was a time gap, something like that - I couldn't account for missing time.  After my dad calmed me down, we got a hotel and stayed the night.  I'm telling you this, because in 1991, the exact same thing happened when I got near Gallup NM.  Only that time, my son was with me - and he remembers it. We got picked up in 1991 - we drove up a ramp or something, or thru a vortex, that looked exactly like Gallup NM - only the people weren't acting right.  They were acting - my son remembers passing the same landmark twice - and now he's 26, and he still remembers it.  We never talk about it, its pretty upsetting. The 1991 incident was like the final time - I kept getting picked - they were following me around - I was so used to it, I would just play dumb and hope that the time frame would move along - they're still watching me, but I have asked them please do not interfere with me or my family - I'm getting a little too old for this- we need to be as normal as possible. Back to 1987 - We were living in Los Angeles in 1984.  I had a strange feeling, like I was supposed to move to Tucson.  My cousin lived there, so we went to visit.  After we got home, I sold everything and we moved to Tucson.  Just pulled up and moved.  I got a job at the University of ARizona assisting the Dean.  I have a BA in Fine Arts, and I was a legal secretary for 20 years.  I'm also a music teacher. I understand mathematical principles and science, and was majoring in math, but I got bad headaches.  The math calculations would spin so fast, it gave me a headache.  So I switched to music.  I can hear music in my head - which really helps if you compose.  It's a fairly common skill among musicians. But somehow, this ability to hear and pick up sound, was meant for more than music.  I started picking up sound when I got to Tucson.  I could hear things and I would ask people, do you hear that?  They couldn't hear anything.  I heard a high pitched signal, like a transmitter.  My son can hear these high pitched signals too.  In fact, he used to hold his ears shut with his hands and refuse to go into places he could hear it. Either it was subliminal broadcasting, or I was listening to something else.  Tucson is a pretty strange place you understand, pretty close to the largest copper deposit in America - copper will pick signals up, I think. I was at the University for about 2 years, on and off, and I had a job working for an attorney.  In July 1987, I started picking up stronger signals at the university.  Like something was under the university property.  I worked in a basement laboratory for a professor.  I finally had to quit, I got dizzy and I couldn't concentrate. As soon as I quit, I started hearing the same signals in my apartment - and it got really strong.  I started freaking out - I lost my cool - and since my family has always been a little strange in the first place - I decided to would have a chat with whoever was signaling. I said, out loud ""Look, whoever you are, I'm a rational person, I don't talk to people who aren't there, who I can't see, so if you need to talk to me, you need to be really really clear, and it has to be something I can't miss.""  So I tossed it out there - and apparently they heard me.  Because a few days later, I was losing sleep and becoming increasingly disoriented.   I fell asleep in the afternoon with the window open - and the next thing I know - a massive gust of wind came thru the window and slammed all the doors - and I could not open my eyes.  I could see without my eyes being open. I was on some planet and the temperature was below zero - everything was frozen solid - I could hear the sound of breaking glass, or high pitched bells, people talking - and I was unable to move.  I am highly analytical and I started making mental notes - trying to see on the sides -  And just like that, I was out of it.  I literally packed up my kids and told them to get in the car - and I started driving south on Interstate 19 south of Tucson.  I was shaking really bad.  All I knew is I wanted to get out of the apartment - I couldn't breathe and I was shaking really bad  A storm started rising up from the South, and started moving in - I got off the highway at Valencia - and turned left.  I was shaking so bad, I had to stop the car.  I told the kids to get out, while I calmed down. Somebody was standing right behind me - that I couldn't see, blowing on my neck.  I had the kids with me, and I was terrified.  We started walking, and we went a few blocks, and ended up in front of a bank.  It started raining, the kids were wondering what was going on.  I told them, go in the bank and sit down, I'll stay out here for a couple of seconds. As soon as the kids went in the bank, and I was standing there - the bank saw we were in distress and called the police.  The police came, talked to me, and I had to make something up - like I was tired -  Right about then, I looked like a lunatic.  My kids were really upset.  They called my husband at work - he works as a mathematician and engineer. While the police were standing there, the storm rolled in, two of the policemen touched me, and man, a huge bolt of lightening smacked me - and I saw the sun explode - and I thought - well, I must be dead..... The police looked at me, grabbed me again, and somebody took over my body and literally threw the police on the ground.  I guess touching is a no-no.  Then this voice goes ""do exactly as I tell you, we need to get you out of here"". I guess I was on the ""wrong side""  The police started acting really stangely.  A woman came out of the bank, and she stared at the police and said ""she's fine you need to go now"" - and they got in the car and left.  When did you ever see that happen.  Then she said ""come inside, do you need a glass of water?""  All of a sudden, it all turned, now everybody wanted to get me a glass of water.  My husband showed up, he stared at me and the kids - and he tried to escort us home.  It just got crazier and crazier after that. Somebody started driving the car, and the kids and I had to go for a ride.  I wasn't ""me"" anymore - I was somebody else.  Whoever it was, beamed down here. After about a day of driving around, and running out of gas in the desert, the police found us again - and man I had some explaining to do after that.  My husband was furious.  I had to sit there and take it - and pretend I was nuts - I wasn't nuts.   I was trying to observe.  He was trying to show me something.  He explained things. When I said, ""well why are you telling me all this stuff, I'm nobody.""  the answer was pretty much I had to wait about 25 years, and then there was a pretty good possibility that the information would end with me unless people were willing to listen.  Other than look like a nut, that's how it all started. The police transported me to a mental facility - and I had to sit there for 4 weeks looking like a nut case.  I went along with the whole thing.  While I was there, I had a little radio with a headset.  When I changed the batteries, the batteries drained in my hand.  That hasn't happened again. After 1987, nothing happened again until 1991 - I was driving across I-40, approaching Gallup NM, and the road just ended, there was another flash, and the road was back - only I was not in Gallup NM. I stop there all the time, whenever I drive to NM.  Chief Yellowhorse sits on the property - it's a sacred site.  I usually stop and go in, maybe get a drink and buy some jewelry - but most things are unspoken -  The university offered me an office position with the Mars project - but I turned it down and went back to Los Angeles.  If I knew what was going on, I could be much more straightforward. While I was in Los Angeles, I saw the black triangle craft with the red lights, just once.  It hovered over the San Fernando Valley - I think long enough for me to see it - then it left. The only other thing that was pretty spectacular, was a light show over Mesa Arizona around 1991 - it was a series of dots and dashes in blasts of color, that streamed across the sky and went directly over our apartment.  I got my husband and the neighbors, and we all stood there and watched.  It came from the direction of the airport, and the next day, the paper ran a story that somebody was fooling around with lights - and not to pay any attention to them. I have a lot to say, there's more, but that gives you a general idea of what happened.  I had problems going to Santa Fe NM a couple of years ago.  I told them, again,  ""I am not going to tolerate a repeat performance, so if you don't mind, I need you to back off!""  And they respect my wishes, if you can believe that. We sort of have an understanding.  They're here if I need them to be here for any reason, which is sort of comforting, but I really don't want to go thru anything like that ever again unless it's part of scientific research and there's plenty of documentation and researchers on board.  I'm more than happy to walk any research team thru this, I'm just not going to chase them down.  They need to ask me and respect the territory.  I refuse to be treated like a nut job -  I just saw your Characteristics secion.  Yes, my car engine stopped and forced me to walk for miles in the desert.  Also, in 1987, on that date, (I am positive of the date)  tucson lost all electricity at the date and hour - all the electricity went out for about 15 minutes in an electrical storm - you would have to check the newspapers - but I'm sure that was the day -  The voice kept saying ""I'm turning off the power"" - apparently they can't get in unless the power is out -  There was also a lot of extremely loud ""car"" type horns - deep ones - blasting signals - it all happened so fast - and then the voice goes ""how's this?""  He's a real sarcastic alien with a really great sense of humor - it's like ""jokes on me"" - It's like, human beings think they are so smart, and that just isn't the case.  We are really really stupid.  I came to terms with my stupidity years ago, and I guess that's appealing. I'm positive they were watching my dad and then me - this is a family thing - I am not even sure if we're from this planet - I'm starting to have my doubts seriously - this family is very very strange -  You won't be able to meet my oldest brother - but he looked exactly like an alien drawing - he was super tall and very thin and bony - he even scared me a little - He passed away a few years ago.  I guess our family was out in Roswell when that craft went down in 1947 - I was born in 1946 in California - at least that's what they tell me.  My birth certificate is from a hospital that doesn't exist anymore - and there are no photos of my mom being pregnant - she and I never got along much - it was mostly dad and myself. Well, if that isn't the strangest story you got in a long time, at least you were entertained.  I also see that you want to know if I agree to talk to an investigator.  Yes, you can do that, but don't do it over a phone. Email is better.  I can't talk by phone to anybody and depend on the conversation being confidential.  My ex husband works at the National Security Agency in Washington.  He monitors my phone calls - he hates me because I threw him out 30 years ago.  That's a whole other story.   I wish aliens would pick him up and keep him.  Much love.  ((name deleted))",2009-08-27T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

A clear cold night... saw Orion's belt and my gaze was drifting toward zenith when, at appox 10 degrees south of zenith i noticed a ""string"" of dim, starlike, warm-color, (reddish) points of light passing overhead from zenith heading due south.   The ""string"" was approx 1.5x to 2x diameter of full moon, marked by almost equal intervals between the lights.  The lights traveled in a straight line toward the south (there was a bit of very slight variation in the formation - they were not following the leader with exact precision - the spacing between them varied slightly and there was also some very slight variation side-to-side as they moved south.  This gave me the feeling that the lights were each separate entities and not part of the same rigid body (but they could have been part of a non-rigid body, like a string, for example).  The lights were each only about half as bright as Betelgeuse and definitely much smaller than Betelgeuse... I might not have noticed if there was only one of them... it was the formation that caught my eye.  I followed them for about 5 seconds as they covered approx 35-40 degrees of sky before they faded into the southern sky.

The lights were visible through his back patio door, which faces east with about 15 miles of visibility into the horizon.  The object was hovering about 1.5 miles off of the ground and was about 3 miles away.  It was over a residential neighborhood.  Initially, I thought that it was a reflection of Christmas lights through the patio door from a neighbor’s house across the street.  We opened the patio door and observed the object, which emitted no sound and what looked like white lights coming in towards the object.  The object changed shape from a distorted diamond shape, to oval, to circular, to arms of light outstretching from the middle to one giant ball of bright light.  We witnessed colors such as blue, green, amber, red, purple, and almost every color of the rainbow coming from the object.  The light patterns were completely erratic and random with no steady pattern.  The image maintained position for about 15 minutes but changed shapes and colors frequently.  As earlier stated, there were white balls of light that looked like they were being sucked towards the object and at that moment, above our heads, a comet shot in the direction towards the object.  This comet was low and extremely bright, and unlike any I have ever seen.  We went into the house and turned out all of the lights and watched the object change formations.  Then, it just started disappearing into the east, like it was being sucked up into a vacuum tube.  The momentum seemed very quick, and within a second, it was gone.  We sat there in amazement, trying to figure out what we just saw.  As we were watching the sky, the object came back in the same sucking type motion back towards the west.  The patterns, such as color and shapes, remained the same erratic pattern as before, but the object was higher into the sky.  It stayed for only about 7 minutes this time, and then disappeared in the s! ame fash ion as before.  After disappearing the second time, the object did not return.  We continued to watch the sky until 2400, but the object never returned.  We recorded about 22 seconds of poor quality footage on a nikon camera with video options, but could not zoom in.

I told him that fireworks are shot up from the ground. I told him these items came downward. Then we became somewhat nervous. As an African-American man, it is rare that we see these types of objects, or at least publicly tell someone. I work for an air line and I tried to tell myself that it was a plane or maybe someone was playing with a flare. However, the lights started to make all kinds of shapes. The three lights became four and made a triangular shape. Then the lights just hovered. Afterwards, the lights became five and made an angle like this >. Then it just hovered.

As I watched  these lights they started moving, they would move side to side and up and down. They appeared in the eastern sky about 135 degrees off the ground. They looked like they were about 50 miles from my house, and about 35 miles apart. I couldn't make out the shape of them, but the lights I saw looked like they took up the whole front on the object. This wasn't the first time I saw them, but when I did see them before  I thought my  eyes were playing tricks on me, but after seeing two of them together tonight I knew  they were real I'm a 70 year old male who is retired and living here in North Carolina.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,35.18325652173913,-83.42856086956522

I have always been somewhat skeptical about UFOs, but until the night of November 8th 2009 (I believe) I saw something completely incredible!  I was walking out of my girlfriends house to kiss her good night at around 8:12 pm. We looked across the lake up towards the mountains and noticed what seemed to be two sets of headlights (meaning four headlights total)  coming through the sky( I thought it was coming down the mountain but that was about 6 miles away) my girlfriend too thought it was a car way off in the distance, so she walked inside. I stood there for a few moments noticing the lights getting closer and closer.  I noticed a man jog by as I was staring at these lights, which were now only 100 yards away from me and getting closer.a sound of a VERY HIGH PITCHED jet engine came closer and closer(it was so high pitched it was almost a whistle) by this time I was looking straight up in the sky a! t this thing directly overhead me. It had a helicopter shaped body but with wings that were slanted downwards at a slight angle, and at the end of these wings were large “fans” which appeared to be angled down causing the fans to act as propellers. But under the main body was a jet (meaning I saw a small flame shooting out of the bottom which was maybe 2ft long) the object in question seemed to be about 30 ft long with a twenty foot wingspan and was only flying 50 FT OVER THE TREELINE. It proceeded to keep its pace which seemed to be about 100-150 mph  I then ran into my girlfriends house screaming and yelling when I told them what I saw and heard thet were amazed because they couldnt hear this thing fly over. In all my experience living around planes, I have NEVER seen anything like this…the guy who was jogging said he thought it was a low flying B12 bomber or something…but it wasn’t that big. I don’t know if this is alien craft but It looked man made…but either way it was! unidentified.

See full description. I was walking home from a movie one evening. I had just passed the Rubber Bowl on George Washington Blvd, in south east Akron, when the sky behind me lit-up. I thought someone had turned on the lights in the stadium, so I turned around to look. Out of the night sky(from the north) came a bright object. It was in a shallow dive. At that moment it seemed to have slightly elongated ""wing tips"" and a very bright - whitish glow. It was silent, but I could definitely feel its presents in the sky above me. It slowed as it passed almost directly over head.(Perhaps 2,000 feet above me.) Then it picked up speed and climbed away at about a 45 degree - upward angle, going south. It was gone in less than half a minute and the sky became black again. Estimated entry speed was + 600 mph. Over head speed was about 100 mph. And estimated exit speed accelerated from 100 mph to well over 1,000 mph before it was out of sight. Overall estimated distance that the object appeared visible was: Approach equals 3 miles. Over head about 1 mile. Departure probably 20 miles, before going totally out of sight. I have seen meteors, artillery shells, tracer bullets, and all kinds of aircraft flying at night: And there has been nothing that I've ever seen that behaved like this object. Once over head, I could see that it was slightly curved all across the leading edge (from tip - to tip), and had two smaller curves meeting in the center, at the trailing edge. It had no distinguishable fuselage in the center. A guess at the size would be 100 feet tip to tip and 30 feet leading edge to trailing edge. It could have been 8 feet thick in the center area, but I only got a glimpse at that, as it was coming toward me and going away. There was a lot of very bright light nearest the object. The light was longer and brighter span-wise. It was smooth, with no exterior features, lights or markings. I was not close enough to determine if it was made out of metal, ceramic or other substance, but its surface did have a bright white glow about it. That's all I can tell you.

It was about 2 feet in diameter and between 15 and 20 feet off the ground traveling south when I saw it coming from behind my friend. I immediately yelled,""look a boomarang, lets catch it.""  He looked up and saw it and we both waited for it to come down but it continued traveling on a straight steady course and did not come down as we expected it to. We ran and grabbed our sling shots and ran after it.  We ran into a large open field behind his house and watched it as it traveled over a tree, which was in the yard of a house about 1 block away.  We knew that a large woods was immediaately behind that house and so we ran across the open field to the woods and then ran about 1 mile through the woods to find out if we could still see the object.  We peered out over what was then a city trash dump but could no longer see the object.  It was traveling at about 10 miles per hour when it came between the houses and made no noise what so ever.  The object guided itself to pass immediately over the tree of the house which was one block away.  The object looked to me like a boomarang spinning so fast as to appear as a solid disc, but it may have actually been solid, I don't know.  I chose to classify it as circular instead of disc because I don't believe it was very thick at all.  My friend still remembers this event today, which is at least 42 years later.

The tractor had its headlights on and he looked around, but did not observe anything at ground level.  He looked above the tractor as he reached the end of the field and observed a large cigar shaped vehicle hovering motionless above the tractor as he did his turn around.  This vehicle was observing and following him as he crossed the field.  He became paniced and decided to leave the field when he reached the other end of the field. He raised the plow out of the ground and drove the tractor out of the field.  He then drove into a heavily grove of trees and when he reached it he shut off his headlights and shut off the tractor engine.  The cigar shaped vehicle followed him over the heavy wooded area and when the tractor was no longer visible the cigar shaped vehicle accelerated and streaked away at a great rate of speed.

It’s something I will never forget. My Navy buddies and I, all stationed at NATTC Millington at the time, were driving back from a weekend in Nashville.  We were traveling in two cars.  I was driving the second car, my red Fiat X1/9.  Since my car was only a two seater, it was just me and one other guy who witnessed the event.  It was a Sunday night and warm enough to drive with the hardtop removed from my car.  Our view out the roof of my car was perfect. I don’t recall exactly which back road we were traveling on, but we did exit I-40 at some point, west of Nashville, so that we could come into Millington from the north.  I’m fairly certain we passed through Covington, so I’m guessing we were on highway 54, west of Brownsville...thanks to Google maps today that would seem the most logical route we would have driven.  Today, it seems a bit out of the way to get from Nashville to Millington, but you have to keep in mind I was young, loved to drive my convertible, and because it was a warm night out, I was most likely looking for any excuse to drive with the top off and delay our arrival back to the barracks as long as I could. I was the first to spot the bright light that was slowly moving to the north of the highway.  It was quite low to the ground and moving parallel with us.  I would say it was about a quarter of a mile away, maybe slightly further.  At first I thought it was a helicopter shinning a spotlight on the ground.  I then pointed it out to my buddy. I was driving the speed limit, which was most likely 55 mph.  As we continued to watch the light, for maybe five seconds or so, it began to accelerate at a high rate of speed (still moving parallel with us), then in an instant, it changed direction at 90 degrees (turning to its left) and rapidly accelerated perpendicular to us, which put my car on a direct path to meet ""this light"" about a 100-150 yards ahead. Because it was obvious to me that our paths were going to cross rather quickly, I immediately took my foot off the gas and began to slow down.  I still had no idea what this thing was. This light was nearly instantly on the right side of the road, then it slowly passed over the highway directly in front of us, 60 to 80 feet off the ground.  So it was pretty low.  It was at this point I realized this was no light. It was perfectly circular in shape, with a brushed metallic color much like a stainless steel appliance.  The bottom of the craft was about the same diameter as the width of the highway.  I’ve always estimated it to be about 40 to 60 feet in diameter.  What I’ve always referred to as the ""flight deck"" of the craft, was about two-thirds the diameter of the bottom section.  (Imagine a round piece of cake with a smaller diameter piece of cake stacked on top of it.)  A Christian friend of mine once told me I witnessed the ""wheel, within a wheel.""  The non-Christian I am, has since learned it’s a biblical reference from Ezekiel.  (Still not enough proof to change my mind.)   As the craft passed directly in front of us, I noticed the flight deck section had an array of windows that were rectangular/trapezoidal in shape, translucent in color, arranged in alternating colors of red, yellow, green. It passed from our right to left, directly in front of us.  When it reached the left side of the road...just above the south ditch area of the highway, it began to bank to its left, directly toward us.  I can’t swear to it, but I’m pretty sure my car was at a near dead stop at this point and I’m sure our mouths were hanging wide open. As it passed directly over us, I noticed a circular row of lights on the bottom of the craft.  They were in the same color scheme as the upper lights...red, yellow, and green.  But these lights blinked on and off in an orbital fashion. One thing I distinctly remember is that it was perfectly quiet. The craft made no mechanical noise. The only sound I recall was the sound of a big hunk of something cutting through the night air.  I tell people it sounded like buffeting wind...similar to the sound a low flying goose makes as it passes overhead. The craft passed right over my car, with the two of us looking straight up out of the top of my car.  Once it passed over us, I turned to look back over my right shoulder and it looked like it was going to land in a field just past a grove of trees, on the north side of the road.  At that point I just wanted to get the heck out of there so I hit the gas. Get this.  My buddy was a die-hard amateur photographer with a 35mm camera and extra lenses...all packed in his camera bag tucked behind the seat he was sitting in.  Plenty of photos of The Grand Ole Opry, I’m sure...but neither of us had the presence of mind to pull the thing out to snap off the proof the world has been waiting for.  (Whenever I hear critics argue...""but there’s no proof,"" I can understand why.)   I drove back to the base with both of us looking behind us the entire time.  When we walked into the TV lounge area of the barracks, our buddies who we had been following asked us where we had been.  They claimed to have been back on base 45 minutes before we had arrived behind them. I haven’t a clue as to where those 45 minutes went. I try not to think about it. The next morning during our first class break, my buddy and I pulled aside our class instructor...a Marine Corps gunnery sergeant.  We began telling him our story, and then he stopped us and took us into his office to hear what we had to say.  Because we were stationed on a Navy training command that also included a Naval air station, my buddy and I were convinced the air station’s air traffic control tower would have some sort of record keeping or electronic recording from the previous night’s air traffic activity.  Gunny wouldn’t have any of it and ordered us to never repeat our story.  I’m guessing he thought we were two sailors attempting to come up with some nut-case story to get a discharge. I feel fortunate to have had the experience...whatever it was.  It’s something I’ll never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Nine menacing crafts rounded up a large group of campers on the Colorado River during one incredibly long night.,Winterhaven,CA,1978-03-25T22:00:00,disk,several hours,"Occurred : 3/25/1978 22:00  (Entered as : 03/25/78 22:00) Reported: 5/9/2010 10:44:07 PM 22:44 Posted: 5/12/2010 Location: Winterhaven, CA Shape: Disk Duration:several hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75362.html,"Nine menacing crafts rounded up a large group of campers on the Colorado River during one incredibly long night. On the last Saturday night of March, 1978, I was with a group of friends on a spring break camping trip in a former California State Campground, 18 miles north of Winterhaven California. I say former because the facility had been virtually destroyed by massive flooding from the Colorado River where it had served as a landing for travelers navigating down the River. Before it had been destroyed, it had housed a seasonal general store, as well as a large camping area with large bathroom-shower facilities and Ranger trailer up on a hill overlooking the grounds. But by this year, all of that was gone, and the trailer abandoned by the Rangers but the area was still used by a handful of hardcore campers. During this last Saturday in March, the nine of us were on the peak of last mountain at the farthest end of a chain of foothills that began at the campgrounds and ran north along the Colorado River ending at this last peak overlooking a panoramic view of the entire northwestern desert and river valley below. Before our encounter that night, two truly amazing events occurred.  First we experienced an unexplainable loud buzzing electrical discharges through our hands when flicking our index fingers. We could hear the loud buzz, as well as feel the strong current running through our fingers. This lasted approximately a few minutes and then disappeared.  The second strange anomaly to occur next was - the sunset we watched from the peak lasted a abnormally long time - at least two hours longer than it normally would. We commented on this several times while in progress but no one could explain and unfortunately, no one had a watch to give an accurate accounting. However, it was undoubtedly much longer than can be explained by any normal physical means. And as if that wasn't strange enough, it ended so abruptly, we were caught completely by surprise in the complete darkness of the night. We normally would have already made the long trek back to camp, a couple of miles through the rug! ged foothills, during the twilight which always proceeds the setting of the sun. But in this case, we were so mesmerized by the incredibly long beautiful smoldering orange glow of the sun which appeared to stick right behind the mountains in the far west, we didn't leave, we just naturally expected the benefit of the post sunset, slowly fading twilight, which for some reason didn't happen . . . defying all laws of physics. Once we were confronted with this sudden darkness, we tried to not let it freak us out and gather ourselves for the long treacherously difficult trip back in total darkness, the moon not yet risen, and frankly were a little more than concerned about our safety getting down - especially down the narrow path from the precariously steep cliff we were on - hundreds of feet to the canyon floor below. Anyway, right as we were beginning our descent down, one of our group spotted a star erratically zooming across the night sky in straight lines from point to point. We all began to watch, suddenly pointing to other stars that were behaving in a similar fashion. It didn't take long for the group of us to realize that they couldn't possibly be stars but must be lights in our own night sky that just resembled stars. And sure enough, with in a few minutes, they all gathered together in a tight rotating ball growing larger as they dropped out of the night sky in to the distant horizon,! appearing to settle into the river basin several miles northwest up stream from our location. Although below our view, we watched their bright domes of light wind down the river south towards us. In a fairly short time they came into our view as they appeared from around a bend in the river entering our section of the valley. There were nine crafts flying in a diamond formation. They each had several search lights fanning the area as if they were frantically looking for something or someone. As they came underneath us in the washes below, we were, of course, still several hundred feet above on our perch, they suddenly broke formation and shot out in different directions in what appeared to be a co-ordinated military maneuver securing the area. Until this point, they had hovered silently down the river - but when they broke into their frantic search in different directions, their crafts gave off bright flashes of lights and loud crackling blasts of electrical discharges resembling thunder and lighting. I could feel and smell the static electrical energy fields they were creating as they surged about. I could also hear the roar of air they propelled and also the sound of the water being displaced by the rush of air as well. It was amazing how quickly they would move from one point to another - a brilliant flash light with a simultaneous crack of thunder and instantaneously be somewhere else stopped dead but for the roar of moving air which appeared a breaking mechanism. As I said, when they came into our area of washes, they broke out of formation and sped around as if looking for something, as this was happening, a very strange event occurred at the very same time. The other eight people I was with on the ledge began talking amongst themselves as if they were in a different time and place. And no matter how hard I tried to get their attention concerning the fantastic scene unfolding below, they just continued talking to each other seemingly oblivious to it all. In fact I got the distinct impression they were discussing a sunset lasting a very long time. I basically felt they were sacred senseless and were in some kind of fear induced manic behavior which seemed impossible to break, so I gave up trying, turning back to the crafts below which had moved down the river past us to the campground a couple of miles away to our south - except for two craft that had shot below our position inland around the other side of the foothills. Instead of moving on south on the inland side, these two came quickly back to right below us and one of the craft shot up to our position on the ledge and hovered level with me about a hundred feet away - out over the canyon floor. My companions were still completely engrossed, talking frantically to each other, even though I made one last futile attempt to draw their attention to the ship silently hanging in front of us. It was shaped like the Bat plane - with a curved, rounded front, and sweeping back to two large wings comprising the back. The front appeared to have a elongated windshield mimicking the line of the curve - making up about a third of the height of the ship which was probably fifteen to twenty feet. The width at its widest - near the back from one wing to another - was approximately twice its height, maybe more, like fifty feet. It radiated a fluorescent reddish light from underneath that lit up the entire area in a eerie blood like glow. And I could see! equipment like or led lights inside the front windshield. There was also a gentle humming sound similar to an electric train transformer. I felt a pronounced static electrical field like presence engulfing the area. In a matter of a few moments the craft began to rise above me and came closer - to about fifty feet - now I could see the shape, which I described already, because of the glow of the red panels which mimicked the shape of each back wing. It was about as long as it was wide. It was making no noise as it lifted above me and it did this very slowly and gently with just the faint transformer hum. As soon as it was directly above me - a green spotlight came on in the middle of the craft between the two red panels and I was entirely encased in a green mist that felt hot to my skin. I immediately felt a sexually charged sensation in my balls as well as the base of my spine that began to surge through my entire body. It was like an all consuming orgasm of heated energy pulsating my every fibre. As I seemed to climax, I felt myself lifting or levitating towards the ship. It wasn't like I was being pulled, as much as I was being energized to a float on my own - like my molecules were being manipulated by an internally-produced, stimulating force. The last thing I saw at this point was looking down on my friends still talking manically amongst themselves as I floated upward.

What we saw there was this...a large, silver object which appeared perfectly round, beaming some kind of light on us.   Our jaws dropped, and we simply sat there frozen, stunned and terrified for a few seconds, which was how long it took me to receive a silent communication which was,""you're afraid"".  Then, the object took off upward, resembling what I could very loosely compare to the Roadrunner in the old cartoons when he was under chase, said ""beep beep"", and ended up way beyond the mountains on the horizon in a matter of seconds.   Only now it was who-knows-how-many-miles directly above our heads (this was probably what is known as a ""hyperspace"" move); it then did a slow rectangular trajectory, then disappeared behind a cloud.  Perhaps it joined with something else, because what we witnessed next, through the clouds w! as a huge mass of light moving up, up and away into the northeastern sky.

Was ridiculed for it by my family for what I am about to write. I am of the age of 35 yrs and almost 20 yrs ago, a friend and I were honestly getting ready to head to the lakes about a mile from my home at the time to have a few beers.  Mind you we hadn't had any to drink at this point. We pulled up to about the end of the lake, “they were man made lakes for reservoirs,” and parked the car got out and cracked our first beer.  This was around 9:30 pm..  The year was I believe 1990 and it was around march , “what day I could not be sure,”.  Anyhow we just cracked our first beer and looked over to the north east toward cape Canaveral fl. We noticed a luminescent orange light emerging from the ground. Our first reaction was what is that?  I said it's the shuttle. My friend says , “no couldn't be I didn't hear anything on the news about a launch”. I said, “ Me either but there it is. The strange thing is that it looked to be traveling straight up and  at a very slow accent. My friend also noticed this and said that's weird. I agree. And sure as he said that it looked to have shot straight up what looked to be at least  2 miles up within the blink of an eye. We then noticed it coming in our direction. After seeing it move toward us we guessed it to be at least 3to4 miles away. It was over the lake not more than 50 yards in front of us within less than three seconds. Our initial reaction was holy sh** what the f**k is that. My friend and I got in the care shaking trying to put the keys in the ignition. I told him how many time in your life will you see this again? So we stayed. I remember it being shaped like a slender oval. It reflected the moonlight and the moon as would a mirror and had two lights on top swaying back and forth touching each other. No noticeable windows or anything. I don't think they knew we were there. I believe it was purely accidental we saw them that close because when I opened the car door to get a better look, “ this thing at an angle straightened up shot side to side across the lakes at what appeared to now be a white light. It shot back and forth within 2 seconds stopped  at the end of the lakes and just shot off towards west palm bch fl you didn't have time to even close your eye and it was gone. We both agreed that we had just seen what we had seen. I told him we should tell someone. He said sh** I'm not telling anyone there going to think your f***ing crazy. I went home told my mom and brother who both till this day call me a liar and just don't believe. Look I wasn't a believer in this. Never told stories like this in my whole life about seeing things. Yet how can you help what you see. I am now and always will be a believer. The story gets better. For about a week after I noticed what appeared to be a white light resembling a star would always be on the right of the cars I would be in and would also change direction with the car as we would turn there it would be on the right side of the car. Weird I thought at first until I thought that no other stars do that so what the f am I going crazy?  I kept telling my girlfriend at the time and she about thought I was going crazy too. Until about 6 days after the initial sighting I noticed from my house back by the lakes a light. Looked like a spot light from a helicopter. I told my girl do you see that? She said it's just a plane or something like that. So out of all last hope I grabbed my lighter , “I know sounds stupid,” and began flickering in click click click pause click pattern. My girl looked at me like I was crazy. Can you blame her. Everyone else thought I was crazy. Until I noticed the light got real bright and flickered the same pattern. My girl said that was co-incidence so I did it again in a different pattern. And once again it did also. At this point my girl even said that's weird. I noticed the light starting to come our direction and as it got closer we heard the sound of a prop plane. My girlfriend then said see I told you it was a plane and I said no crap your right. At this moment the prop plane sound changed to what sounded like a helicopter . I started to trip at this point and I asked my girl if she just heard that thing change sound. She said yes. And at that moment it sounded like it changed to the sound of a single jet propulsion engine. The light began to get closer and as it came by the street in front of the house the light dimmed out to almost nothing and the sound just stopped. And there it was again and my girl saw it with her own eyes and starting crying and saying I want to go inside. I told her to look and tell me I am not crazy and she said I see it I see it I want to go in the house. I told her to go inside and get my mom and her husband , “at the time,” and tell them to come out the back door and look up over the house in the back yard . This thing was 30 ft high and probably 30 ft in front of us. By the time my mom and her husband came out I watched this thing start flickering and moving up down left right and random patterns as fast as the eye could see and disappeared . My mother said that I talked about it so much to my girl that I convinced her to see this in living color and she saw it only because I convinced her to see this, my girl I mean. She even told my mother and they did not believe us. If I was that convincing to make someone see that then put me on ripleys or I am in the wrong line of work. Oh well I know what I saw and have not seen it in almost 20yrs. Moved to wis. And recently strange things have occurred over the last two weeks that I can not explain. White star like object sitting in the sky around dusk very similar to the one I thought was around for a week prior to the second sighting when I was sixteen. Noticed every night for last two weeks at least ten times this has occurred. Will watch the star slowly descend and turn to amber orb no visual shape other than amber or every once in a while it changes colors but mostly amber. Sits there and moves slow almost as if to get my attention. Will watch it fade out to nothing and light will reappear bright white and turn amber and move slightly . Call this strange but it is really weir-ding me out .   After 19 yrs what the hell is it and why does it keep coming back . Have looked around environment and questioning it you know , “ maybe it's a street light , but come up with the same answer. It's not! Reason: It has not been here every night.  I've seen this thing at least! 10 times and on a couple of clear nights its not there and 30min later there it is . So if anyone can help me solve this riddle pls do. Note: I have never been abducted nor have I ever seen an alien being, just what I saw when I  was sixteen and now again almost 20 yrs later. Have never been inside of this thing or anything like this. Just a color changing orb appears at close range. Is it possible after one has a close encounter for these things to show up and let you know at a distance that they are back or am I just fortunate enough to see this again ? And if so why ? Haven't seen or looked up in almost 20 yrs . Tried to forget what I saw. This all started 4/14/2010 right before the meteor event. Saw these lights before the meteor and have 9 other occasions over the last 2 weeks. I know I am not nuts considering I haven't seen this in 19 yrs and not the same. This has been appearing around9:30 10: almost every night for the last two weeks. Any explanation would be valued.

It was red at the beginning, but after a few minutes, it got brighter as it approached and resolved into a multicolored profusion of lights.   The event lasted about 5 minutes, and during the last 30 or so seconds, the collection of multicolored, randomly flashing lights stopped directly over my house, which was about a hundred feet from the garden.  It was dark, so I couldn't discern the shape of whatever it was, just a bunch of randomly flashing multicolored lights.   It appeared to be about 100 feet above the house, and if I had to guess based on the cluster of lights as an indicator of size, I would say that it was about 20 feet wide.   Anyway, as it stopped over my house, a spotlight shone down from it onto the house.  I must emphasize that it made no noise at all during the entire time, even when it was almost directly overhead.   When the spotlight appeared, I panicked and ran into the house.  The person who I was standing with outside watching it followed me after about 15 more seconds.  After I had calmed down some, we both went back outside and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2010-05-12T00:00:00,32.9642,-94.9275

It was about sundown on a March evening in 1989.  I forgot the exact day.  I was riding in my friend’s Jeep and we were heading back to his apartment.  We were stopped at a red light at an intersection heading east.  Up in the Southeastern sky, it looked like a jet airliner was on fire heading down toward Earth.  The smoke and fire cleared after a few seconds and revealed a large, rectangle shaped, solid object.  It had dozens of white lights along the side.  I want to say they seemed to be windows, because the light seemed to be coming from inside the object, not mounted on the outside. The object seemed to be about a football field or so long.  It hovered at treetop level at a fifteen degree angle slowly drifting north about a mile away.  It made no sound. Everyone in their cars at the intersection was freaking out.  All of this took place over about a minute or so, maybe less. It had drifted pretty far North by the time the traffic light turned green.  That's when we saw and heard fighter jets (lights out) screaming toward the object from the far Southern sky.  As we hurried to try to get under it to get a better view, we lost sight of it for a few seconds because of the trees on the left side of the road.  When we got to the next intersection, the jets flew right over us, and we saw the object way down the street.  I could see the back end of it.  I would guess it was about a mile away, moving faster and much higher in the sky now.  We knew we would never catch up with it.  Almost as soon as we saw it, it quickly moved very high in the sky at an unbelievable speed, and it was gone. About an hour later, I went and told my Dad about it, and drew some sketches. We watched the ten o’clock news, as they were going to have a story WITH FILM FOOTAGE of an object seen in the sky that night.  The film they showed was taken by a lady that had been at a local nearby restaurant that evening, and it had that restaurant’s sign in the foreground.  But what they showed looked like a falling star, nothing more.  No word from the dozens of witnesses that saw what we saw.  No footage of the object hovering a hundred feet or so off the ground, or any of the rest of it.  They said it was a ""Russian satellite falling out of its orbit.""   When those things happen, don't they know about when and where those things will fall?  I'm all the time hearing weathermen saying things like, ""Keep an eye in the Western sky tonight to catch a glimpse of blah blah blah.. Over the years, I've wondered how many other people saw that, and I've wanted to compare notes.  I haven't been able to find anything in any newspaper of TV. archives that even told the story. Since that night, I've questioned everything.  I truly believe the government knows much more than we even believe they do.  I hate to sound like one of those conspiracy freaks, but after seeing undisputable proof that we are not alone, it makes me uneasy to not have the whole story.  Anyway, that's my story, as best as I can remember it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2010-05-12T00:00:00,36.109455879967555,-95.93524541768045

Last night july 1, 2009, while in tonopah arizona, near the palo verde nuclear plant. We saw a very large triangle shaped UFO. we were driving down a dirt raod, and saw a bright flashing light. we were in the middle of nowhere, when driving down a dirt road, when we saw a flashing light.  we had seen objects here before, and our intentions were to look for ufo's, this is a hot spot. people who live in this area have been chased in there cars, seen objects on a regular basis. It was 10:30pm, we went off road behind some mountains, no sooner had we come around the moutain, we saw the large flashing light. All of us were scared, but at the same time curious. my friends girlfriend was crying and telling us to turn around. we got withing 2 to 300 yards from the light. It was the size of 3 football fields. it was triangle in shape, and windows around it. it was about 3 stories tall, and about 30 feet offf the ground. we flashed our lights and it flashed back, in the same sequence of flashes. my friend James and I gout out and walked closer. the closer we got, the better we could make out what was standing in the windows. there were small big headed aliens, and then 7-to 9foot tall aliens. we based this off the size of the windows. some of the windows you could see through, the other windows were dark, but then the dark windows, cleared up one by one, and as they went clear more and more aliens appeared through the windows. James was video taping the whole time. it was a sureal expierience. i was terrified, but excited at the same time! we walked closer and had to stop because the heat coming from the craft was so intense. the craft hovered and then landed. a large pannel at the bottom of the craft opened, and then two aliens proceeded to walk out. this absolutely terrified us more, but we couldn't move or talk. i remember trying to scream, and say run, but we couldn't move, or talk. Heather and Jamie were in the car honking the horn screming to come back, but we couldn't respond or move. the a! liens wa lked up to within 20 feet of us. one of them was very thin and tall, bout 8-9 feet, the other one was about 3-4 feet. we stood there in amazement, shock because we couldn't move or speak. Then a calmness came over us they were speaking to us telepathically. they were saying not to be scared they weren't going to harm us. i remember asking why they were here in my head, and they heard what i was thinking. this conversation went on between the 4 of us for 15-20 minutes. they said they were here to help us, so that we would not destroy our planet, and that there was a horrible event coming soon, that it had to be stopped. james asked if it was something like 911, they commented no bigger, and it would come from the middle east. I was thinking to myself like I had been in this situation before, and the tall alien heard my thoughts, and repeated my name. he said yes henry you have been visited like this before, and he told me. when you were 6 in deming new mexico, you were in the desert exploring, and we talked to you then. I had blocked this out, but it all came back.  they said they new we were coming, and wanted us to warn people of global warming and what was to come if we didn't start taking care of our planet. visions of disaster entered our head, as if to show us what was to come, if we didn't warn people. the taller alien walked closer, and held my hand, and I was no longer scared, neither was James. He said that he would see him again soon, and to warn people about saving aour planet, to both James and I. James was recording the whole time. they turned returned to the craft, and it was gone in a split second. when the craft left, we both fell over like weak, stood up and made our way back to the car. when we got there Heather and Jamie weren't crying anymore, they just hugged us. when we got in the car, it wouldn't start. so we sat there for a minute, and then it just turned on, by its self. like if things couldn't have gotten any wierder. as we started to drive away, three military helicopters apper! eaed, an d were shining light on us. then  5 military hummers showed up, and a chased us. I told James to hide the camera, Jamie and heather started crying. LUke airforce base is about 10 miles away from where were at. I tried running, but over a speaker they told us to pull over or they would be foreced to shoot at us. we pulled over, and military soldiers surrounded the car. Two men dressed in black, opened the door, and asked us to get out. One of them looked like I had seen him before. He asked us to get out and both men in black questioned us, while the military personell searched the car. the men in black asked us what we saw, how long we were there, what we were doing there, if we had any contact with the alien craft. the size, shape, what we saw, if they communicated with us. we answered no to everything, and then one of the soldiers found the video camera. The men in black reviewed it, and said we were not to speak of this. they took the camera, and took me with them. James, heather, and jamie asked where they were taking me, and they said don't worry about it. I left with them and they questioned me in the car. I kept looking at the one man dressed in black because i had seen him before. He asked why i kept starring at him, and said do i look familiar, scared I said no. they questioned me more, on what they said to me, and if I had ever seen or expirenced this before. I said no, and the at the I-10 highway, by the tonopah joes resturant, they let me out and then they were gone. i called James on his cell phone and they picked me up. it was a crazy night, but i had to report this. if anything happens to me James, will contaact someone, at your facility. our evidence is gone, but this really happened. we questioned people who lived in the area this morning, and they all saw the craft, and all the military soon after. this morning while questioning people who lived in the area, they all said that the military helicopters were flying over early in the direction from where they saw the craft. we drove down t! he I-10 to where we turned off of and there were military soldier who had the road blocked off, and helicopter flying to and from that area, so we aren't crazy, and there are 4 of us who wittnessed this, along with the people who live in the area who saw the craft. we talked to 15 people who lived in the area and all, but one saw the craft, the other one an old lady said she was asleep, but was woken up by the mititary heleicopters, and they have been going back and forth since midnight last night. I hope my story opens peoples eyes, and they see we are not alone, and the aliens are just trying to help us save our planet, and live peacefully. We are going back again tonight, but taking a different road, I will keep you updated. ((name deleted))",2009-08-05T00:00:00,33.5778,-113.0234

The light was higher than ive ever seen,it was a very distinct and sharp circular looking light.  I followed it with my eyes for about 2 minutes, it was moving very fast right up with the stars. It travelled accross the sky up by the stars in a straight line for a minute, it then went over my head so i had to lean back vertically to see it and follow it, it then started flying downwards then turned in the complete oposite direction, it went out of my view about a minute later. I heard a noise in the bushes right next to me straight afterwards and got a horrible feeling of fear down my neck and back so i ran inside and locked the door. I do not know whether the movement in the bush was an alien being as it could have well been an animal like a cat or a hedghog but i was so scared i didnt dare look at the bushes for longer than a split second. This is the second time i have seen something unexplainable in the last 6 months, the last time i recorded a triangle shaped craft with lights in the corners just up by beamsley beacon, the reason i mention this is because the Menwith Listening station in harrogate is relitavly close to addingham and may have been something to do with it. The more i see this type of thing the more scared i feel about whats going in our universe and wether we really are safe on this planet.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

I was returning home with my wife and children from visiting family in Saratoga Springs.  When we got out of the car my 5 year old asked if a bright light up in the sky was a planet.  It was a clear night so myself, my daughter and wife began to look up into the sky to star gaze.  I looked at the light again and realized that it had nearly moved behind a tree.  It did not blink so it could not have been a commercial airliner.  It stayed a yellow/white and was clearly very very high up in the air.  It moved due North very fast.  There were other commercial aircraft in the sky that night flying due south and north west.  At first it was travelling the speed of a commercial aircraft, but it picked up speed quickly and began to travel 5-6 times the speed of a commercial aircraft very quickly. It made no sound. As the light approached the horizon we looked up and saw another light moving in the same tragectory.  It was nearly exactly the same in all ways including speed.  I watched until each light had traveled over the horizon and was out of sight.  The entire event did not take any more than 4-5 minutes. The speed at which they accelerated was amazing, and I have been unable to stop thinking about it since.  My daughter and wife witnessed this as well.  I am convinced that it was not a satalite or asteroid/shooting star and was some sort of aircraft.  I am unsure if it was in the atmosphere or outside of it.  They were not satelites.  The most likely scenario is some sort of high flying supersonic aircraft.  The lack of any noise was the most shocking thing about the whole incident...until I saw the second light following the first. Can you find out if the military had any aircraft flying north at supersonic speed along the NY/VT border that night?  If they did not then I would call it a UFO just due to the speed, brightness of the light, consistancy of the light, and exact trajectory of each object. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of ISS.

They were above the clouds;  no sound;  no strobe lights like aircraft would have.  Moved from southwest to northeast over Eau Claire although on slightly different trajectories.  They each moved at a fairly fast, and constant, rate of speed and were out of view in about 2 minutes. One witness says he has seen lights like this before over Eau Claire several times in the last 15 years.  The other witness has never seen lights like these before. One witness ran for binoculars.  Through binoculars lights just looked like bright lights;  no further detail could be seen. Unusually bright areas of lightning followed the sightings in the west, northwest, and north within 15 minutes.  Then clouds moved in and there was a mild thunderstorm with mild rain. Observers were out in the yard with pets when lights were seen.  Both observers are former Air Force members, in medical professions, not flight professions.  They live in an area with lots of overflight of aircraft and these lights are not consistent with any typical overflying aircraft.

England.UK  Saucer. 5 mins.  Moved from one side of wilndow view (house side) to opposite side. 04/30/09 In 1958 living in hostel (nineteen year old males) sharing a bedroom with one other male. Early in  the summer morning (it seemed quite light outside but not really dawnlight). I was awoken by my room mate (the room was small and narrow, he slept at one end and I at the other, we were on the first floor up, the hostel being on the outskirts of a small village, our room had a large, long window which looked out above a small conservatory, flat roof, and over the large lawn, then into the middle distance of field and hill, then skyline. My room mate called me from sleep, saying, what's that out there, I eventually got up and went to the window (his view from his bed was to the left of where I stood, so I looked in that direction I did not see anything but I instinctively looked up to my right and there, above a leafy chestnut tree (it seemed just a few feet above, against the clear sky)was this saucer shape object (in the 1950s I, we, did not know anything about 'flying saucers' or 'ufos', and indeed I had completely forgotten about the incident when wakenig up in the morning proper.)The size of the saucer was, or seemed, about four foot in diameter and about three foot in height. It was completely silent, I did not know what it was, it had, on the raised 'bulb' shape on top, (or I'm not sure now, whether it was lower down on the main body) a horizontal row of oval-like windows (frosted as I coud not see into them)I looked really hard into the windows and at that moment it just shot away, totally silent, no lights and in a blinking of an eyelid it had gone (oddly, I puzzled over at the time concerning the distance and speed which it became so small, to a pin prick of white light, then gone into the middle distance yet against the background of the hill, so it did not seem to go high and away in the sky but more of a trajectory curve - that's my adult word knowledge.)Years later I thought that my peering into the windows was an energy interference and so it made off. The saucer had a short s! tream of red behind it which seemed to be a connected to it, till the saucer had pinpricked into a tiny white light.I wondered why it, seemingly, had moved from left to right outside the window (only about eighty feet up in the air, and our window was say twenty feet up and I wondered and felt sad that if I had not of eagerly peered into its windows whther it would have stayed longer). Apart from another friend coming up to me the next day, saying that my room mate had seen this object in the sky, I had completely forgotten about it and then, I had never had it in mind until twenty five years later when my young son was all into ufos (1980s) that the memory suddenly shot into my mind, fresh again and since then it has been in and out of my thoughts. This place was in a Hertfordshire village, Waterford, in England, United Kingdom.(Incidentally,and a big coincidence, in early 2002 I went to visit a friend up in the north of England, Newcastle, and he introduced me to a female friend of his and as she and I chatted we discovered that in the 1950s she had lived in the same, Waterford,village and at the same time. I told her of my saucer sighting, surpringly she and her family had, often, seen 'lights' over the common land of the village. I have wondered why would the saucer and the lights visited this small village in the countryside. (Sorry for going on, but this is the first time I have relayed these experiences to any 'official' body, such as yourselves).

There’s a strange feeling coming over you like that some how you are drawn to whoever is inside the thing.  It starts moving back on a 45deg. angle to the path it came in on, and as it does it starts to rise!  Suddenly it moves upward with increditable speed and no change in sound.  As the lights disappear you feel like you have just lost your best friend.  You look at your brother who is about twenty feet from you and two years younger.  You both run to the house to tell your dad what you have just seen.  He dismisses it as so much garbage because he’s a Baptist preacher and that blows his religious theories all to hell!

This is a very old case that has had me wondering all these years what this thing was.  I was only 10 years old at the time, and my Father, Mother, aunt and uncle and cousin went to an old drive-in movie theatre just outside of Atlanta.  This drive-in had bleachers at it similar to what you would see on a small sports field. My cousin and i were watching the movie from the bleachers while our parents were still in my uncle's car when a boy on the top row of the bleachers yelled out, '' look, there goes a flying saucer!'' we all looked in the direction he was looking in and there was this brightly lit white object that looked like the lid to a round candy dish with a dome like thing on top. This thing was moving very rapidly just above the tree line and disappeared below the horizon. I didn't think about it after it disappeared and turned around and turned my attention to the movie again until the same kid that first saw it yelled, '' here it comes again!!! but this time this thing was coming directly toward us!  Every child on those bleachers including me and my cousin ran for cover.  We searched frantically for our parents but could not find the car as it was quite dark, so we ran into the building that housed the projector booth and the snack bar.  I told my cousin to look out and see if it was gone, and he said he didn't see it, so we stepped back outside and to our horror, this thing was directly overhead!   We ran again trying to find our parents in the car, and to my great relief i heard my Mom yelling, '' we are over here!'' and we ran to the safety of our parents and the car. This thing looked quite different from the way it did the first time we saw it. It had slowly rotating white lights on it like rectangles stood on end.  Nothing else could be seen but the lights in that circular pattern.  It was about 1,000 ft. AGL and looked to be about 30 ft. in diameter. This thing was dark in the center.  It moved slowly and came from the northwest and moved on toward a southeasterly direction until it disappeared behind some trees in the distance.   My Father was in the U.S. Air Force for 6 years and i asked him what that thing was, his reply, '' I don't have the faintest idea.''   I was horrified by this incident. I have never seen another UFO. I would very much like to know if anyone else has saw a UFO that looked like what we saw that night back in June 1964.  As frightning as this was, i would love to see that thing again now that i am a trained observer. If anyone could let me know what this thing was, i would sincerely appreciate it. My witness count is just an estimate, it is possible that over 50 people could have seen this UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))",,33.808705515846256,-84.38988231962239

This event occurred many years ago when I was a teenager camping with parents and relatives in northern Indiana.  As best as I can remember, this event occurred during the summer vacation after I completed the 7th or 8th grade.  It’s hard to be exact on this point as so many years have elapsed, but I can be certain of the month, August, because that’s when my father always took his two week vacation which we spent camping. My Aunt, my cousin, and myself were enjoying live music, a country band if I remember correctly, in an enclosed pavilion at the campground when we decided to step outside for some fresh air.  It was a very warm August evening around 20:30; the air was very heavy and thick, as most August evenings are, and I remember taking in a deep breath of the cooler outside air.  We had walked a bit from the pavilion, making small talk, and found ourselves among a stand of pine.  I had glanced up, for no particular reason, and spotted a very large, orange colored orb hovering right above. I pointed up immediately and said ‘Look!’. My cousin and Aunt both looked up and stared in amazement.  The orb was very large and seemed as big as a three-story house.  It’s hard to say how far away it was, but I remember thinking to myself that I could almost reach up and touch it.  I think I may have actually stretched out my hand.  The orb had a very distinct glow to it, that’s honestly, hard for me to articulate.  The best description I can come up with, and I’ve thought about this from time to time over the years since the event, is that if you could imagine a giant pumpkin that’s been carved very close to the rind, and then a large lit candle place within so that it appears that the surface is emanating light, rather than a direct light source…if this makes sense. The event lasted maybe 30 seconds, the object never moved, never made a sound, and then it just blinked out and was gone. I looked up at my Aunt who was still staring with her jaw gaped open, and said, ‘Did you see that!?’. My Aunt was silent, but my cousin said, ‘I think it was a firework,’ as if to provide some kind of reasonable explanation.  I said in return, ‘There’s no way that was a firework, I think it was a UFO’. We all walked back to the pavilion in silence.  We never spoke of the event after that night. There is one more detail here that I’m not totally sure about, but when we returned the band was wrapping up, and I could swear that when we had left they were just about to take a small break, not finish for the night.   I’ve heard of ‘Missing Time’ since the event and I’m not saying that’s what happened.  I just wanted to note this point because I remembered at the time thinking that is was kind of strange that the band was packing. I’ve always wondered if anyone else had ever seen an object such as this one during the summer of 77 or 78, so I decided to share this event with you folks.   I’ll always remember the amazement and utter awe I felt that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2010-07-19T00:00:00,41.7127,-85.7972

After so much information became public I started to mention it. In the fall of 1978 I was working at the China Lake Naval Weapons Center and living on the military base.  As a friend and I were entering the rear gate, I looked over at him and something caught my eye.  I told him and he looked over and saw it too.   We pulled off the road onto the dirt shoulder and saw a car behind us also pull over.  We sat there for maybe 10 min. and watched this saucer type UFO (rounded dome on both top and bottom and the saucer type middle) hanging over the middle of town.  An illuminated cloud surrounded it.   After a while, it all of a sudden swooshed back really fast heading south west it just flew faster than anything we had in 1978 or now.  The illuminated cloud hung there for quite a few minutes the cloud dissipated and was gone.  The Gentleman I was with and I talked about what we saw.  We both saw the exact same thing.  I’m assuming the car behind us saw the same thing since we both did.   Being a small town I expected something would be published in our local newspaper but it never was.  After so long of not finding it in the newspaper I decided to put aside and not mention it.  Our town at that time had maybe 12000, 13000 people and some one other than us must have seen it. In 1996 while still living in Ridgecrest I was headed west on hwy.178 and then south on hwy.14 to pick up 178 again after a few miles.  While I was climbing up the hill a light caught my eye.  It was speeding fast and was a completely round bright light.  I watched as it went behind the peaks and then into the clear and then back behind the next peak.   OK, I feel really stupid seeing two UFO’s in my lifetime but I did. I still remember the name of the man I was with and know where he went back to his hometown.  He was a very nice honest person and so am I.  I would even be willing to take a lie detector test.   I visited Roswell NM in April and after seeing all of the information there I decided to inform someone.  I'm 65 yrs, old and not in great health.  I would like to find out what professionals like you think of it, especially since we were on a military town.  The object was not over the base.

The object was not obviously metal and did not reflect light and if I guessed how far off the ground it was I would think roughly 300 ft but no more, and the size was large and if it landed it would have likely took up the width of the median and both sides of the roadway. It was bell shaped and the bottom of it had three lights (I believe 2 blue and 1 red) and shining down from the center was a single white beam of light that was uniform size from where it came out of the object all the way to the ground.  The object was hovering without sound directly above a section of ground between Old Mars Hill Hwy and the ramp that takes vehicles from Jupiter Rd up to 19-23S with the light shining directly down between Old Mars Hill Hwy and the ramp.  There was some dust or vapor that appeared to be moving inside the beam of light.

I stood on the side of the road and observed the craft for about 3-4 minutes until it was out of my sight.  There was no sound being emitted from the craft.  I was racking my brain trying to figure out what it was; it wasn’t a modern aircraft that I knew of because there is nothing I know of that can move that slow and stay in flight except helicopt! ers, but they create a lot of rotor wash and noise.  The craft had 3 lights on it, that I could see. I could only make out the shape, not the color as it was dark so all I could make out was a silhouette from the moon light.  I can only speculate on the size, I guess it was about 100m in length. When I got where I was going I told my girlfriend what I saw and asked her if she had seen it.  She hadn’t and she thought I was just waving at her.  Her mother and friend asked me if I had any missing time. I guess that’s a sign of abduction, who knows.  There wasn’t any missing time.

They took off almost parallel to the earth (if that makes any since) in other words they didn’t go straight up they left at an angle.  Their speed literally went from maybe 1-2 mph to an excess of 200 mph in 1 second. They both left at the exact same time as if they both knew it was time to go.  As they left,  they made not one sound, they were gone and I haven’t seen them again since, although I wish I would catch another glimpse of them because they do fascinate me.  I can only imagine the view from someone in that apartment complex, to have walked outside, looked up and seen 2 UFO’s hovering above them only 3 stories from reach.  Amazing!!!!

"flying, stringy, orb, brain shaped object",Vancouver,BC,2007-08-14T16:00:00,other,1 MIN,"Occurred : 8/14/2007 16:00  (Entered as : 08/14/07 16:00) Reported: 7/12/2010 2:33:16 PM 14:33 Posted: 7/19/2010 Location: Vancouver (Canada), BC Shape: Other Duration:1 MIN",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76474.html,"flying, stringy, orb, brain shaped object Since what I saw is very difficult to describe I am hoping that someone else out there has seen what I have seen.  The reporting of this event is late yes, however.  As the years go by I feel compelled to report what I have seen. I had just got home from work, sitting on the rear porch waiting for my girlfriend to get home.  I know the date was the 14th, of August 2007 as this day lands between my girlfriends and my sisters/niece birthdays’.  The day was clear, warm with no clouds in site, the time was about 14:00.  The following events only lasted about 45sec-1min, quickly, I realized what I was looking at  something that has not been seen, nor described to me in any way before.  I got a really good look at the object, I knew that taking note of the fine details would help me remember.  Trust me; this is something that I will never forget. I sat there looking to the NW direction.  Moving slowly from North to South, I saw, what I can only describe as a “flying brain”.  This may sound funny, however the first thing that came to my mind is that the object was in the shape of a brain (kidney type shape).  The shape of the object did change though.  As it was moving, it would seem to take shape to the wind.  I would not call it round, square, saucer, ball..etc… the color was similar to fire; reddish, orange and yellow.  I was not a ball of fire.. I had time to look at this, the following description is “exactly” what I saw.  I will use products to assist with my descriptions, again, I have never seen, nor even been described anything like this before. Altitude:  about 300’ off the ground Size:  about 30-50yards long x 10-15yards total (it was flexing, in the shape of a brain, but moving as it moved) Speed:  about 60km/h  Distinctive features: •	it was stringy.  You could call it a mass of string (like that under a baseball), but the strings was very defined, defined enough that it still strikes me to this day. Colors were vibrant and defined.  You could see the yellow, red, orange.  They were separate from each other and I could tell by looking at it.  This, along with the string was the most amazing part and the part that I cannot explain the best. The strings would move, like tentacles kind of.  They were not all pointing in the same direction, they were moving in different directions while the object moved to the South.  Each string was a defined color, and the color was it’s own.  There was no common pattern of the colors of the strings.  The strings seemed to be different lengths. I saw no lights, no doors/windows (points of access), no writings. It moved in the same direction, did not climb, did not descend. It was silent to me. While watching this, there was one of the neighbours kids playing in our backyard.  I told him to look up at the object.  The child does not speak English, other than a few words.  When he looked up he said “the sun”.  I said to him that yes, it does look like the sun, however it was not.  He did not seem much more interested in the object. I continued to watch it move across the sky.  Within the 45-1 minute time frame, I was able to get a really good look, I wanted to remember this for the rest of my life.  When it went out of view it just went out of view, I cannot say if it sped away or disappeared, it was just out of my view behind buildings. After watching what it was, I looked around to see if anyone else was out side, there was no one.  I looked at the sun myself (maybe the child was right and I am crazy), the sun was not even close, and, did not look like this.  You cannot stare at the sun for 1 minute and expect to see normal again, this was not the sun.  I thought of what the kid said, and yes.  It would resemble the sun in a way.  If you see photos of the sun (close up telescope type), you see the fire leaping from the sun’s surface.  This fire leaping would somewhat resemble the strings that I spoke of earlier, as the color as well.  I know what fire looks like, this was just not fire.. A lot of people laugh when I say it was a flying brain.  I use this description only to describe the shape, and, it was the first thing that came to mind when I saw it.  It was like an orb.  The orb was what appeared to be the main body, strings came off of and all around it.  The orb, when the object moved, would move into a brain shape.  I do laugh at my brain description myself, but, it is what it is.. I do believe in UFO’s, I have seen a lot of unexplained lights and stuff, but, never anything like this, and never anything that I would report as it could be too many other things.  This object is not nothing that I have ever seen.  After seeing this, I am sold that there is something else out there. Anyone that thinks I am full of it, or crazy.  You have your belief and that is just fine.  I am not interested in anything other than trying to find out what this was.  I am not saying that it was visitors from outer space, paranormal or anything else.  I don’t know what to call it, I have never seen anything like it, except on that day. Please, I ask that if you have seen something that resembles this I would love to hear about it.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,49.26892572695909,-123.11223982257269

I will try to research and contact the trucking company I used to work for, to get the exact time that I was there. I do however remember intimate details of the craft that I saw. At about 4 am on this night, it was a clouded sky, as I pulled into the pilot travel center off of 10th street, next to the comfort inn. I began to park near the end of the lot on its north side. Something told me to look up and I did.  Above the cab of my truck about 50 to 75 feet up was a large saucer shaped craft.  I know it was not a hallucination, because it passed over a street lamp and the glow of the light illuminated a sort of upside down bowl depression on the bottom of the craft. I estimated its speed at around 5 - 10 mph moving in a northly direction. the craft was at least 100' in diameter. with a row of small lights around the central bowl depression which had a lip on the bottom o! f the craft, on the outside of the lip of the bowl were about 10 or so lights spaced evenly.  There was no sound at all. I am terrible at drawing but I will try to get someone to work up a sketch of the craft. Do you know of anyone who saw anything similar around the time i did in the same place?  I will try to get back to you with more informaiton and a sketch.

The date was early February 2008, my car would not start the day before and I had arranged the day before for a friend at work to pick me up from a ring road about 200 yards from were I lived in the morning. In the morning,  I went to the end of my road and cross over the ring road and waited about 100 yards from the traffic lights and stood there waiting to be picked up, it was a cold but clear day and across from me was semi detached housing some traffic but no people walking. I looked down at my feet they were cold and when I looked up again seconds later there in front of me is  a sight I still cannot believe could have been there but there it was, it seemed to be a large 30 foot or more rugby ball shaped object just floating 20 feet maybe slightly more above the semi’s across the road from me (around 60 foot from were I was standing) but that was not what got my attention but it was the object or part of the object I could see within this rugby shape window like opening,  this object craft whatever was very shiny and seemed to be made up of angled shape panels, it was certainly larger then the rugby shape opening, I seemed to be looking into another reality or whatever because it was rotating back forwards side to side in a very jecky wayI just was unable to focus on it as it was jecking so much but all within the shape opeinng, I got glimpes of  of different bits of this craft within the shape opening, I  then  noticed after about a minute  or! so a very dull vermilion part that did not seem to be of  metal, then after aboout 2 minutes or there abouts had past it flicked that dull area into view and it looked like flesh (it’s very hard to explain) what that bit was but it was a long trangle shape which seemed to be raised above the very shiny metal around it then it flick to another angle, during this time I look along the road to see if I could get someone to see what I was seeing but there just was no one around. I was getting very annoyed because except for cars going past no one was around to confim this, this was happening in a built up area of BOLTON I then looked to see if my friend was coming down the road when I looked back at this object it  had begun to move up and to my right and all I could see now was a dull brown rugby ball shape I could not see the bright metallic craft within it now  and it went out of sight after around a min  or so. I had just seen a shape wiith a object larger then the shape I have no idea but could this be way these UFO’s seem to disappear and change shape maybe when entering or leaving these, it could maybe be the way they travel to and from here undetected who knows, this sighting really shock my belief in what suppose to be real and what does not, this is why only now do I feel its time to put it down not very good but to the best of my ability.

In the early afternoon on Dec. 30, 2009, seven of us were among the passengers on a Continental flight departing Houston for the Yucatan (Mexico).   About 20 minutes after the pilot announced we had reached our cruising altitude of 35,000 feet, I noticed what appeared to be five large rods protruding upward from the clouds off the right wing about 1/4 mile to a 1/2 mile out.  The rods looked like manmade structures, each about 10-20 feet high.  Each rod had the appearance of a cell-phone tower -- metallic weaving.  There were five rods in total, each spaced approximately 80-150 feet apart, forming what looked like a pentagon. No connecting tower or craft was visible. I pointed this out to a younger friend, who at first didn't notice them.  After a minute or so, he finally located they him.  He said they appeared to be ""drifting.""  Again, we were at 35,000 feet, so there's no way they could have been part of a grounded structure.  They remained visible for about 6-8 minutes before our flight moved away.

I noticed something that caught my eye to the NNW, it looked to be a dark colour, round in shape and just static in the sky.  It then moved ever so slowly and then remained static again.  I ran in and grabbed my camera and when I came back outside I managed to take two pictures taken on a Canon Power Shot, one taken on normal view and the other on a maximum 16x zoom.  From where this was witnessed I would hazzard a guess at others from different, neighbouring towns having seen this also. As I was watching a plane flew over at a high altitude [leaving contrails] and the object vanished.  I returned back indoors for a while but popped my head out again to see if it had returned and saw another object the same as the one I saw but more to the West.  I grabbed my camera from the kitchen but failed to pick it up on my viewfinder and when I looked at the sky the object had again vanished. I cannot find a rational explanation for this, it certainly wasn't a bird as it was too high, certainly not a plane as no noise and no contrails [the plane that went past it left contrails and made a noise] and it was far too high an altitude for a stray helium balloon to be seen with the naked eye, nor a helicopter.

He then asked why it was dragging a hot air balloon behind it.  I looked up agian and noticed a small black oval, possibly 20 meters long and 10-15 meters wide which I would estimate was 1000-1500 meters behind the aircraft. For almost a minute the black oval maintained speed a distance from the Airbus, but it finally 'peeled off' at a speed of which I have never witnessed. I myself am a former Royal Naval Engineer and was designated to HMS Invincible (1993-1999). During this period I witnessed many military aircraft travelling at speeds in excess of Mach 1.8, usually at military exercises. If I compare the speed of the black oval to military aircraft I have worked with before, I would say it was accelerated from tailing the Airbus (400+ mph) to Mach 3.5 in 1 second. As you can imagine, at this speed the oval quickly vanished from site in the direction of Banbridge, SW. I do not wish you to contact me, but thank you for your time.

I've had this event in my memory for many years, and I am wondering if any one can substantiate or add detail to what I'm calling an event. I believe it happened between about '68 and the early 70's.  My father worked as the attendant at one of the few all night gas stations along the old Rt 66 as it passed through Joplin, MO -- locally known as East 7th Street.  The station sat near the crest of a very long up-slope and so at night one could see back across the city quite well.  He was the introverted, serious type person.  Many of the local cops patrolling the city made this station a regular night-shift break stop and they shared all the ""cop gossip"" with him.  He stated to me the following when I visited on a weekend. One night he saw an illuminated metallic craft moving slowly just above rooftop level across the city.  The motion was steady and it exhibited a controlled motion.  It apparently did not come directly over the gas station.  This activity continued long enough for several police cars to engage in trailing the craft around the city, as he saw the roof lights on their cars in the distance and heard sirens.  He said that the craft eventually gained altitude and simply faded into the night sky -- there was no sudden vanishing, it just flew off very calmly. Later that same night, many of the cops converged at the gas station and began relating to each other what they had witnessed.  My father, of course, heard much of the chatter between officers and on the radios.  All agreed that they had seen a very large metal craft that simply glowed with no apparent source of light.  Some reported what appeared to be windows and various details about the skin, much as you might attempt to describe the surface of any vehicle after having been up close. After a few nights, the various cops on duty the night of the sighting resumed their regular break stops at the gas station.  All told my father a similar thing: They had all been instructed to forget that they had seen any thing and to speak no more of it. Dad said that the Joplin Globe Newspaper ran an article on the UFO as soon as they gathered the early police reports, but then the story was never given any additional press by the newspaper. I repeat that this was told to me by my father years ago.  I buried this for so long that I lost track of when it happened.  I wish that I'd had enough presence of mind to have at least written down the date. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

This sighting took place so long ago that I’m not sure of the exact date.  However, it was the summer (approximately July or August) of 1995 or 1996 and took place in Crestview, Florida. I was in the backyard with my grandson when I looked up and saw an object in the sky.  It was solid white (at least I don’t remember any markings or lights) and triangular in shape.  It was long and narrow, looking about the shape of the long paper airplanes we made as kids.  It was moving very slowly and completely silently. I watched for a moment and then looked down to tell my grandson to look up.  When we both looked up, the object was gone.  It was broad daylight and the sky was completely clear with no clouds into which it could have disappeared.  I could not have taken my eyes off of it for more than a few seconds.  It would have had to move at a tremendous speed to disappear in that time.  I’ll never forgive myself for looking away and not seeing how it left. A few minutes later a small aircraft flew over at approximately the same height as the object (maybe a bit lower), and I could clearly hear the airplane engines.  The object had made no sound at all. I haven’t mentioned this incident to anyone but my family, and my grandson was much too young to remember it.  I was afraid to be labeled a kook because of the many “sightings” that have been reported in Gulf Breeze, Florida, over the years.  Gulf Breeze is only about 20 miles from Crestview as the crow flies. I haven’t read or seen any accounts of objects that were shaped exactly like the one I saw.  If you have had reports of anything like it, I would greatly appreciate your letting me know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I heard a buzzing noise which was easily discernable in the sky. I had no sense of direction of where it was coming from. The noise grew and grew in decibels until my ears hurt worse than they ever have(born with a better than average sense of hearing). I collected myself and lookEd out my bedroom window which faced West. What happened next I'll never forget!  A circular pattern of lights flew over the trees(about 8 total). The noise and velocity violently shook the trees on our property to such a degree it was like a bomb went off. A noise like that would've been heard for miles!  Suprisingly, the story gets stranger yet remains the truth of what I witnessed. I went out into our living room to talk to my family about what I just witnessed. They told me they didn't hear anything and that I just had a wild imagination. I can only confess how badly I would love to find out what I had seen that night, and that I have never seen an Aircraft like that. I would also like to add that I have seen many kinds of military cargo planes fly directly over our property going South over the years since the sighting.

I am filing this report on behalf of my son who witnessed the event.  At about 20:30 on January 4, 2000, (est.), my son was in the vicinity of Jomax Rd. and 62nd St. looking toward the south at the lights of Phoenix in the distance.  The day had been overcast with some rain, which had stopped in the evening.   A light at the extreme right side of his field of view caused him to look in that direction, west.  He witnessed a vivid green circular object descending at about a 30 degree angle, the object was the size of a dime at arms length.   At a height of about 200 feet above the ground the object stopped and a second identical object then appeared as if out of the first and proceeded on the same path and speed until it was about 12 diameters from the first, then it too stopped.   A third identical object immediately appeared, traveled the same distance, stopped, and a fourth identical object repeated the process until it reached the 12 diameter distance.  The moment the fourth object stopped the entire string of four objects then pivoted on the central axis of their array with the last object appearing closest to my son with the original object the most distant.  The array swung in such a fashion that it became parallel to the ground, forming an east-west line.   At this point my son was able to see that there were still four objects even though they overlapped each other from his vantage point.  Within a second or two all the objects simply vanished, followed a few seconds later by two loud ""sonic booms"".   At this point my son, then 16, made a hasty retreat to our home. He described the objects as having even illumination across the entire surface with distinct edges.  He described the green as similar to the green in a traffic signal.  The movement of the objects was very smooth as each emerged from the previous one.  His estimate was that the objects were about 1/4 mile from his location.  A set of electrical transmission towers runs on a southeast to northwest line, about 1/2 mile west of this location.   When I questioned him about the possibility of some sort of ball lightning or electrical plasma, he dismissed this possibility stating that the objects were never in the vicinity of the transmission lines.  He stated that the objects somewhat reminded him of the warning balls attached to power lines in the vicinity of airports.   Since the objects retained their circular shape as they pivoted, he made the assumption that they were spheres. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Let me start by saying that unfortunately, I am unsure of the date of the incident.  I know this was around the time I earned my driver’s license, but the date may be off by a year or so.  Sorry for the inconvenience. At the time, I was living in Winslow AZ, and two friends and I were driving to Flagstaff in the late afternoon to catch a movie.  I was sitting in the back seat, passenger’s side. We were traveling west on I-40, coming up on the Leupp exit. This is the first exit after Winslow, traveling west.  At this exit, there is a large butte.  I’m not sure how tall the butte is, but here is a link to google maps where you can see the actual google photo of the butte.  There is a car and a couple of road signs in the picture to help with the scale of the photo. http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=35.065833,-110.825272&spn=0,0.084543&z=14&layer=c&cbll=35.069161,-110.834558&panoid=--tNYYmSTeVgXLV4q9Gpgw&cbp=12,0,,0,5   As we approached this exit and butte, we were startled by the sight of what appeared to be a hovering commercial airplane to the right of the car.  Just an average airplane, only without any insignia or markings.  We could clearly see the windows, without people in them.  Not only was it hovering, but it was incredibly low.  Only two or three times the height of the butte off the ground, less than 1000 feet.  There was no sound. Like I said, this took place during the afternoon, and well within the sight of the highway. It was practically hovering over the exit ramp.  There were tons of people pulled over on the side of the road, going in both directions.  They were talking about it, some on their phones, others were taking pictures. We were too scared to stick around to see what would happen next, so we kept driving.  I remember turning around in my seat to watch it out of the back window.  It stayed in the same position until I lost sight of it. How many people must drive on that major interstate in the afternoon on any given day during a 15-30 minute period? My guess is about 500.   Everyone who drove by saw it, it was impossible not to. I’m hoping one of those people will remember seeing this too, possible post a picture.  I have never been able to find any documentation of the incident.

At approximately 11:00pm on 28/02/2010 I witnessed a number of bright orange lights moving from the North West tracking a South Easterly direction. I had just arrived home and as I got out from my car I looked up to the sky to see a large orange light.  I watched for about 20 seconds as it slowly tracked from North West in a South Easterly direction. The sky’s above us are on a busy flight path so I was used to seeing the flashing lights of aircraft in the sky.  What made this sighting unusual and what captured my attention was the orange colour and the fact that it was not flashing. The night is question was a very clear night with a full moon high in the sky and to the south. I thought I would get some binoculars and watch the object from the rear of my house. The rear of the house is south facing. I waited outside the rear of the house expecting to see the object.  After 10 – 15 seconds, there was no sight of the orange glowing object so I went to the side of the house to see where it might have been. To my amazement I saw in total three objects of the same colour, two which were slightly less intense in luminescence. At this point I ran back into the house to get my binoculars and called my partner and two children.  We ran back through the house to the front door. From the front of the house, which is north facing, two of the objects changed to a different path, rising in the sky and losing their luminescence.  The third object continued on a south easterly track. I followed the remaining object through binoculars for 5-10 seconds and then went through to the back of the house where again I was able to track the object on a south easterly direction. The luminescence of the object faded as it continued south easterly direction.  I did not see this as unusual as it was heading in the direction of the location of the moon, not directly at the moon!.   However, I was able to continue to track the object as it moved into a south easterly direction while losing it’s luminescence. I could not distinctly make out the shape of the object. What was additionally so unusual was there was no sound from the object(s).  Normally as aircraft pass over head their engine noise can be heard very distinctly.  However on this occasion there was no sound what so ever.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,,

The odd thing is that as it floated westbound it was counter-rotating.  This cylinder stayed at that height even as it floated over a stone wall and into a field, I slowed my truck down to watch it, as it came to another stone wall it maneuvered over it at the 2 foot height.  Another truck driver traveling north saw it also and asked me what it was.  All during this time the cylinder stayed perfectly horizontal to the ground.

When it was in this shape, the left side of the craft had several non-blinking lights that were blue. The right side was virtually the same except the lights were red. In the middle, there were several diamond shaped white lights that also did not blink. As it passed over our heads, it seemed to be moving more slowly than a regular aircraft. Also when it passed over head, instead of a boomerang shape, it appeared to be triangular. about a second after it passed over our head,the blue lights went out. it started to turn slowly vertically while it was moving. When it was almost completely vertical i thought it seemed to be diamond shaped.

""Hi nice to meet you, come check out this ufo in the sky!""  My cousin, her boyfriend, and myself were standing out in the freezing cold last night smoking cigarettes and talking about life in general, when all three of us suddenly got silent and began questioning what was visually in front of us.  It was a bright white light high in the sky with six smaller lights blinking around it on both sides, six total.  There were only three other colors besides the white light in the middle.  RED BLUE GREEN, RED BLUE GREEN.  That was the pattern.  At times it would move farther away making it appear as one bright light.  Every few minutes it would begin to move around very slowly but then return to sitting still.  This took place for around two hours.  After I built up the ! self esteem to go inside and tell the others what I was witnessing thats exactly what happened.  They came outside and it only appeared to be a very bright star.  They began to laugh and give us funny looks when the light completely disappeared for three or four seconds only to reappear bright and flashing the pattern of multi-colored lights again.  We stayed outside observing for nearly three hours stunned in disbilief at what we were witnessing.  Im not saying it was a ufo I do not know what it was.  I am 22 years old and the five people with me were all between 22 and 26.  None of us have ever seen something like that before and when you witness something like that it is truly disturbing in a sense, it makes your spine tingle.  Shortly before the object went away two planes circled within the area of the object but would not get very close.  I just hate not knowing something and I really wish there was an explanation to what we witnessed.

This is a ChemTrail sighting report. The aircraft were large resembling passenger airliners; they were drab grey mostly and black in color. There were approximately 4-6 planes. I awoke for work at 6 am PST March 1, 2010; I live in San Diego East County near hwy 67. The sky was perfectly clear and blue near my location, except for two jet con trails going from east to west. This is not in the standard flight path for the area for either civilian or military aircraft; there is no commercial flight path at this location. I work a short distance from home approximately 10 miles by road near the hwy 8 and 125. I observed at this location from 7am to 8:30 two aircraft making chemtrails traveling east to west, one was at a higher elevation, and you could see that it was an airplane but it was too high up to get details of the craft. The other plane was at a lower enough elevation to see the size and color of the plane, it had wing tips they were facing up, two jets motors on each wing, drab grey and black in color. You could not hear a jet exhaust noise from the airplanes. I observed 5 passes with this pattern; it would vary in respect to starting from southeast towards northwest and starting northeast towards southwest at the high and low elevations. I could not observe the whole incident, but I saw enough to know these facts to be accurate.  As a few minutes past I  found a vantage point to look at the sky again; I observed 11 chemtrails in the sky at varying heights going east to west and two from a more north to south west direction. I observed during two passes at the lower elevation after the ""cloud"" spread was starting, these planes had no chemtrails coming out of them. Slowly the chemtrails would spread out and the slight westerly breeze would push them east, you could see these ""cloud"" were stopping from the atmospheric pressure of the local mountains, so the chemtrails spread out from north to south. It appeared like there were several very, very long thin ""clouds"" stretching from east to west. By mid afternoon I could no longer feel the warm sun which I had from the morning or see bright blue sky. The sky was filled with a hazy looking ""cloud"" layer. Not any cloud I have seen, but a hazy white cover in the sky, with slight blue sky color penetrating through. As of this writing at 5:45pm PST there is still a white even haze in the sky, at my homes vantage point I can see normal puffy clouds behind the local Mt. Laguna to the east, which I see all the time as a normal weather pattern occurrence. These ""hazy clouds"" on the west side of Mount Laguna, were created from the trails of these military looking jet aircraft as I have described here. There is no round or puffiness shape to it, as with normal natural clouds, in regards to the hazy flat white layer created by these planes.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

So, then I thought “ok maybe it is a comet or meteor” when suddenly what I saw it split into three white circles in a backwards “L” shape.  I was not too far from home, so I immediately called my dad and told him to go outside and face south. He saw what my boyfriend and I had seen, and then, it split into five circles. We were amazed and going crazy trying to figure out what it was. As we drove as far South as we could we noticed the five circles of light were vertically straight. Trees got in the way of my view, but when I managed to get another glimpse of it, it was horizontally straight. We saw a plane that appeared to be heading in the same direction and then it took a turn away from it. I am not sure it had to do anything with what we saw, but it seemed interesting. The five circle! s of light clustered a bit closer together and quickly faded out of sight. I did try to take pictures of these mysterious orbs in the sky in the duration of about ten minutes that this was going on, but my camera phone could not capture something at the distance of the lights, which I want to say was possibly twenty to thirty miles away. Relative to the size of full moon that was out at the time, I would say it was about one eighth of the size (and the moon was big and low around 1850 hours), or about three times the size of the North Star, or maybe even the size of a light bulb twenty to thirty feet away. I am sure more people had to see it if they were going south of Krome Avenue.

The formation of light would all glow a white hot bright for a few seconds and then the bright glow would quickly dissipate.  But you could still see them. When they were not glowing brightly I could make out what appeared to be a dark spot on the top what appeared to be an avoid shape as the sun reflected off of a dull metallic surface of each one.  The best way for me to describe the shape and color of the surface would be that each object appeared like an upside down brushed stainless steel cooking Wok.  Then in perfect unison, they would all glow white hot ! again, similar to what a high intensity headlamp would appear like. The most interesting thing about this formation, is that they all maintained separation from each other and did not appear to be moving in front or behind each other like a swarm of bees might appear like.  The formation did move gradually at times, but appeared to hang in the air and slowly gain altitude.  I could not believe this happening in broad daylight with local airtraffic all over the place.

The object was not moving which seemed odd. The color was white and red with the white being much brighter than the red. Then, the white light began to dim but the white light was still brighter than the red. This oject then made a slow move to my left and then to the right before stopping.

Here's the story... I went outside to smoke a cigarette and enjoy the scenery as I do each morning. The sky was a clear blue with just a few thin clouds passing by. I looked up to the sky for no real reason and that's when I saw it - a white cigar-shaped object very high in the sky, probably at about 20,000 feet in altitude. The object was heading south/southeast and clearly had no wings. It was just a plain white cigar-shaped image with what looked like an aura of light around it. After watching the object for about ten seconds it occurred to me that this was not a normal aircraft I was seeing so I grabbed my cell phone to see if I could take a picture of it. At this time the object had traversed only about a quarter of the visible sky and I thought it would take another 20 seconds or so before it would be out of sight. I looked down to pull up my cell phone camera and when I looked back at the sky the object was already gone! This was only a few seconds later and I wondered at how the object could have disappeared so quickly since it was still in the middle of the sky when I'd looked away. It should still be there, I thought. Either way, the object had vanished completely and was seen no more. A minute or so later a commercial jet was seen heading east. Even though I could see only the profile of the jet, the wings were clearly visible. This is the part that made me think that I really had seen something strange because when the other object passed directly over head, any wings on it should have been easy to see against the open sky, but there were none. It was daylight when this sighting took place and no flashing lights were seen on the object, but the same could be said about the jet that followed. If the first object was a blimp, what was it doing so high in the sky and how could it have disappeared so suddenly? Beyond that, the object was moving much too quickly across the sky to have been a blimp or similar known flying object. Call me crazy if you must, but I think I just saw a UFO!

The object in question appeared to be a white light whose intensity matches that of a bright star. The object moved relatively fast however not so fast that this factor in and of itself made me suspect that what I observed might be of unknown origins. The most significant detail of this experience was the absence of any blinking or otherwise red/green lights on the sides of the object as would identify a passenger jet. Furthermore the object made no noise yet it flew at an altitude that seemed to be characteristic of that of a plane that might be leaving or landing at DFW International Airport (relatively low). As the object flew from the northwest to the southwest it became smaller and smaller and dimmer and dimmer eventually to the point that I could no longer see the object in the southwestern sky. The object seemed to maintain a relatively constant speed throughout the sighting and flew in more or less a straight line.

The local time was 10:01 PM (when I first started observing) and the event spanned until 10:10. The object was a pulsating, star-like object that stayed within about 5 degrees south east of epsilon-Cygnus or Gienah. What first struck me was the brightness, near that of Deneb at its peak, but falling to darkness within a few seconds. It repeated this behavior many times. The other aspect was the color, a brilliant blue.  This was observed from central Escondido, California - near 33 deg 7' minutes north, -117 deg 3 min west. So the obvious issue was the elimination of possibilities. First, the object did not travel in a straight line and did not appear to be moving at a velocity for orbital motion, so it certainly didn't seem to be a satellite.   Second it nearly hovered at some points, not characteristic of an aircraft.  Considering the time duration it was no meteor.  The color and therefore the color temperature, would match a very high temperature object, above 10,000 K.  Not a common object near the Earth.   It did move in the sky, so it wasn't a distant astronomical object.  It didn't seem to progress like a balloon, but that is ""up in the air"". It was no ""Chinese lantern"" with that intense blue color.  There was no sound. It was too long in duration for an Iridium flash, and was too blue.  So it could have been a high altitude UAV or other test aircraft with a bizarre blue light. It might have been a balloon with a similar light.  It was certainly a mystery and I wondered if it had been observed by others. I am an engineer and amateur astronomer and have been observing the sky for many years.  It was also observed by my wife.

I've always been the type of person that has to have solid proof to believe in things like u.f.o.'s, well i'll just tell you what happened. I used to live in a apartment with my previous wife and our two children,I always worked graveyard,now for 27 years, I would always see this guy who lived in our complex coming home from fishing,I only knew him to say hi,or hows it going,but one day he came home with a 101 lb. sturgene fish that he caught behind the rice mills in west Sac.  We then started talking about fishing,he asked me if I wanted to go to a place on my night off where him and his dad used to go and catch tons of cat fish. I agreeded to go , he told me it was on private land ,that it was an eragation sluogh a couple of miles into this land ,we would have to go at night, but not to worry,nobody is ever out there,he was right it was prestine, and soon as your line hit the water,you would get bites. We probably caught 25 to 30 cat fish, it was realy buitiful out there ,there was'nt a piece of trash to be seen anywhere,tall trees lined both sides of the slough. About two weeks later, I was telling my friend and my sister in laws boyfriend about this fishing spot they both wanted to go, I told them about the land being private, and that we would have to go at night. We went about 12:00 am by 1:00 am we where there starting to fish, just like last time we started catching cats like crazy ,we where using an electric lantern to see, it was mildly bright, while we were sitting there all of a sudden down the slough ,on the bank, about maybe 150 yards or more away, a bright light came on, it looked to be like one of those bright coleman gas lanterns, but we could'nt see or here any people, we where instantly scared being on private land where my nieghbor told me he and his father never saw a soul out there, we quikly turned off our light and watched. Nothing was happening ,the light just stayed on, we waited a while and then thought it might be someone fishing like us, we thought we would try to be quiet and keep fishing with our light! off,we did. We fished for about an hour or 2, when my friend said he wanted to go lay down in the back of my nova, that he did'nt care if we kept fishing,we did, though we kept looking down the slough at the light, we got so used to it being there we kinda stopped thinking about it, when all of a sudden the light got intencely bright, it scared the hell out of us ,when I say it got bright I mean like stadium lighting, we jumped up asking each other what the hell where we looking at?, before we could wake up my friend the light got giant ,it loominated all the trees and water,and I swear to you this light rose off the ground, it was so bright we could'nt see any mass on it,just light. I then opened my car door and shaking my friend to wake up, by this time the light was at the top of the trees, My friend said what is it ,I told him it was the light that was on the bank, he then asked me if it was a u.f.o., it made no sound at all, I told him I have no idea what it is,we the! n stared throwing our gear in the car, and we jumped in,we did! 'nt know what to do, we had to drive towards it to leave, as we started near it ,it backed up, as we got closer it then moved quikly across the top of the trees,we could see it loominating the trees as it took off, it almost seemed to know we where watching.Im getting goose bumps remembering this night.  I have been through many things in my life since then, I remaried to a wonderful wife,but we suffered some great tradgedy in our life ,like the suicide death of my youngest son, the passing of my father who died fairly young,I dont usualy tell this story, because it sounds crazy, but I swear its true, I dont know what we saw, maybe you do. Many years had past and I lost contact with the 2 guys I was with that night, but one day my wife and I ,and my sister and her boyfriend went to the asparagus festival in Stockton Ca.,and while we where there amongst thousands of people I hear someone call my name ,it was my friend who was in the car asleep,he said hey ,hows it going ?,its been a ! long time, how about that thing we saw that night?

Saw the UFO, and walked to my window.  It was over the tree line, but its diameter could be anywhere from 2 feet to 2 miles.  Made absolutely no noise.   Seemed to be metallic with a dome on the top.  On the bottom were 5 or 6 perfectly proportioned circular lights, all green, themselves in a circular formation.

I even believed the sighting to be some kind of promotional stunt for the movie.   I saw a news story on 10 o'clock Fox News Baltimore broadcast that stated that there had been many calls to police and to news outlets from the west side of town, near Woodlawn, report a current UFO sighting.  Someone else must remember this news story and they might remember the date.  There isn’t a posted story archive at WBFF 45 (Fox News Baltimore) but someone there who read the news at that time might recall the story. I live on the west side of town, so I went outside to see if I could see the UFO.  It was about 10:15 pm and the weather was warm, and the sky was mostly clear with some small thin clouds.  I immediately saw the UFO flying just above the trees, slowly moving east, as if following Rt. 40 toward Baltimore.  The craft was huge or the size of a stadium, and it made no sound what so ever.  The craft was saucer shaped, like two plates put together.  Around the midline of the craft were rotating red and white lights that rotated in a counterclockwise direction.  The body of the craft was silver in color, and there were windows in the front, or cockpit, and smaller round windows along the side I saw.  A pilot could be clearly seen in the cockpit window, in shadow, and was humanlike in shape.  It was not an airplane. I went back into the house to rouse others to view the craft, to no avail.  My Mom was in the bathroom, and my boyfriend was asleep on the bed and refused to get up.  I ran back out to my front porch, and I saw it proceed east, toward town, and it disappeared behind the trees.  I am not sure what it was, but I drew a picture of the object I saw.  A similar craft was seen by two girls in South Africa near this same time, or so I heard, on some UFO show on television on the History Channel.

Myself and two other house mates were outside enjoying the view of the sky.  The sky was partially cloudy but quite bright due to the presence of the moon which was slightly bigger than half full. At approximately 10:05 P.M., our attention was drawn to a high flying jet aircraft travelling from west to east.  It was low enough for us to hear the faint roar of the engines.  I lowered my gaze and noticed a dark shape with lights drop from the sky approximately 5-8 miles south of our position over Okanagan Mountain Park.  It began to move slowly over the park in an east to west direction. I alerted the rest of the group and they all turned their attention to this object.  As it reached the outskirts of the city it changed direction and started to move south to north, towards us.  At first we thought it might be an aircraft except for the fact that most aircraft in the area fly an east west route.  Kelowna has a relatively busy airport and we were used to oberving aircraft arrivals and departures.  I was formerly employed as a Ground Specialist at the Ottawa International Airport and was familiar with most aircraft including those at air shows.  This was something I'd never seen b! efore. We first observed the object as a dark triangular shape silhouetted against the bright night sky.  We could not hear any noise from the object as it proceeded slowly towards our position.  A soft white glow emanated from what appeared to be 3 portholes, one at each corner of the underside of the object.  The colour was flat black.  The size was equal to that of a 737 jet aircraft viewed from 500 to 700 feet away at it's closest point.   As the object approached a position to the west of us it seemed to change its course slightly to the east for 5 to 10 seconds then turned back to its original course.  At this point its apparent size was that of a football held at arm's length.  The object proceeded north and gained in altitude as it approached the western spur of Knox Mountain (where the mountain meets the lake) and passed over and out of sight.  The entire sighting lasted approximately five minutes. We don't know what it was but we are absolutely certain that it was not a conventional aircraft. Years later, after I'd moved and gotten married, I mentioned the incident to a neighbor of mine.  He said he had a friend who lived a block to the west of our original sighting position who saw a large triangular shaped object fly right over his house.  I asked my neighbor to speak with his friend and enquire about the date and time.  He did, and though he was not sure of the exact date, the time was right and it was early June 1998.  Other than that he really didn't want to speak about it because as my neighbor put it, ""it spooked him"".  He never reported the incident.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,49.928621739130435,-119.4277732173913

I never spoke about this before, but after I saw this object each time I went into a store the theft alarm gates went grazy and ringing. I always explained to the stores that I had no idea what made the alarm go off. 1 day I contacted TNO (Nature Science Research) in the Netherlands, asking them: why always when I enter a store the alarms go off. TNO explained to me that the alarms are triggered by electro magnetic forces. So I had to be charged with electro magnetic forces more than other people. After maybe 6 months the complaints disappeared but after looking some files about ufo's and electro magnetic forces I do now have an idea why I was electro magnetic charged. Maybe the cigar shaped object that flew over my car somehow charged me. My friends know only that I was electro-magnetically charged because al the alarms went of as soon as I entered a store but I never told them about the cigar shaped object.

I was driving to pick up my daughter after work at night.  She stays very close to the airport, so I am completely used to seeing airplanes flying close overhead and am quite familiar with what an airplane looks like, how they fly, how fast, etc.  I was driving along a road called Airport Dr. where planes normally fly over the road to land on the landing strip nearby. I saw what at first I assumed to be a plane about to land considering it was quite low to the ground.  At first I was worried, because although it still had a good stretch to go before landing, it was lower to the ground than the planes I normally see preparing to land.  I watched it as I drove along, waiting for it to fly overhead to it's assumed destination (the landing strip).  However, it never flew overhead.  There were still a couple other cars on the road at that time.  Then as I continued to drive, eventually I was alone on the roadway, which is when I began to panic, because that's when I realized that the craft seemed to be following me (although not completely obviously).  It was dark, so I couldn't see anything but it's lights, which where 3 white lights in what looked like a triangular formation.  I started to freak out when I realized that the way it was flying was not anything a plane could be capable of.  It was following alongside the road, too close overhead to be a plane but not close enough to get a really good look.   It was also slightly behind me and to the left, so I had to keep turning my head back to see it, than to the road again.  I turned on to Marine Dr. where it continued to follow me.   At this point, I was scared ((deleted)) and going at least 20-30 mph over the speed limit, nearly vearing off the road several times. Finally after what seemed like forever, but considering the distance I will guess was probably around 5 minutes or less, the lights/craft seemed to separate slighty as it sped off very quickly.  As it did this I noticed at least one, possibly more, red light(s) as a glanced as it sped off. Basically the most frightening experience I have ever had, and I never want anything like that to happen to me ever again.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,48.74688634868421,-122.44462006578947

(130kms North of Ottawa) Around 0030 hours on Thursday, November 19th 2009, I went outside to smoke a cigarette and a bright white light caught my attention; it was distinctly brighter than everything else in the sky. As I paid closer attention to it I noticed a sort of red light emanating from one of its sides and a bluish hue that seemed to be on the underside of the object. It appeared to be hovering but was not completely stationary, it kept repeating a kind of circular, or wave pattern, at regular interval, about every two or three minutes. I was puzzled by it and ended up staying outside for 45 minutes-or-so, observing it circle around in a similar fashion to a mosquito, or a fly, or something.  It was getting cold, so I decided to go back inside to get binoculars or something but I don’t have very powerful ones so figured they would not be of much use. I went back outside less than an hour later (around 01:45) and, to my surprise, the object was still there hovering around. The white light was still bright but the red and blue ones had become intermittent, only visible for short periods of time over several minutes; the predominant light (white one) appeared to have acquired a yellowish-orange color. (The first time I was outside it remained a very bright, clear, white; aside from the red and blue lights/reflections or whatever they were)  The object appeared to be so far, and high up, I can’t even estimate the distance or the altitude other than it was a good couple kilometers up in the sky and at least 15kms away from my position. I don’t really know what to say about the shape because it didn’t always look the same: sometimes the bright white light was shaped kind of like the letter “C”, sometimes it looked more triangular in form and the rest of the time like a cylinder standing on its end. There did seem to be two distinct parts to the object, though, like there was something obstructing the light in the middle?? At some point when it was closer the first time I saw it, I thought I saw like a kind of pompon on the top but I wasn’t able to see that again so it could have been some effect with the light. Also, the main light was throbbing, it would get a little dimmer and become bright again; this cycle lasted about 1 or 2 seconds, like a kid flipping a light switch continuously (this was observable the who! le time).  The sky was completely clear: I observed numerous meteorites entering the atmosphere and burning up and at least one plane (what appeared to me as being a commercial passenger aircraft) that seemed to get pretty close to the object, albeit a considerable distance below it. Around 0300 hours I decided to get back inside as the object had not done anything else than dim/brighten and enter hovering patterns in the previously stated fashion. There was no audible sound whatsoever from the object.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,46.3834,-75.966

I estimate it was at around 40~50 thousand feet.  I immediately check my iphone application to see if there were any planets visible.  I did notice that Jupiter was directly due south at an alt of 40 degrees.  This light source was due east over what I would estimate to be over San Manuel, AZ.  After 10 minutes of my wife and I observing this light, we noticed the flashing strobes from military aircraft either from Davis Monthan AFB or the Guard Unit at Tucson International.  The military aircraft moved fast towards the craft, which hovered the whole time.  When the military craft approached, the craft rose up immediately and disappeared into the darkness. We noted times, places and conditions.  Then we starting thinking about an interesting sighting my wife and I experienced much earlier in our trip.  We were heading east on I10 near milepost 170 due south of Phoenix when I looked to the west, admiring the sunset (5:25pm), when I noticed what appeared to be a plasma arc about a few miles from the highway, which blinded me.

I have always believed in them but I am truly convinced that they are real now. My only concern is why are they more noticeable now.

The object was there from when I arrived around 6:15, watched for 30 minutes, rushed home to get camera, came back it was only there for 30 second more so I captured nothing on video. There were MANY witnesses looking up and staring and commenting, some screaming saying "" OMG what is that"" etc. I noticed at least 5 witnesses and talked briefly to a few people about it. It was almost STRAIGHT up in the sky as after the clouds went away a bit I noticed it was in the area of W Cassopia. It FLASHED when the Casino spot lights hit it, just like the previous youtube video's from the end of October of this year, but those video's had only 1 small light, this had 2 IDENTICAL lights and a longer one in between them. I could not make out anything when the spotlights were not hitting it as there was cloud cover and it was already night. It looked like it was just above the clouds, quite high, 1000 feet for sure, about 2 inches long&#65279; at arms length. VERY bright, was in a straight line time facing NNW. The light was white with a tinge of blue, light itself was the straight like a bar bell with 2 lights on the end. IT had a smaller light on each end of the bar that were identical in shape. There was a light, then a small space then light. This composed the SMALL light at each end. Then there was the middle BAR light which was about 5x the length of the small end lights. Had a middle longer bar then the light like the video again in a straight line. Since it was there for about 30 minutes or more as I was watching it, I was hoping it might be there for a while longer, so I rushed home to get a camera and my Night Vision Monocular. When I got back, it was there for only about30 seconds more, I couldn't even set up the camera to take any video then it disappeared. I waited until after 9:20pm to see if it would come back but I didn't see it anymore. Just before 9pm, still looking in the area of the sky where it was using my Night Vision Monocular, I suddenly saw a DOT just like a small star moving in a straight line and immediately thought it was a Satellite as I have spent countless nights star gazing and see satellites every 5 minutes sometimes which is nothing unusual. This light however  stopped going straight, slowed down smoothly, but quickly, and turned, started flying around that area with incredible speed and maneuverability, it's very difficult to describe the type of movement...it was FAST, reactive, but still smooth flying, not like a bug or bird or anything I've ever seen....keep in mind I've star gazed for decades, have owned numerous telescopes, so I'm familiar with what I can see out there, this was like nothing I've ever seen. This point light looked to be very high as it was in FOCUS with the stars, anything very close would be out of focus on my Night Vision as it's manual adjusted focus so it had to be quite distant. This light then darted off in a straight line after the maneuvers, and the lights from the street and buildings flared up the Night Vision and I couldn't view it anymore as there were street lights everywhere.  The whole time I was yelling out ""that's impossible"" etc, I couldn't contain myself.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,43.08378091286308,-79.10258340248963

I was on holiday with my ex-husband up in Cairns and we decided to go to the beach for an hour or two.  As there are many beaches up North and it was not a holiday season, we were the only ones on the beach that day.  We laid out our towels to sunbath for awhile and when I laid down, I looked up to the sky to the left and I saw what I thought was a plane with the sun reflecting off it and paid no attention.  Approximately 10mins later I looked up again and it was still there and being a little bit surprised, I told my then partner and we both watched it and it did not move!  I started to get nervous and said to him that I was scared and that we should go, but my partner said not to be silly and that it was too far away and it couldn’t harm us.  I then said well it can’t be of this world and perhaps they were watching us and I wanted to leave, but he said for us just to watch it and see what happens, so we did even though I was scared. We watch this ship that I originally thought was a plane for approx. one hour and then it just shot off to the right and into the distance at incredible speed and disappeared. I say that it was cigar shape, only because it was a fair distance away and at first I thought it was a plane, all I can say for sure is that it was long and silver and stayed in the one spot for a least an hour that we were there, so it could have been there for some time before we arrived and when it disappeared, it shot off at incredible speed. I thought after all these years that I should tell someone, because at the time we didn’t know who to report it to and thought that we would be ridiculed.

Blue Fireball Impacted SouthWestern Virginia Valentines Day 1974 14 February 1974 at approximately 21:00 I was at Woodlwan Intermediate School in Woodlawn, VA. located halfway between Hillsville and Galax Virgina in Carroll County.  The event was our Valentines Day Dance. I was only 14 years old and in the 8th grade.  This event was so memorable and permanently emdedded in my memory because it was so dramatic.  It had a huge impact on me and has remained so ever since I witnessed what you are about to read. I was attending the dance alone- dateless- I was only 14 years old and not yet dating at full-steam.  Because of my singular attendance, I was bored and stepped out into the hallway adjacent to our cafeteria where the dance took place.  At the southwest entrance door peering outward, the night was very crisp, cold and a beautiful clear Blue Ridge Mountains winter night.  You could actually see the outline of the distant mountain tops of Mt. Rogers and White Top Mountain in Grayson County about 50 miles distant.  I was looking in the direction of the two mountains taking a break from the dance in the cafeteria adjacent to the hallway.  These two mountains are both exceeding 1 mile elevation, making them clearly visible and unobstructed from almost any position, day or night, within 60 to 70 miles radius of the area of SouthWestern Virginia and Northwest North carolina. While standing at the doorway I peered outside through the glass in boredom from the dance. I noticed a huge blue fireball with a white contrail descending through the clearly lit sky, streaking towards earth at an incredible speed. It approached the ground at approxiamtely 25 degree angle of approach to the horizon.  I remember thinking about how I could actually hear the roar of this fireball approaching above the roar of adjacent music from the dance inside in the cafeteria!   After about 2 seconds of visible and audible flight time, the blue fireball raced through the winter night sky approaching from the North at an incredibe rate of speed.  It impacted the ground with a huge flash of exploding blue and white light!  The explosion that resulted appeared to be in the vicinity of the 2 mountains I mentioned above- Mt. Rogers and White Top Mountain. Approximately 5 to 10 seconds (and possibly even as much as 20 seconds- seconds felt like minutes at that moment) afterwards, the resulting shockwave from the exploding blue white object shook the ground and door where I was observing. I remember thinking that it had to be a huge object to produce the resulting shockwave through the earth and thundering noise that I could hear over the roar of the music from the dance.  I initially had trouble comprehending what I had just witnessed! It was a very short, extremely dramatic and even frightening!  I can only specualate whether this huge object was a meteor; something man-made; or even extra-terrestial.  I don't remember hearing or reading anything about this dramatic incident even days after it happened in any local or national news media.  The impact must have occurred in an isolated area or unpopulated region in or near the two mountains mentioned earlier above.  That may explain why it went un-reported. I don't know why the event was not publicized?  It is a true mystery to this day.  Surely, there were others besides myself that witnessed this dramatic event?   But I never heard anyone else ever speak of the event.  I subsequently did not try to discuss the event with anyone for fear of persecution as a ""nut job""  Regardless of what the objct may have been, it was a huge impact that produced earth-shaking dramatic results!   An observatory or other agency may have observed the event that night remotely?  Alternatively, I have never heard or read of the event in any newspaper or any other publication.  It may be catalogued obscurely in someone's astronomical log somewhere?  Surely, I was not the only person to observe such a dramatic event that night?   I was the only student in the hallway at that time.  All other students were in cafeteria oblivious to what I witnessed. I can only speculate as to the origins of the object that impacted the Earth that night.  But having a near-photographic memory, I remember this extreme event with more questions than I have answers.  I can only tell you that what I witnessed that ""Valentines Day"" night in 1974 was something very extraordinary and possibly Extra-Terrestrial.  It imapacted the Earth in SouthWestern Virgina with a flash and a bang that also made an everlasting explosive impact in my memory!.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,36.7302,-80.8356

As the airport is 15 mi. so., I didn't think too much of it at first other than the lights were too low for an aircraft on approach as well they didn't seem to be moving towards me, but me towards them. As I drove nearer the lights I stopped & what I saw nearly took my breath away - permanently.  Suspended about 25 ft above a home, was a saucer.  There were 3 ""cones"" coming from the sides of the saucer: 1 in the middle and 2 others at 45 degree angles from the middle one.  At the tips of these cones were the white lights I'd been watching.  On the underside of the cones were three colors: blue, red, green.  None of the lights were flashing, and there were no ""windows"".  What terrified me most was that from the underside center of the saucer was the most incredible lazer of white light - about 4 inches wide focused on the roof of the house below.  I rolled down my window and sat to wait for another car to come to confirm for me I wasn't crazy; I even pinched myself hard thinking I might be dreaming.  There was NO sound at all coming from the saucer.   In 1975, Clermont was still a one-stoplight town on the outskirts of Indianapolis.  The saucer was just south of the Dairy Queen by about 3 or 4 houses.  After waiting 10 mins. for another car to come, I got scared and drove to the sheriff's station 2 blocks away but no one was there - at the time it was a 3 man operation.  I was so freaked out I drove around for half an hour before heading home.  The next night I was at a small gathering and hesitantly mentioned seeing a UFO when another friend said, ""I saw it too!""  I told him, ""Okay - you go in another room and draw a picture of it and then we'll compare.""  And by god he had the same picture w/ the cones and all!  He said he saw it around 23:30 flying towards downtown Indianapolis at a high rate of speed accompanied by 2 other saucers.  They flew directly east until they got to Merid! ian St ( divides the city E/W and goes N/S) whereby they took a 90 degree turn and sped down the center of the city!!  Hundreds if not thousands of people must have seen these saucers yet there was no mention of it in any media.  I believe the 12/20/75 sighting on your website is the same as mine - all I can remember is that it was likely a Thur or Fri nite and it was the week leading up to Christms. Of all the reports I've read, none have ever mentioned anything about a lazer focused on a house anything and I've always wondered these last 35 yrs what that white lazer could ""see"" for them. Oh, and the saucer was of a soft lustre like I've never seen - like and egg painted painted a semi-matte silver. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Earlier that morning my Grandmother had mentioned she had to go to the bank that is also located in Pleasant Hill. He had finished his CAT work and unhitched the trailer from the dump truck and we proceeded to move out east on hwy 58 to go home. We had gotten to the intersection of hwy 58 and Tillicum, as that street is called now, and I felt something weird in my tummy, like on a roller coaster ride. I remember saying ""what happened?"" My Grandpa then said, ""look down there, there's your grandma."" There was no seat belt laws back then so I stood up in the cab of the truck and crawled over to my grandpa's lap and looked down. I could see the top of the bank and could see my grandma's Buick going into the drive-thru at the bank. I could also see east down the hwy, we were at what I believe to be now at 200-250 ft up above the hwy. I remember seeing the top of a tractor trailer rig and the tops of a few cars. I also remember looking down on the telephone poles. This lasted maybe 10-15 seconds and then we were back on the hwy traveling at speed moving eastbound. I immediately asked my grandpa ""How did we do that, what did I touch?"" He responded with, ""What's that?"" You see it was pretty loud in those old dump trucks. I said, ""How'd we go way up in the air!!?"" I stood up and started trying to mess with some buttons. He then said,""Quit messing with that stuff , get up on your seat and just hold still!"" It seems he had no recollection of the event. We got home a few minutes ahead of my grandma and when she arrived I excitedly told her what happened. She said,""(grandpa's name), whats he talking about?"" Grandpa responded ""I don't know he's been going on about being up in the air or something rather since we got back."" I told her grandpa didn't believe me and I was pretty upset. When my parent's came to get me I immediately told them what had happened but I still wasn't believe! d. I can remember that day vividly. Sadly my grandpa passed away in 1998. I used to ask him about that day when stuff like that came up. He never recalled that experience.

My grandpa was in our backyard with the dog taking her to the bathroom before he went to bed. I was in my room watching TV and my mom was doing the same in her room.  My grandpa ran in the house and yelled for my mom and I to get outside.  When we got out there there was a craft that looked exactly like the drawing Kris made.  The three of us stood there and stared at the craft for probably close to five minutes as it went over head. The craft itself was triangular with a white light at each corner with a red light in the center, we couldn't see any details besides the light, it just looked like this pitch black void in the sky. The red light was, I would guess to be about twenty to thirty feet wide, and the white lights looks more like they were running lights of an airplane.  At the time, we guessed it was 200-300 feet per side. The craft was moving so slow that we couldn't understand how it could stay in the air, and it was no more than a a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet off the ground.  As the craft went over, we heard this very faint droning, the only thing I can really compare it to was like the hum of a turbine in a dam.  A ways behind the large craft was three white lights that were in a triangular pattern, we couldn't tell if it was one craft or three, but it was completely silent and looked like it kept a steady distance behind the big craft.  I would venture to guess it was about a tenth of the main craft, if that. The crafts traveled from east/north east and moved west/south west over the city of Lake Havasu towards California.  We all went inside sufficiently weirded out by what we saw.   A few minutes later I got a call from one of my friends who asked if I saw the thing in the sky.  He lived about about two miles north east of where I did and was out with his dog.  My aunt and uncle were on their patio that night on the north west side of town and they saw it.  I can't remember dates, but, my aunt told me they've seen the same craft, but without the three lights following it) on several other occasions. In talking to some friends of theirs, they also saw the craft the night we all did, and one other time.  I've got a friend online that I've known since 1997, he at the time lived in Ohio, he said that he saw this same craft as well several times.

As we watched the,  the object projected a very blue-white beam of light on to the passing train cars,  it lite up the train as if it were daylight.  By this time,  my girlfriend was really freaking out and asking me to drive away,  I was so amazed all I could do was just stare untill she began hitting me in the arm and telling me to drive.  I drove slowly towards the main road while watching this craft,  my girlfriend screaming at me to drive fast but I was in disbelief.  As we got to the asphalt I turned on my headlights,  I think thats when the object realized we were there.  The beam of light shut off and the object tracked us parallel back to the edge of town,  as we entered town,  the craft stopped suddenly and streaked to the N.E. at a very steep angle and at a speed no man-made aircrat could achieve.

I stood under it for about 30 to 40 minutes. This was back in the late summer, early fall of 1978 in Bartlett, Ill. My mom, my sister and I were on our way home from Bingo in (Streamwood, Il), which was a Friday evening. We had just gotten to Rt 20 and a block from turning onto North Ave when my sister who was sitting in the front seat noticed some lights in the sky blinking. She pointed this out to both me and our mother. What I seen was BIG and saucer shape. When I say big, I mean bigger than a commercial Air plane. This UFO was about 100 ft just about above us. My mom , who was driving, became scared and did a U-turn on Rt 20 and drove down the road about 2 miles. The UFO continued to be just about above us. She then turned around again and she at this point decided to go report it to the police dept. She was scared and I guess she felt that she would be ok if we just went to the police dept since it was following us. It followed us all the way to the police dept (I know it sounds strange a UFO following you, but it is true). When we got to the police dept, it disappeared, just gone in a split second! We talked to a police officer and told him about what we seen. He told us that “100’s of people have reported seeing this”. He just acted nonchalant like no big deal. The UFO that hovered above us did not make any sound what so ever. It was quiet, no vibration, the only way you knew it was there was the lights that went around the craft in a circular motion.  The officer reassured my mom that it was ok and when we went to leave we looked to see if it was there and it was not. The police station was about 10 blocks to our apartment on Wayne Ct, in Bartlett. We were heading down the road and as we got to the corner of N. Marion Ave, Wayne Ct and E. Taylor it suddenly appeared out of nowhere.  We continued on to our apartment on Wayne Ct. My mom pulled in the drive way and my sister jumped out of the car scared and ran into the apartment and told my boyfriend ( Derrick Fender, of Elgin, Il) and my other sister and her boyfriend (Mike ! Kessel l of Hanover Park, Il) that there was a UFO at the end of the street. They all ran out of the apartment and went to where My mom stood by the car. I walked down to the end of the street where the UFO was hovering.  Again no noise at ALL none. No wind, no noise just the lights making a circular pattern around the ship.  My sister, who had been in the car with me and my mom, came back outside and yelled at me “Get back here they are going to take you”. I was several months pregnant with my first child. I did not feel fear at all. I was more curious that fearful.  I stood under the ship, which I looked up to and it was about 100 ft above me and was much, much bigger than an airplane. As I stood there looking up I could not see what it looked like at all. It was as if it was transparent and I could see the stars through it. However I could also see the lights (green, yellow, red, and orange) going around the perimeter of the ship that outlined it circular shape.  I stood there looking, for awhile about 30 to 45 minutes, so I was told by my family. However, to me it was as if I was only there for a couple of minutes, it was as if time stood still. I know that the neighbors seen this also as some of them where outside watching.  Suddenly it just disappeared in thin air, did not fly off, just disappeared in a split second.  I stood there for a few moments and then walked back to where my family was.  There has only been one picture I have found on the internet that closely resembles what I seen and that is this (note this is NOT the actual UFO just what it looks like) This is Similar to the ship I seen <a href=""http://s35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/heaven-sent/?action=view&current=UFOthatIseen.gif"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/heaven-sent/UFOthatIseen.gif"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  [IMG]http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/heaven-sent/UFOthatIseen.gif[/IMG] http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/heaven-sent/UFOthatIseen.gif ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was approx between 8:30-9pm and I was driving eastbound on highway 13.  I noticed through the upper right corner of my windshield HUGE lights.  At first I thought it was a blimp because it was moving so slowly SW to NE.  It was so odd that I pulled off the road so I could get a better look at it.  There was a football game going on at the Burnsville high school and so I initially thought it was a blimp that was going to hover over the field with a display like the American Flag?  But, it had rows of lights (one row of red the next row white with several rows) but after pulling onto the side of the road and I got a better look at it I saw there were only rows of red and white and it was a rectangle shape and wasn't a blimp.  It was enormous, I'd have to guess it was close to the size of a football field at minimum.  I remember wondering how it stayed afloat because it was moving so slow.  So I rolled my window down so I could hear if there was any engine noise.  There was possibly a faint hum at best, but it was hard for me to tell because cars were passing by and it wasn't quiet enough.  I sat and watched it slowly move out of sight and there was one other car in front of me that had also pulled off the road.  I never spoke to the person/s in the car in front of me, now I wish I would have so we could have shared observations. I had been on my way to meet a group of friends at Burnsville Bowl, when I arrived they asked why I was so late.  I remember looking at my watch, but since it's been so many years ago I cannot remember how late I was or how much time I was missing.  I know I was confused because I had told them I saw some weird cool lights but had only sat on the side of the road for maybe 15 minutes. I never reported the sighting because I was convinced that HUNDREDS of people would have seen the same thing I had because of it's size and slow speed and surely many people would call it in!  I did faithfully watch the news for the next few days hoping I'd hear about it but never did.  I'm regretful that I did not report the sighting then because now I cannot provide an accurate date or time.  Now I think I understand why so few photographs exist, because while it was happening I was unable to take my eyes off of it and was completely mesmerized!  I may not have an exact time/date, but I will not forget what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Most likely the bottom of the ship or objects body. My friend and I were driving to the Quakerbridge mall in my sisters Datsun 280zx on RT. I-95 going east. My sisters car has a moon roof. I was gazing out through the moon roof noticing the slight fog in the air as I was driving and noticed two lighted objects appear side by side. It looked as if they were coming towards us but being that we were driving in that direction probably made it look that way. I quickly called to my friend and told him to look up, do you see what I see? he said yes, what is it? One of the objects hovered above us and followed in our direction as the other one had seemed to stay behind. I immediately noticed the shape and lights. There were what seemd to be four octagon pods hooked together with a honey comb shape screen or lens and the lights slowly pulsated in each pod, white, red, blue and maybe orange?? Driving at 60mph I slowed down and pulled the car over to the side of the road so we could get out to get a better look at the object. As we looked up into the foggy air, we could not see the object. We got back in the car and drove on to the next exit ( Trenton, New Brunswick ) As we took the New brunswick exit toward the mall, we had to stop at the next red traffic light. The New Jersey motor vehicles inspection station is on the right. As we were waiting for the light to turn green, I looked up into the fog and there it was, right above us, that same pulsating octagon object. I jestured for my friend to look up and we watched it slowly ascend into the foggy air and then nothing, it was gone. The light turned green and we went on our way asking each other what the hell did we just see? The strange thing about this experience was that it did not creep us out or make us scared. It was like, oh whats that? and then hmmm, life goes on. I do have to say I have always been intrigued by stories of UFO's ever since i was eleven years old.

At the time, I was south bound on Kennedy Dr. in the City of Kankakee, Il.  During this immediate time of the sighting, I looked out of my driver's window, looking east and observed an object which was a Cylinder shape in a stationary position, not moving at all.  It looked as if it was 150-200 ft off the ground. The Cylinder shaped object appeared to be very large, long in size and had blinking multi-colored lights along the side, in a straight single row.  The tail appeared to have a yellowish-orange glowing tail, which appeared to me like an after burner on jet aircraft. This object appeared to be hovering in place.  I am presently a Helicopter pilot and have been around all types of aircraft and this was not an aircraft.  It looked almost cigar shaped. After witnessing this object, my view was obstructed by approximately one city block of trees for approximately 10 seconds before my view was opened up again.  At this time the object was gone, completely out of sight and not seen again.  The distance from where I observed the object, it appeared to be stationary over the down town area of Kankakee, which was 4-5 blocks east from where I was at that time. I never told anyone, except my wife. I have always been a skeptical person but that sighting convinced me of what I had seen. A couple days after, the Kankakee Daily Journal newpaper printed a sighting of the same thing I had seen, by a couple living in rural Grant Park, Il which is 12 miles east of Kankakee.

It was dark so the time would be roughly 7pm to 9pm  PST.  Couldn't be much later than that I would've been forced into bed at  around 8:30.  Fair Oaks, CA.  Roughly 15-20 miles east of Sacramento.  Within 1/2 mile of the American River. It was silent.  It was moving slow and seemed to be only 50-100ft off the ground.  It was disc for the most part much like if you were to take two plates and stack one upside down onto the other.  It wasn't just a disc shape though.  Imagine you have the two plates again now take 3-4 small plates, saucers, stacked properly or and set the original two on top of them.  That would be pretty much to scale.  A large disc section with this lower section roughly 2/3 the diameter of the main section protruding.  This lower section is round and flat on the bottom, it has a taper to it.  Smaller at the bottom tapering to somewhat larger where it was joined with the large disc section.  All around the edge smaller bottom section were panels, each a rectangle, but only about 30 around the entire ship.  These panels ran the entire height of the lower section, the bottom had no features that I recall.  Each panel lit with each color imaginable, changing colors every second, not in some un! iform pattern, it seemed each was doing its own thing. I was on the lawn of my grandfathers house.  I believe some family members had been over that evening and they were about to leave.  There were roughly 5 of us out there.  I saw the craft, low and slow, going right down my street towards the river.  I reached out for it and started running after it as fast a small boy can.  I recall one of my sisters screaming at me to stop.  It was all so fast.  I reach out and start running, simultaneously she starts screaming, ""No Matthew Stop!"" I didn't.  I ran about 25 yards and I was keeping up with its slow pace but suddenly it sped up and I mean like snap your fingers, boom, it's gone. I've asked all my sisters about this incident none of them recall this ever happening, but I know at least one of them was there.

"Bright light in the sky, periodically moving to new locations practically instantly, with multiple military aircraft chasing later on",Longbranch,WA,1995-07-01T00:00:00,light,45 min+,"Occurred : 7/1/1995 00:00  (Entered as : 07/01/95 0:00) Reported: 5/11/2010 1:54:30 AM 01:54 Posted: 5/12/2010 Location: Longbranch, WA Shape: Light Duration:45 min+",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75375.html,"Bright light in the sky, periodically moving to new locations practically instantly, with multiple military aircraft chasing later on I do not recall the exact date of the event that I wish to report. I do know that it was in 1995, I believe in the summertime.  Myself and a friend (both about 16 yrs of age) witnessed it from my mother's home in Longbranch, WA.  I have checked on and off for years to see if I could find any similar reports occurred in the same area around the same timeframe and have been unable to find any to date.  I recently found the website for NUFORC, so I thought I would give a shot at reporting it here to see if I could get any further information.   I have to admit that in a way the following description will sound like something you might read or see in a sci-fi story, but I can assure that I and my friend witnessed the event as I will describe in the text below firsthand with the exception of the details from the following morning which were relayed to me by my mother, which seem to bear relevance to the situation so I will include that as well. At some point late night or early morning, I will say around midnight would be a fair estimate, the two of us were sitting in my room.  I looked through my window and saw a bright light through the branches of a tree outside which at first I took to be just a bright star in the night sky.  Within the next several minutes I looked out again and the light was still there in the same position but seemed a little brighter.  Again a few minutes passed and I looked out again, but at this time I could see that the light was in another position relative to the tree, so at this time I mentioned it to my friend and we decided to watch it through the window as the position changed seemed unusual.  Again it stayed in this position for a couple minutes while we watched and then suddenly disappeared and reappeared almost instantly at yet a new point.  At this juncture we decided to go outside to watch as it seemed to be getting closer and would soon be at a point where we could not easily see it above from the window.  Outside we watched for several more minutes with the same process repeating where the object would be stationary in the sky, disappear, and then reappear at another point.  I would say this went on for what seemed to be at least 20 to 30 minutes.  If I recall the directions correctly the object was north of us to begin with when I first saw it and progressively moved south toward us as it went (I will continue to use this directional assumption for the duration of this account). At this time from the southeast we heard the sound of jets approaching from the direction of McChord Air Force Base which is located in Tacoma, which is the nearest large city to Longbranch.  We located them in the sky and saw multiple jets moving in the direction of the light.  When they appeared to be nearing it, it moved to a new point in the same manner as before and the jets turned and went toward it again.  This repeated several times with the same results over several more minutes. More jets approached and this continued with the object now moving further into the east.  They progressively moved out further over the surrounding woods in that direction  until we could no longer see them over the trees.  I would estimate this cat and mouse between them to have gone on for at least 15 to 20 minutes before we lost sight of them all with an estimate of around maybe 8 to 10 jets participating overall.  We watched a few more minutes to be sure they didn't come back in our directio! n and then saw a large dark object coming just over the trees from the same direction the jets and object disappeared from, passing directly over our heads.  When it got near and passed above us it clearly appeared to be a large black helicopter running with no visible lights and with no discernible sound from the rotors.  This is the end of what we saw firsthand. The next morning my mother returned from a trip she had taken to visit family in the Tacoma area the day before and when she got home she asked if anything unusual had happened the night before.  When I asked why she was asking she stated that when she was passing through Longbranch on the way to our home that there were multiple government-plated cars parked by the road with men in suits stopping any passersby to ask if they had seen or heard anything going on the previous night, without giving any information into the nature of their inquiry.  I informed her of what I'd seen but we agreed to keep the information to ourselves at that time.  We never heard or saw anything further on it.  As stated previously, the last part involving my mother was not first-hand, but it does seem pertinent to the prior night's event, although she passed away a few years ago and is no longer around to verify that particular aspect. If you have taken the time to read this in total without discounting it offhand, I appreciate your time and apologize for the length of it, although I did feel I should be as detailed and thorough as possible.  I hope to find out through this outlet if anyone else has seen or heard anything about what happened here, but if not I shall continue to search on my own in the future as I would like to know what occurred here.

My path around a corner apple tree I felt the presence of something. Second time around in the same spot I feel a presence again so I am looking around but see nothing.  Third time I am coming up to this corner looking at everything in front of me and see nothing but going under and around the tree I feel a presence again, continuing on and looking back, still I see nothing.  OK now I am disturbed, I know I am being watched but I don’t see anything.  It is my fourth pass I am determined to see what is looking at me.  I come up on the corner I feel the presence I pass under the tree and as I look back, up in the apple tree is a small creature being with dark almond shaped eyes, opaque color thin limbs.  It was kind of scrunched up in the tree just watching me, in clear view and just watching me.  When I first seen the being it was invisible, I mean I was looking thru i! t, I wasn’t grasping what I was seeing. I was scared.  I did not finish mowing the lawn.  I did not tell anyone as I thought certain they think me crazy. About a week later around 1:00 am I witnessed a mother ship hovering in the field just outside the bathroom window.  5 acres separated us and our neighbor, I could not see the neighbor’s house it was so big.  It appeared to be hovering just a few feet off the ground, round and disk like in shape with many windows.  It was close enough you could see activity in the port holes of the craft. My sense was that the being in the tree was lost or perhaps like a teenager took off and the mother ship was there to pick him/her up.  I have always been of the opinion that we are not alone and well now I know that to be true.  Of course you ask the question, Why me, why did this being presence it’s self to me?  I sensed the lesson for me was continue on my journey continue on my search for peace.  It was like the being and I had something in common, assuring me that there are struggles no matter who you are or where you are in the universe.

It was hovering just a few feet away.  I was so excited I just stared at it.  The light blinked, as though something walked in front of the light.  It seemed like two shadows.  Then the light flashed brighter and I was blinded and all I could see was this light and nothing else.   My dog was growling and whining at the window.  The only time she acts like that is when there was a deer in our back yard.   Then I saw the ship raise a little bit, point the nose to the sky, and disappeared in the blink of an eye.  I went to bed, when I woke up I had a strange mark on my arm, and a weird mole sticking out of my stomach.  It felt weird, so I was uncomfortable and started pulling at it.  I worked on it for a couple of years and I was constantly pulling at it.  Then finally I gave it a good pull and a long string noodle thing came out of my arm, like a vein and it was a foot long.  I thought I'd pulled my vein out but it wouldn't come all the way out.  I thought it was connected to me because I felt pulling on my stomach, on the inside.

Tonight I was over at a friend's house stargazing as we do often when the weather permits. The weather was warm and clear. The moon was 3/4 full with Jupiter off to it's right. Three of the four moons of Jupiter were visible. My friend's house lies under the flight path for planes going into Seatac when they have to fly south to circle around to land going north. It's also under a flight path for planes that are going to Boeing Field from the south.  Needless to say, we see a lot of planes on any given night that we stargaze. We also usually see one of the Guardian helicopters from the King County Sheriff's Department flying around, so we are both very familiar with the aircraft in this area. At approximately 1:00am when Coast to Coast took a commercial break, my friend went into his house to use the bathroom. A few minutes later I decided to stand up to stretch my legs. We sit on his porch facing due East, so when I stood up, that's the direction I was facing. I saw a bright pulsing light directly ahead of me. My first thought was that it was a private plane with it's landing lights on heading in my direction. Private planes' landing light pulse on and off as they come in for a landing, but the color was wrong and I couldn't detect any forward motion. The color of the light was sort of amber yet at the same time it was like a mixture of red and white light, but not pink. As if the red and white light was swirled together. I could detect both colors at the same time although it appeared as one light. The motion that I could detect was a gentle back and forth motion and at the same time a gentle up and down motion. It was erratic yet seemed under control. I grabbed my binoculars, Celestron Skymaster 15x70s, and looked at it. It appeared much closer, but otherwise appeared exactly the same. I was pretty sure that this wasn't a plane, so I flashed a small flashlight at it. I didn't notice any reaction from the object. I then grabbed my friends big flashlight which I believe is a 2.5 million candle power light. I flashed it twice in the direction of the object. I'm not sure if it was coincidence or not, but the object moved slightly to the right behind a tree. I had to move to my left a few feet to be able to see it again through the tree. After about 30 seconds the object started moving to the left. When it did this I could see that the pulsing light was a white light at the rear of the object, based on direction of travel. There was a non pulsing white light at the front of the object and there were 3 non pulsing red lights visible. As the object came out from behind the tree moving North, I flashed the big flashlight at it a couple of more times. Again, I don't know if it was coincidence or not, but the object accelerated. It was a very quick yet smooth acceleration. This is when I realized that the object was not as far away as I had first thought. I had been thinking that it appeared to be very far away, but now it appeared as if it was only a few thousand feet away, perhaps closer. Without knowing the size of the object it's hard to tell at night. As the object moved what appeared to be North, I would lose sight of it for a few seconds as it went behind trees, but I quickly realized that it was now heading West, or perhaps WNW towards Tukwilla. It accelerated again, very smoothly, and I lost sight of it when it went behind a neighboring house. When I looked at it with the binoculars as it was traveling westerly, I was looking at it from the side, so I could not tell what shape it was, but I got the impression it was triangular. I saw no wings and no tail section and it was totally silent. From it's apparent size and distance, I should have easily heard it. Guardian One at that distance would have been very loud and easily identifiable as we have seen it on many occasions fly by at that apparent altitude and distance.  The only problem is that whatever this was, was way faster than Guarding One and made no noise.  As a matter of fact, Guardian One just flew over my apartment as I am writing this. It was quite noisy and can be heard a great distance away. It was also much too fast for a private plane, which we had fly over us not very long before this sighting.  Again, the private plane was easily heard and identified.  For it to have been a commercial plane, which we see several every night, including tonight, the pilot would have had to have been making an emergency landing since he was only flying about 20 degrees off of the horizon.  At the estimated distance a a few thousand feet, it would have been incredibly loud.  I also estimate that it was only a few hundred feet in altitude. I feel like I'm rambling, so I'm going to end this.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,47.38164504608295,-122.19678513824886

They were diffuse balls of light zooming at very high speeds in circle formations that would intersect making the overall pattern look like zig zags or figure eights. Also some of these orbs were popping in and out of my view in patterns of movements that were in shorter duration and appeared to me as not moving in circles. However I had the thought that these orbs were further away from me and I was only seeing on end of their trajectory or path. When I would shift my focus to the whole sky rather than trying to follow a couple of the orbs I then noticed that there were many more balls of light zipping all over the sky. I had the thought that they were flying at various altitudes. Last night was a beautiful night with a light cloud cover, patches of clear sky and stars peeking through. All day the clouds over the Bay were unusual, multi-colored, and diverse formations, several rainbows appeared in the late afternoon, early evening. A summer thunderstorm was trying to express itself. A few drops fell. It felt like a Hawaii day and night. As I was watching the orbs last night I wondered if they were absorbing energy from the clouds. The phenomenon stopped when the cloud cover dispersed and the moon rose into the sky. At first I wondered if the lights were searchlights.  I did not see any beams however.  I only saw the balls zipping and circling about. They were not the lights from normal aircraft. I wondered if they were being projected from a ship/boat but as the lights were above my head and my house in on a hill half a mile from the edge of the Bay, it did not seem possible. I am not a UFO buff. So I am not sure of the correct vernacular to use to describe what I saw. I have done an internet search wondering if anyone else saw what I saw.

Flight JK-297 had taken off from Salzburg (Austria) with 109 passengers on board, and had made a refuelling stop in Majorca before setting course towards Las Palmas. Halfway through the flight, at about 23:00h, Pilot Francisco Javier Lerdo de Tejada and his crew noticed a set of red lights that were fast approaching the aircraft. These lights appeared to be on a collision course with the aircraft, alarming the crew. The captain requested information about the inexplicable lights, but neither the military radar of Torrejón de Ardoz (Madrid) nor the flight control center in Barcelona could provide any explanation for this phenomenon. In order to avoid a possible collision, the captain changed altitude. However, the lights mirrored the new course and stayed about half a kilometer away from the plane. Since the object was violating all elementary safety rules and an evasive maneuver was deemed impossible by the crew, the captain decided on going off-course and made an emergency landing in Manises' airport. This was the first time in history in which a commercial flight was forced to make an emergency landing because of a UFO. The flight crew reported the lights abandoning the pursuit just before the landing took place. However, three new UFO signals were detected by the radar, each one with an estimated diameter of 200 meters. The objects were seen by several witnesses. One of the UFOs passed very close to the airport runway, and emergency lights were lit by the land crew in case the object happened to be an unregistered flight experiencing difficulties. Given the lack of answer to all communication attempts, a Mirage F-1 took off from the nearby airbase of Los Llanos (Albacete) to identify the phenomenon. The pilot, Spanish Air Force captain Fernando Cámara, had to increase his speed to mach 1.4 just to be able to get visual contact with what he perceived to be a truncated cone shape displaying a changing bright color, but despite his initial efforts the object quickly disappeared from sight. The pilot was informed of a new radar echo, which indicated that another object might be near Sagunto (Valencia). When the pilot was close enough, the object accelerated and disappeared again. This time, though, the UFO seemed to respond and the fighter had its avionics scrambled -its electronic flight systems were jammed, a highly hostile action. At last, and after a third contact attempt, the UFO finally disappeared, heading for Africa. After an hour and a half of pursuit, and due to fuel shortage, the pilot was forced to return to the base with no results. [edit] Possible Explanations The public impact of the incident was such that on September 1980 it reached the Spanish Parliament. The High Chamber representative Enrique Múgica publicly asked for an official explanation, but a UFO sighting was dismissed and the incident was attributed to a series of freak optical illusions. The full official report, declassified by the Spanish Airforce on August 1994, states that the Supercaravelle JK-297 pilot Javier Lerdo de Tejada, the land crew in Manises' airport and the Air Force Captain Fernando Cámara might had been misled by ""flashes emitted from a distant chemical industry complex"" (about 100 miles away from Manises) ""and some stars and planets"". Although this possibility has been much argued and repeatedly rejected by all people involved it stands as the only non-UFO-related explanation. The on-flight difficulties experienced by the fighter were not mentioned in the public release. The electronic system failure on board the Mirage F-1 could nevertheless be explained by the fact that the U.S. Navy Sixth Fleet was stationed in the area, and was making use of a powerful electronic warfare equipment while awaiting the outcome of the Iran hostage crisis. Since in the late seventies all UFO phenomenons were promptly published by mass media and readily consumed by the public, it has been argued that the flight crew might have been influenced into believing that they were experiencing a UFO sighting instead of just witnessing an optical phenomenon, and had therefore been readier to consider, and finally undertake, such an extreme maneuver as an emergency landing.

It was a marathon drive and by the time my cousin and I hit Whitehorse in BC, we had been on the road non-stop for over 40 hours.   It was shortly after midnight, and I was driving down a long dark straight stretch of highway, about 10 miles North of Whitehorse, heading South.  I remember it being a clear night, as I could see the stars as I drove.  This section of the highway was heavily lined with Douglas Fir trees, so it was darker to the left and right of the roadway, and slightly brighter directly above, due to starlight and maybe moonlight. When suddenly I was startled by what appeared to my mind as a flash of lightning going directly overhead, straight down the highway the same southerly direction as my car, but what struck me as odd is that it was straight.  Not like jagged lightening.  Plus there was no sound of thunder. At the time my cousin was sleeping and the flash of light was bright enough that it woke him up. When he asked what that was, I simply said I thought it was lightening. 10 minutes later, as we approached the outskirts of the small town of Whitehorse, we noticed that a police car was in the ditch on the left side of the road with his lights flashing. The officer was standing next to his car looking straight up.  I just continued to drive on (not sure why) and half a mile later, there was a fire truck in the ditch on the right side of the road, and the firemen were standing outside their vehicle look up at the sky.  By this time we were coming up to the first signs of habitation, which was a gas station. It was brightly lit, and there was another police car there with lights flashing, and about 6 people standing outside looking up at the sky. I pulled up to a pump and got out to fill up the car, and the attendant was standing a few feet away looking up, and I asked him what was going on?  He looked at me incredulously and said, ""You mean you did not see it??!""  I shrugged and said, ""I was driving into town from the north, I did not see anything.""   He shook his head and stated, ""How could you have missed it? The damn UFO was flying low enough to force the fire truck and cop car off the road, then it went and buzzed this station and then headed up the road you were just on!"" All I could say was, ""WOW!""  My cousin and I just shrugged our shoulders. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2009-05-12T00:00:00,,

As I headed back into my house, I noticed an extremely bright light in the sky behind my house.  I was immediately struck by the brightness of the object because it had just turned dark.   I observed it for a moment or two, wondering if it was a planet.  When I realized that there were no other stars in the sky yet, I became more intrigued.  I, therefore, decided to observe it longer.   5 minutes turned into 10 minutes, and I called my husband outside to ask him what he thought it was.  He first thought it was a planet or the ""north star,"" but as he observed it longer, he thought it was ""a little strange.""  The light was not moving and made absolutely no sound.  After approximately 10 minutes, my husband decided to go back into the house.  I, however, remained transfixed, and continued my observation for approximately 30-40 minutes longer before I decided to go ba! ck into my house to get my camera.   At approximately 9:15-20 p.m., I took photos of the light.  During the entire 40-45 minutes of my constant observation of this light, it remained in relatively the same spot in the sky.  [It is important to note that we live less than one mile away from the Mercer County Airport and literally see planes landing on the runway (running west to east) through the trees in our backyard.  This light, however, was directly north, and during my observation of this light, continued to see planes fly in front of it.]    As I began to take pictures of the light (which visually remained static) I noticed that when I found it in my camera viewfinder the object appeared to be MOVING very rapidly in a haphazard way.   When I moved my eyes away from the camera to observe the light, it appeared perfectly still to my eyes! I took 8 pictures of the light on May 15th.  After I took my 8 pictures, the light simply disappeared.  During my observation of the light, I was ! not frightened, simply intrigued and highly curious about what! I was o bserving.  It is also important to note that I was seeking some confirmation that it might be an airplane flying south, however, at no time did I observe flashing beacon lights. The light appeared again in the same relative spot in the sky on Sunday, June 6th, 2010 at approximately 8:00 p.m.  My husband and I were returning home and I noticed the same very bright light as I got out of our car.  It was earlier than the previous 5/15/10 sighting, and the sky was somewhat lighter.  Again, there were no other observable stars yet in the sky, thereby highlighting the intensity and oddness of this particular light.  I immediately retrieved my camera and took 7 pictures of the light. I observed the light intermittently (i.e., I kept coming outside from the house to check on it rather than strictly observing it as I did on 5/15) for approximately 40 to 50 minutes.  Just as in the first sighting, the light remained static (to my eye) and remained in the same relative position in the sky. The final time I checked, it was gone (approximately 9:00 p.m. or so.)   Since my two sightings of this intense light (and subsequent review of my pictures), I am HIGHLY curious about it and am hoping that someone can explain what it is to me.  I now find myself looking for the light every night, but have not seen it since the 6/6/10 sighting.  Further, I did check the flight data on the ISS, and it was nowhere near my position in New Jersey on either 5/15/10 or 6/6/10. ((NUFORC Note:  If in the NW sky, probably Venus.

I often work late and that night, in late May of 2010, I got home between 22:00 & 23:00. As usual, after getting out of the car, I stood there a while and look at the stars.  I was looking N/E and caught a flicker to the East.  I looked and saw, what I can only describe as, a fireball.  It was moving so slow that I actually watched it for about 30 seconds.  30 seconds!  It was moving easterly on a steady path and had a faint, but visible tail.  Whatever its distance was from my eyes, I can assuredly say that it looked the size of the full moon.  I could actually see movement in the color probably due to excessive heat. It was kind of like looking straight into a jet’s afterburners. It was either a HUGE object or it was very, very close.  From my viewpoint, it looked like it was at a level where I would normally see jets coming in for a landing, but I’m sure that was just an optical illusion. I saw nothing coming off the object like pieces or sparks.  It was round, clean and almost photoshopped-looking except for the faint pinkish spray of the tail. If this was a meteor, it was far too close for my comfort and there was nothing at all mentioned on the news. This is the second time I’ve seen something like this. The first time, in the late 70’s, was not nearly as spectacular, but just a thrilling.  As we were driving back from Newport Beach at 3:00am, that object went right over our heads, like a plane going down, then shot up at a very sever angle and out of sight, all in about 10 seconds.  No sound at all. Neither of us talked about it.  The people in the car driving next to us also saw it.  I looked over at them and they just shrugged. If I were to have taken a picture of either object it would have looked exactly like the gas bubble (without the fiery outer layer and red tail) on the ‘In the News’ section of the C2C website, under ""Black Hole blows huge gas bubble."" I’ve never seen ball lightening in California. In any case, I doubt it would be as big as these objects. I am a Staff Assistant for an Engineering of a Municipal utility.  I worked in the aerospace industry for 10 years, loving my company and every minute of work.  I have been intrested in everything to do with space, planets, astronomy,and etchnology since I was 1st grade - all due to a large panaramic picture my teached had posted on the Science Wall that dipicted the birth and death of planet Earth.  I didn't quite accept that particular concept of Earth, but it was colorful. I keep binoculars in my car just so I can look at stars.  (Unfortunately I wasn't about to take my eyes of the May object to grab the binoculars.I now keep them under the front seat.)   I often get up at two or three in the morning just to go outside and look at the sky.  It's very calming, but somewhat hard on my neck.  I've seen a lot of extremely interesting things up there that, and that just keeps me hooked.

The sky night is beautiful there and we often go out in our field and checkout the night sky.  My mother little sister maddie my brother dino and my friend tommy were all sitting out on lounge chairs talking and trying to find constellations in the sky.  It was about 11:35 and I noticed a whit sphere shoot out and dissappear from  what looked like the brightest star in the sky that night.  I tried pointing it out but they had all missed it but we countinued to watch the orange looking star after a bit they we stopped watching because nothing more happened.  About half an hour later when I looked at the star it appeared to be getting bigger and soon we could see it moving away from the tree line and picking up speed.  At first I pointed it out but not everyone could tell if it was moving or not but it started moving a bit faster and soon had moved a large distace over the sky and finally fell directly above us and just sat there in the sky.  It sat directly above us for about ten minutes until it stared to kind of shimmer a bit aof red beneath it and then accelerate almost straight up and turning solid red.  It did not stop util we could no longer see it at all.  We all without a doubt knew this was not a natural  as it only took about a full minute and a half to make it from the treeline untill directly above us and the just stop from such a fast pace and sit there not moving directly above.  I can tell airplanes and satelight immediately and watch the night sky quite often and it was a cloudless night.  Anyways after seeing it leave we headed back to the cabin to tell my dad and other sister and when we got there had realized three hours had gone by and did not remember being there that long and my mom was a bit mad because we had to wake up early.  I had my phone wen we where out there and she didn’t want to be up that late but I seemed to be the only one who really noticed the time loss and found it weird.,2010-07-19T00:00:00,41.2242,-79.6352

Initially though it was a nearby mylar balloon ascending in the evening wind.  Upon observing, I realized it was considerably more distant because a light aircraft landing nearby at a community field eclipsed the object and based on the size I would have estimated it to be much closer if it was a ""free-ranging"" balloon.  Still skeptical, I observed and noticed the sphere ascending slowly to the south at a steady rate.  A faint fuzziness existed around its perimeter. I photographed the sky using a blackberry camera phone such that each frame should encompass the sphere.  To my amazement the object passed behind a thin but opaque cloud during the observation period.  This then confirmed that it was much higher and further away than a mylar balloon or facsimile.  The object maintained its altitude (estimated ~2000-3000 ft).  The presence of numerous jets landing and small private aircraft preclude the notion of a misidentification of a plane as a black/opaque sphere.  Six images were taken as it progressed southward to ultimately disappear.  I am posting this observation in response to seeing NUFORC reports of similar  in the vicinity.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,41.761355311004785,-88.31528937799044

Two Hovering by the Sun and One Flying North East.  Report Includes Two Sightings by Others On Same Day. After I was done mowing my neighbors lawn at 4:15 p.m., I went outside for a cigarette.  I decided to look up for some sky gazing, despite the sun being the only thing hanging in the sky. The sun was shining behind some maple trees, decreasing its luminosity to the point where I was no longer blinded if I looked at it.  I could see bugs and pollen flying through the air, but I also saw something else as well.  Two metallic white / silver spheres caught the sun's light.  One proceeded to move North East, and I watched it fly to the horizon.  It seemed to have a sort of darkness around it, like a haze. The sky just seemed darker around it.  The other objects, still catching the suns light, hovered for a few more seconds and just vanished. I submitted the report to MUFON.  That day, another report was submitted by a man about how he and his wife and kids saw ""dozens"" of silvery spheres in Leesburg hovering in the sky over a Costco at about 5:00 PM, an hour after me.  They watched them for about a half hour, and saw some of them glow.  Their report also states that single spheres would split and become two, and two would become one.  They were moving North. Later that week another individual submitted a report to MUFON with pictures.  The individual saw a silvery white sphere flying North.  This report took place an hour or so before me in Richmond. That is three reports of silvery / white spheres in one day, over the course of a couple hours.  This is my report.  I don't know if the submitted theirs here or not but for investigation purposes, theirs and mine are on MUFON.  I am very sorry if NUFORC is a competitor of MUFON.  I just want to this story out to as many people as possible. The next day, somewhere between 4 - 4:15 PM I went out to the pipeline behind our house for another cigarette and in curiosity I looked up to sky at the spot where I saw the objects the day before.   My curiosity was peaked even more so because of a very low flying and very slow flying Blackhawk helicopter that flew over the pipeline.  I didn't think anything would come of it but I was wrong.  This time I watched a black sphere for a minute fly under one of the only clouds in the sky.  Once it hit the blue sky it was gone, like it could only be seen near the cloud.

It looked similar to the way a satellite looks(only considerably bigger and a different color), but appeared to all of us to be much lower in the sky than a satellite.  It seemed to be at about the same altitude that a small aircraft would fly.  I'd estimate maybe only 4 or 5 thousand feet.   It was a very deep unchanging orange/reddish color.

The object was about the size of a head of a pin seen at arms length. I observed for about 5 minutes.  It stopped moving and stayed in a stationary position..  I said to myself that i am going to go to my car to get my digital canon camera.  And i did. When i got back it was hard to relocate the object at first but i finally was able.  It was sitting there for another 4 minutes and then slowly moved off to the north... Minutes later, I noticed another Goldish red orb in another area in the sky.  Basically overhead but  just a few degrees off to the south from just overhead...  It was larger  or lower and perhaps at the cirrus cloud height.  I took a few pictures with my canon camera..   Again it was still broad daylight and it almost seemed to glisten in a red gold type of light..  It was not close enough to tell if it was actually metallic or if it was a light.  I decided for some strange reason to turn the flash on the camera to on..  When I did that and took a photo.  The object that was standing stationary in the sky for about 5 minutes rapidly accelerated toward the southwest..   And then accelerated again and vanished. It was a two stage acceleration, going from still to rapid speed m then suddenly accelerates again to super fast and it was gone. When looking at the photo that I took,  and after I enlarged it,  looks  like all those other photos that you would see of UFOs in the national enquirer, and I laughed to myself.. To the naked eye it was more visible and did not represent any known aircraft.  It was neither a bird nor a balloon.

I have just witnessed an object falling into the atmosphere at 5:08 am this morning(2/15//09). I stepped outside to have a cigarrette, and noticed a glow  travelling due south about 45 degrees above the horizon. it proceeded to fall glowing a bright silver color, with no other color at an unusually slow rate. After about 1.5 seconds it began to dim and then the intense glow faded to see a remnant travelling for another .5-.7 seconds towards the treeline behind the water tower. The trajectory appeared to be heading into the East side over Charlotte, and from my astonomy background appeared unusual because of the relative speed and color. I seemed about 1/2 the speed of most meteor oblects and the duration of visibility after burning also lasted for a longer period. The color was an intense white light that would be a magnitude 5 times brighter than Jupiter ( which is visible just after sunset in the East currently around 7 pm). This could have been a very large meteor that did not burn completely, and the remains may have reached Earth East to South East of Charlotte. This however appeared to be at a slower speed, possibly close to a speed of a visible manmade satellite. [There has been recent news coverage of a  2 satellite collision last week (maybe around Tuesday-Wednseday). Also there has been coverage of close range asteroids that were found last Autumn, and several large objects that entered the atmoshere last October-November 2008. Also, I saw one of these on 10/31/08 at 2:58 am and the color was yellow amber with a fater speed and longer visible duration which appeared to break into several pieces]. What I saw this morning was different than normal in speed and color from previous experiences with meteor phenomenon, and may be part of recent satellite activity.

It was moving so smoothly in one direction (diagonal, to my left, passing from the side of me to in front of me) that at first i thought this sphere was on some type of invisible zip-line.  Then the sphere started moving in directions outside of it's original path.  Still traveling forward, it moved up and down, and then swooped very quickly as it got closer to the brick building in front of me (High School in the Community).  The sphere was small as I mentioned, but it's movements were quick and smooth.  The possibility of it being controlled somehow by remote is out of the question based on the quick, sudden movements (at one point doing a quick loop.  The word dancing would almost describe it).  I kept walking forward towards the brick building where it was fading out of my site, and then I could no longer see it as it seemed to have traveled out of site.  I continued to look for it for the next 30 minutes to no avail.  Shortly thereafter I saw a large slowly drifting  object far off in the distance, cigar shaped, but very large.  It didn't act or look like a cloud.  The only possibility I could come up with was that maybe it was a Zeppelin or blimp.  This remained in my sight for 15 minutes or so.  Also, a bright light high in the sky appeared in view.  It looked like a bright star or planet, but I hadn't seen it minutes earlier.  This made it suspicious to me.

While walking westward through large trees in the landscape park. I stopped in the shade of a tree for a moment. Looking now and deliberately to block the sun. I looked up to the west in the sky and instantly become stunned of what I was witnessing in those 5-8 seconds. I can only describe in words that is simply incredible to imagine for any human. What I witnessed was semi-circular in shape. The size had to be at least one mile to even miles in diameter. Attitude looked quite high at 10,000 ft It's appearance was translucent like a jellyfish-bluish-white in color tone. It definately had a outside rim - Added by two smaller circles on the left side of this thing.Scale size to the larger 10:1 Each of these two smaller circles also had a outer rim.

It was a very freaky feeling those seconds witnessing this thing. I was after 5-8 seconds.that I became curious to see the wholeness of this craft. I wanted to know if there were two other smaller circles on the right side. I could not tell,due to blockage of tree to the right side. I instantly looked into the sun and was blinded by the sun's rays. I again looked up by blocking sun's direct rays, after about 10 seconds. I could not see it anymore. I cannot express to you what the emotions play in witnessing something so incredible.

When I did I was greeted not by the sky I'd been expecting, but by the dark night sky.  I looked around for the source of the light, and not finding it, I went to get a glass of water.  I figured I'd imagined it.  When I came back to bed the light was back, and this time I could see the source.  There was a large, saucer-shaped craft in the sky above the forest behind my house.  It looked almost transparent in the center, and glowed blue around the edges, looking almost jellyfish-like.  I stared for a few minutes, stupefied.

But since the time of my sighting, I have left out so many other significant factors to that night/morning that I just felt compelled to write to you again and explain the whole event, as there is so much more to mention. I have talked about my experience with several people over the past several months and have been made fun of countless times by friends and co-workers, but I still feel the need to explain the whole story to get it off my chest. On 1/2/09, I received a call from a friend’s son, who begged me to come up to Lafayette CO, to watch some meteor showers after I got off of work.  It was on a Friday and I was very tired and did not want to drive up there and hang out that particular night.  But the boy who was 13 or 14 at the time kept insisting that I come up and stay the night.  In fact, her 2 other children got on the phone and begged to see me as well and after I spoke with them, I felt compelled to drive up there.  So I packed a bag and headed north from my house in Denver. I arrived at about 8:00pm-8: 30pm and it was cold and I was dragging butt after a long week.  The kids immediately asked me to run to 7-11 to buy firewood for the outdoor fireplace as it was going to be even colder later that night and into the early morning hours.  So I bought 3 or 4 bundles of wood for our night.  Upon our return from 7-11, we hung out for a while and planned our night and agreed that we (my friend and I) would get up around 3:00am-3: 30am to start making hot cocoa and coffee for the 4:00 am showers.  But at around 11:00pm-11: 30pm, the kids were very hyper and were not ready for bed by any means.  They asked me if we could burn one of the bundles of wood and sky watch for a while before heading to bed.  I hesitantly said yes but knew that I was fading fast and didn’t have much energy from a long week at work.  At any rate, I didn’t want to disappoint them, so we headed outside. Once we got the fire going and brought out blankets and snacks, my friend’s daughter (7 yr. old) climbed on lap to stay warm.  The 2 boys, I believe were 13 and 11 were running around singing loud and throwing things in the yard.  I was getting annoyed because I didn’t have the energy they had and I really wanted to just chill out and relax in quite and peace.  The little girl fell asleep in my lap almost immediately as she was bundled up well and was pretty warm.   About 10-15 minutes after she fell asleep, I saw a gray animal or ""something"" running in a very weird manner along the side of the fence.  Whatever it was, it used a hand as well as its legs to run and hop at the same time.  At first glance I thought it was a wild animal and as soon as I had that thought, I literally threw the girl off of me and yelled, ""What ((deleted)) was that?""   This thing moved very fast along the fence and was gone in no time at all.   My friend had her back to the ""thing"" and the boys were running wild and didn’t see anything.  I was so freaked out; I didn’t want to stay out there anymore.  I told them what I saw and they kept asking questions and so on.  Finally, I said that I was going to go inside and sleep for a while because I was getting up at 3:00am-3: 30am to make the snacks and then to watch the showers.  Plus, we needed to save some of the wood I bought.  So the boys said that they were staying downstairs to watch movies with the intention of staying awake all night.  My friend, her daughter and I went upstairs to her bedroom and we all were going to sleep together in the same bed.  After we jumped into bed, I was on one end, my friend in the middle, and her daughter was at the other end snuggled up with her mom.  I fell asleep immediately. After sleeping for a while, I woke up freezing like I have never felt before. (I have lived in Colorado my whole life and never wore coats in the winter and would only wear jackets because I am always hot).  So I pulled the blankets up to cover myself up more.  As soon as I did this, I was immediately burning up.  I threw the blankets off of me, and I was freezing again.   By this time, I woke up because my face touched my arm, which was like an ice-cube.  My eyes opened and I rolled over to see a purple light hovering below the ceiling.  I tried to focus my eyes to understand what I was seeing, but I could never really make out what it was.  It just changed shapes and was hovering about 3 or 4 inches from the ceiling, closer to my side of the bed.  I watched the thing for about 10-15 minutes before I decided to get dressed and start making the coffee and snacks. 1/3/09  At about 3:40am, I woke up my friend and told her what happened in the bedroom and she decided to get up too.  I also told her that the boys were downstairs sleeping in the livingroom with the TV still on.  I told her to look for her video camera with the infrared feature so that we can have it for the showers.   Then it occurred to me that she may want a smoke before the kids got up (they didn’t know she smoked) so we decided to smoke first before getting any cameras together.  Besides, I’m not good with any kind of camera with the exception of a cell phone camera so this was going to be all on her to set that part up. This is the part that I originally reported to this site, but I left out some stuff so I need to re-tell the story. A couple of minutes before 4:00am, we went outside to smoke.  We were out there for a short while when I saw what looked like a flock of geese flying towards us.  I pointed in the direction of where I was looking and yelled, ""Look!""   As soon as I said that, I then realized that this was not a flock of geese at all.  It was a triangular shaped object that was gray on the outside of the perimeter and on the bottom, but shiny black finish on the rest of it.   As soon as I told her to look, the thing changed direction a little and aimed its path towards us.  It was directly over us about 300-500 ft in the air and made no sound and was moving very slow.  I initially said that it was going 30-40mph, but it was going slower than that.  My friend stood there with her mouth open and totally freaked out and I started checking in with her because I thought she was going to start screaming or something.   By this time, we could see directly underneath this thing and again, it was gray, with a light at each point of the triangle, with a round ""portal"" in the center and some weird designs on the bottom.  It didn’t make a sound at all. It started moving in between her house and her neighbor’s house and I started to chase it.  When I started running after it, I knocked over the chairs on the patio and bumped the table really loud, when all of the sudden, it disappeared right in front of us.  The lights weren’t on, but something inside was illuminating the lights from within to let us know they were lights.  And it looked as though it was using our street lamps and porch lights to guide itself.  I know I said that we watched this thing for 7 seconds in the first report, but there was no way it could have been that short because of the detail we were able to extract from it.  That was one of the things that always bothered me about it my first report. It was more like 20-30 seconds. After it disappeared, we went in and woke up the boys first.  My friend said, ""That was the most amazing UFO I have ever seen.""  We started telling the kids to get up in case it came back, and because it was time for the showers.  So after we got settled in our spots, the showers came down immediately.  During the showers, we saw more UFO activity with lights flying low all over the place and doing crazy maneuvers and indescribable movements. We would keep talking about it for the next 2 hours. So at about 6:00am-6: 30am, the wood was almost gone, the winds were picking up and some light snow started to fall. I told everyone that I was going back to bed because I really didn’t sleep much and I was freezing again.  So I went upstairs to lay down in my friend’s bed again alone.  The purple light was gone this time.  At about 7:00am, my friend came in to crash too for a while.  However, at 8:30am, I got up to go to the bathroom. In the bathroom, there are lots of windows to look at onto the front yard.  When I glanced out of one of the windows, I saw a light layer of snow (about an inch high) covering the ground, with a perfect circle partly on the grass, sidewalk, and street in her front yard.  There were no tire tracks, footprints of any kind or anything else near the circle or any other place out front. It was totally untouched by humans or animals. I woke my friend up again and to show her what was out front.  She looked out the window and asked me, ""What the hell happened last night?"" I know this was a long story, but I had to go back and correct some things.  I just couldn’t keep all of this information out of this crazy experience.  I swear that I am not making this up and have witnesses to substantiate this weird night/morning.  My friend has agreed to talk to anyone about her piece of the story too.  However, we do have to keep the kids out of it for obvious reasons.  However, my friend’s children and I have experienced other UFO’s that same year, at that same house.  And there is more to tell, believe me!  But that was the most amazing UFO at that house because it was so huge.  But we do have more stories about some other cool sighting too of a smaller triangle flying 20ft above our heads 3x’s in the same night.  But that’s another story for another time.  Besides, I don’t remember the date of that one.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,40.0153,-105.1076

Some trailers were also parked near these lamps and I just plainly seen it hovering about 2.5 stories above the lamp post.  This thing was huge, i mean huge, and I trully, trully feel priviledged to see this with my own eyes and at such a close distance at that.  I'm sure about 4-5 other cars on the road must have seen it as this this was BIG!  It was just hovering above and not doing anything, no noise or wind from the craft.  Theirs a reason why psyphy depicts them as circular saucers and this one was no exeption. It looked exactly in the movies. It had 4 circular lights under it but they were not in the middle of the craft.  They were kinda grouped and at the side of the underside of the craft facing away.  They were quite weird lights as they were clearly visible but emited absolutely no kind of lights nor beams of lights.  Just hovering in the night on the side of the road from highway 401 east.  I have never been so scared in my life.  My eyes were actually tearing as i almost crashed off the road in utter amasement.  I dont know why i was crying, its almost as if my body forced it, a natural process?  It was uncontrolable.  It was a dark color of some short, maybe black/grey.  This was kinda hard to judge as it was late and hard to see, let alone driving down the highway and seeing this thing.

Do they routinely fly one after ano! ther, this was not going up, it was flying across the night sk! y, and I ’m sorry I never documented exactly when it did happen, I just know it was about 5 or 6 months ago…..would love some opinions.

That night, my girlfriend and I were sitting on their deck enjoying a romantic evening when 5-6 lights appeared maybe 35 degrees above the horizon.  At first I dismissed it thinking that it was just a group of air planes from the nearby military base, but as we watch the lights go higher in the sky they began to divide into smaller points of light and dramatically change direction.   By now we were curious, knowing that neither of us had seen anything move so quickly and precisely in the sky before.  The lights came closer and closer and were just below cloud level when all of the darting points reconvened and assumed a linear shape.  The lights were at an angle that made it impossible to tell for sure, but it looked almost like a bent line (chevron?) as it veered north. What made it so peculiar and distinctively not an airplane was the in consistency of its movement and the way the lights divided themselves.  I’ve never seen anything like it and must say that it was certainly one of the most eye opening experiences I’ve ever had. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is not indicated by the source of the report.

I kept my attention on that part of the sky. within a minute I saw it again, but this time it was more visible (brighter / slower movement). I ran to the tent and grabbed my camera. I witnessed what looked like balls of light moving in groups. these lights were a golden color and could be seen changing at a high rate between red,green,blue,and white. they faded in and out, as if they were disappearing and reappearing. some of the time they would stay in a semi-transparent state.

They seemed to be a few miles away. after taking a few pictures, they disappeared. moments later they were spotted by my friend. they were within a mile or less and where moving extremely low to the ground.

I had to make a turn into the parking lot and I lost track of the object.  I parked and got out to try and reacquire it, but no luck. I got back into the car and drove to the drive through.  After I got there and ordered, and another car pulled in behind me so I couldn't back out, I saw the object again.  This time it was closer to being overhead, slightly north and east of my position. I have to take my eye off it to pull forward.  Once I stopped, I look for the object once again.  Now I see 2 objects, the new one further west of the original. I pull forward again.  Now when I look at the objects, the new one has changed color to red. The objects are moving, but so slow I could hardly tell.  The white object seems to be moving closer to the red object.  The white object starts to circle around the red object counter clockwise, all the while closing the distance between them. I have to look away to pay for my food.  I look up very briefly after taking my food and see the white object moving away from the red one.  I sped out of the drive through to a parking space; I get out and look for the objects once again.

It appeared to stay at the same elevation during the entire observation time and just zip across the sky like a vehicle under some sort of propulsion.

I witnessed a gently pulsating (~4 Second Intervals) orange light/fireball moving due north over Tacoma, Washington at a constant angle of about 70 degrees above the western horizon.  Though I could not judge the distance or altitude well, the “apparent and relative” speed and size was like that of a landing light from a military airplane or the International Space Station at it’s brightest passing overhead.  It was noticeably brighter and slightly larger than a planet or bright star but I noted no atmospheric aberration giving the sensation that it was a small object moving by at a close distance (a few hundred feet away).  This struck me as bizarre because my logic dictated that the object, like an aircraft at that motion, should be a mile or two away.  At one point, the object began to slowly undulate and decelerated to a stop within about five seconds, then emitted an apparently solid “column” of light from the bottom.  The light column did not continue ! downward to the ground, but ceased in mid-air about two to three degrees below the object.  Also, this emitted light was shimmering with several colors (ie. Purple, green, white), and was minor in magnitude in comparison to the luminosity of the main object body and was relatively difficult to see clearly.  After about ten seconds, the light column and fireball disappeared and in it’s place began a bright white and random strobe pattern.  The object then accelerated to the north again, achieving extremely high apparent speed until it disappeared from view down near the north horizon.  (I had just enough time to run upstairs from my south side downstairs porch to see the last few seconds of it passing into the distance from my north-facing second-story kitchen window).  I also noted that the light portion of the blinking interval cycle was very fast or “instantaneous” compared with strobe lights that I had seen before this.  Total U.F.O. observation time was about two minute! s, and lastly, there was no noticeable sound coming from the o! bject th roughout the sighting.  I have lived near a major US Air Force base my entire life and have spent 34 years around many different aircraft of which I feel that I have become very familiar.  This object, which I only passively noticed far in the distance from the corner of my eye, very quickly struck me as odd and out of place.  I had a strong feeling that this object, if not a human-piloted or controlled craft, definitely exhibited signs of intelligence or intelligent control, possibly even aware of my observing it.  I was transfixed throughout the sighting and found the experience beautiful, fascinating, unsettling, and frightening.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

I am a 25 year old female.  I stayed at my sister’s apartment while my car was being fixed last week.  On Friday, I got my car out of the shop but decided to stay at my sister’s to watch movies.  However, first I wanted to come home to feed my dogs and wash clothes.  These would take some time as I live deep in the country in Arkansas, near Memphis.  It usually takes me at least 15 mins. to reach my house from my sister’s apartment. I came home around 5-5:30, during dusk, and noticed this weird shape in the sky that did not move.  I didn’t think about it for long due to the fact it was kind of far away.  I came home, did my chores, and left for my sister’s apartment.  After watching movies (2012 and Zombieland), I started for home around 1 in the morning.  As I got closer to my house, I realized there was this strange light in the sky around a field.   Once again, I didn’t really pay attention.  I thought it was a lamppost. As I rounding the third curve, I saw the light right above the field near the Waverly Gin.  This really freaked me out.  I was the only car on the road, in the country, near a field.  I thought for sure this thing was a helicopter, crop duster, you know just trying to rationalize what I was seeing.  When I got to the curve where the Gin and field were, I started to slow down.  As I slowed, I literally saw a disk like shape with one light, like a flood, search light looking-thing, and two red lights on the side.  I rolled the window down to hear, you know, if this was a helicopter or what, and I heard nothing. I seemed to be hovering over a line of trees about 100 feet away.  When I slowed down, I sat there for about 30 seconds to figure out what this thing was.  As I sat there, I started to see it coming closer to me.  I freaked out and tried to get as far away as possible from this thing.  It started to follow me and did so for about a mile.  I started to look at the clock and at the road, a little back and forth motion, to make sure I was still at the right time.  I remember the time was 1:45 the last time I looked at the clock in the car.  After I rounded curve number 5, I was no more than a few hundred feet from my house and looked in the review mirror, out the sun roof, and both side mirrors and saw nothing. When I pulled up to my house, the next thing I noticed was the neighbor’s outdoor lights didn’t come on when my dogs ran into his yard barking insanely.  So that started to weird me out.  I sat in the car for 5 mins. looking everywhere I could outside my car to see if something was around, above, behind, or anywhere near.  I got out and tried to peek above the trees to see if I could see whatever it was I had just encountered.  I saw nothing.   For the past two nights I have been freaked out whenever I drive home because whatever it was a I saw was not a plane.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,,

I live in a condo building on the 5th floor out of a 7 floor building.  My wife and I were watching television and we were engaged in conversation so I was looking her way which was in front of a window.  That is when I noticed an object come over the building and trees rather quickly.   I was looking south and the object was traveling south east.   First, I noticed the color which was very bright and green, almost like a neon green.  In my opinion I thought the light looked like a green stop light color but much more intense.  Also, the light was slightly pulsing big to small repetitions at a steady, swift rate.  Second, I noticed it didn’t have any trails like a shooting star or meteorite plus I had never seen anything like this so close .  The angle was about 25-35 degrees. Lastly, the object traveling in a perfect straight line in that approximate angle, progressively got smaller and eventually vanished (all taking place in about 5-7 seconds).  This is the first unidentified flying object that I have ever seen.  I know that it was not man made, it was just to fast and the above description makes it impossible.  It was fast but not fast enough to be a comet or some type of space rock in my opinion.  I have not been able to not come up with a logical explanation for something like this.  I immediately told my wife to look out the window, and she saw the last couple of seconds and was speechless.  Given the above characteristics makes it hard for me to come up with what it could have been.   Thank you for your time.

The object's brightness grew in intensity to a bright blue-white light and rapidly faded out as it travelled across the sky. From what I can recall (I haven't had a chance to post something until now), I believe the object was slightly below the moon at that time. I'm a casual aerospace/astronomy enthusiast and have seen lots of shooting stars before, but this seemed bigger, brighter and more prominent. It appeared to travel slightly slower than a usual shooting star as well. I don't think this was an alien spacecraft; but could it have been some space junk re-entering the atmosphere or perhaps an iridium flare? The only reason why I'm not sure about an iridium flare is because it did seem to have a flaming tail to it, but it could have been an illusion.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089
