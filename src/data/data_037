Once while stationed at Holloman AFB NM, I viewed what appeared to be very fast moving objects flying over a nearby mountain range.  It turned out to be a flock of geese.  Since NM has always been famous for unexplained sightings it is easy to wrap one's brain around that possibility.   This evening I was able to focus my binoculars on the objects I have been seeing.

I was an airplane enthusiast and modeler at the time, but UFO's were not in my vocabulary.  I had never heard the term before. One spring evening, probably late May or early June (appx. 1962-63), I went to bed at 9:00 pm which was my normal routine.  My bed was placed next to my window (which faces west) and, as usual, I would stare out into the night sky prior to falling asleep.  This time, just as I was drifting off to sleep, I saw an unusual object floating in the sky, seemingly just outside my window.  Coming fully awake, I was startled to see a large, circular red light, appx. the size and color of a traffic light as seen from about 100 ft. away, hovering at a height appx. 50-60 ft. above the ground.  On either side of the large light were two smaller red lights, about one-fourth the size of the central light, and angling upwards at about 45 degrees so that the entire object appeared V-shaped. I continued to watch the object for appx. 15 secs. at which point the following occurred; the large, central light dimmed to about half its former luminosity and the four smaller lights winked out completely leaving only the large light visible.  Appx. 2-3 secs. later, the four smaller lights reappeared only this time in a straight line, two above and two below the central light.  The smaller lights were also dimmed this time to match the brightness of the central light.  I continued to watch this arrangement for appx. 15 more secs. before the lights winked out completely. I remember that my window was open that night and at no time did I ever hear any noise from the craft nor did it change position while in view.  I also remember there being a stiff breeze that evening as evidenced by the rustling of the tall grass in the field directly behind my back yard which would seem to rule out a balloon of some kind.  I also believe that all of the lights correlated to just one object and not that all of the lights were individual objects.

I was a freshman at Hillsdale College living in a girls dorm which sat above the Arboretum.  I don't know the exact date, but it was an evening when we were all studying for midterms.  A student in a room that faced the Arboretum (actually looked over it - the tops of the trees were level with our windows) called us to her window to see a huge disc hovering over the tops of the trees.  It was metallic looking, gold, and it had a red/orange light in the center and two blue/white lights on the sides.  I assumed there was a fourth light on the side we couldn't see.  It was perhaps 75 feet across and within a hundred yards of us.  As we watched, it moved forward, then backward and eventually sideways and away from us maybe a mile or so.  It then landed in a grassy clearing. As I remember it, we called the Civil Defense, the police, and the boys' dorm.  A man from the Civil Defense came up with us to watch it.  We saw the boys run out of the dorm and down toward the object.  We also saw a police car drive toward the object.  As the boys and the car approached, the lights on the object went out.  It was not seen again. The next day, Dr. Hynek from Project Bluebook came out as did the TV and radio stations.  Oddly, I don't recall that the officials spoke to the actual observers. The sighting was labelled as marsh gas - an absurd conclusion as it there was no marsh and what we saw looked metallic and solid. Many years later I read a Reader's Digest while waiting for a plane, and saw this story reported, so there may be more information there.  I think the R.D. story was in the 80s, but it could have been the 90s. ((NUFORC Note:  The sightings by many students at Hillsdale College constitute a celebrated case.  This sighting is well described on pages 354-357 in ""The Encyclopedia of UFO's,"" written by Ronald D. Story, and published by Dolphin Books in 1980.  The section devoted to the Michigan sightings in March 1966 describe four sightings, on March 14, 17, 20, and 21, the last of which occurred near Hillsdale College, and which was witnessed, reportedly, by 87 students, as well as by Dean William Van Horn, who was the Director of Civil Defense for that college.  The object observed hovered over a nearby swamp for an estimated two hours.   We have changed the date above to March 21, in order to reflect what we know about this case.  PD))",,41.8619,-84.6038

I could see NOTHING AT ALL. The dispatcher wanted to see and he was calling me so I relived him and he went and saw the object. While I was on the desk I called the tower (Aircraft Controller) he told me that he could not see the object with his eyes but that it was on the GCA radar. I also called the radio station and the ask all the people to go out and look and see fi they could see it. There was one other fireman who was unable to see the object. That night after the sighting the firehouse was a buzz with talk and speculation but when the next day came none of these witnesses could remember it, only me and the other man who did not see the Object could remember the incident. The next day when we went back on duty  (we were on 24 and 24 off) Naval intelligence officers were there in the rec. room and they interviewing the other man who did not see the object and he was in there about an hour then it was my turn. I went in and the man ask me what did you see? So I started describing what all the other men had described and after I got all through he said again, Now what did you see? After about the third time, ""DU"" I got the message and said, ""I didn't see anything Sir"" and he said to me, ""that's right now don't forget it"". He did say to me, ""you didn't call the radio station from here did you""? I said, ""I didn't see anything"", He said, ""that's right; carry on Sailor"". The following hours that day I and the other man who did not see the UFO, we were transferred out of the fire department and on to the flight line.

Amazing object to behold! Sighting occured in Sep. of 1967 [two years before the Moon landing of Apollo-11 - I was very interested in the space-race at that time]. UFO (flying disc/saucer) seen first at a distance of about 1 mile to the north of the city. Approached/descending and came up the middle of the street in housing estate [four miles from city centre]. Hovered overhead for about 2 minutes at a height of about 20ft. Trapezium shaped window on side of the circular craft. Flying machine rotated on its axis 180 degrees and window moved to other side. It was so low that I could actually look into the craft through the window of this machine - whitish interior - nothing else observed through this window [obviously, if there was a window something could look out of it]! Sighting occured at around 10pm - twilight - craft kind-of blended into the dark sky background. Noiseless/silent. Looked like something out of a film. I was 12 years of age at the time of sighting. Amazing sight and left me with a sense of wonder at the time - flabbergasted/goggle-eyed/knew I had seen something really unusual - not from here. Also seen by my 13 year old brother who can confirm the sighting. At the time of the encounter we were out for a walk in local area. First thought the object was a plane/helicopter - bright white spotlight underneath the craft turned off as it approached. Knew immediately that it was a 'classical' typical UFO [from watching TV programmes and newspapers/magazines of the time]. Object moved/floated up the street over the tops of the houses in a southerly direction for a distance of about 150ft. After about 5 minutes the disc/object shot up into the sky at high speed. Dark metallic blue colour - very close sighting, typical UFO - very distinct as such. Looked like a flying machine from 200 to 500 years into the future. Impressive, very visual, solid-flying-machine, unmistakable as UFO and typical of the photographs that I have seen of these things. No markings on craft to identify it. Seen at very close proximity - less than 20 ft from the ground - saw the underside of the machine. Circular shape. Hovered above houses in local area - just above the roofs. At one point directly overhead. Have read extensively about the subject over the years. My personal conclusion: UFO's are real - seeing is believing. Origin: probably other dimensions. UFO's/NDE's possibly related. We are not just biological creatures but also spiritual beings. There is a bit more to the universe than science/religion tells us or would care to admit [outside their box]. Even after all these years since the sighting [39 years] I am still amazed that I saw such an object and have not personally seen anything like it since. Find it very odd that after 60 years no answer/explanation to the subject of UFO's has been forthcoming from science/religious communities.  Presently interested in astronomy [have 16-inch Newtonian telescope] & chess. Christian. The UFO enigma seems to be a conundrum/puzzle/mad-hatter's riddle - a world-wide phenomena - a question with no answer, as yet. Yes - people are seeing and photographing these objects. Many hoaxes have been reported but I think a high-percentage are geneuine reports. Billy Meier's pictures are very good [possibly real] but I think his story is off-the-wall, a diatribe which ruins his case. This testimony is geneuine, honest and true. I have no ulterior motive in reporting it [similar report also sent to Mufon website in Feb-06]and would like to remain anonymous although you may contact me privately by email if you like. Do you believe in fairies/UFO's/angels/God?  What is the sound of one hand clapping? What is the riddle of the Sphynx? Who are we/what are we? What is the nature of reality? Is there life after death? What do you think of NDE reports? Is the Ark of the Covenant under the Temple Mount? Is this the end of the age? Is the Christian story true? Are there codes embedded in the Bible text? Are crop-circles telling us something - symbolic? There are more questions than answers and the more you understand the less you know! Well, that's about it from me - I hope you find this report interesting and believable?  Just file it away with the other 1,000,000 sightings that have been reported over the years. I'm hoping that someday somebody will come up with the real answer to this phenomena and enlighten us all - a logical, lucid, rational, believalbe, provable, truthful explanation will suffice - at the moment we are living in a fog of possible solutions, bubble-geum answers with no end in sight.",,,

We then noticed a large, typical disc shaped object, silvery in color.  It made unusual movements, floated near and far within seconds, then would suddenly fly off into a direction, stop hover, and again change altitudes and direction like I have never seen since.    Within minutes several Air Force jets (?) along with a couple helicopters appeared which seemed to fly in a searching grid type pattern.

Had just gotten off of work at or just about 2:00 a.m., it is a nightly job I work 7 night's a week so I was wide awake.   When I got onto the street I was facing to the west and saw a unknown craft approximently 10-12 miles which on a compass would be WWS to SW. It looked to be on the otherside of the mountain range which is about 9500 ft. there.   Immediatly after I saw it I killed the light's on my vehicle and drove to a parking lot up the road where I could get a better view.  I watched it for about 15 minutes it would hover for a couple of minutes then move left or right a little, it had light's flashing on it that would flash in differnt repertion's of Blue, Red, Green, and White, at times all light's would stay on.  During that 15 minutes I had turned my headlight's on to take off and all light's on the craft immdiatly turned off after my light's had been on for 10 seconds,  I then drove back down the street out of view then came back with my light's off and parked again.  About a minute passed and the light's came on again on the craft.  I decided to a county road that circles around and comes back to town, the road that I took also cut's off and goes in the mountain close to where I saw it at.  As I turned off on the county the light's still flashed until a little after I topped a hill where my light's where easily seen in the sky, after that the light's never came on again on the craft.   I came home and then about 30 minutes later one fighter jet possiblly a F-18 (wingspan didn't look like a f-16 th only other jet they fly here) flew about a block or two away from my house coming from a straight from where I saw the light's.  The light's on the craft I saw that night didn't flash at the same rate it varied from somewhere of .20 - 1.0 seconds, it could of been a helicopter I couldn't see a shape because it was so far away, but there are several lavish ranches on the other side of the mountain's just about where the lights was at.  The airforce does do training flights here occasionally but I've never seen just one flying that time of night, they alway's have another jet within a couple mile radius and which there was none others that I could see.   It could not have been a star or planet in the sky as what I saw was bigger and brighter than the rest of the objects in the sky.   The Lat/Long for the general area I saw it at is 37.25'N  105.12'W, it is not a tower, the closest one to that area is about 5 miles which is a repetitor tower which has no light on it.  In my best opinion the craft was about 1000 ft above the ground based on visual referance with surrounding mountains, the town here is viturally asleep or no one comes out after 23:00 at night untill about about 6:00 in the morning. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at the star, Sirius.  It gives off vivid color, and it is very bright.

We were camping at Barview Jetty Camp ground just north of Tillamook Oregon.   Our camp was about 100 yard from the beach.   We were sitting around the campfire at about 11:00 when out of the corner of my eye I saw what looked like a bright star over the ocean.   When I turned to look at it the light grew to an enormous size and it was extremely bright.  If you were to take a nickel and hold it at arms length at about 45 deg into the sky that will give you a bit of prospective.  I said to the kids "" What the heck is that?""   As the kids turned to look, another light appeared right next to it to the right.  Not quite as big and bright as the first one but still pretty bright. Then another one, and another one and another one.   So hanging over the ocean were five balls of light that were lined up horizontally.  Then from left to right and fairly quickly they went out one by one. I’m thinking to myself let be logical about this.  It must have been a flare or something.   So we ran down to the beach to find other people standing by the ocean staring at the sky.  I immediately realized that the boats that were out off shore were very small compared to the lights we just saw and that the lights had to be at a pretty high altitude.  These were gigantic lights in the sky!   We walked up to a couple that was standing down by the water and asked them if they ad seen the light.  They said that they did and that’s why they were there.  Then the girl said that this was the second time she had seen them. She said that the first time was a few minutes earlier up north of where we were.  Just then it happened again down the beach over the jetty.  Same thing with the big bright light and the other four that followed.  It hung there for about 10 seconds and the disappeared from left to right again.  We all stood there looked at each other with no explanation.  After about 5-10 minutes my daughter noticed two faint red lights coming right towards us from straight out over the ocean.  They were very tiny and silent and they went right over the top of us inland.   We decided that they were probably air force jets at I would say about 10-15 thousand feet    Were they doing something out there or chasing something?  All I know is that the small red lights were tiny compared to the other ones.  Pretty Bizarre!  Wish I had a video camera with me.

It was similar to lightning but there was no sound and although the frequency was consistent with lightning the duraion mentioned above makes it inconsitent with normal weather patterns in this region. The lack of sound also makes it unlikley to be lightning. The light seemed to originate from an easterly direction possibly just beyond Walton Jail.

As soon as we met at the airport at 2pm, she excitedly told me, she saw something very dodgy from the plane as her flight was coming into the north eastern coastline of the UK at approx 1pm (she landed at the airport at 13:41). Just out at sea she spotted between 5 to 7 orange round objects...I have below the story in her own words...  When she told me, I checked on the Net to see if there were any other similar reports in the same region and around the same time...Needless to say, I was excited to read of the reports also coming from the east of England of multiple orange discs on the 17th, the previous day to my girlfriend's sighting. Do you know if anyone else also witnessed her sighting on the 18th September?  My Girlfriend's report...... ""On 18th September I was flying from Prague to Edinburgh. The sky got cloudy somewhere over the Netherlands. Over the Channel the clouds were a bit torn. I felt sleepy as I had to get up at 4am that morning and didn't get to sleep too well at night. And seeing just clouds became a bit boring after a while. Also my seat was at the window but near the wing, so the wing and the engine took a lot of my view. If I wanted to see something, I had to lean forward and look out of the farther window. So only occasionaly I looked out to see if we are still over the continent or over the sea or approaching Britain.  Then around 1pm (GST) I looked out again and saw we were still over the sea. There was a gap between clouds so I could see the sea. Down, deep under me I could see some round orange things. They looked like round rubber life boats on the sea. There were 7 of them. They seemed to be floating on the sea surface. They were moving slowly and then when the left most circle got into its position, I noticed that they created a perfect boomerang shaped formation. That attracted my attention. Creating the formation, they were moving quite fast for something that big on the sea. I could swear that at the beginning they were a bit scattered but now they were very much giving an impression of a single body. That perfect the formation was. I started thinking of an invisible delta aircraft and really, apart from the orange spots I couldn't see anything between them. Was it a military training? I tried to have a better look to identify what it was but suddenly there were two white clouds bursting out of two of the circles like an explosion and all the formation, like one body, moved forward with great acceleration leaving just two short white double lines behind. The lines were short, just about double the height of the triangle. As a space craft getting enough speed just from a short fire. At high speed all the formation disappeared under the cloud and I had the feeling that it wanted to hide, not to be seen. I hoped that it would come out on the other side of the large cloud before the engine and the wing cover my view, but it didn't. After the cloud I saw a ship, looked big, at least like a ferry, maybe bigger. And still the length of the ship would make only about two thirds of the side of the boomerang. And the circles were slightly bigger in diameter than the width of the ship. So the object must have been huge.  Soon after we approached the East coast of Britain and 1.40pm we were landing at the Edinburgh airport.""",2005-10-11T00:00:00,,

I was having dinner at a new aquaintance's house in Nenana, who my boyfriend at the time introduced me to and was also one of the witness's. We were having a beer and discussing UFO's, which I had brought up because of my interest in the issue.  The gentleman said that they see stuff (UFO's) all the time out in this rural area of Nenana. I asked him what all has he seen and stated that I have always been interested in viewing a siting but had not been really fortunate enough to view anything distinct. He stated that all we had to do was watch the sky outside his home and we would likely see something.  We stepped outside to prove this and as I was waiting I asked him what he had seen. He said just look up and watch the stars very closely. I said are you sure it's not a satelite because they look like stars and move steadily across the sky.  He said just watch when you find one.  So I watched, and I almost instantly saw a star moving slowly across the sky. I said ""Well thats a satelite."" He said just watch. As I was watching this star, which looked like any other star but moving like a satalite, it stopped and changed direction. It was stopped for about 5 seconds and started back in the other direction it had come, I was startled, because I thought that satelites were in orbit and they cannot move in the opposite direction back to where they had come and planes cannot just stop and change direction. The object had moved about an inch in my view then returned and stopped. I then viewed, as it was returning, another about an inch from the first star or UFO doing the same thing. I noticed it moved about the same distance and then returned to where I first viewed it. As I was watching in absolute awe I started to notice others moving and right after I started spoting all of them I saw one of them shoot like a shooting star with a short trail unlike other shooting stars I had seen before which had long trails mostly. Nevertheless it was very much like a shooting star. It could have been one but the other things continued to move about in different direction stopping and changing directions. The getleman who showed me this stated that you view this pretty much every night anytime. I have not visited since but I would be curious if someone could bring out a telescope and view these things up close. This is near a base called Clear Airforce base. I have traveled through Nenana to get to Anchorage and have never seen an entrance to this base. It is there though because my cousin lives near it and my phone bill says her phone number is at Clear Air Force base area.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,,

We were on a tour of the UFO highway in Nevada during the Columbus day long weekend where we witnessed highly maneouverable lights in the sky.  After visiting the town of Rachel, we proceeded to the famous mailbox, I forget which farm it is at. We were at least hoping to enjoy a desert sunset and evening and perhaps were hoping to maybe see something unusual.  Between 2100 and 2200 local time we witnessed an amazing display of agility by a light maneouvering over the first ridge between the mailbox and Groom Lake.  It was about as bright as the planet Venus is in the night sky. It would shoot up above the peaks and then flutter down like a feather. We were impressed when it then starting moving extremely rapidly and stopping from one end of the ridge to the other. It appeared to be covering a few miles in a matter of seconds.  What was striking was the agility of this object. Perhaps moving several hundreds of miles per hour and then reversing direction in literally the blink of an eye.  The craft would disappear behind the ridge often, for several minutes at a time and then reappear. Upon the last disappearance 3 of these objects appeared, doing the same maneouvers but not in formation.  There were 5 witnesses to this incident. All of us tourists to the area.  There was no noise associated with this sighting. No turbine, afterburner sounds etc...  Myself - I am an officer in the Canadian Forces.

So my attention was suddenly very focused. I stood there and watched what looked like a solid contrail slowly move from the northeast to the west (I think anyway, but I am not the best at direction, I use the sun to judge). I also noticed that despite the sunny day, and the position of the sun, I couldn't see a tiny shiny point at the head of the ""contrail"" like there would normally be, as the sun reflects off of the metal of a plane, because there was no plane, and what I was looking at, along with about 6 others now, was something other than a plane, or its contrail..

One night early last spring I stepped outside about 7:00 or 7:30 in the evening to look at the sky. Some storm clouds were passing through and the tail end of a fast-moving weather system was just overhead.  From my front yard I looked east and could see the dull reflection of my small town on the low moving clouds to the east.  Just then, as if travelling in this weather system, the triangular object appeared to descend from the fast-moving clouds and travelling in the same direction, as if escorting the weather system. The craft descended rapidly in north-to-south direction, then turned east, in the direction of the weather movement, at which time it disappeared from my sight.  Curious to know if others had seen the object, I called the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and reported it.

From the bottom view it had three red lights, one on the tip of the craft, and two on the back. In the middle of the bottom of the craft it had a large blue speckled light. There was also small blue lights scattered all over the bottom of the craft. And like I said it made only a small humming noise and was low to the ground. It was traveling at about 20 mph.

Two of them are a couple and the third is an old friend of mine who comes to visit me regularly. The couple decided on their second or third night visiting that they would like to go camping somewhere nearby. The boyfriend had never been to Sedona, and was taken away by its beauty. He talked the whole visit about what he wanted to see in the area while he was there and his desire to explore the metaphysical aspects to Sedona. After the couple came back from their hike that day, they were ready to go on the camping expedition. My other friend from California and I took them out to a spot we knew on a big, tall hill just outside the Village of Oak Creek near Sedona, just off of Beaverhead Flat or ""Seven Mile"" Road. My friend was tired, so she decided to stay asleep in the passenger seat of her truck, which we had used to lead the couple in their truck. It was about 2100 hours when we arrived at the campsite, I believe; I can't be sure. However, the three of us cracked a Beck's Beer each and started shooting the breeze. About an hour or hour and a half later was when the sighting occured. The couple and I were standing an equal disctance from each other around the campfire, talking. Somehow, the subject of UFOs came up in the course of conversation, and the boyfriend casually mentioned his desire to see one while in Sedona. The girlfriend confirmed, saying that he basically wouldn't shut up about it on their hike earlier in the day. No more than two minutes passed when, in the middle of a sentence while speaking to me, the girlfriend broke off and said, ""Is that a UFO?"" She didn't point, but her eyes looked so wide they were about to burst out, and she was looking directly over my shoulder. I turned around, and without skipping a beat, I said: ""Yes, it is."" The boyfriend's eyes were transfixed in the same direction, his mouth hanging open like a Looney Tunes cartoon. What I saw was just above the horizon to the West: Three lights, in a perfect triangle (I don't rightly remember the orientation), maintaining their position. The lights were brighter than any other object in the sky, even with this being a clear, starry night, but they were so far away they looked to be in space, not in the atmosphere. Immediately after confirming the girlfriend's sighting, I yelled to the boyfriend to grab the camera. ""John*, grab the camera!"" He just sat there staring. I looked back at the lights. They started to ever so slowly move over to the right; almost imperceptably. ""John*, get the f*cking camera! Now! Go!"" I yelled. He started to run around frantically, looking for the camera that he hadn't even unpacked yet, while not taking his eyes off the lights. He tripped over several objects. I knew where my friend's camera was, so I ran back to her truck, the girlfriend in tow (scared out of her wits, screaming), and threw open the driver door. The girlfriend cowered behind me. I yelled at my friend while grabbing around frantically in the dark truck for the camera. ""Sarah*! Wake up wake up! Look!"" I pointed out her window, in the direction the lights had been. She turned and looked. ""What?"" She said. ""It's gone?!"" I yelled. I looked over at the boyfriend, who was now holding his camera in his limp right arm, looking more disappointed than I've ever seen a soul. He told me what happened: ""Dude, it moved over to the right all fast, and then it was just gone."" I asked him if he got a picture, and he said he didn't find the camera in time. My friend never got to see it, but the other three of us have never seen more proof-positive evidence as to the existence of UFOs. We are all true believers now. The boyfriend kept muttering that he had had a life-changing experience, and how he would think differently about everything now. I tried to use humor to make myself feel more comfortable out in the wilderness. The girlfriend was very scared, but expressed a willingness to remain in the wilderness with her boyfriend, who was now stating his want to be abducted. And my friend was scared silly by the looks on the rest of our faces, and wanted to get out of there. We left, wishing the couple good luck on their possible abduction, and high-tailed it out of there as fast as we possibly could. We asked the couple in the morning if anything else had occured, and they said nothing after we left. I wish we had a picture, so we wouldn't sound crazy, but we'll all take a lie detector test any day.  *I changed these names.

My exact location and whereabouts are uncertain but I can at least make a general guess that i was somewhere between Bonelli Bay and the Temple Bar Marina in a cove somewhere.  As the evening drew in the drive became hard to see.  I didn't want to fall into an unseen gully nor did I want to drive over a dried tree stump and get a flat so I decided to just wait out the night.  As it started to rain i felt that the best thing was to just fall asleep in the truck with blankets over me.  I noticed as the night time creept it started to get very dark and all the crickets and bugs around my truck started to get fiercely loud and active.  I was staring into the night sky sitting behind the steering wheel when I noticed a few bright white lights in a V formation head toward my direction.  At first I thought that they were interestingly playful because they would fly together and then the leader or point light would leave the other two and head closer in towards my way.  It was obviously not an airplane because they would stop and then proceed in alternating speeds.  I had a great view of them especially because it was so dark where i was parked there were no signs of obstructive clouds in their range.  I remember it being very cold and sort of windy.  As I watched these lights come in and move out I tried to listen to them in order to determine if they were helicopters or military style aircraft.  It was very interesting to watch them move, stop and then forward heading in a direction towards the Hoover dam area or Boulder City.  Over a couple of hours these lights were playing in the midnight sky but never seemed to make any noise or any sudden moves other than great speeds as they were darting in the sky.  After a few hours there were lower flying helicopters circling the area with what had appeared to be flood lights grooming the area.  But, the helicopters were distinctly recognizable compared to the playful lights in the sky as you could hear their blades cutting through the wind.  At one time you could see a wide panoramic view of airlines on route, helicopters and these UNKNOWN solid white lights moving high and stopping in an orderly fashion as to be watching me watch them hover and dart to the west.  It also appeared as if a light would stop and then another light would break off from its original making two independent solid white lights. They were actually fun to watch.

I would say it was a baloon except for the transparent part at the bottom and the very bright white light at the very bottom. Also, if it were a balloon, how did it disappear so quickly? Even if it burst, it should have been visible falling and I did look for that. It's really too bad I couldn't have gotten a pic of it.

It brought to mind a boat ride I had taken years ago.  It was 1968 and at that time I was working for a company called Tech Center in Morton Grove, Illinois.  Tech Center was a research and development house for the Armed Forces, the aerospace industry and NASA.  There was Tech Center equipment aboard the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules, we had even designed and built our own satellites, O.A.O. II is still in orbit and operational to this day.  The people who worked at Tech Center would be considered geeks by today’s standards, we all wore plastic pocket protectors and had slide rules (pre-calculator days) strapped to our belts.  But geeks or not, one thing we did know at Tech Center, was what the military did and didn’t have in the nineteen sixty’s.  Back then I had a small Thompson cabin cruiser (remember the wooden boats with the lap strake hulls) and once every year I’d take the guys from work out fishing.  That morning in 1968 we got an early start.  We pulled out of Diversey Harbor around 3:30 a.m. and started heading north.  It was still dark.  An hour before sunrise we were trolling north, paralleling the shoreline, six miles out and twenty miles north of Chicago when the most extraordinary thing happened.  A craft flew directly over our heads.  I mean - RIGHT OVER OUR HEADS!  What first caught our attention was a mechanical humming sound behind us. All four of us in the boat simultaneously turned and looked above and behind to see what was causing it.  What we saw, was a craft in the air, 150 yards behind and slightly to port, perhaps 400 feet off the water and coming straight at us.  The craft was rapidly overtaking us, but at a very leisurely pace for an aircraft.  It was quiet, but loud enough to be heard (or perhaps felt) above the boats motor.  The craft didn’t sound like an airplane.  It didn’t whine like a jet, didn’t thump like a helicopter and it sure didn’t have propellers.  What we saw had no wings, tail or struts.  It’s fuselage was elliptical in shape with a blunted nose and tail.  It was large (but not huge), perhaps 150 feet long, 75 feet wide and 30 feet thick (like a skinny football which had been flattened out).  There were no windows or anything that resembled a cockpit.  The craft which appeared to be gray in color did not have any lights or visible markings.  It seemed to be dimly illuminated, or at least it was not as dark as the surrounding sky.  This may have been moonlight reflecting off the water.  I remember feeling the great mass of the craft as it passed above us.  Although the craft was not large in dimensions, it just felt a lot bigger than it was.  I’ve stood next to B52’s, 747’s and large Air Force cargo plans, all bigger aircraft, but without the same feeling of massiveness.  This thing above us felt as if it weighed hundreds of tons.  Although Spartan in appearance one sensed that this was some very serious machinery.  This craft had come up behind us from the south-south-west and passed directly overhead at a height of no more than 400 feet.  Without pausing, changing speed or making any correction in course it just continued on a leisurely northward heading at a speed of about fifty miles per hour until it disappeared.  And that, was that.  The four of us were just dumbfounded.  We watched it slowly disappear into the night sky, and then it was gone and we were just left staring at each other in silence.  The entire incident had lasted less than four minutes.  There wasn’t one of us who could explain what we had just seen.  Remember, we were the four geeks from Tech Center.  My friend ((name deleted)) was the first to speak what we had all been thinking,  ""If there is such a thing as flying saucers, I think we just saw one.""  No one argued with ((name deleted)).  Then we went back to fishing.  Surprisingly, we never spoke afterwards about what happened that night. You would think that we would have, but we didn’t.  I believe each of us had our own thoughts about what we had seen and we were all keeping those thoughts to ourselves.  To this day I’ve only told the story to a very few people.  Believe what you will, or call me a nut job, I know what I saw that night.  It’s been thirty five years now and even with all of our great modern technology I’ve never seen anything like it before or since.",,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

I was assigned to MMS Preload which was on the east side of the base, just south of the bomb dump. We were surrounded by revetments which we used to climb up to smoke and take a break. One night, I don't recall now the date but it was in the summer of 1968 around 1:00 a.m. while on one of these breaks someone spotted a series of lights off to the NNW. At first we thought it was returning B-52's but then someone reminded us that our returning aircraft normally came out of the North. Incoming aircraft are easily identified and this was not aircraft. It was common to see aircraft stacked one behind the other and you could normally see the landing lights. In fact, you could distinguish between a B-52 or a KC-135 by the lights. On this occasion, the lights were lined up horizontally. As I recall there were 5 to 7 lights and they held a steady position for several minutes. Then, several would not be there, only to reappear at a different location. Then several others would disappear and join the others. The lights appeared stationary other than when they would go off only to reappear. This pattern continued for about 20 minutes. We had a base telephone mounted on a tree and one of the guys ran to the phone and asked the operator to connect him to the tower which was done. The person in the tower said they had no incoming aircraft, did not have anything on radar, and thought we might be seeing things. We were seeing things, these strange lights. Others on base saw them and several inquiries were made but no explanation was ever provided. This has haunted me for over 35 years and to this day I have no explanation other than IT WAS NOT AIRCRAFT. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",,,

It showed three lights at the top and four at the bottom in a trapezoid shape, with a trailing colored glow at the rear. It changed altitude, up and down, as it flew beside us.  A query to air traffic Control (USAF) resulted in no radar contact in the area.   As we descended to 6,500 the object descended with us in formation.

The object had been there for about five minutes as I had been watching it during my walk home. What attracted me initially was the fact it was pulsating sort of a cherry red to light mauve or soft purple color.  I went into the house and got my binoculars and we watched with the glasses for about ten more minutes, suddenly it sped off to the Northwest, there is a large 1200 meter hill or mountain close by, just as it appeared that it was going to hit the mountain it suddenly made a right angle turn and shot straight up and disappeared.  We stood around for another ten or fifteen minutes talking about what we had seen and then dispersed.  Two days later there was a report in the Victoria newspaper of a sighting by a gentleman living in an area some 7 miles to the north, he claimed the ""object"" was over Duncan. The interesting thing is that directly between this gentleman's locale and Duncan, there is a hydro station that draws DC current from the mainland and converts it back into AC current for distribution to Lake Cowichan areas. This object had to be positioned directly above these transmission line. It is our theory (and it is only a theory) that the ""object"" required some form of electrical energy for propulsion.

As everybody was talking and saying goodby I started watching the western sky and saw what I thought was a plane moving north along the western horizon. At first I didn't think much about and watch it move slowly along. I had moved away from where my family was at the time and kept watching this so called plane. The it did something very strange. It stop dead, right in the middle of the sky. Then it started to move high but straight toward our house. It was very high in the sky. Like the hight of a jet. Then it just stop again and started moving in another direction. It kept stoping and moving and I knew that it wasn't a plane or a satelite. Then it just blink out of site. For a moment I look around the sky and there it was again. To describe how far it had moved in less then 10-15 seconds would be like looking at the hands of a clock and watch the big hand move from 9:00 t0 3:00 in a blink of an eye. It did this several times and when I went to tell my family it was gone. I had to have watching this object at least 10 mins or more.

And it seems to coincide with a report on the same day from Princess Anne which is due West-South-West of Ocean City, MD.  I would have been 11 in June of 1970, my birthday being August 17, 1958.  I saw a fast moving object in the North Sky, at an elevation of between 45 and 60 degrees.  It was nothing more to me than a bright light, but what struck me was its speed and dissimilar shape to that of surrounding stars.  To me, an Amateur Astronomer, it appeared that if all the surrounding stars were between magnitude 5 to 8 this object was closer in magnitude to 3 to 1.  It was that stark in the night sky, and I have to tell you 1970 was a time in Ocean City when light-pollution was not a problem.  Often during the summer months one could easily see the bright belt of the Milky Way tracing across the sky at about 12 o'clock high.  This object traversed almost straight across the sky, as I said at a high velocity, but suddenly it turn north, and began to sink slightly and veer off to the left.  Then all of a sudden it was gone.  Needless to say I was dumb-founded, and terrified at the same time.  I would not tell anyone of what I saw out of fear of being ridiculed as a kid with a very active imagination.  My guess is that the event sighting in Princess Anne was to do surveillence over the Wallops Island NASA facility, and the sighting I made might have been the same craft or another one altogether.  I surmise it was doing surveillence at Dover AFB, which is relative to the direction I reported seeing the craft traverse the night sky.  I cannot begin to tell you how much this sighting upset, but it did, I was more scared at what I saw than I was excited, and for years I wondered if anyone else saw the same or similar events.  I came to your site after seeing it the ABC News Special Report on UFOs which aired this evening (24 FEB 2005) and when I researched your database for Maryland sightings I was shocked to find something similar occured in Princess Anne at about the same time.  To me, this is no mere coincidence, for I am certain that what I saw that night WAS NOT a star, nor a meteor, nor a comet, its path of progress across the sky was too varied an the turn that it made to the north, which was abrupt, does not coincide with any natural law pertaining to heavenly bodies.

At first the lights looked like aircraft, but they moved in an erratic manner and continually appeared and dissapeared near the main object.   I got my video camera and zoomed in as far as I could and noticed the object was strangely textured and when I was zoomed all the way in it semed to retreat until I could no longer make out the texture.  We watched this go on for several hours and saw what appeared to be dozens of aircraft moving around in the sky at very low altitudes.  Some would appear to stop suddenly and change direction.  After going inside our house to change tape in the camera the object was gone entirely along with all of the various aircraft.

It had an irregular shape at first which made it diffiult to conclude what it was.  It reminded me of a windsock.  Wide on one end and a tail like wavy thing on the other end.  It seemed to glow from within and it was huge and high.  Much too large and high to be a wind sock.   We took a right onto Aviation Road (traveling East)and saw it again briefly.

This HUGE ROUND GLOWING thing that seemed to be moving away at a remarkable speed.  It looked like something was partially covering it, maybe clouds.

My wife and I spotted a very BRIGHT circular object, as we were pulling out of the driveway to our home starting at approximately 1900 hrs.  The object was very high in the sky, at approximately 10-20 thousand feet.  It appeared to be hovering or ""orbiting"" in the same spot.  This object was bright light yellow to white in color.  Initially I thought it might have been a planet such as Mars or Venus.  However, after observing it, I ascertained that it was way too large, and bright to be either planet.  It appeared to be a big around as a Quarter turned on its side.  The object was hovering over an area approximately South, Southeast from my vicinity (Sharkey), and it appeared as though it were over Montgomery County (Mt. Sterling).  As my wife and I turned out of the subdivision where we live, and traveled south on KY 801 towards the community of Farmers, we could see this object with no problem whatsoever.  We just kept looking at(not a good thing to do while driving) it and when I arrived approximately 1/4 mile North of the West bound on ramp to Interstate 64, I decided to pull over to the side of the road.  We continued to sit and watch in amazement, while this large object remained stationary in approximately the same place.  I am a very methodical and logical man, and so I decided to rule out ALL possible explanations.  As I mentioned earlier, I ruled out a star, or planet, as it was too large and too bright to be either.  I then ruled out a fixed wing aircraft, as it had NO strobes, or beacons.  I also ruled out a fixed wing AC with a landing light on, as it never left the altitude OR heading to proceed to base, and would not have been able to hover.  I then ruled out rotary winged aircraft, using a spotlight, as it was too high to have used one effectively for ground searches.  Lastly, the object stayed this way for at least 15 minutes, after which, we decided to proceed on our way.  However, it was in the sky at least another 15 minutes, as my wife continued to monitor it after we turned East onto US 60 towards Morehead.  Once we arrived at approximately Big Perry, we could no longer see the object, due to the vegetation and elevation.  Unfortunately my wife FORGOT that she had her digital camera with us, and didn't take a few photo's.  Coincidentally, we arrived back on KY 801 about 30 minutes later, after traveling West on I-64, and saw no trace of this ""light in the sky"", ruling out virtually ALL possiblity that we saw a planet or star earlier.

When the planes came up to the sky, that’s when things got really interesting.  When the planes came from the western sky, one of them went over the middle object since they were in the original spot from where I first saw them.  When the plane went over the middle object, I lost track of the plane since I was focused on what the light was.  I'm not even sure what happened to the other plane, but I'm sure both of them just took off.  But, when the planes came to where the objects were, the objects started traveling north towards my apartment.  I thought nothing of it since I thought it was a plane coming this way since there were two planes that came to the sky.  So I was going to wash my dishes but I noticed that when the first object was coming towards my apartments, I got a bit nervous. The first object had a bright yellow light in front of it and it looked like a plane coming since it had two red lights blinking on the sides of it.  But when that went past my building, I started to clean my dishes. However, when the second object came by I ran to my other window because this object just took over the night sky.  From my 2nd bedroom window, I noticed that it had a yellow light towards the front, followed by red lights that were in a pattern on the side of the object, then when I was beginning to lose sight of the object I ran to my other bedroom and I noticed that the second object was traveling upwards and I saw a bright yellow light on the bottom of this object.  I lost track of this object since it continued traveling northward.  I am not exactly sure how far apart these red lights were on the side of the object but since the object was very close to my apartment and it appeared to be over the residential area that was a little bit westward, I knew it was to low to be a plane.  Not to mention the fact that both of these objects made absolutely no sound.   But, back to the lights, there were only red lights on the side of the object and this was nothing that looked like a plane.  There was no wing shaped object on this craft, the lights were lined up in a straight line.

Well, it moved over my head very fast, faster than a plane or a helicopter but maybe less than half the speed of a meteor in the sky, and once it got to about 2 to 3 o'clock in the western horizon, the globes disappeared but made a final birdlike sound about a 1/2 second after it disappeared.

While walking in a northwesterly direction on Lloyd Road (see map) I saw what appeared to be an airplane with its landing lights on approaching me just above a house on Cheyney Road. I was startled because there seemed to be at least six or seven very bright white lights in a row. I had never before seen so many landing lights on a plane, there are usually only two, maybe three or four at the most. We live along one of the approaches to Philadelphia International Airport (about five miles SW of us) so I have seen many planes approaching with their lights on. I looked at the lights for a few seconds, there was no sound of a plane, only the wind blowing. Suddenly the area around all the lights turned a bright red/orange, sort of a flattened oval shape. Where the white lights had been, the red/orange color was brighter than the rest of the object. The color was very intense and reminded me of the intense type of color that you get from a welders torch, only it was an intense red/orange and not blue. The object then began to move sideways (easterly) and at that instant it turned into a white color again, turned and moved extremely fast away from me in a north easterly direction and quickly vanished in the distance. The whole event lasted about 15 or 20 seconds.  I never told anyone of this event but after seeing a television story about the January 2000 object near East Saint Louis, it reminded me of this event because the lights in a row seemed to similar to what I had seen.

Besides we fly airplanes not sausers I was a 17 year old young man when I had my encounter. I lived in Fremont Ca. It was a hot August day in 1977. I wanted to get out of the house, so I called up couple of girl that I knew and asked them if they wanted to go for a ride. They said yes. So I went and picked them up. I decided to take them to a place where I knew about. It was outside of Pleasenton Ca.  There was a abby where these monks lived. These monks had painted a bridge. It was done in different seens. They were seens from 1776 thru 1976. They were very beutiful, and I knew it would impress the girls. So I took the girls there and they were impressed. When we were done we drove to the end of the road. Theres a parking lot over looking a small lake. I shut off my motor and got some beers out of the trunk of my car. When I got back into the car I gave the girls a beer and cracked one open for myself. As soon as I looked back up, there it was. I couldn't beleive what I was seeing. It was a disk flying like nothing I'd ever seen. I grew up flying with my friends dad. We got to fly once a month. So the first thing I noticed was there was no sound. This disk was changing colors and had a haze around it. It was hovering over the far end of the lake and then it would fly off. When it flew off it was at about a 45 degree angle. It seem to go around ten miles away. then in a blink of an eye, it was back over the lake. I apeared to change shapes right before my eyes. I couldn't understand what I was seeing. Needless to say, I was scared ((word deleted)). I wanted to look over at the girls and see if they were looking, but I was afraid it would fly away. So I didn't look over. I just asked them if they were seeing what I was seeing, and they replied I hope so. I asked them if they were seeing a flying sauser. They said yes. That really scared me too. I think part of me was hoping they weren't seeing this flying sauser. My brain was working overtime. I had never seen anything like it before so I didn't know what to do. As I kept watching this sauser it was flying back and forth around the lake. Then another sauser appeared. About 1 min. later a third sauser appeared. It was really stange, it was like they just appeared. We watched them for about another min. then one of the suaser flew right over to where we were parked. It stopped around 50 yards from us. Now it was hovering right in front of us. I was trying to move but couldn't. I was frozen with fright. We were looking right at them, and I felt like they were looking right at us at us. It felt like an hour, but was only about 15 sec. Then it flew over to west end of the lake. We watched them for a couple of more min.s. I not sure what they were doing there. But when they finally left it was the most amazing thing. All three sausers flew of to the west. they flew around 5 miles at a 45 degree angle. Now this is a little hard to exsplain. But they all three seem to fly in the same spot, and then they flew off as 1 sauser. It left a trail when it left. When it left it was so fast, it looked like a shooting star. I've seen the trooth flying aroud out there. I'm now 46 years old. And I'll never forget what I saw. At the time in 1977, the girls and myself decided to sware secretsy. We were afraid if anyone found out what we saw, they would think we were crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2006-03-11T00:00:00,,

I proceeded up the road and when I got to where the light basically was coming from there was no light present, I looked arond in curiousity and discoverd an object the size of a house hovering about fifty feet in the air, It was basically a half moon and visability was good, this object was very dark and large, there were no lights on and it made no noise what so ever. I parked my car in the middle of the road and left it running with the lights on hoping someone would come down the road to witness this as well. I stood still in one spot staring at this object for about 5 min fearing what it would be capable of doing. I looked around and saw a house that had it's lights on so I ran over to it and knocked on the door, I waited for a couple of minutes but nobody answerd, I ran back to where my car was and the object was still there. I became so scared I jumped in my car and drove off quickly, as I went to the stop sign at the end of the road I looked up and the object had followed me all the way down the road, I turned to the left and saw the object was still following me, I floored the gas and never looked back again, it took me over a month to tell anyone else but eventually I told my parents, we ended up moving to an area basically right where this event occured and a neighbor saw the same thing almost one year to date later, she described the exact same event I witnessed.",2006-03-11T00:00:00,41.79,-72.8735

I said ""WHAT is That!?!"", the other person turned around, saw it and was unsure themselves...this all happened in a matter of seconds and then , it seemed to just disappear.  The object was definately low , though, not low enough to get a detailed description.  I shared this information with my family and then, nearly one week later , my husband and I were outside and he noticed something amidst the tops of the trees, over the St. Johns River..I saw him looking, but just disregarded it and he asked me to come over and look, but by that time it was gone .  He described to me nearly exactly what I saw, only , his description had it closer to the ground with a center light as well...I did not see a center light on the first occasion. He said it moved extremely slow and , then, after disappearing behind trees, he no longer saw it.  We remember these experiences QUITE well because neither of us have ever experienced this type of thing before and we know of no Military Aircraft that fit this description and just disappear, it seems , into thin air. This also happened just before and right after our youngest son's birthday, so , that makes the dates easy to remember. We have been looking for it again , yet, have had no luck.

I am a university student who lives in Canberra, Australia and i don't really have much of a fascination with ufo's or space.  On a saturday night my friend and i arrived at another friends house to watch some movies. After knocking on the door i realised i had left my car lights on so i went back to my car which was parked out by the road. It was a very clear night and the sky in Canberra is great for a star gazer because it is a small city thus their is little glow in the night sky from buildings or city lights. As i walked over to my car i looked into the sky and directly north i saw what i initially thought was a satellite. I have seen many satellites before but this one appeared to be a little different. It was moving at a slow pace and in a straight line from right to left in the sky, it was a whitish/yellowish colour and it had no flashing lights apparent. The difference between this satellite to others i have seen before was that instead of maintaining a smooth trajectory the object seemed to be slightly bobbing up and down. I knew this was strange for a satellite so i kept watching. The objects trajectory then changed and it looked like it was moving downwards rather than in its straight line. It did this for about 30 seconds and then the object stopped and was sitting stationary in the sky.  My friend then came outside and i called him over to look at the object. We looked at for about 1 minute as it sat still and then to my amazement the object began flying from left to right back which meant it was flying back at a slow pace in the opposite direction as to when i first saw it. My friend and i watched the object fly for about 1 minute until it stopped again. It stayed stationary for about 2 minutes then simply disappered to my friend's and my own amazement.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,,

On Friday afternoon (~6:15 P.M.) Nov. 05, 1999 I was playing with my dog in the backyard of my home in Santa Clara, CA. which is directly behind Paramounts Great America Theme Park.  There were light partial clouds that day and no fog, so any aircraft was clearly visible.  Seeing aircraft on a continuous basis to and from San Jose International Airport and Moffett Field was common at that locale.   This evening I noticed the incoming flight patterns of the P3 Orion naval aircraft from Moffett Field.  The planes appeared to approach from the north, then turned west toward the air field (from my perspective).  They would first appear to be small twinkling lights, then as they got closer, of course, they would finally take the shape of an airplane.   Then, suddenly, I noticed one of them appeared to be tumbling from the sky?!   I ran to the fence and thought to myself, Jesus that plane is going to crash!  I'm actually going to witness a plane crash!  But as it got closer it looked like it was diamond shaped?   Then it shape shifted into what appeared to be a slow moving metalic colored dominoe moving southbound in the north sky!  What...in...the...hell...?!  I lost sight of it as it passed behind my neighbors roof.  I rubbed my eyes in disbelief and shook my head violently!  I thought to myself, okay I am not crazy, when this thing reappears from the other side of the roof it's going to be a Boing passenger liner on it's way to San Jose Airport.  Much to my surprise, when it reappeared it was, in fact, a gigantic wingless craft cruising as slow as you please right over the Bay Area!!  AAAAAh, it's happening, we're being invaded by aliens!!!!!   I ran frantically screaming into my front yard trying to direct anyone's attention to this craft.  My mother, niece, grand-nephew, friend (a former nuclear powered submarine pilot), and four of my neighbor's (one of which was a retired senior engineer from Lockeed Martin) came outside to see what I was yelling about.   Then, in disbelief, we all watched this UFO perform some of the most amazing arial maneuvers I've ever seen with my own eyes!  First, as it was moving in a southernly direction, it made an immediate 90 degree turn west.  No banking, no arch, I mean on a dime!  Then, it suddenly ascended, glowing orange as it rose!  I thought aloud, ""look a plasma, it's striking a plasma!""  My neighbor, Mr. C replied, ""no, it's catching the tangent rays of the sun.""  I asked, ""How big is this thing, a couple, or a few football stadiums maybe?""  Wild eyed, Mr. C replied, ""No, much much bigger...like maybe half the size of the Bay Area?!...I don't know?!""   Then it made a series of zig-zag and square moves which took our breath away, but the most spectacular move was it's northernly directional shot accross the sky!  It flew so fast that visually it seemed to elongate, or stretch like a rubber band accross the sky to an abrupt stop!   Then, from it's north easternly point in the sky it ascended at a very fast rate until it appeared to be a star in the early evening sky.  It stayed at that point in the heavens for several hours until it just disappeared (~03:00 a.m.).   Unfortunately, we were all so shocked we didn't have the presence of mind to get a camera or camcorder.  No calls to the authorities were made either.   For weeks I looked through the San Jose Mecury News paper and watched the televised news reports for anything related to the event that I and my family members and neighbors witnessed.  Nothing.   I've watched programs on UFO's and read countless testamonial from eye witness accounts of similar such events, but nothing related to that particular event on that particular day.  It amazes me that something like that over such a heavily concentrated population center never made it to the media.   I still don't know what we saw on that day, but I couldn't keep this to myself any longer.   That is why I purposely looked for this web-site to report this event.  I'm sorry it took me so long.

I used to keep my window open before it got really hot.  I live by train tracks (not too close, but close enough), and by leaving the window open, I could hear trains, any sort of cars, animals, anything.  I was on the Internet and watching tv, I also had a fan on, yet I heard this really loud noise, like an airplane was flying over.  My town has a population of about 25-30k, and the only airport we have is municipal..I've lived here for about 13 years, and I've never once heard/seen an airplane in this town.  Anyways, I looked outside, and I see this craft.  It's triangle shaped, has three huge bright white lights on each corner, a small red light and small green light by the back left white light (one of the points was guiding), and what I think was a small white/purple light by the back right white light (I tried to adjust my eyes to see if it was a light or just glare..I wear no contacts or glasses and have perfect vision).  The small red light flashed about every second or second and a half, and the green flashed the same, except twice as fast.  This made me wonder if it was a plane.  I'm an avid believer of UFOs, but I'm always open to explanations.  I drew a recreation (in MS Paint) of what I saw: http://ballz.ababa.net/exetergirl/ufo3.txt  When I saw the craft, it seemed 2D in the sky, and it was pretty far away, and diagonal from where I was watching it.  I'm not good with figuring out distances and how big things can be depending on how close/far they are, but this seemed pretty big and pretty high up, not just above the tree tops, but not right below the clouds, it seemed about in the middle.  I can't really discern how big it was, it could have been about the size of a plane, but it seemed like at that height, it would be bigger than a plane at the same height.  I could distinctly see the shape of the craft.  It was an equilateral triangle with rounded off corners, and it looked like a silhouette.  It was bright out (a full moon just a couple days before), and it was also a clear night.  The triangle looked like it was just a piece of shaped paper flying through the sky..like I said before it was 2D, and I couldn't see anything like engines or any other objects on it.  All I saw was the silhouette of a perfect equilateral triangle, as if it had lights on top or on the side.  This was the second time I've seen it.  The first time I saw it was with two other people in July/August of 2003.  The '03 craft looked exactly the same, but it was going E/NE, while the '05 triangle was traveling N/NW.  The closest military base that I know of is in Davenport, Iowa (about three hours away, I believe), and it would seem a bit odd to me if it was an airplane or military craft.  I don't remember if any sort of magnetic or electrical effects happen, but I do remember both of my cats ""freaking out"" right before I saw it.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,41.0387,-92.35789999999999

I did think it was strange that jets were out flying at that time of night. Then I saw further in the sky, towards the west something floating down like the way a feather would float down and it was in the shape of an oval or a pringles potato chip ( i know that sounds strange, but thats what it looked like to me) and it was coming down really slowly, going back and forth as it came down and as I tried to study it more closely and focus on it, it appeared to have some kind of a pattern on it, to me it looked like some kind of flower and it was white background and the flower looking thing was either lights  or some other kind of shiny material, I couldn't tell.  Then it went too low and I lost sight of it because it went below the trees.  It must have came down somewhere out over the ocean is all I could of where it went.  When I got past the trees finally and could see the ocean I didnt see anything out there, besides it was dark outside, too, and I didnt see any kind of lights out on the ocean in the direction I thought the object must have gone down.  Then as I was standing there at the end of the park looking out at the ocean a object about the size of a helicopter, maybe bigger I couldnt tell cause the object was so well blended into the night sky, this object flew right over the tree tops in the park, and I mean right above them, it made no sound at all, the only reason why I noticed it was the fact that I had been looking up at the sky to see if there was anything else.   This object had a couple of little red lights on the bottom of it which also caught my eye.  It was flying over the park heading out over the ocean in the direction that I thought the other object must have gone down.

We watched it on and off until it was out of sight. We talked about it a bit until we reached our destination. On our way home later that evening, there it was again, we were on a dark stretch of road with trees on both sides and I told my wife I had to stop and see if I could get a better look.  I got out of the car and was searching for the sphere, all of a sudden an enormous object appeared directly over my head, it made no sound and seemed to be not too high over the trees. My guess is that the craft was about 100 feet or so in diameter, it cast a bright red glow which covered the entire area we were in, as I looked up under this thing I could see three spoke-like features, they looked like they might be a silver tone with a red glow reflecting off them, the rest of the underside was very dark with a reddish look. I later thought that the under side of this thing reminded me of an Automobile steering wheel with the spokes angled either upward or downward, witch way I couldn't determine; but it was fascinating. My wife began to yell at me to get in the car, that broke my fascination and I jumped in the car which was still running and sped away, as I looked in the rear view I could see the red glow and all of a sudden the thing just flicked away. Except for a few friends, I never reported what we saw. At the time people who reported such things were considered loony, so why bother, nobody would believe us anyway.  I am always looking to see if anyone else has ever seen an object like that one, but haven't heard of anyone yet. Has anyone ever reported such an object to you people?

It was a camp in the hilly, wooded area of southern Indiana. We had just put the campers to bed in the 6 cabins and 7 of us counselors (ages 17-23) were sitting on the bathhouse steps talking quietly, as we did every night for an hour or so after the kids went to bed. We could see all 6 cabin doors from the bathhouse steps and a wooded hill rose behind the cabins. Off to our left and on a small hill (in the mowed area of the camp) was the camp owner's ranch house. Suddenly a ham-can shaped flying object came over the hill behind the cabins and flew past us to stop and hover over the owner's house. It was about the size of the house and it had white-yellow lights running around the side of the ""ham can"". We were all shocked and we stood up and grabbed each other, asking what we should do. Two of the female counselors and one of the male counselors started crying and we were all talking at once. The craft hovered silently over the house for maybe 30m seconds. Then it rose up in the air and then zipped at an amazing speed back where it came from, over the hill behind the cabins. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

A friend and I were driving out of Gering, NE southbound approximately 3 - 5 miles south of the Wildcat Hills in the winter of 1972.  There may still be a windmill on the east side of the road that marks the place where this sighting occured.  We were on our way to a get-together out in the ""boonies"" at a friend's parents' ranch.  It was very cold & there were clouds of an impending snowstorm in the area.  As we drove south, we saw a very bright light moving at a very rapid pace from south east toward the west. At first we thought it might be a low flying jet, (under the level of the clouds)but then noted there weren't any blinking ""airplane lights"".  I pulled the car over on the side of the road to watch. In an instant the craft stopped in the sky (west of highway) & remained stationary for maybe 10 seconds.  It then streaked eastward, moving faster than when we originally spotted it, hovered momentarily again & then streaked back to the general area it first hovered in. After again hovering for maybe 10 seconds, a bright and wide beam of light shot down from the object toward the ground.  We could not see where the beam hit the ground because there are hills toward that direction at that point of the highway. We were pretty alarmed.  Then the beam shut off and just a few seconds later the object disappeared, reducing in size until gone, as if it had accelerated toward space (didn't move left or right/up or down).  My reaction as driver was to get the H out of there.  I looked down as I put the car in gear & the instrument panel on the dash indicated my car was overheated.  I turned the engine off & popped the hood to check the radiator, with intentions of going to the windmill's stock tank for water. Upon inspection, there was no indication the radiator was overheating; I loosened the radiator cap to check.  Got back in the car & the gauge was reading normal.  The entire event was very disconcerting.  By the way, it may be unrelated but the stretch of road between Gering & Kimball had a number of underground nuclear missle silos located there.

I was sent from my hometown of Christchurch to the North Island to the town/now city of Dannevirke to spend a year boarding at the High School. I was in the B dormitory with nine others, it was late and we were talking quietly as you do. My bed was at the far end of the room I got up and was sitting on the ground next to a friend. I was sitting on the inner sill talking when I looked out the window, it was quite interesting I saw a bright blue light that shifted colours over a long period with smaller light glowing at its side/bottom (it was just outstanding and quite beautiful in clarity) above what would have been to me the main road of Dannevirke I can say this as it was a beautiful clear crisp night. I sat and watched for about 5 minutes while up to 10 at a time in about 30 second intervals other coloured lights came and went to the big blue light. Please remember I was 12 and no impression of anything was in my mind about what I saw, it was just lights going to a bigger blue light. I whispered to everyone to come look. We sat there for about half an hour watching the lights go back and forth, we saw by the way the light got smaller and bigger as they went to the big light that we could judge a distance and we agreed that it was about where I said, that would put it about 1 mile away and perhaps half a mile in the air. The teacher patrolling the dormitories came in and was quite angry we were all out of our beds. We showed him the lights but were to scared to say any more, he watched for about one minute then pulled the curtains and sent us to bed. I had never seen anything before this and never since. I run my own computer repair company here in Christchurch, happily married with a 22 year old daughter who has just become an accountant. I just typed in google ""ufo"" and found this site, I will not be posting again anywhere and I am not interested in any way about ufo's. We are a Christian family and I have no conflict of what I saw. I just say it as I saw it and form no conclusions at all about it. I see it in my minds eye as clear as that night still. It was interesting. If I can add : This happening would have been seen by a lot of people and I would think it would have been noted somewhere so if you find any information from the night please post or email me if you would be so kind.

There was no movement as an aircraft would behave. I know the aircraft traffic patterns in our location and this was way out of those normal patterns and very low.  It had no defining navigation lights.  It had a very odd shape.  It seemed to change shape.   The illumination coming from the object was very aura like.

I was driving north on Highway 4 towards Mechanicsburg, Ohio.  I was on my way to work at ((deleted)) plant in Marysville, Ohio. The time was about 6:25 AM. I was about three miles out of town before I entered the city limits when I spotted a round light in the north east.  I could also barely see the colors of the morning rising sun in the east, but the sun was still way below the horizon. The light I seen was not a star.  I am familiar with what the planet Venus looks like on certain mornings, and this light was not the planet Venus. I'm not sure how far or close it was to me, but if I was to hold out my arm, the object would seem to be about the size of a pea between my fingers. What caught my attention with this object is rather than having a flashing strobe light like most airplane lights, this light was pulsating. It faded in and then faded out continuously. ( the speed of the fading in and out was no faster the the second hand of a clock ticking away.)  As far as I could tell, the light did not seem like it was moving in the sky, I can't be sure of this though as I was driving at the time of the sighting. The color of the light was white. There was only one light, not two or three like an airplane. I observed the pulsating light for about thirty seconds as I drove along the highway curves, the light occasionly was obscured by trees as I was driving, and when I came through the trees into another clear shot view of the sky the light wasn't there anymore. I didn't think much of what I saw, telling myself maybe it was a helicopter light, as I am not familiar with helicopter lights...maybe they have just one light that pulsates and fades in and out. About a minute or so later I spotted the light again in the same spot in the distance...although, this time the light was not pulsating. It was a constant white light, no fading in or out. It also appeared to be stationary and not moving....I asked myself what this could be and I tried to observe it as much as I could while driving and trying to keep my car on the highway. I observed the light for about another thirty seconds while it was constantly ""on"". I looked away just for a split second and then when I looked back the light had disappeared.I thought that maybe if it was a helicopter, it could have turned and the light would no longer be visible in my direction, but I closely observed the area where I had seen the light, and I did not see anything at all, no side view of a light, or no back view of an aircraft,it was as if the light had just disappeared into thin air.

No shape was discernable, though it was not point-like. it seemed to have planet-like girth.  I know the night sky well and for a brief second thought it could be Polaris (was in the same general direction) but it was still too light out and no other stars were visible.  When it vanished, I knew something unusual was up.  It was not moving like a satellite, though I cannot rule out a large geo-synchronous object of some sort (ISS?) This could be checked I suppose.  It seemed to be lower than a star.  I can't say that for sure of course, but it appeared ""inside"" the atmosphere.  I do not have the ability to judge altitude.  The sky was perfectly clear and a few planes flew near it but made no approach.  After it disappeared, an old bomber looking plane flew over.  That was unusual but may have no bearing whatsoever on the sighting.  For the record, it was NOT Venus or any other planet.  Wrong side of the sky, way outside the orbital plane.

The first object had a bright yellow light in front of it and it looked like a plane coming since it had two red lights blinking on the sides of it.

I lost track of this object since it continued traveling northward.  I am not exactly sure how far apart these red lights were on the side of the object but since the object was very close to my apartment and it appeared to be over the residential area that was a little bit westward, I knew it was to low to be a plane.

I was sitting at my kitchen table around 3:00pm on a summer afternoon (we live in a rural farming area)and I happened to look out the window only to see a very large dark pointed object flying towards my house, from south-westerly direction. The craft flew very slowly just above the trees. As the craft moved across the treeline, it but did not create any air turbulence - neither the trees nor leaves moved. It made no sound and moved very very slowly over my house.  My daughter and I ran out onto the side gallery and looked up at the object which proceeded over our heads in an easterly direction. Again, it made no sound and I felt no air turbulence. As the nose of the craft moved over the front of the house, we had time to run to the rear side gallery and watch the last 1/3 of the craft pass overhead  (our house is approximately 45 feet wide).  The width of the craft, I would roughly estimate to be about 200 to 250 feet wide, maybe more. The wing span ran from our road to our barn, which is approximately 2 telephone poles wide(100' between poles). I would estimate it took approximately 7-8 seconds for the last 1/3 of the plane to fly completely by.  The craft was a huge triangle. The color was a dark greenish black. It look liked it was made of plastic. I don't remember any lights or windows, but I distinctly recall that the underside of the craft was comprised of  very large tubing (same color as the craft but the pipes looked like large plastic sewer pipes (running back and forth..(south/north) across it's underside.  I must tell you however, the Plattsburgh Airforce Base was in operation at the time and someone in Howick ( a neighbouring town) also reported an incident and my daughter does not recall the sighting.

There had been sightings of lights and objects reported on the news at the local San Jose Airport. Even some friends were talking about the sitings. The next night after friends wer etalking we were sitting in a friends car outside of his house listening to the radio when we saw what appeared to be 3 lights go down behind the houses in the horizon. We both freaked and immediately drove in that direction but did not find anything and blew it of. A couple nights later we again were siting in the car but this time facing north listening to the radio when we saw a bright orange light approaching us. It appeared to be flying very low. My friend said it was a helicopter. Then all of a sudden it began to move back and forth eradictly. We both jumped out of the car as it flew directly overhead. It dimmed its lights and sat there motionless and silent overhead. It slowly turned off its lights and hovered above us. You could see all the detail of the ship. It had an observaton deck on the side and you could see inside a window and I noticed objects moving inside but could not make out any details other then something inside. The craft was probably about 1000 feet in the air. I would estimate that it was about 100 feet long. You could see dark burned looking edges on the craft. It was shaped like a cigar and had half domes in the back side of the craft that spun like gyros. In these gyros there was red and green lights. When the craft departed the gyros began to spin and the craft moved faster as the gyros spun. By this time my friend ran into the house to tell his parents while I just stood there staring. It finally took off and was instantly gone leaving a trail like Star trek. I was obviously freaked out. My friend ran out of the house and explained that his mom and dad were in the house watching the news as they were explaing that peopel were at the airport waiting to see the lights that were spotted the night before. We called the airport and they laughed. So they gave us the UFO report center number. I called and reported the sighting. To my surprise there is no record of our call. i have called back many time to check and checked all over many websites and have yet to see anything about it. Later that night I went to another friends house to tell him about it. We sat and looked for about an hour but saw nothing. When i got on my motorcycle to go home I noticed the orange ligth again towards the Santa Cruz Mountains. The light appeared to be moving towards my neighborhood again. I drove home quickly parked my bike on the side of the house and ran into the house. I looked out my window and the light was gone. The next day me and my friend told everyone. Everyone thought we were doing drugs. Even my aprents thought we were crazy or on drugs. About a wek later I was working as a custodian at a local school when I looked towards Los Gatos and saw the light. I went into a room and came out and it was gone. I was again kind of freaked out about it. I then put away all my equipment and was walking towards my bike when a truck load of friends came flying around the corner. They had just sighted the craft again at another friends house exactly where I was looking from the school. There was also anothe sighting for a short time early one evening but not competely confirmed because it was in a distance.,2006-03-11T00:00:00,37.28045681818182,-121.95654772727272

We were having a peaceful time when we all noticed that several lights were coming toward us out over the water. They did not seem to be on the lake but above the lake about 20 to 30 feet or more. There was a light in front and several different color lights that seemed to following the one in front. It did not make any noise. The lights did not all move at the same time but seemed to move in a chain like formation. The one in front moved and the others would then follow it. My wife said, ""What is that?"" I said joking that it was a UFO. The children were so frightened they clung to my wife and my mother-in-law. I thought it was a boat coming toward us. The lights continued slowly coming toward us. I also became frightened but I didn't let my family know. I thought it was going to continue directly toward us. I wanted to get up and run off the dock but was so shocked I couldn't move. When the lights were about a hundred feet or so from the dock they turned slowly and went up over the trees and we did not see them again. We turned to the TV to see if there was any reports about what we saw but we didn't hear anything. We have only told a few people about what we saw that night. I knew people would think we were making it up. I have worked for a manufacturing company for over 40 years and I served in the Army during the Vietnam War.

I am not a ""true believer"". I am not an idiot. I do not believe in anything in which I do not have conclusive proof, which is almost exclusivly for me, my own eye witness memories. I am now 31 years old (as of 2006). It was the year of 1989 and I was 15. I saw somthing in broad daylight which was so obvious and easy to see, that many cars on the Mountain Parkway Toll road on the northern edge of the smoky mountains, had parked on the side of the highway to sit apon the hoods of their cars and watch! My mother was driving, and my little sister was the first to spot the spectacle. It was near 6:00pm and the sun was low and orange in the sky. It was that kind of sun that you can look right at even though it is still fully in the sky.When I looked I was only curious at first to figure out what this thing was. It appeared as the shape of an almond with the soft ""points"" being vertical and the color was almost the same as the sun which was in a completely different place in the sky. I put forth a guess that the sun did give this object it's color. Like a reflection of sorts. What I witnessed next along with dozens of parked bystanders and my sister and mother was incredible. Almost instantly there where three small shiny objects appearing identical to normal stars moving around very near the large oval shaped object. Next, one at a time, the small objects moved to the top ""tip"" of the oval and disappeared, as if they had landed on it  and turned off or went inside it!! At this exact time we were going around the circular exit ramp to Interstate Highway 64. Once we were on the new highway going straight I regained a good viewing position only to see that the object had turned on it's side so that it looked more like a giant human eye. It then started to slowly move, I think. For as we went straight, it seemed to move from right to left across our path. The way it was moving and the way it appeared as we changed roads  led me instinctively to presume that it was not a far distant object like the moon. It only move slowly for 10 seconds or so before it disappeared or moved away so fast that I did not see it happen. Please keep in mind that it was a bright clear evening and I have near sighted eyes, however my sister has perfect vision. She sketched many drawings that evening. That's all.

At the time he looked the ufo was about ten feet above the fedex plane. He said "" What's that one of those Awax planes""?  And I said, "" If it is it's going to crash because it's falling apart!

At this time I checked my watch, it was) 5:05p.m. I asked him what it looked like to him, and he said it look like a water tower with no legs. We watched it fly north at the same speed and altitude as the plane all the while slowly moving off to the west of the plane. we watched them both until they dissapered into the distance,they where aprox. one quarter of a mile apart at that time.

I jumped out of bed, ran through the house, I could see light coming in through every window in the house, it was slowly moving in a fashion that seemed up and down, up and down, as I reached the front door the light moved up, and gone, I went out side there was nothing there. this story goes on and on for years,I recent sighting by my son and his girl friend prompted me to subment this report. we now live in Arkasas.

About 1:30 AM I got off the couch to heat a cup of coffee in the micro wave, I was watching Green Barrets a John Wayne movie.  While at the microwave a very bright light (hard to describe) shined in the apt.  At first I thought it was a 4x4'er with every thing he had on high beam? But I heard no truck or any noise at all, I had my back to the window but the whole apt. lite up very bright? A very strange penertating bright white light. The apt. lit eup maybe 10-15 seconds then it went off.  About 10 mins. later my mother ran in and yells ""come out here, you have to see this"".  In the fright and excitement I didn't hear ""you have to see this"" and all I heard was ""come out here"". I thought something had happened to dad? I ran out front and saw my dad just standing next to his car, door still open and just looking up. I watched him wondering then mom said ""don't you see it?""  I looked around and there was a huge ""CIGAR"" shaped object just siting there above the tree line.  Not moving, in town, large cigar shaped object close enough to hit with a rock.  It disapeared, then reapeared on and off?  It was grey in color, it had port holes along the side kind of like egg shaped but you couldn't see in.  You got a very strong feeling that they were watching us.  Two other adults ran out as well over the noise that was made when mom first came in, everyone was quiet, speechless, just watching.  It tilted, it looked like sparks fell from the back (which is back?)It was visible then it would not be visible, this went on probably 10 mins. or so, just staring in awe and speechless.  Then it started to move, slowly toward the main st and toward Mazzio's Pizza across the street.  It tilted again, went invisible again, lit up and ""POOF"" it wss gone in a SE direction, so fast it just vanished when it left, or took off, no sounds or noise? Hard to believe, it was right out side just siting there and I didn't even know it.  The next day the front page of the Shawnee News Star stated...""5,000 phone calls to Shawnee Police Dept. as Russian Space craft re-enters...""  Right..!  That was no Russian Space Craft...period..!  How ever the rest of the news the next day was as well ""Cigar shape craft spoted over FL by hundereds of witness..."" The same reports that happened to us in Okla.  The light that came on also shined on my parents when they stoped the car and got out to check the craft out.  It shined on them as I was at the microwave and that's what I witnessed.  It changed both of them, they acted different and it had a ""peace affect"" on both of them.  They wanted to see another one, it changed them, they went looking for it and they wanted to go?  Dad said later..""if that was a RUSSIAN SPACE CRAFT, I HAVE BEEN BLESSED"".  With all of that, no one even thought of getting a camera.  That was not on any ones mind at the time. Now I know why.

The craft was down on one end of lake and large enough to block a television tower light which has never been out in 40 years.  They went and got two more friends, one male and one female.  Craft was still there when they snowmobiled back onto the lake.  One of the males said that he could see that there was metal or a shape reflected as the lights blinked off and on.  It stayed in the same position and did not move.  They did comment that an airplane had flown over during the time they observed it.  They left before the craft left because they were worried about the power on there machines going out. It was clear to all that these were lights not reflections.   They have lived on this lake for many years and commented that they have never seen anything like this before.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,,

They would wink on like someone powering up a 12 volt bulb with a 6 volt battery (kind of slow to intensity).  At first we thought we were seeing the blinking of a tower through the trees so we didn't pay them too much attention.  But then we saw them again, after our line of sight cleared the trees, we realized the lights were not from a tower. Our next thought was landing lights from several planes because we noticed there was an abnormal amount of planes flying in the area.  That struck us as odd if it were true because why would aircraft fly so close to one another and why would they flash the landing lights (not the green and red clearance lights on the wings).  Plus, they would have to all be facing us pretty much exactly the same direction for them to all be the same intensity, there were about 7- or 8 of them in a somewhat straight line four or so on top and perhaps three or four below spaced perhaps a finger width apart from one another (it was hard to tell if there was a pattern because we were in the car going 65- 70 mph).   As we drove on for about 6 to 8 miles we saw them again in approximately the same position as before which told us one of two things, either the lights were moving our same direction, or they were much higher up then they appeared. We saw them several times again sometimes by themselves sometimes in a group, so we thought we could possibly photograph them with our digital camera (they were occurring very often).   We pulled off the Hwy in a rest stop and got out of the car and counted about 5 airplanes circling in the area.   We then realized the planes were not civilian, they were way too fast and flying very tight maneuvers, plus they would all come very close to one another at all different directions and when they converged that's when we would see the lights flash, we then realized the lights were not the planes, but the planes (we now could hear them) were converging on whatever was making the lights. We tried to get a picture of the lights but with the almost full moon and the streetlights in the wayside we couldn't.  There was a white minivan in the parking lot in front of us watching the lights as well.  After about 35 minutes or so we didn't see them anymore and the jets eventually flew away (in a small formation) so we left too.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,43.5775,-89.4827

Nighttime sighting.  DEFINITLY under intelligent control. utterly silent. Lying down in a local park, looking at the stars, I witnessed what seemed to be a BOOMERANG shaped craft cross the sky directly overhead. The craft had no lights, but was quite large and easy to spot if one were to know where to look for it. Also the moon was just coming up over the horizon and was nearly full which is probably how I managed to see the craft, in addition to watching the backdrop of stars blink in and out as it traversed the sky. To get an idea of the size and scale I was looking at, extend your hand out above your head, and then create a distance of 3 or 4 inches between thumb and index finger.  The craft was definitly under intelligent control and moved from North to South/Southwest.  The craft was utterly silent. No sound whatsoever that I could hear.  It appeared to be dark in color, roughly matching the color of the night sky, though just slightly lighter and greyer. I watched the craft traverse the sky overhead in a straight line for between 8-10 seconds, until I could no longer make it out against the night sky.  Various other airplanes (with required lights of course) were in the area, as usual. None appeared to me to take notice.  There are three possibilities for what it could have been.  1.  Could have been a glider flying at night (but I still think it was boomerang shaped) 2.  Black military project.  Stealth? 3.  Unknown craft guided by unknown intelligence.  I had a similar, yet very different sighting about 7 or 8 years ago in october with a friend, of another silent craft that moved directly over our heads to the point that it filled half of the visible sky.

So I got out of the truck and walked toward the light screaming you punks get the hell out of hear and leave us alone. While out there I realized this doesn't make sense The wind is howlin it's freezing cold there isn't a house for miles and we just got here. What the F#*& is this. We decided the best course of action is to leave them alone. Well it looked just like flashlights. Right in our camp.They would be in front of us and as if on a cable move to our left about thirty yards away disappear and return right in front of us again. Against my brother's wishes I went to confront them again as they were to the position to our left far from the truck. At that point they looked like headlights the way they lined up. I hollered out. You punks got something to say,say it now! Then it accurred to me these lights were like ten feet off the ground and I couldn't see anything under them. Well as you can imagine I booked it up the hill looking behind me and these light just lowered right to the ground.  That was the condensed version of that evening.  My brother was so freaked about the experience he wanted to go to Big Pine California to camp the next evening. It took me hours to convince him what we saw was one of those lifetime experiences and needed to return.

We were moving at about 70 mph-probably 20 miles north of Cocoa Beach, FL exit ramps.  All of a sudden the top section of my 19XX ((deleted--vehicle)) windshield was filled by the shape of a rough cylinder object about 75-100 feet over the highway crossing over the highway at a 90 degree angle to it and from my right to my left (headed east).   It was gigantic--being at least two hundred feet long and maybe 60-75  high.  Along the top of the object were a line of blue lights - maybe five or six and along the bottom maybe 8-10 white lights and another 10 along the side-somewhat like halogen lights and constant - no strobe or on or off.  I am positive about these colors.  It seemed to rather  ""float"" across the road at 100-150 mph. There was NO noise nor sounds at all. The most significant feature was a row of about 8-10 rectangular giant white panels along the side with a big  X in each one and some object in the center -like a small dome.  The panels were lit with a white light from within. These were giant and not any type of conventional aircraft windows since they were far larger. They had a slight bend to their line or position down the side of the craft-up in the front and back. There may or may not have been a wing.   I had just a second to hit my dosing son and yell...""look at that"".  He did  see it also for a split second.  It was so close and so sudden that I almost lost control of my vehicle but was able to put my window down and steal one 1.5 to 2 second glance to my left.  I could see it from the rear (by this time 3-400 yards away and still hugging the ground - at best 100 feet up) and headed east).  It reminded me of a giant vulcan bomber but I cannot be sure. Not sure I saw any vertical stabilizer.  It was emmense and with the window down-- still no sound was audible. I have seen and touched B-52, C5A, B-1, Sr-71 BLACKKBIRD, WARTHOGS,AND PHANTOM AIRCRAFT AND ALSO SEEN JUST ABOUT EVERY OPERATIONAL COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY conventional aircraft in the US--it was NONE of these being far far larger and totally silent.  Color - unkown maybe I cannot recall as it was so sudden.  From the rear I have a faint recollection of a giant thick maybe wing like shape-maybe delta or - but it may not have been a wing.  This had to be 4-5 times the size of a B52. It was not a B-2. The rectanges were at least 10-20 feet high and about 8-15 feet across. They were along the side rather like the guns of an old ship of the line. They were not like any window of any aircraft I have ever seen. Impression was of -maybe- again maybe-a gigantic man made aircraft flying in a very dangerous manner without conventional running lights,no sound and at way under the stall speed for any aircraft of that size.  I have searched the internet for years looking for similar observations and found only a distant few.  No alcohol or drugs used by me - I have never seen any other ""UFO"" but found the time today to enter what I can recall here for others.  My son recalls the rectangular white objects along the side and the blue and white lights-he recalls more white lights than I do -- maybe 15-20 along the side. Patrick AFB was a number of miles to the southeast but the object was far lower than any conventional flight or landing path- had no landing lights or wheels down.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,28.31667755102041,-80.61323061224489

I would start by saying, someone, or a few people in the surrounding area, had to have witnessed the same event. In the local areas, there's the Hilton hotel, where someone possibly, may have been looking out of the window. Tower for air traffic control and the everyday travelers, some other eyewitness, to the event.  My job includes outside work. while I had noticed how clear it was that night, It was going through my mind, is that the big dipper or little dipper. At the left corner of my eye, I spotted this bright light, yellow/green in color.  The object was round from the bottom, flat, slowly moving over the top of the terminal building, near what was then called,  the round house.The object was smaller then the round house, mybe by a half size. Could it have been curious, about the shape, looking like it's own. This was a restaurant, with coffee shops etc.,on the top level.  The object was below the main tower, no more then a few hundred feet above the terminal bldg.. As it slowly moved, from where I was standing, towards the center of what airline employees call the ally, ramp area for taxing aircraft to the gates, I'm thinking, no noise is being made, I'm trying to make out some detail, there's to much of a glow. Then it was directly over my head, it stop for no more then one second, then it shot out towards my right. It moved so fast, you could see an after glow, tailing behind.  If you were to count, one, two,by three, it was over the trees, that's beyond the border of the airport.    My next thought, I need to get this down on paper. I ran into one of readyrooms, area for ground services, found a sheet of paper, and wrote down everything I had remembered. One thing I need to mention, a few days before, I heard on the radio, there was something that was picked-up on radar, eariler that week.  The explanation, one of the facility bldgs. being picked-up, it was nothing to be worried about. This was no dought, a cover-up.  As I mentioned before, someone else had to have seen it as well. I would hope, someone could come foreward, and varify my story, it's the honest to GOD true event that took place. I was told, say nothing, people will thing, your crazy. This was from a friend, who did not believe me. I believe the facts and the truth, need to be told. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

I was heading west on highway 10, and I was just approaching Prescott, WI when, out of the corner of my eye, over a darkened corn field to my left, I saw something move.  I turned my head and looked.  At first, I thought it was a reflection of my dashboard lights on the window glass, so I decided to roll down my window.  The light was still there, pacing my car, about 1-1.5 miles to the south of me, over the cornfield.  after a few minutes of watching this light and not paying attention to the road, I decided to stop my car on the side of the highway.  I looked down for a split second to get my cell phone so that I could call my girlfriend and tell her what I was seeing.  When I looked up, I saw the light streak east and disappear.  My cell phone, which is never turned off, and had no mechanical problems, was turned off.  When I turned it back on, the time did not register right away, and I had no signal in an area in which I normally have full signal.

We sit in our chairs facing the northern sky and look at the stars.  The ""star"" enters our field of view from the northwestern sky (around the 10 o'clock position), and flies in a steady but very erratic up/down pattern. It then flys to the northeast (around the 1 o'clock position) at a steady speed, keeping its up/down erratic pattern, and then suddenly...poof! It's gone.  Since the beginning of June we have witnessed this event 6 times. It is a steady, bright looking ""star"" and has no flashing lights, identifiable form, etc. Has anyone else seen these ""stars""?

We have numerous flights of commercial and personal aircraft over our house on a daily basis- but not one of them ever fly into the airspace heading towards Edwards. There is a definite flight pattern these normal aircraft take around this restricted airspace- and yet, these stars head into that direction until they ""dissolve"". Very unusual.

I happened to look up into the sky above us and noticed a round, grey object moving at a steady, fairly rapid rate of speed.  This object was absolutely not an airplane of any kind and appeared to be very far away, far enough away in fact that when it reached clouds it appeared to move either behind or through them, appearing on the other side.  I got the attention of my father and husband in time to point and ask, ""What is that?!"" The three of us watched as this object moved across the sky (right to left) and disappeared behind a cloud, not exiting on the other side as it had before, just disappearing into ""thin air"" I suppose.  The same or following day (I can't remember which), I took a photo of the ocean and skyline. I don't recall the time the photo was taken, but there was no sound of any kind of aircraft at all.  I noticed nothing in the photo until I loaded it onto my computer from my digital camera and saw a round grey object hovering above the ocean in the right side of the photo.   There is nothing in the sky at all (even clouds) except this strange object.

Baldy I am not completely sure of the approximate time of the event, but i know it was between 10 and 11 at night. I was up in the mountains with a few friends of mine and we were celebrating the last day of school. The mountains were and still are, one of our common hang outs but that night was a little different because a new area was recently opened after construction was finished. We decide to go on the new path, which my two others were familiar with. We parked up on area that was the base of the road. We all got out of the and my two other friends began to walk towards the ledge of the cliff directly in front of them facing the interior of the mountains. I stayed at my current location and began to gaze at the sky as i do most every night. I turned about 180 degrees, facing the west, before abruptly stoping at the sight of something i had never seen before. It was a circular object, bright and luminesant. From my view point it appeared to be as big as the moon or maybe bigger. The object had to relativly close because of it size and no plane would safely fly at the elvation through mountains terrain  nor would need to be at the elevation. It was very bright and had a great radiance about it but no light was cast by it. It was a combination of colors but at the same time one solid color, consisting of white, yellow and orange. But before i could call my friends over to look at it, the object shot off at a speed and a velocity i have never seen before. It was very still for a short period of time then dissapeared in the same amount of time or shorter. I began to cheer and laugh because it was my very first U.F.O sighting. My friends gave me ridiculous conclusions of the objects identity, but all of them were nothing like what i saw. I see planes in the sky all the time when i am up there and none of them are that large and could move at speeds that fast. About a week later i was watching a documentry of the SciFi channel called Roswell: Startling New Evidence. As i watched the program, something caught my eye and luckly i taped it so i could go back and check it out. The topic of the section was about project blue book and they began to show different documents from the organization. The thing that caught my eye was that claremont california was listed in one of the documents, and next to it was a case file with a claim of seeing a description of the thing i view shortly before. I also was told by another close friend that he viewed the same thing as me on the same night from his bedroom. It was around the same time as my encounter and he described a loud noise at first and then silence. The object then hovered slowly over his home about three stories above. With these added encounters that are very similar to mine, i am happy to know that i am not the only one who has seen these un-identified objects and very egar on knowing its origins and seeing it again.

The tones were witnessed by another person of similar age in the same room.  Both of us dismissed the tones as a dog whistle at the time.  The tone started in one pitch and many moments later appeared to change pitch to a second tone.  We were actually in a bedroom when we heard the tones.  It is difficult for me to remember the exact date, time, and month because this was something that happened a very long time ago.  I do recall that it was raining at the time this was going on and for that reason I listed November as the most probable month of the event.  A number of years later I attended a support session for abductees that was held in Seattle on Aurora.  Although I have never been abducted, I learned from the group that high pitch tones are one of the signs associated with contact with a UFO.  For that reason I have decided to file a report.

My mom, dad, niece and I were in our backyard after making ice cream. We noticed, hovering over the tree filled field across Highway 62 what looked like a long flat array of lights.  They were flashing in a sequence: green, red, green, red, blue, green, red, white then they would sequence again.  I couldn't tell if there were any windows or exactly what shape it was, it was high up, maybe 300 yards. Then it started moving slowly toward our house.  It stopped directly overhead and seemed to lower quite a bit, maybe half the distance it had been was instantly..gone.  It was now hovering about 150 yards over our house, and from the bottom we could see that it was round,still flashing the same light sequence and not making a sound.  Then it started moving again, toward the fields behind the backyard.  It continued on, and dropped again over cow pond 1.  It hovered there a moment and continued on.  It went past field 2 and dropped over cow pond 2.

Field 1 was completely normal, as was cow pond 1.  We wore our knee waders because the mud around the ponds was thick and pretty deep if you got within 3 feet of the water.  It was also, as usual, surrounded by frogs.  It took us a while to get the dog out of the water and the mud, but we continued on.  Field 2 had strips of dry, flattened grass in it starting about halfway through it, but none of the strips connected.  At the edge of field 2 for about 5 to 10 feet, the grass was all flat and dry.  The dog wouldn't go anywhere near the flat grass or the pond that abutted it. Pond 2 was WEIRD.  The usual mud around the water still held the impressions of the cows that had last drank from the pond. The deep holes where they had pulled their legs out of the mud were completely dry. The mud had dried and cracked...it crumbled easily in our fingers when we picked it up, but on the ground it was solit and hard....sll the way to the water's edge which was down from about a diameter of about 40 feet to only about 10 feet. We circled the water three or four times, but as far as we could see there were no frogs or even bugs in, on or near cow pond two. We tossed chunks of the dirt into the water to try to stir anything, but nothing was there.  Less than a week before, the pond had been full of frogs and bugs and even crayfish. The only thing we got on our waders was dust. We went into field 3, but once we were past the 5-10 feet of flat, dry grass there were bugs and normal field flora and fauna...no frogs though. We returned home, dragging the german shepherd away from cow pond 1 again.  We told my parents what we had found. I wanted to report it, but my father wouldn't let me...I think partly because we were new in the area and partly for fear of ridicule. Thgank you for letting me tell my story after all these years.

This event took place on the first Sunday in October 1973.  I was a high school senior at the time.  My mother had been visiting her sister that evening.  My aunt's house is about a mile from the base of an area called ""Big Ridge.""  Its a residential area.   As my mom was going to the car to leave (between 9:30 & 10 p.m.), my aunt walked out with her.  They stood in her yard talking and my mom noticed bright lights coming down Big Ridge.  She told my aunt to look at those funny looking lights on a car coming down the ridge.  My aunt told her that couldn't be a car; there was no road in that particular spot.  They agreed the lights were highly unusual so they continued to watch it.   All of a sudden the lights (or craft) shot straight up into the sky.  They continued to watch as it zipped up & down the length of the ridge faster than anything they had ever seen in the sky.  Its movements were quick and sharp; up, down, back, and forth.  It would go so far away they could barely see it; then as fast as it disappeared it would zoom back into full view.  At the time, we were hearing about lots of UFO sightings so thats the first thing they thought about - it had to be a UFO.   My mom came home (about a 10 minute drive) and told us what they saw.  My sister, her son who was about five at the time, and myself got very excited and wanted to go back to my aunts house to see it.  So we all piled into the car and went back over there.  When we got there, some of my cousins were trying to see it through binoculars but all you could see was fuzz; it was much clearer with the naked eye.  After a while it got very far away and didn't come back our way.  My adventurous mother figured out which direction it had gone and said ""it looks like its up around Valleybrook.""  Valleybrook was, at the time, one of the most exclusive subdivisions in our area.  This is where it gets GOOD............. We all jumped back in the car and headed up Hixson Pike toward Valleybrook (about five miles or so from my aunt's house).  I swear to God somebody/something in that craft knew we were looking for it and knew exactly where we were going.  Theres a large curve right before Valleybrook.  As we came out of the curve we had full view of the subdivision on our left.  And there it was, at the back of the subdivision, moving slowly along the tree tops toward the road we were driving on.  I believe that finding the craft in the exact location my mom said we were going to was no coincidence; somehow they were tapped into our thoughts, knew we were looking for them, felt maybe we were going to be receptive to them, and came down to show themselves to us.   The craft was huge and beautiful and it scared the living daylights out of us.  I don't think our reaction was one they were looking for because we freaked out.  If we had continued the direction we were driving and the craft had continued on the path it was on, we would have driven right under it.  By that time my mom, who was driving, was frantic.  She was screaming ""I'm not driving under that thing"" and we were screaming back at her to not drive under that thing - to do something to keep from it.   Luckily there was a second entrance to the subdivision so we turned left onto that road.  The second house on the left was the only one with outside lights on so we pulled into their driveway.  This put our back to the craft which was hovering at that moment over a small pond at the edge of Hixson Pike.  My nephew was screaming ""Oh God, Oh God, Oh God.""  My sister threw open the car door and had one leg out of the car; she was going to run into some stranger's house.   By the time we pulled into the driveway and i turned around in the backseat to look at it out the rear window it was gone.  Totally vanished like it was never there.  We have no idea which direction it went when it left; it disappeared that fast.  I can't help but wonder if it would have stayed longer if we hadn't panicked.  I also sometimes wonder if they still watch me and know when I'm reliving the events of that night.   WHAT THE CRAFT LOOKED LIKE:  It was oval in shape, had a metallic body, small windows around it, in the center of the bottom was a cluster of the brightest, whitest, clearest, most brilliant lights I have ever seen.  That was 30+ years ago and I've yet to see any white lights that have remotely compared to them.  Around the entire craft was a red glow.  There was no physical/visible red light (like a bulb); only a glow.   It was being driven with precision along the tree tops and made no sound.  When we first spotted it at the back of the subdivision it was skimming along the tree line behind a row of houses.  It moved slowly and continuous until it reached the road we were traveling on.  Thats when it stopped and hovered over the pond.  It never crossed Hixson Pike; it just vanished into thin air.  We didn't report our sighting to anyone because we didn't know who to tell.   When we told our story to friends/acquaintances/family in the following days, we were treated like idiots and just made fun of.  After seeing the ABC special last week and finally getting names of people who might be interested in our story, I decided it was time to tell it.  Whether anyone believes what we saw or not is irrelevant; we know what we saw, the story hasn't changed in 30 years, and will never change.  I only regret that video cameras weren't available then like they are now.   My mom is now 85 years old and her memory isn't what it used to be, but one things for sure, she still remembers that first Sunday in October 1973.

I was travelling home with a friend who was in the Air Force and we saw a bright yellow fireball behind some trees in the Tunstall Forest, east of the base.  Thinking a plane had crashed we drove around for about 15 minutes on forest roads and nver located anything.  Nothing was published on the fireball we saw and no planes reported missing.  This might just have been one of those unexplained mysteries, except that there were always those kind of mysteries around this area and this was 7 years before the now infamous Bentwaters incident.  I was born and grew up in this area and as child in the 60s regularly saw things that I realise could not be explained away now, as they were then.  If I asked an adult then, it was always explained away as ""they must be testing something at the base"" but never as the Orford Ness Lighthouse as some have tried to explain the 1980 incident.  Anyone living there knew those lights and what they were.  Bentwaters closed abruptly in the mid 80s and local speculation is that it was to do with the incidences that occurred there during the 70s and  especially in 1980 and 1981. There has always been local talk of tunnels from Bentwaters to Woodbridge and other talk of secret testing that went on at the base and at nearby Martlesheam Heath  (an English base during WWII and now a Governement run installation).  Another writer on this site proclaims the military never messes around when it comes to nukes.  Not really true, when one considers that in the 60s and 70s, Bentwaters was proclaimed as not having nukes and all the while kept a very low profile, while Greenham Common was busy with anti nuke protestors. Lakenheath was considered the headquarters USAF base in England and yet had no real ""mission"" at least at that time, yet their security was very tight. Meanwhile on Bentwaters, I as a civilian had my father drive me to the flight line to meet a friend who worked out there surrounded by nukes.  He pointed them out to us.  We could have easily have been someone other than who we were, which is a frightening thought in retrospect.  The security in and around Bentwaters was lacking and lots of people did come and go, virtually unchallenged, unless an ""alert"" was in force.  What really happened there, we may never know but I suspect there are lot of people who have come and gone from service at Bentwaters who have small bits of the puzzle and one day all those bits may just slot together and produce the finished jigsaw.

This happened thirty one years ago but I still remember it quite clearly.   We lived on a small farm that was a quarter mile from the nearest neighbor and almost a mile outside of the closest town.  I was ten years old and was outside at the end of our driveway waiting for the school bus to pick me up.  My only sibling, an older sister, was ill that day so I was alone.   That morning was notable because it was the first school day after the ""Spring Forward"" adjustment of the clocks and it was therefore darker than I was accustomed to.  Although it was ""twilight"" there was still enough light to see the barn, the cars and the fields around me.   I was oriented to the east and was facing the road.  I was watching the sunrise as I waited.  I then had a feeling that ""I was not alone"" and looked over my shoulder to the north.  Hovering maybe fifteen to twenty feet off the ground was a sphere with a number of lights on it.  It was bigger than a basketball but smaller than a beachball.  It seemed metalic and orange, white and lavender lights seemed to eminate from it although there didn't seem to be any bulbs or lenses.   When I first saw it it was still and maybe twenty five yards away.  It began, slowly, to move toward me until it was only ten feet away and ten feet off the ground.  I was not afraid.  I don't remember feeling anything, not even curiosity.  It stopped moving but seemed to turn or roll but not on an axis.  It seems that I looked at it for ten or fifteen minutes but I have no recollection of its departure, nor do I have any recollection of getting on the bus.   The next memory that I have is of sitting on the bus and being several miles from my house.  Over the years I have thought about this incident many times.  The facts that I have given here are directly from my memories.  There are other ""memories"" that include me being aware of a larger ship hovering in the distance beyond our barn, but I can't be sure that this isn't embellishment that occured over time.   I did tell my family about this but it was received with a ""Oh, okay."" reaction.  I didn't tell my friends or anyone else until I was in my twenties.  The first time I talked of it, probably fifteen years after it happened, I experienced a strangely powerful emotional reaction that had me shaking and close to tears.  I have never had such a reaction since when either thinking of or talking about that day.  I submit this account to you now for the benefit of statistical compilation and because I'm curious if others have submitted similar events.

Then it slowly moved to a position lower on the horizon.  It became slightly less bright.  It was still for a few more moments and then it began to slowly move up and down in random circular motions, almost as if it was floating or dancing.  This lasted for about five minutes.  Then dark clouds rolled in and obscured our view.  The sighting lasted for about ten minutes altogether. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We assumed it was a car, but there was no cars to be found. The object was coming twords us at an incredibly fast pace for about 7 seconds and then it started to drop down while still coming our way. It was starting to drop twords tree's and was hard to be seen. We could still see parts of its neonish color when it vanished. It seemed to be far away from us, but the size of the object was pretty big.  First time that we had experianced something like that. Even when the object vanished we still heard the ""engine"" sound. Thats when we decided to head back inside cause it scared us badly. Also, right before that object appeared, my friend was saying to himself, "" I wish something memorable or exciting would happen"" and it happend indeed.

I WAS DRIVING SOUTH ON HWY. 273 IN ANDERSON, HEADING FOR THE I-5 SOUTH WHEN I SAW A BRIGHT LIGHT OUT IN THE SOUTH WEST SKY.  MY 10 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS ALL WRAPPED UP IN A BLANKET LAYING DOWN ON THE SEAT OF THE VAN. I SAID... LOOK AT THIS BRIGHT LIGHT, WHAT THE HECK IS IT? IS IT A METEOR? I WAS FASCINATED WITH THE BRIGHTNESS OF IT.THE NIGHT WAS SO DARK OUT, THE CLOUDS WERE THICK AND FAIRLY LOW. THERE WERE NO STARS TO BE SEEN. I COULD SEE A SHADOW OF THE MOON FROM TIME TO TIME AND THEN IT WOULD BE DARK. AS WE CAME ONTO THE I-5 SOUTH THERE ARE A FEW HILLS AND I WAS DRIVING RATHER FAST TRYING TO GET AROUND THEM SO I COULD SEE THIS LIGHT AGAIN. IT WAS MUCH BRIGHTER THAN ANY LIGHT I CAN REMEMBER SEEING. I HURRIED AROUND ONE HILL AND THERE WAS A LITTLE SPACE IN BETWEEN WHERE I COULD STILL SEE THE LIGHT BEFORE WE CAME ONTO THE OTHER HILL THAT HAD BLOCKED OUR VISION. I HURRIED AROUND THAT HILL AND HERE WE COULD SEE THE LIGHT REAL CLEAR. I KEPT SAYING... WHAT COULD IT BE! MY DAUGHTER SAT UP IN HER SEAT WATCHING IT WITH ME. I SAID... IS IT AN AIRPLANE? I THOUGHT AND SAID IT CAN'T BE...IT'S TOO BRIGHT. THE LIGHT WAS NOT ROUND IT WAS MORE OF AN OVAL SHAPE FROM WHAT I COULD SEE. I WAS SWERVING ALL OVER THE FREEWAY. IT WAS ALMOST AS IF THIS LIGHT THAT FIRST LOOKED LIKE A METEOR OUT IN THE SKY, WAS COMING TO US AS WE WERE DRIVING. NEXT I LOOKED OVER AND IT WAS JUST HOVERING OVER IN ONE SPOT, KIND OF LIKE A HELICOPTER. MY DAUGHTER WATCHED IT AND GOT A MUCH BETTER LOOK AT IT. I ASKED HER IS IT A HELICOPTER? BEFORE I COULD EVEN FINISH THE SENTENCE I SAID... THERE IS NO WAY IT COULD BE A HELICOPTER BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS BRIGHTER THAN ANY I'VE SEEN AND IT WAS WAY TO BIG. ALL OF THE SUDDEN IT STARTED DROPPING STRAIGHT DOWN. FROM WHERE IT WAS HOVERING OVER, NOT MOVING, TO STRAIGHT DOWN. I SAID.. IS THAT THING DROPPING DOWN OR IS IT JUST MY EYES CAUSE I'M DRIVING? I TOLD MY DAUGHTER I WAS GOING TO PULL OVER ON THE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY SO I COULD GET A GOOD LOOK AND SHE SAID... THAT IS TO BIG DON'T PULL OVER...KEEP ON GOING... DON'T STOP! IT SCARED THE HOLY CRAP OUT OF HER. ALL THE SUDDEN I LOOKED OVER AND IT WAS AS IF THIS AIRCRAFT? THING HAD TURNED, WE WERE NOW PASSING EACHOTHER. I NO LONGER SAW THE BRIGHT LIGHT BUT WHEN I LOOKED OVER AGAIN...WHAT I SAW WAS HUGE! AT A GLANCE IT KIND OF HAD THE SHAPE OF AN OLD MILITARY HELICOPTER (THE GRASSHOPPER LOOKING KIND) BUT MUCH MUCH BIGGER. BIGGER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN THAT COULD FLY. IT HAD ROWS OF LIGHT, WHICH APPEARED TO LOOK LIKE IT HAD DIFFERENT LEVELS TO IT. THE EASIEST WAY TO EVEN TRY TO DESCRIBE IT WOULD BE MY THOUGHT OF STANDING ON A CITY STREET IN THE DARK NIGHT AND LOOKING AT A FIVE TO EIGHT STORY BUILDING WITH LIGHTS ON IN SOME OF THE ROOMS, ON EACH LEVEL. I TOLD MY DAUGHTER...I HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS BETTER. I REMEMBER LOOKING BEHIND ME ON THE FREEWAY AND I ASKED MY DAUGHTER...CAN'T ANYONE ELSE SEE THIS? PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO BE SEEING THIS! THERE WERE OTHER CARS FURTHER BEHIND US, I COULD SEE THEIR HEADLIGHTS. BEINGS I ALMOST WENT OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD ON THE FREEWAY, I TOLD HER I AM GOING TO GAS POINT, THE STREET WE WERE GETTING OFF AT, THEN I HAVE TO PULL OVER. I TOLD HER WE WOULD BE FURTHER AWAY AND WE WOULD BE OK. AS I EXITED OFF ON GAS POINT, I INSTANTLY STARTED LOOKING FOR IT. THERE WERE A FEW TREES IN THE WAY AND AS I GOT PASSED THEM I LOOKED ALL OVER FOR THE LIGHTS AND THEY WERE NO WHERE TO BE SEEN. POOF...JUST GONE. NOT A TRACE! I HAVE SHARED MY EXPERIENCE WITH A FEW PEOPLE, MOST MAKE A JOKE OUT OF IT. MY BIGGEST QUESTION...DID ANYONE ELSE SEE WHAT WE SAW? I CALLED AROUND TO SEE IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY REPORTS OF A SIGHTING. WOW! IT WAS LIKE I HAD THE PLAGUE. I WENT TO THE AIRPORT AND FUNNY AS IT SOUNDS, THE LADY AT THE DESK SAID THE WEIRDEST THING HAPPENED TO HER...IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY, SHE WAS OUT RIDING HER HORSE AND A BEAM OF LIGHT CAME OVER HER AND FOLLOWED HER FOR A SHORT WAY AND THEN IT WAS GONE. BUT, SHE HAD NO INFO. AND COULD NOT TELL ME WHERE TO GO TO FIND OUT IF ANYONE ELSE HAD SEEN THIS. I CALLED A RADIO STATION, A NEWS STATION, LEFT A MESSAGE AT THE PLANITARIUM, CALLED THE TOWER AT THE AIRPORT...NOBODY, I SAY NOBODY WANTED TO HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT IT. EACH PASSED THE BUCK AND NEVER EVEN ASKED SO MUCH AS A DESCRIPTION. I WAS VERY...I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN JUST HOW I FELT. THATS WHEN I GOT ON THE INTERNET AND STARTED READING. ONE PERSONS DESCRIPTION WAS ALMOST WORD FOR WORD WHAT WAS SAID AND SEEN BY ME AND MY DAUGHTER. AFTER READING THROUGH QUITE A BIT OF INFO. I REALIZED A FEW THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO LIST...WHERE WE SAW THIS THING DROP DOWN FROM A STAND STILL IS DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM AN AUCTION YARD.(NOW IS THE TIME ALL THE RANCHERS ARE MOVING THERE CATTLE FROM THE HIGHER ALTITUDES TO THE AREAS WITH MORE FEED, AND THE AUCTION YARD IS VERY ACTIVE AT THIS TIME.) THERE ARE QUITE A FEW LINES RUNNING THROUGH THE AREA AND QUITE A FEW OF THOSE ELECTRICAL LOOKING TOWERS ALL THROUGH THE AREA IT WAS SEEN IN. RIGHT OVER THE HILLS I SPOKE OF, BEING ALMOST DIRECTLY NORTH EAST OF OUR SIGHTING IS REDDING AIRPORT. OTHER THAN THAT OUR SURROUNDINGS ARE ALL MOUNTAINS. WE SIT IN A BIG VALLEY. COTTONWOOD IS A RATHER SMALL PLACE. THERE'S ALOT OF LAND SPREAD OUT. I JUST WONDER WHAT THE HECK BROUGHT THAT BIG OLE THING HERE? KEEP IN MIND, I WAS DRIVING. MY YOUNGSTER WAS WATCHING THE WHOLE TIME. SHE GOT A MUCH MORE DETAILED PICTURE OF THIS THING. SHE SAID...IF IT WERENT FOR THE LIGHTS ON IT, I WOULDN'T OF BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE SHAPE OF IT.  QUITE AN EXPERIENCE, I WON'T FORGET. WHAT SEEMED LIKE 20 MINUTES WAS ACTUALLY ONLY 2 MINUTES.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,40.3344,-122.45019999999998

As it grew closer it suddenly became frozen and stayed in one position.  It was at a very high altitude.  I was tempted to rush in and get my camera, but scared I'd miss something.  I know that's a classic excuse, but you'll have to take my word for it. As I watched it suddenly vanished, but appeared again at the far right of my eyeline as I was seeing it.  I focused ALL my attention on it.  There were occaisonal flickers of runway-like lights heading outwards in the cliche-like chevron pattern.  I swear on my parents' my sister's and my own life that I watched this craft for 20 or so minutes tonight in a stationary position.  It gradually began to move, but REALLY slowly.  It would then dart at speed to another position, but it would sit there for ages.  As I say it was REALLY high.  Above cloud level.  I watched it until it was out of eyeshot.  It seemed to ascend. Clearly getting higher in a weird way, but not appearing duller.  Lights totally clear all through the incident.  Then it was suddenly gone. This didn't scare me at all.

TO E. AT 8:40 pm. Approximately 24 hours before the ""Phoenix Lights"" sighting(s)in Arizona, my next door neighbor and I were standing on the sidewalk in front of my home located in Northwest Las Vegas, Nevada on March 12,1997 at about 8:40 pm (20:40),when I glanced up(looking WNW) at the Spring Mountain area and saw a huge formation of off white or yellowish lights in a relaxed V or chevron shape gliding (ENE)directly towards and ultimately over our position!  I asked my neighbor if she was seeing what I was seeing and she confirmed same.  This formation of ""lights"" was very low (estimate slightly higher than local air traffic), and VERY wide (estimate 1.5 miles wide as I scanned the object) Our major intersections are approximately 1 mile apart, and I am located between Cheyenne and Craig Road off of Alexander, so the apparent width was fairly easy to guesstimate. This formation of a dozen or more lights didn't appear to have substance in between the lights, because as it slowly and silently moved directly over us we could see the night sky (stars) in between the lights of the formation. The sighting lasted probably 4 minutes.  I wanted to run in the house to grab my camera, but we were both kind of frozen on the spot watching this event. The formation of lights glided silently overhead towards the location of Nellis Air Force Base approximatey 16 miles ENE of our position.  As soon as the object? was out of sight my neighbor, (65 year old female) and I parted. I ran in the house and told my husband. I called Nellis Air Force Base to report what I'd seen, and the Airman on the other end didn't seem very interested and said he was ""in the basement, and probably couldn't see much anyway""!  He suggested I contact your UFO Reporting Center. I also called KLAS TV Channel 8, and they were pretty vague, with no other calls at that time.  24 hours later the Phoenix lights stole the show in my neighboring state of Arizona!  I heard the hoopla on the Art Bell show March 13th as well.  I have tuned into his show since 1984 when he first started on the AM station in Las Vegas.  I did call Mr.Davenport about this sighting, and he asked me to write a letter documenting what my neighbor and I had seen.  I did so, but did not see it in the archives, when I was recently reading through them.  Please know I am not confusing the dates.  My ""Las Vegas Lights"" sighting 24 hours before ""Phoenix"" is etched forever in my memory, as March 12th is my brothers birthday, he had just left my home about 2 hours previously.

I just found this web site and decided to enter what I KNOW I SAW the evening of 3/17/97 (like so many others did that night in the Phoenix sky). I was gardening in the back yard of my Scottsdale home. I noticed 8 or 9 soft glowing amber lights in the sky approaching me from the south in a V shaped (flying wing) formation. The 'flying wing object' gradually flew 'directly over' my home (in the course of about 5 minutes) at a perceived altitude of about 500 feet (about the same height of near-by Thompson Peak Mt. of the McDowell Mountains) at a speed 'I thought to be' about 40 MPH. The object was like a dark shadow (rather than a solid aircraft) and emminated a deep, soft, quiet, vibrating tone (like an electric turbine generator). I was stunned (in awe) and just watched it pass (as it veered slightly WNW). From that evening until now, ALL reports made by ALL witnesses have been discounted / unexplained by ALL governmental entities... *even though Sky Harbor air traffic control reported its unexplained existence in the Phoenix metro area that evening. I am well skilled in matters of aviation AND not convinced (either way) in matters of extra-terastrial 'whatever', BUT what I saw was not 'unidentified'... *It was awesome and real... and it WAS NOT (I know for sure) 'of ANY earthling's doing'. ** A difficult thing to assess (from one who STILL doubts life exists anywhere else in our universe... close enough to travel here at the speed of light in a time frame of a million years or more).

It was a May night sometime mid-month 1997 I think when myself and a couple of friends were doing a little night fishing on Oneida Lake about 15 miles north of Syracuse, NY Around about ten pm one of my friends noticed a group of three bright lights in a row across the lake(about four miles) and over the hills to the south. As we watched three or four other lights blinked on in  line with the other three. This looked exactly like the lights in the video footage that was captured in Phoenix.We must have sat there for over an hour watching these lights.Some of the lights would seem to flicker on and off but they would always appear back in a straight line. We could not make out any shape of any object and there was no noise. The lights were still there near 12 am when we left. The area where the lights were is on the flight path for planes landing at Hancock airport. I've seen planes with their landing lights on and when they come toward you they look like they are hovering.These lights however were brighter and were aligned perfectly and couldn't have possibly been commercial aircraft. A week or so later a niece of mine who lives near the lake said she saw a formation of unmarked black helicopters fly over in the afternoon; however she was not sure if it was the same day that I had the sighting.

It was a cylinder shape with three balls of lights in a triangular pattern on the bottom of it, you can tell it was a cylinder shape because its lights were reflecting off itself to reveal its shape.  It hovered overed the parking lot for about 5 min. and then began to move south east - we then caught up with the flying object and got out and looked at it, we heard no sound of a engine, or no smoke or any sign of a normal aircraft. And it was small, about 1 to 2 ft. in diameter and about 3 to 4 feet tall. Any way, then we followed it south east down the street and parked and watched this object fly real high into the night sky, as it got higher in the air the lights got brighter. It then reached a point to where it stop getting higher.  As we watched, one of the little balls of light broke off and fell then quickly disappered. Then after about 2 min. the whole thing disappered. It disappered for about 30 seconds then reappered. It sat in the sky for about 1 more min. then it just flickered away.  The thing is, having seen it at about 25 ft. above my car and hearing no engine, and then watching it go as high as planes, i cant figure out any aircraft that can silently move from above my head to that kind of altitude as silently and smoothly as it did.

Since it is a busy street I had to keep moving. I got to the next light less than a quarter mile and way and did a U-Turn. When I got back to the area there was nothing.

As we got older everyone said we were crazy and left at that.  But on this night I have been convinced that they are the crazy ones.  We were sitting outside late at night smoking a cigg and we noticed an object getting extremely bright and close and at first we thought it was a plane but as it got closer we could hear no sound of an engine.  Suddenly it stopped approximitly two football feilds away directly above our heads.  All we could hear was the sound of a low humming and I got the strangest feeling I have ever had in my life.  My head began to feel very light and my vision began to blur and the only thing i could focus in on was the light above our heads.  I can only explain this by saying it felt like I was on some sort of crazy drug. I was both scared and excited from what I was seeing.  then just like that it was gone, in a blink of an eye just dissapeared. I just cant get over it.  I could see how it would scare some people because it is something that hasn't been taught to us, but I just like say if they wanted to harm us I'm sure they could have done it a long time ago, but like any smart person knows violence in never an answer and I have the feeling that they are very intellegent. I always have dreams about them and I'm sure some of you others do to, but in my dreams they communicate with my without speaking and inform me that the eld of our world as we know it now is coming to an end and we need to prepare for it and they say they have been here on earth for a very long time and do care about it greatly.

I was unloading my car when I turned to go back to the cabin and looked up in the sky to the South and saw the unusual lights. I 1st thought what I was seeing was a flight of hellicopters because planes would not be moving so slowly but then I realized their was no sound. I shouted for my brother in law ""Crawford, look"" and pointed him to the lights. What we saw was a series of ~5-6 lights lined up in an edge straight row at ~3,500 feet above ground. the lights moved in unison, silent and moving slowly from West to East. I am certain of the altitude because from out vantage point their are a series of ridges, one being mallardy (sic) ridge that show elevations on topographic maps as 3,200 - 3,500 feet above sea level. I have taken a daylight picture of the spot from where I 1st saw the lights pointed at the ridges and can provide that upon request. MY brother inlaw found lated that several others had locally reported seeing a large craft with the lights we saw moving accross Whidby island to the West of our location then over puget sound to the West of Whidby Island then over Marysville/Everett area and on to the East of Granite Falls past out location. I can better pinpoint the date & time once I have an opportunity to look at our Cabin sign in log book from that night and then can pretty well pinpoint the date & Time. The best discription I have found that closely matches what I and others saw that night is to view the video from the Phoenix lights. We did not see a Triangular shape.

The line of three black triangular crafts was perpendicular to an invisible line from the center of the first triangular craft to the center of the trailing black triangular craft.  That particular craft was trailing a little distance in the rear of the main formation.   All of them had very small red lights on all three tips of their triangular shapes.  The center craft in the formation had a bright white strobing light directly in the center  on the bottom.  The shapes were each about the size of a dime held at arms length.  There was absolutely no discernable sound from the formation before they were overhead, during the flyover, and after they'd passed.  They were totally silent, almost as if they were five black phantoms (ghosts).   So far, NOBODY has given me an explanation of what they are, or were.  They DEFINITELY weren't B-2 bombers or F-117 aircraft.  I'm very familiar with those military planes and the shape of their wings.

In that moment, the object started to grow amazingly until it reached maybe 10 times its original size, then disappeared. Sadly no one else could see it. I believe it entered the atmosphere.

We were driving to the local ice cream parlor, and as we were driving on the street that leads away from my house, I looked up and saw this long triangle, like a Star Destroyer (from Star Wars IV-VI). I pointed it out to my sister and her boyfriend, and we all watched the thing. It was slightly lighter than the sky around it, and had a small orange light at the very tip of each point. Whiteish smoke was coming out the tail end (the shortest side) and trailing away, kind of like a cloud. It was moving... I'd guess about the speed of any airplane(?). After about 35 seconds of us watching it, the whole thing just faded. The outline faded, the white smoke stopped (but the smoke that was already in the sky died away slowly), and the orange lights dimmed. The two rear ones died out completely, but the one on the front tip just dimmed until it was around the brightness of a red dwarf star. (I don't know whether it was a stealth action.) The whole ship slowed down, and moved very slowly from that point on, and we just watched it for like another minute, and then my sister said, ""Just drive."" So we went, I kept trying to watch for the triangle's light, but I lost it, and by the time we got back, I guess it must have flown away or just dimmed completely. I'd guess it was between 22 and 45 degrees up in the eastern sky (from our POV). Our background? My sister and I are born-and-raised Americans, and the boyfriend is a Russian. They aren't UFO buffs, and I'm mostly a paranormal investigator (excluding UFOs). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,

I had no idea where we were ( above what state or city etc ) as I am not familiar with plane routes..............so i had no idea where we were. ......anyway, he told me we were above HUNTSVILLE ALABAMA and we were at 6000 FEET. ....I then looked at my watch at noted it was ABOUT 6:10 PM ( my watch set at timezone of my home in WEST TN )...I am not sure if that would be the same time in HUNTSVILLE ALABAMA or not. ......  I did not see this out of the corner of my eye. It was pretty clear skys and i watched it clearly. It appeared to be something like a ROUND BALL and looked sort of chrome in color. I have no idea of the size as the distance would be sort of hard to gauge in the air for me but if i had to guess id say maybe 5ft to 20ft in diameter???  CAN YOU HELP ME FIGURE THIS OUT?  WAS ANYTHING GOING ON IN  HUNTSVILLE AL AT ANOUT 6:10PM ( WEST TN TIME )?  ARE THERE ANY HISTORY OF THIS?  IS THERE SOMEBODY ELSE I CAN CONTACT?  IS THERE ANY GOOD INFO ONLINE THAT WOULD HELP ME?  IF SO WHERE ONLINE IS IT?  I am not jerking you around and i am 36 years old. I feel stupid even asking and even dumber admitting I saw this but i did.  i hate to give out my name at least right now. hope u understand for know.  i cant just ""stop"" thinking about it. i need to know more. any assistance would be appreciated.  Q: I WE WERE MOVING FORWARD IN AN AIRPLANE, THEN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT APPEARED TO BE MOVING UP FROM BELOW TOWARD US FROM THE BEGINING MUST HAVE ALSO NEEDED TO BE MOVING ALONG AT THE SAME PACE AS US. IF NOT, WOULD WE NOT HAVE PASSED BY IT??? SO  MAY BE IT WAS ACTUALLY MOVING ALONG UNDER US AND GAINING ALTITUDE............SO IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING UP IN A STRAIGHT LINE........THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, IT HAD TO MAYBE HAVE NEEN MOVING IN SAME DIRECTION AND SAME SPEED AS US WHEN I ORIGINALLY SAW IT AND NOTICED IT COMMING UP TOWARDS US..................CRAZY!........WAS IT SORT OF FOLLOWING US?????................SPOOKY BECAUSE I AM NOT A BIG FLYER AND THIS WAS THE ONLY THE 2ND TIME I HAD EVER BEEN IN A SMALL PLANE.

His family lived a couple of houses down from mine on Northcrest Drive located on the bluffs near the foot of Pikes Peak. I remember it was a crystal clear day without a cloud in the sky.  We were lying on our backs in ((name deleted)) front yard talking about things that eleven and twelve year old boys chat about and then he said to me look up into the sky.  I looked up but didn’t see anything.  Then he pointed up with his left arm and I followed his line of sight and saw eight round disks rotating in a circular motion directly above us.  We pondered what they could be and I specifically remember asking him if he thought they were angels.  We watched these objects rotate in an extremely tight motion above us for many minutes. There were a couple of unusual things that immediately caught my attention.  The first was that the eight objects were metallic (silver/whitish) in appearance, circular in shape and were flying and rotating in an extremely tight circular pattern.  We viewed the objects from underneath and I remember the movement seemed extremely unusual since we were used to seeing military aircraft since we lived so close to the Air Force Academy.  Besides both of our fathers worked for a government subcontractor who worked for NORAD and so we were very familiar with all types of military aircraft of that era.  What was most shocking is what happened next.  As I stated the eight objects were rotating in a circular motion and then they suddenly stopped moving.  The objects remained motionless without falling from the sky and all were perfectly separated from one another.  Then they suddenly accelerated at an astonishing speed from one another in exactly opposite directions.   I followed one of the objects as it flew over Pikes Peak and when it disappeared behind the mountain I looked back to where the rest were, they were all gone.  My Friend ((name deleted)) followed another one of the objects in different direction and was also amazed.  After witnessing the finally, only then did it occur to us that we did not see angels.  I swear to God that what I witnessed is true and will continue to believe it until the day I die.  Some facts: Colorado Springs is about 5,000-6,000 feet above sea level.  Pikes Peak is about 14,100 feet above sea level.  The objects we witnessed must have been at least 8,000 - 9,000 feet above us since one of them cleared Pikes Peak ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

They had no markings, perfectly metallic with a parting line on the center circumference, purplish color on the bottom and silver on the top, about the length of a 727.   We quickly ruled out earthly origin.  They stopped above the platform, then without turning, went southeast about 1/4 mile, hovered, reversed and came back to a stationary position above the platform.   During this time, Navy frogmen in wetsuits were attempting to enter a rubber raft at the base of the platform but after seeing the craft, they climbed back up the ladder of the platform and re-entered.   In about two seconds, the craft 'bulleted' away at about a 45 degree angle back toward the same southerly approach direction and were invisible.   A few seconds later, two phantom jets, apparently from Tyndal AFB in Panama City, roared at about 100' over our boat and ""chased"" the craft at the direction and angle of ascent as the craft had departed.  The impression I had was of a puppy trying to catch a speeding car.  I had recently been discharged as an ROTC Army Officer and my brother from the Coast Guard.  If I'd had my recently purchased SLR camera with its 210mm telephoto lens, given that most of the time we were 300-400' from these craft, there would be little doubt today of the existence of UFO's.

My brother and I had one many, many years ago and I would very much be interested in finally reporting something that was only shared with my parents and a few friends.  My friends, when hearing my story, were somewhat incredulous but knowing that my brother and I are of very serious character, they find it very hard to believe that we are making up a story.  Needless to say, my parents believe us wholeheartedly.  A summer evening, either 1974 or 1975, a friend called me to pick her up from the mall since her brother had neglected to do so.  My mother asked my younger brother (either 9 or 10 years old at the time) to accompany me.  As I drove on Ford Avenue (Woodbridge, NJ), over the NJ Turnpike bridge, my brother motioned to the sky and asked me to look at what he had spotted.  I was in awe when I saw a very large disk surrounded by a series of round white lights all along its perimeter.  It was quietly hovering -- not a sound was heard from the sky.  It looked like there was also a dim blue light emanating from it -- as if it were at the tip of an antenna -- this light was very hard to see so I can't attest that it was anywhere associated with an antenna, or exactly where it might have been located.  As the object hovered, it amazingly began rotating vertically on its axis, then it became horizontal once again and dashed away behind a set of trees directly in front of our line of vision -- that's when my brother and I lost visual contact.  I'm sorry that I did not look at the object more intently -- I was driving, and when I slowed down to take a good look at it, the drivers behind me began feeverishly beeping their horns.  I may have missed seeing the object altogether if my brother hadn't spotted it.  I surmise the other drivers did not see it -- they wouldn't be in such a rush to drive along if they had.  I'll never forget the sense of wonder and fright (I was trembling slightly) at witnessing such an object.  My brother and I had not ever been interested in UFOs nor did any reading on the subject -- we were not in the least bit biased and prone to interpreting unusual sights to be UFOs -- needless to say the sighting spurred our interest.  When I got back from the mall (without my friend who finally had gotten picked up by her brother), my brother and I related the story to 2 little girls in the neighborhood -- they had seen exactly the same thing!!  Thank you for the opportunity to finally share our story after so many, many years.",2005-04-16T00:00:00,40.5525,-74.2915

While I no longer remember the exact date (or even the year) for sure, I can estimate it within a year based on the age of my children at the time.  The two youngest (born 1972 and 1973) were still in cribs and sharing the same room on the second floor of our old farmhouse, only a few miles outside the town of Marion.  This is big farm country, and our house was surrounded by very large fields of wheat.  Late one evening during the week (my husband worked 2nd shift and was not home yet), I tiptoed into the darkened room to check on them as they slept.  The curtains were open, and my eye was caught by light or movement through the window.  I knelt by the window ledge and watched colored spheres of light (predominately red, some blue, some yellow) swoop and circle over the field.  It was summer, and the windows were open because we did not have air conditioning. I tried to tell myself it was fireworks as it was somewhere around July 4th, but there was no sound and the lights did not resemble any fireworks I have ever seen.  Gradually, the lights disappeared, though none of them shot away rapidly.  I had one other experience, though I no longer recall if it was the same year.  We were travelling near our home in our van and were passing over an overpass across State Route 23 when a bright blue light suddenly flashed on the passenger side of the vehicle.  We thought at the time that it could have come from a helicopter or plane, though we did not see or hear anything in the sky.  Years later, when I mentioned this to my family, I was startled to learn they had no memory of it, but I am sure it was not a dream. (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

A neighbor boy who was 7 and lived across the street of me to the left and my close girl friend who was 11 at the time (and lived 1 house north of the boy);and I was 8 years old at the time.  At some point the ball got away from me and landed just into the boy's front yard. As I picked up the ball, I looked up to see a glowing round (dare I say) saucer shaped ""thing"".  The disk was silent, floating above the full grown maple tree line; and from where I was standing, just above the boy's house. It seemed as if it was glowing, yet it did not give off light as a lit football field would on the horizion.  The detail on this thing made us stand there in awe, watching it. There were mechanical ""things"" all around it, such as pipes, cylinders, and other devices. Much like a person looking at the workings of a cars engine. It was bright white in the sky, with the exception of a red flashing light. The flashing light was a slow strobe, and very rythmic. The thing we saw was not moving and never did actually move, yet no sound what so ever was heard. If you have ever seen a picture of Disney's Space Mountain, this thing would somewhat resemble it. The slightly domed top (lit white) {liken it to the lid of a pan or pot} and the details were round the item like a deep pan, and a flat-ish bottom.  The duration of time we stared at this object seemed like an eternity, as we screamed for our parents. Unfortunatly our parents thought we were just playing and ignored us. As I ran into my house to retrieve my parents so that they could verify this thing we were seeing, and they finally made their way outside. The thing had disappeared. I asked my two friends, and they said this thing that was glowing disappeared, only leaving the red flashing light for a few moments. Then the flashing light also disappeared. We live very close to a small air field called Lost Nation Airport and I have lived with small planes, helicopters and even personal jets flying in and out of there as long as I can remember. I know what these things sound like, what they do and what they can never do. I also know that the only way in 1974 that the detail we saw on this thing could ever be duplicated is if you had a painted, detailed picture and projected it onto a large screen (such as a drive in movie screen)and somehow hung it high above the tree line. I am to this day bothered by this image and truely wish to know if the three of us were the only ones to witness this. Something like this could not have only been seen by elementary school aged kids in the middle of the suburbs!  Mentor, even then, was a dense area of houses and it was a beautiful, warm night. There is no way that anyone else could have missed it (at all). I often wish I could have some way to draw it or recreate it, much like the movie Close Encounters. I also wish I was not treated like a looney for what I saw. This is why we never said anything to anyone (other than parents). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My grandmother got out of the car, and went into the house, while us boys got into the car with our mother, to see if we could catch up with it. We saw it again over a field, on south avenue ext. we pulled into a furniture store parking lot, and watched it.  The u.f.o was hovering about 400 feet over the field. Then randomly, another disc that looked the exact same as the other one, appeared over some trees. We watched both of these discs for about thirty minutes. By now it was starting to get dark, and the stars were coming out. The second one that we had seen, always stayed higher than the first u.f.o. The first disc kept shooting down a light, like it was looking for something.  The most amazing thing about this, is that these discs were only about 300 yards from the road. Cars had passed, but none had stopped. The lower disc moved up to where the higher disc was, and stayed there for about 3 minutes, and then they just shot off into the sky, at a very fast speed. By this time it was completely dark. The next morning, we looked in the newspaper about this incident, and the had a little write up saying that the u.f.o was a weather balloon.

I grew up in an Air Force family all over the world, and have ridden with my father in small aircraft since I was four.  I know what aircraft look like.  This incredible red light took its time about flying and I called my husband to come look.  After it had gone, I was just stunned and could not go to sleep.  I kept checking out the windows for anything unusual.  Then, coming down a hill about 500 yards behind my home was a very bright white light. Looked like someone was running down the hill toward my house.  Of course I woke up my husband .....who said...its probably just a hunter. A few days later we hiked to the back of our property to just look around.  We found 3 burned areas in a pasture.Each was exactly the same size and  about 12 feet across with a badly burned little pine tree at the edge of one circle. Two circles were right together with only about 4 feet between, but the other was north and about 10 feet from the two.  The grass did not grow there for many years. We would walk back there from time to time just to stare at the bare circles. About a year after this happened I was reading in the newspaper an account of a UFO sighting and was amazed that it too had bobbed up and down in the sky.

Late afternoon, almost dusk, we went back home.  I wandered out into the street between our houses while I was waiting for them to put their sleds away in their garage.  I was just sort of looking around, and noticed a lighted object in the sky approaching from the southwest, roughly from the direction of the field in which we had been snowmobiling.  It appeared to be a single object with two lights, one red and one white.  I believe one of the lights was blinking, but I can't remember now which color it was.  I assumed at this point that it was a small private plane, as the town had a small municipal airport and it wasn't unusual to see small single-prop planes in the area.  The object continued to approach until it was directly overhead, then turned east flying directly over the street I was standing on.  It moved a short distance straight east, maybe a block or two, then stopped and hovered.  The object appeared to me only as two glowing globes of light, red and white, stuck together like two beads or marbles that are touching (they did appear to have dimension, i.e. the glowing lights were definitely spherical, not just point sources of light).  I saw no other structure, so I don't have a good reference for determining the size of the object - however I should note that although it was right about dusk, there was still some daylight, and had it been a small plane or helicopter I would surely have seen the structure (there were no helicopters in town anyway).   As to height, based on how it later flew away (below), it seems the height was modest as the object disappeared below a nearby tree line before travelling very far, so I would guess it was roughly a few hundred feet - no more than 1000 - off the ground.  If this is true, then the object was not very large - perhaps the size of a car or truck.  Anyway, after hovering for perhaps 10 - 20 seconds, the object moved directly back along the way it had come, straight back west over the street until it was directly overhead, and then it stopped & hovered again.  It did not turn or maneuver like an airplane would have to, it had simply moved straight backward along its original line of flight after hovering.   At this point I was almost in shock at what I was seeing, and just stood there staring at it.  If one of the lights had been blinking earlier as it approached, neither one was now - both lights were glowing steadily.   It hovered directly overhead for another 10-20 seconds, then the two lights separated and moved apart.  One light moved north a short distance, the other moved south a short distance, and it seemed that there was a thin glowing filament connecting the two.  The filament seemed to gradually fade away until I could no longer see anything connecting the lights.  (I suppose the filament could have been an afterimage in my eyes created by the movement of the lights, but it didn't seem to me that the lights were so bright as to have had that effect - but maybe...  The lights were not bright like a spotlight, more of a strong but soft glow.)  The apparent separation between them was probably not much more than the apparent distance between my hands if I hold my arms straight up overhead.   The lights stopped & hovered in this position,  separated from each other, for another 10-20 second interval, then moved back together and  ""rejoined"".  After another short interval just hanging there hovering straight above me, the recombined object moved slowly away to the southeast.   At no time during all of this did the object make any noise at all - it was totally silent.  Once it started moving away I kind of ""snapped out"" of the almost-trance I had been in while watching it, realized that someone else should see this too, and yelled for my friends to come see.  (I don't mean to imply that the object had directly affected me by using the word ""trance"", but while watching it I was completely focused-in on what I was seeing & oblivious to all else, could hardly believe what I was seeing, and it did not occur to me to call to my friends until it started moving away.)   One of my friends came to see what the fuss was about, but by the time he got there the object was some distance away and all he saw was a moving light in the sky, which he took to be a small plane.  The object continued to move away until it drifted below the tops of the trees on the next city block in the line of sight, and we lost sight of it - I would guess it might have been a half mile away at that point.  As far as I know, no one else in town reported anything strange that day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",2005-04-16T00:00:00,44.0376,-96.3186

It was the experience where we did not wake up until after 2:00 in the afternoon, all very disoriented.  I had remembered being in a ""craft"" going straight up through the clouds in the daytime.  I called you around 5:00 that evening, spoke with you for a while and you gave me the phone number for a lady, I don't remember who she was or what she was affiliated with, but she in turn gave me a phone number for a hypnotherapist who does regressions for abduction, her name was ((name deleted))and she lived in Woodinville. And then 2 days after this happened my 4 year old daughter told me about going up in a 'sky car' and seeing 'sharks'. So yeah, 1995 not 1975! Thank you!

I was 17 and it was the summer of 1975 in Minneapolis Minnesota.  My 'friend-boy' (he was 22) was walking me back to my apartment where I lived with my family.  We stopped to talk and were standing in the Phyllis Wheatley elementary school field that separated the school from my apartment building by about an acre.  The street was about a half a block away to my right and his left, facing the apartment building.  Across from the apartment building was another apartment complex. It was about a half an hour before sunset on a very clear evening.  Around the perimeter of the field, there were a lot of tall trees.  We were engrossed in a very good conversation when I notice to my left, something coming through the tops of the trees.  It didn't make a sound but it was as big as a very large house.  It was black and shaped like a very narrow triangle.  It has lights on each point and a big 'spotlight' typed light in the middle.  It whoosed over the very tops of the trees, so close that we both ducked, thinking it was going to hit us.  I asked him if he saw what I had just seen and we both definately agreed that what we saw was shaped like nothing we had ever seen before.  Now, here is where it gets very, VERY strange.  Not more that one minute later, as we were engrossed in conversation about the object we had just saw, I noticed movement, this time over my right shoulder.  Coming out of the bushes next to one of the apartment buildings across the street was a caveman!!   I stopped in mid sentence and my friend noticed and followed my eyes.  He then asked me if I saw what he was seeing.  I said that yes, I see a caveman!!  We both watched as the caveman parted the bushes holding what looked like a large tree branch in his left hand.  He was not very tall and had on what looked like brown fur around his mid-section.  The color of his skin was light beige.  He didn't make a sound but stared at us as we stared at him.  What broke the concentration was when I screamed.   The caveman then started coming towards us--but he moved like he was under water or mechanical.  I could NOT move from where I was standing because I could NOT stop staring at this very strange sight!  Finally my friend grabbed my hand and said to me to stop staring and start running!  I had on a pair of yellow Japanese shoes that I had to kick off because my friend was pulling me so fast.  I turned to look behind us and the caveman was so close that I could see that his bared mouth bore yellow teeth.  When he ran, it was in that mechanical, under water way--like he could not control his movements--but that didn't stop him from moving so fast!  He looked like he was caught in the beams of a strobe light.  As we reached the steps of my building, I looked back again but only saw his hand as it was ready to grab me just under my shoulder.   Thank goodness the building's main entrance door was always unlocked!!  We got in the building and my apartment door was unlocked as well (because my siblings were home).  I locked the apartment door behind us and we both ran to the front window to see if we could see him anywhere but all we saw were my parents who were just pulling up.   We both looked at each other in puzzlement, then ran right back to the door--he snatched it open only to find an empty entryway.  The caveman was gone just that quick!  We both ran out to help my parents with the groceries--both talking a mile a minute about our experience.  When we got back inside, my mom asked us what the thing in the sky looked like.  We described it to her and my dad.  My mom suddenly had to sit down and they both just stared at each other.   My Mom then told us that that was the same object they saw, along with about 50 others, just the week before.  They had been stopped at a light at a very busy intersection and she said everyone was jumping out of their cars pointing at it.  She said they all got an excellent look at it because it was moving slowly across the sky.  I remember her showing us the newspaper clipping about it.

There were 2 white pulsing lights in tandem and then 1 red light that was fixed in what appeared to be the front of this object. I could not actually see the object but could see the lights and they moved together like they were attached. These lights were low in the sky and below the normal flight line of normal aircraft on approach to ORD ( there were many other aircraft in the sky at the time and this object must have been noticed by other planes ). What really made me stop was the fact that they just stopped and then turned like they were on some sort of swivel. They then started heading east at a rapid speed and made another swivel turn to the south when I lost sight of them behind the tree/building line. When the object turned I never lost sight of the lights ( they were never obscured like a plane banking) and they turned on a level plane...The two white lights got wider apart and the red light actually moved to the middle of the 2 white lights and then the object seemed to move away from me.

The lights were in a cloud, so there was no visible signs of a craft, but there seemed to be no spotlights or store signs that could have caused this.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,40.55069822812846,-105.07729501661129

The object would brighten briefly and then in the air below the object, an identical amber light would appear and descend toward the ground then fade out. This was repeated several times as the main object kept heading away from me on a straight and level course. One of the objects that appeared below the main object, descended and then made a right angle turn and moved north before fading out. It was hard to estimate altitude on this object but I would guess it was below 5,000 feet. The main object continued to head east until it faded out of view. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, I filed a report of a sighting in Glendale, Arizona with you on Thursday, December 29, 2005 at 22:37:21. I had the sighting around 3:30am and did not fill out the report until late that evening. I had worked a 10 hour shift that day and was quite tired when I filled out the report. I hope you post the report when you update your data base but, I made a mistake on it that I was hoping you would correct as I want the report to be accurate. Because I was so tired when I filled out the report I got the direction of the sighting backwards. The object(s) I saw were moving WEST and not east as I stated in the report.

I approached the object as I was driving in my car again and could see it quite some distance away behind the nearby trees.  I drove past the trees into the clearing where I could get a good view of the object.  When the object came into clear view I started to wonder if what I was looking at could possibly be a planet, because it was much too large to be a star.  No sooner did I have this thought in my mind when the object quickly faded out (as if someone had quickly turned off a dimmer switch) There were no clouds nearby in the sky that could have hidden this light. The sighting only lasted for about 10 to 15 seconds this time, but what really bothered me about this particular sighting is that I had the feeling that this object knew that I was looking at it.In my last report I suggested this light could possibly be a helicopter. I firmly believe at this time, that the light/object is not a helicopter. I don't know what the light is, but for some reason it seems to be hovering around this one particular spot in the country...as far as I can tell, there seems to be nothing but farms and fields in this area.I'm reporting this sighting in case someone else in this area or other areas may have seen what I have seen.

At first I thought of discounting it as just a bright planet in the sky, but the brightness of the object was much brighter than any planet could have been. The object was so bright that it gave of a white aura; perhaps haze in the atmosphere. We were in the car when we spotted it.  The object appeared to be located over a nearby national gaurd base -- Stewart Air National Gaurd base in Newburgh, New York. It was in the south western sky about 30 degrees above the horizon line.  As soon as we got out of the car we rushed to see the object. At this point we could verify it was a UFO. It was seemingly stationary like a planet or star would be, but when standing still and comparing it to a stationary object (tree -- there was no wind) it verifiably moved ever so slightly. We got a telescope and further verified the object. We could also verify its movement -- not that of a normal star, plane helicopter or balloon. It moved left to right and differed in distance at times.  The object was circular with three quadrents. It appeared to morph in shape as we looked at it. The object was white through the telescope and had a dark center to it at times, sort of like a donut. The three quadrents pulsed with different color lights to the naked eye and through the telescope. The three quadrents gave it a trianular shape to the naked eye, but in the telescope the object appeared spherical. The object also had a forcefield like quality to it. the white light would shimmer and shift like plasma or some form of energetic matter.  At one point there were other lights, which some of us thought were planes circling around the object. At another point a verifiable plane flew directly in front of the object -- keep in mind this was in close proximity, if not over an air base.  The object was in the sky for about an hour from the initial time we spotted it. Then after being in aproximately the same proximity for about an hour, flew off out of telescopic and naked eye range.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus sighting??

We were on our way to San Antonio and pulled over on the side of the road to check one of the tires.  I caught a strong cinnamon smell that brought back dormant memories of an experience I had back in El Salvador in 1969.  I was eight years old and El Salvador was at war with Honduras which was a neighboring country.  There was a nightly curfew and my older brother (10) and I used to sneak out of the house and go across the street to an open field to watch the lightning from the bombs in the far distance.  My brother went back to the house for a minute.   I felt something grab my ankles and lift me up to the sky.  As I looked up, I saw what looked like a huge bubble with a bright blue light inside.  I still remembered as the blood rushed to my head.  It felt like a long time that I was hanging upside down.   Next I found myself inside this bubble sitting in a chair and looking down.  I felt someone's hands on my shoulders but could not see anyone.  Someone sort of holding me down.  I also heard what sounded like dolphins chirping.   The bubble moved around the neighborhood for a while.  I could see my brother was outside again with my grandfather looking for me. They called for me and I could hear them.  They could not hear me.  I must have been about a hundred feet above them.  Finally the bubble came down near the same field and I ""fell out"" on my stomach.  My brother and grandfather heard me crying and eventually found me.  I have never told them this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Something very large was moving very slowly just cross the tree tops. I slowed down even more to get a good look at this thing. I stopped and hung in the air over the road about 30 yards in front of me. I stopped to look at it. It was dark grey. About 50 feet long. (The road is about 25 feet wide, and this thing was more than twice that long.) The shape put me in mind of a dumbbell. Larger sphears on each end with a narrower cylendar like center. Each end had a window that was about 5 feet high and went the width of more than half of the radius. The center cylendar also had a like window down the side. The out side of the ship was made up of triangle panles. In the window I could see at least 3 beings looking at me. The one turned his head to another, then quickly looked back at me. the other one moved very fast to the other end of the ship. I could see him through the windows. Then the ship took off with amazing speed. I hit the gas to see if I could tell where it was going. It shot off at tree top level, then made a curve up to the sky. The ship went from standing still to vanishing in less than 3 seconds. I have thought of this everyday from that moment on. I have told a few people, but it sounds kind of crazy, so I have not brought it up. Has anybody seen anything like this? It made no sounds. No lights. Nothing.

Moved with intellegence The incident hapened a few days after we got plowed with a couple feet of snow in march of 2001. Iam glad I have a place to post this because what happened was very strange. I hope this is not too long. I have lived in wayland my whole life and live adjacent to miles of conservation land. No one knows these woods as well as I do because I have been out there almost everyday of every season since the early 1980s. There are no conservation trails in this area and does not see any traffic from dog walkers or hikers. The area is sort of swampy which I think helps keep people away. Its the kind of area that if you know your way it can take you five minutes to get to a point that would take someone else an hour to get to. I love it. Anyway. There sure is history out there in those woods. European settlers have been in that exact spot since the early 1640s. My woods was home to one of the original families. They were millers and provided timber for most of the early town works. But unusually they were quite far from their neighbors. Also there is an ancient fishing site thousands of years old well within walking distance. This site was also intricate in the king Philip Indian insurgency and the revolutionary war. This is a brief history of what I know about my woods out there. Maybe this pertains? At about 1.00 am I was in my yard letting my dog relieve himself before bedtime. Looking out into the forest I noticed a light, that looked to me like a candle being walked around through the trees at waist length. Knowing that there are no houses in that direction and that there should be no one walking in the woods at night I became curious and went with my dog about 30 yards in, past my yard to get a better look. I couldn’t see much but something was happening out there. The flickers of light I was seeing had no explanation, had never been there before, and shouldn’t have been there at all. But I could still hardly make them out, there was a hundred yards between us and lots of trees. I went inside woke up a family member and told them there were people in the woods with candles or flashlights. We went into the yard but the small flicker of lights didn’t impress enough to go out there and check it out. The next day my friend heard about this from me and begged me to go out there with him at around the same time, I agreed. We bundled up, I grabbed a B.B. rifle(makes me feel safer) and we headed out. Immediately we saw the same thing I had seen the night before, small flickering through the trees just above ground level. We were about 300 yards in when suddenly there was like a camera flashbulb going of in front of us deep in the woods,  about another 80 yards in front of us. Then one way to the right of the last flash, but still in front of us, then a flash to the left. Real bright flashes. The flashes then started flashing towards us. We were talking to each other saying ""you’re seeing this, right?"" There were about 30 separate flashes from different directions in front of us gradually getting closer and closer. One flashed about 3 feet from my face. It looked like someone struck a huge match of different colors but it was not fire, it was all of a sudden light from nowhere. They flashed about twice the size of a basketball and the one that flashed next to my face seemed like slow motion. When it flashed there was slow motion. that’s the best I can explain it. My friend and I looked at each other and ran back to the house as fast as we could out of sheer terror.(I should have stayed but my stomach got very queasy) When we got back to my yard. We talked about what we saw and decided it would be stupid not to go back out and really experience and try to interact and get to the bottom of the ""ORBS"" that just seemed to display at least some intelligence by coming directly to us. We walked in complete darkness back to the exact spot we had 25 minutes earlier seen the orbs. No flashes or peeks of light through the woods greeted us. We couldn’t believe they were gone. So we went farther. When we reached about 3 quarters of a mile into the woods(significantly farther than the initial experience)we saw light. Almost to the top of one of the oldest trees in the woods(an old field corner marker next to a stone wall)were 3 Huge orb lights circling this tree!!! We were about 25 yards away and they were suddenly in very clear view, literally in perfect view of us. They were about 6ft by 6ft and one was slightly larger and had a slightly different tint than the others they made no sound. We watched in shock, from an excellent vantage point for what felt like it was 10 minutes. I still had the B.B gun and we took turns looking through the scope at them for an even better view. They were totally unnatural and foreign to anything I had ever seen before. They had a natural very bright bio luminescence sort of look to them but the spheres themselves did look metallic. They slowly circled, lucidly, near the top of the tree. We started panicking about how we might start to get out of there. Continuing to face them we backed away. I turned and started running as fast as I could. When I turned to look back all three orbs had stopped circling the tree and had begun to follow us in a single file 10-12ft above ground. They were slow and didn’t catch up to us. We ran all the way back to the yard non stop.  In my yard we were safe.  We kneeled down panting, relaying to each other what had just happened. We had not said a peep to each other during the whole encounter trying not to give ourselves away. I haven’t seen anything similar out there since. Not even the initial flashbulb things through the trees no matter how deep I am out there. But in that spot, where the tree they circled is located the branches of all the surrounding trees are bent in the same direction in a very odd and obvious way. This, like the rest of the story is very hard to explain. Never the less it happened and it proved to me that there is much more out there that still is unexplained by modern science.

I ran to the car to get my binoculars naively thinking that if this was too bright to be a regular satellite, maybe it was the International Space Station.  When the object was about at zenith, it slowed to a stop.  My friend and others camping in the area exclaimed in surprise when this happened.  I trained my binoculars on the object and discovered that it was actually two objects, one glowing bright yellow that we had been following with our naked eyes, and the other much dimmer and glowing a deep, deep blue.  While the yellow object was now moving very slowly and steadily, the blue object seemed to orbit tightly, rapidly, and haphazardly around the yellow object, constantly changing directions and speed.  After meandering around the sky above us for maybe 1 or 2 minutes, it began to climb.  I could not judge its altitude.  People around us thought it was anywhere from 20,000 to 100,000 feet up.  Through the binoculars, I guessed that it was about 1,000 to 10,000 feet up and climbing, but who knows?  Eventually, the blue object slipped behind the yellow object and I never saw it again.  At that moment the yellow object began to gyrate rapidly and wildly in a small area and seemed to leave a short trail.  I thought maybe my binoculars were shaking, but this was not the case since the background stars were not themselves gyrating.  The object continued to climb quite rapidly until it was difficult to see even with the binoculars and then we lost it.  I'm guessing this whole thing lasted about 6 minutes, and the whole time we did not hear a sound from the objects.  It is certainly possible that this was some kind of hoax since the RTMC might be a tempting target for hoaxers.  I also considered aircraft from a nearby airport, but its behavior and appearance were unlike any aircraft I have ever seen, and it did not make a sound.  The RTMC is held up in the mountains at a YMCA camp.  The air that night was cool and very still.  I tried to see if at any point the space between these lights would block out the stars behind it, but I could not come to any conclusions mostly because it was always moving and was small even in the binoculars.  Funny that I had a nice digital video camera in the back seat of the car and didn't even think to use it!  About a year after this happened, I contacted an organizer via e-mail.  He saw it, too, but felt that the object was ""in the hundreds of feet up"", and given the venue was probably a hoax of some kind.  I'm a computer programmer and my friend is a mechanical and electrical engineer.

My mother and I tried to identify what it was (going through rocket/ ultralight/ gyrocopter/ helicopter/ airplane), but could find no rational explanation other than that it could be a blimp/zeppelin/derigibal.

The object seemed to dissolve in orange-red sparkling lights (almost like glitter - like in those old-ish movies where someone disappears by magic into a bunch of sparkles. This took about 3-5 seconds), before completely disappearing, leaving only a relatively bright star-like light in the sky, which I watched for another 2 minutes or so, before losing sight of it.

Airport (SEA)- At approx. 1935 the sky conditions over SEA were dark/ clear, with some haze from light pollution on the east and west horizons.   I was facing south and noticed a high-altitude aircraft passing southbound directly over the SEA VOR (Nav. Aid located on the SEA airfield) the aircraft appeared to be a small / corporate or military plane with a red beacon traveling at a typical jet speed at approx. 40,000 - 45,000 ft..   When the aircraft was at approx. 80 degrees up / to the south of the airport / VOR, I noticed one movement of light coming from approx. 080 degrees mag. / ESE, at first I thought it was a meteor, as the light came into focus from haze on the east horizon at approx. 85 degrees up and south of the airport I could make out a rectangular shape of considerable size with 3 to 4 white lights in parallel at an altitude way higher than the small jet aircraft.  It crossed my entire field of view from initial spotting of the movement of light ESE, overhead and to the 260 degrees mag. / WNW hazy horizon in 3 seconds. The rectangular series of lights did not trail any type of light or streak like a meteor, no sound / sonic boom, it was distinctly high in altitude, but not of the movement of typical faint star type light of a satellite passing over.  I checked the Intl. Space Station orbit for 3/7/05 for Seattle, and it was to pass at approx. 1905 12 degrees on the horizon for 2 minutes.  The sunset here in Seattle was approx. 1820 ?, being that the object was distinctly observable high overhead may have been due to the angle of the sun over the horizon shining on it. My background includes approx. 17 years of operational work in aviation.  USAF, Boeing, Airport Ops. etc., and I also hold CFI / Comm. / Inst. pilot cert. / ratings.  I have never seen anything move that fast that didn't look like a meteor streaking through the sky!

I work for a local newspaper and my editor, was so interesed in my UFO encounter (on March 7th, 2005) that he wrote an article about it in our March 10th issue. He wrote the article off a paper I wrote describing what had happened. It describes better than I can, the events that happened that night. I have used *** on last names and street addresses. My editor later wrote a follow-up editorial on April 7th, 2005. Here is the article as follows. If you would like me to send you an actual paper, that is available also.  What was in that March 7th sky? So you think your Monday was a bit taxing do you? Elaine ****, webmaster and graphics artist at the Modoc Cuonty Record and her family were jolted by some very strange skies over Alturas. She said it all started about 8PM when she saw something odd from her living room window, ""I saw a large hovering aircraft with five lights, shaped like a boomerang,"" she said. ""I stared at it for at least five seconds before jumping up and looking out another window. I didn't see it from there, so i shut off the lights, but didn't see it again."" Elaine said she ran outside and the object was gone, but several jets were flying in different ares of the sky. ""I called my dad and told him I thought I just saw a UFO,"" said Elaine. ""He told me to come over to his house, so I bundled up my son and raced over to their house on East *** Street. When I arrived my dad and sister were outside looking at the 12 or so jets flying back and forth over the night sky."" Then things got weird. ""A big bright ball of light appeared from the north,"" said Elaine. ""I pointed it out to my dad and we watched it come towards us. As it did, it morphed into a triangle. As it got closer to us, we could see the belly and notice it was indeed a triangle with little red lights creating the shape. ""On the right side was one green light. It flew over our heads flying in circles and turning at sharp angles. It's flight pattern defied logic. The lights were steady, not blinking once."" The craft flew south towards Likely and then it turned back, appearing to head straight for the family. ""Once it was over our heads, it flew back and forth, like a bird flying in all directions. At that time, we noticed a second one to the north. It was white. Once the two triangles met, they started a dance in the sky, gliding here and there,"" Elaine recalls. ""Then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, one of the triangles suddenly burst into a bright ball of light. I thought whatever it was, it was going to crash land, but it broke away from the ball of light. The lights hovered over **** Street near the Alturas Cemetery, just sitting there until they slowly disappeared."" Elaine said the triangle then shot off towards the north, followed closely by the second one, hovered a minute or so, then disappeared. ""There was no sound at all when the burst of lights appeared and when the triangle appeared,"" said Elaine. ""It was pretty freaky, but we all saw it."" There was no reports to the police or sheriff's office and the military has not returned calls. If anyone saw what Elaine saw on Monday night, contact the Record at 233-**** and let us know.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,41.4384,-120.534

Last night, around 8 PM, I was on the back porch, sky watching. I noticed a very bright light in the western sky. I focused on it, expecting to see the strobes of typical aircraft. There was only a constant, bright white light. It was quite high and far away, traveling from southwest to northeast. I thought that as it neared my position, I would see strobes. This never happened. After a couple of minutes, I decided to go inside and get my binoculars (9x35 Leupold). While once again looking at this object, I noticed a high flying jet, crossing the below the path of this object, although they appeared very distant from one another. As the unknown object continued its northeast path, at least two other hight flying jets came into view (separately) but again, this object was higher and much brighter. Under magnified vision, I was unable to ascertain the true shape of this object but, the light was a solid mass (no smaller lights), and the white light had a silver tint to it. What really made it different for me was that it was one large area of light. I kept thinking that this object was much larger and brighter than all the satellites I've seen before. For all I know, I was viewing the space station. I just don't know. After about five minutes, it went out of viewing range, still heading northeast. At one point, when it was passing between the earth and Polaris, I thought I detected a directional change, to the east but, I may be mistaken. The night was the first clear night we've had in days and the temperature was around 70 degrees. Ugain, under magnification, this object was qhite large and just a solid bright, white (silvery) light and of course it was silent. If what I saw was man-made, I apologize for wasting your time but still, I did want to report this. The last thing I'll say about this is it was quite spectacular in that I had plenty of time to watch it and the magification gave me a pretty clear view of it.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,29.488865917141535,-98.4752404435546

It made absolutely no sound though it was low enough we though it would crash. What really caught our attention was the intensity of its brilliance. Though it was still daylight its brilliance was greater than the daylight itself. We watched in amazement as it started to plummet downwards and all of a sudden it simply dissapeared in front of our eyes. It did not fall nor did it fly away, it just simply dissapeared in a yet brighter color than it previously had. All that was left behind was a small, thin trail of smoke.

(Many years ago I saw something similar and checked it out in binoculars and saw the distinct upside-down teardrop translucent balloon shape.) About 10 minutes later I noticed it taking on an orangish hue and it quickly faded red and dark as the sun went farther below the horizon. I'm 100% convinced it was just a balloon but I wanted to submit this report to help clarify any others you may receive. I am an amateur astronomer and have a background in physics.,2005-10-11T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

September 21, 2005   'Fireball' lights up night sky:  Callers alert Coast Guard   BY JUAN ORTEGA FLORIDA TODAY  If you were in the right place at the right time along the Space Coast on Tuesday night, you would have seen a light show -- possibly a meteor or space junk.  From Fort Pierce to about five miles south of Jacksonville, reports came in to Coast Guard offices starting about 7:30 p.m., said Dan Yates, a Coast Guard petty officer in Port Canaveral.  Yates said one caller who was walking his dog near the Sebastian Inlet described the object as ""huge, like a giant fireball.""  The caller said he looked toward the Atlantic Ocean and saw the object disappear into the sea.  Bart Lipofsky, a professor of physics and astronomy at Brevard Community College, said it more than likely sailed over the horizon instead of splashing down. He added many witnesses often make the same visual mistake.  Yates said callers to the Coast Guard station thought a boater might have been in trouble. ""A lot of people thought it might have been a flare that might have gone up,"" Yates said of other callers.  Babs Angel, a public affairs spokeswoman for Patrick Air Force Base, said no local military activity was taking place Tuesday night.  The Coast Guard in Brevard received more than 17 calls throughout the evening from residents and two police agencies, Yates said.  The Coast Guard base near Jacksonville also received calls.  ""It's kind of new to all of us. We're not used to meteors coming down at the beach,"" Yates said of that possibility.  Lipofsky was teaching a class Tuesday night and missed out on the show. When told of the range at which the object was seen, he said: ""Well, if it's a meteor, that's quite a fireball.  ""Another possibility is it could've been space junk coming out of orbit.""

I felt an intense erie presence and looked around but didnt see anybody or cars. I looked up to see a saucer directly above me.  That was at the point that i had stopped the car cause i sensed that the presence went at the speed and where my car went. i was feeling this thats why i looked up.  As soon as i looked up at the thing it took off at a slight angle and then straight up in a flash. i could see it getting smaller and then dissapear.  It made no sound. i have never before or after experienced anything like this but it was as clear to me as anything because ive been sober over 20 years.  The object was a metalic blue and silver.  It had a strange glow or haze in the sense that the colors almost faded or interchanged with each other and did not stay solid if that makes any sense. Like a fluxuation.  The year was between 2001 and 2002. In winter i believe. This is the only thing i am uncertain about.  I always said i should report it but never got around to it and just recently thought to do so when the debate came up again. I guess once youve seen one you get a little annoyed when people discount it and thats why im reporting it. nothing to gain but a little off my chest.I know what i saw.

John indicated that he had gone out right after dawn for his normal morning walk; the weather was crisp and clear with a crystal blue sky. Off to the SE he noticed an aircraft‘s contrail similar to those he had noticed during the past weekend.  He also observed that the aircraft appeared to be lower in altitude than when such vapor trails are normally formed.  The metallic aircraft color was readily apparent in the sunlight, and the contrail was white against the blue sky.  Suddenly the contrail stopped, and at this point the aircraft appeared to be about the size of a pencil eraser head at arm‘s length but incredibly, the aircraft seemed to have almost halted in the sky.  John watched as the contrail dissipated right up toward the back of the aircraft.  He also noticed that the body of the aircraft seemed a little too long as compared to others he had observed.  At that point, he realized there were no wings attached to the fuselage.  He continued his observation for 6 to 7 minutes until, moving very slow, it was lost from view with no change in it‘s appearance.  Upon receiving the above report from John about 10:00 AM, I noticed that the skies above Fayetteville and the Atlanta area 15 miles to the North, were full of jet aircraft making a very obvious checkerboard pattern of vapor trails (the sky was FULL). Inspection of these via binoculars and video zoom over the next few hours indicated they appeared to be the normal contrail vapor formations, slowly drifting more or less eastwards. Due to the aerial activity, this writer alerted other MUFONGA members in the Atlanta area. SSD/FI David Brown of Norcross (northern Atlanta suburbs) then indicated he would be outside most of the day and would conduct surveillance and report back later",2005-05-24T00:00:00,,

I went to pick up my daughter from school around 6:00 P.M.. in Okeechobee and when we were coming back home to Kissimmee prairie it was dark.  As I was about 2 miles from my camper trailer I saw a bright light hovering above the trees. I was not alone on this sighting; my three daughters were with me and they saw the light, too.  We were coming into the prairie and when I saw this bright light I slowed down; I wasn't sure what to make of it.  I did know I had never seen anything like it before. It was dark and the only thing I could see was the bright light flashing down in the trees. I knew it wasn't an airplane or helicopter because there wasn't any flashing colored light. This light stayed in one place until I got closer. When I got closer, about two blocks from it, the bright light turned off. This scared me. I knew whatever it was had seen the lights of my car so I hurried up and went home to my trailer which was four blocks north of the light.  When I got home I asked my husband if he'd seen the light and he said no, he was watching TV. I asked him to come outside and when he did I told him what I saw. He said it was an airplane; he didn't believe me.  While I was telling him about this bright light and looking in the same direction, the light came back on in the same place as before. We watched it for about fifteen minutes in one spot but it was not moving or making any noise. It was too dark to see anything except this bright light which just stayed in one place. After about fifteen minutes the lights turned off. I was really curious after this and stayed outside looking into the sky. Then, about five minutes from the time the light went off it reappeared north of my trailer over the trees again. This time it was moving slowly towards our trailer. I'd say it was about three blocks north of us this time. This was getting really scary by now. I could feel the hair on my arms standing up. We turned the lights on our car and the light in the sky went off. When the light reappeared for the third time it was a little further than before. This time it was over a cattle field. I kept an eye on it and couldn't believe what I saw. I saw lights being shot down from the huge light in the sky. I heard the noise the light beam made. I say ""light beam"" because that is the only type of noise I've ever heard like that.  That was on TV, so I'm not too fond of saying that. If I could describe it any other way I would.  When we saw this we jumped in our car and went closer to where other people lived.  In the prairie {Kissimmee} the houses and trailers  are not close to each other and in 2001 there were no street lights and the roads were not paved. I'd say there were about twenty houses in that area at the time. Around the area we were in we only had one neighbor who lived four blocks from us. The next day my three daughters went to school and asked our neighbor's kids if they'd seen the light and they said no, it was probably the military in the area. I'm from Louisiana and never saw such a thing before. I wouldn't know if it was military or not but I do know for a fact if wasn't a helicopter or airplane, for helicopters and airplanes don't stay in one spot for a long period of time and they have colored flashing lights and this didn't.

The object was solid because it blocked the stars overhead. It was extremely close to the ground because i could feel something like a light breeze only when the object was overhead and when the object passed, the breeze was gone. There were no sounds or anything other then a slight ""woosh"" sound as it went over head. I got out my camera to see if i could get a picture and the batteries were completely dead, although they had been replaced earlier that day.

Thursday 6/30/05 at around 5:35 pm, I was walking toward my car in the parking lot at work when I saw what looked to me like a round black object standing motionless high in the sky south east above the San Jose airport. I was looking up at an angle 135-140 degrees, considering straight up to be 180 degrees. To give an estimate of the size of the object in view, it would compare to that of holding up a cherry seed between ones thumb and forefinger at arms length. Now I can not begin to calculate its true size not knowing how high and the miles away the object was from where I stood. A moderate breeze was blowing toward the east. I assumed it could be a large weather balloon. Then after what seemed like a minute had passed, this round black object suddenly rotated revealing a disk or saucer shape. Within seconds of this new transformation, I began to notice a bright white flash every couple of seconds or so but randomly and not consistant. Then it began to free fall downward but in a way resembling a leaf falling from off a tree limb.  Twice I saw the bottom part, round and circular, tilt toward my direction so that I could see a faint orange glow or gold aura , even looked like it was sparkling somewhat . The object descended straight downward about a hand length. Then it hovered about 3 seconds before shooting upward like that of watching a bumble bee in flight. By this time I pretty much ruled out the notion of it being a large balloon. I heard a roar of a jet plane taking off from the San Jose Airport but could not see the plane until it got to a certain height heading northwest in my general direction. The large jet aircraft came into view as it ascended upward. I could now compare this unidentified object to the jet plane. The object was indeed considerably farther up and toward the south east than I had previously thought. The large commercial jet plane as it went overhead just slightly to the east of my position was the length of my thumbnail at arms length. After the Jet plane was nearly out of sight toward the northwest, this black disk shaped object currently hovering high up in the sky south east of the airport took off so rapidy that it vanished in just two seconds. I continued looking and then the object or another disk object reappeared out of no where for three seconds and then it vanished in thin air and did not reappear. I don't know what I just witnessed for nearly 2 minutes, but it is certainly a mystery to me that I am anxious for it to be solved!

This was on her blind side and we both heard it and it caused me to look over due to my angel I had a better view than she, however, we both saw this.

This evening just before 8:00 pm I went out on the deck to relax and just as I sat down I noticed a bright light heading in a westerly direction, above 10,000 ft. would be my estimate of altitude.   My first thought was an airliner heading west and reflecting massive sun. The sun was up quite high still and well above this craft.  It was still full daylight at this time.   I grabbed my binocs out of curiousity and what I saw was not an airliner in my opinion.  This craft moved very slowly, had no blinking lights that I could see, and no discernable shape. Just a bright shining light.  At one point a Cessna flew through the field of vision (flying North) which made it very clear that the light I was watching was NOT an airplane!  It did dim a few times after this and then seemed to veer to the left (South) and when doing this, became even more intense of a white light.  Just after that intensifying, it disappeared.  I continued to look with the binocs for several more minutes before giving up. I noted the time, 8:01. So, this is where it gets more curious.  I went inside at this time, took care of some things and went back out to the deck at 8:55.  I watched the same area for a few minutes and ...damn if I didn't see it again!!  This time it was orange and illuminated from the bottom (apparently) due to the sun being much lower and the sky becoming more orange with sunset.  It again moved very slowly in a different direction, more northwest I would say. I watched this time for under a minute before it disappeared, it got funky and hard to focus on with the binocs, like it was shimmering or something.  Then it was gone. Just thought it was strange enough to write in about. Perhaps someone else saw it too?   Thanks.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,

We had been out with some friends but they had gone home and we were just chilling out laying one of the benches near the beach so just looking up at the sky talking. It was a really clear night so lot of visible stars. It was him that first noticed it and he pointed it out to me. It looked exactly like a star..just a ball of light travelling pretty fast and very high as it was about the size of the north star so just a little bit bigger than the others. It wasnt a plane or helicopter we realised because it made no sound..was way to high up and was travelling way to fast. Also they have flashing lights on the wings etc. This did not flash. My first thought was shooting star/comet but we followed this thing across the sky watching it then we noticed another (previously stationary star) move and follow the same flight path. Then another 4 did the same they were still..and then they moved. We eventually stopped looking as i had to go home and we werent exactly liek 'wow' we were just like hey thats weird etc.  Second time - The second time was early july. I had been at my boyfriends house  that night and he was walking me home. We were on my street about 100 yards from my house and I saw this thing again..looked like a star again but this time it seemed closer as it was bigger. It was definatly the same thing as before..no noise no flashing etc. It moved pretty fast and then it stopped it then moved again and then it changed direction and seemed to go back like it was getting further away. It got smaller and smaller and disappeard within about 3 seconds. No other lights follwed this time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We were standing outside my parent's house in Arlington, Texas, facing North. The objects came in from the West, until they were over the house across the street at which time they made a leisurely turn to the North. I was at 97.xxxxxW 32.xxxxxN at the time, in fact, my parents still reside there. The objects were not at all impressive, being a gull grey in color and making no strange aerobatics.  I have a book by Robert Emenegger called ""UFOs, Past, Present and Future,"" and it has a sighting survey based upon the Observer's Data Sheet prepared for the USAF. I filled it out at the time and am using it to provide the data I'm entering here. I still remember it well, and will attempt to properly describe it in words, though my drawing from the time would be of better use. I have scanned the photo and stored it online at;  http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y20/ckirmser/UFOSighting.jpg   My mother and grandparents first called the objects to my attention. I went outside and was joined by my sister, her friend and my brother. We all saw them, and I had all but my grandparents sign the sighting report as witnesses. Now, however, they have nearly, if not totally, forgotten the episode.  When I got outside, I saw the objects coming in over the roof of the house to our left, westwards. I lived on a cul-de-sac, with the entrance on the east connecting to a north-south road. Our house is on the south-east corner facing the connecting road with the driveway leading to the entrance to the circle, where we were all standing.  When I saw the objects, I rushed inside to get my binoculars only to find that my sister had broken them from when she had last borrowed them; this is why the event is so prominent in my memory. I then got my telescope, a small thing from K-mart, maybe 50x, and dragged it outside. By the time I got back outside, the lead object was over the house across from our driveway, to the north, and had started its turn to the north.  I trained my telescope on the lead object and managed to get a lengthy view until it was just too much of a hassle keeping it in focus and trained, so I just used the Mark-1 eyeball until they went out of sight to the north. I had 8 minutes of clear view, except for my trip inside for my binoculars and telescope, before they disappeared into some clouds. There was only one star out at the time, and the moon wasn’t up until 9:30pm. The only other traffic I saw was an airplane on the opposite sky when the objects were almost out of view. I live near D/FW Airport, but it had only just opened back then and it’s a good bit away. Besides, I know aircraft, and was a member of the Air Force JROTC at my high school. I can’t think of any aircraft that would take 8 minutes to travel a mile, give or take.  To describe them, I think the best thing to do is to think of a Dorito chip with very rounded corners. Now, take the chip and bend the rounded corners up to form a shallow bowl shape. Put a small raised hump on top of the chip in the center (only just visible past the edge) and a small circular light on the bottom in each corner and that’s pretty much it. The view I had was a three-quarter view from the bottom, so all I saw of the seeming hump was just what poked over the edge. The bottom was very round as were the edges. The object was an overall grey, and the lights were pretty much just white spots, they weren’t bright at all, in fact, they weren’t even visible until I used the telescope and remains of my binoculars. The objects didn’t give off any light or sound and made a very slow leisurely trip across the sky; as I had said, nothing impressive at all. I still have the drawings of it, and can forward them in future if you so desire and I can get to a scanner. I reported the sighting to the police that same day, but I have no idea if they kept any record or anything. Well, that’s about it. I’ve tried to put down all I could think of and could find on that sighting survey, and I hope it helps. Feel free to contact me about it at the email address below.

We both observed several boomerang shaped disks with a red light in the center.One was larger than the rest.They were all hovering and the smaller ones would move only if the large one moved first.They would follow it quickly in a haphazard manner, kind of jutting around in the sky until they would stop and hover near the large craft.  We agreed that he would call the Wharton police and I would go home and call the Dover police.I could see the objects all the way home to my house and was fearful as I knew these were UFOs.I went in and told my parents then called the Dover police.They laughed at me and hung up the phone.The Wharton police also laughed at my friend and did nothing. My mother, father,and I stood at the top of a hill in our back yard and watched these spacecrafts for at least 2 hours.  We got tired and went to bed.I have been hesitant to tell anyone this story because my family and close friends never did believe me and still tease me about it to this day.I would guess there were about one dozen of these boomerang shaped crafts.All had a red light in the center and although it was dark,appeared to be solid gray or black.They appeared to be hovering over the town of Dover as we faced them and watched intently for so long.Once the police laughed at me,what was I to do?Who else could I call?It feels so good to finally tell my story to someone who doesn't think I'm crazy.I know what I saw.Thanks for listening.

We got off our bikes and watched the object for about five minutes in its stationary position. It made no noise of any kind. It then,literally, accelerated at tremendous speed to a point 45 degrees to the west and below the treeline about five miles away. The point where we were standing was atop a hill above the surrounding area. Within another second or so it began rising above the treeline to the northwest. After a few seconds of rising above the treeline to a point about 45 degrees in declination, it began quickly accelerating  up and down and side to side in 180 degree reversals of direction while wobbling. It remained black in color throughout this 10 minute period from the start of our observation, again making no noise and was now positioned about five to seven miles distant.  It also appeared to have a slight atmospheric disturbance around its immediate periphery. I could not believe what this object was doing in terms of its erratic movements, apparently without being affected by the force of gravity. If it were, all on board would have been crushed to death due to their own inertia.  The object then came toward us and again was almost directly overhead at the one o'clock position facing Nortwest but very low perhaps no nore than a few thousand feet. It was highly polished, appearing black because it appeared to be reflecting light. It tilted downward towards us and I could then see the shiny metallic-chrome looking surface with an elevated central section, about one-third the diameter of the craft. It then righted itself and slowly moved away back over the treeline to the west where it had disappeared over the treeline the first time.  I have seen weather balloons, aircraft of all types and even the SR-71 Blackbird at several hundred feet of altitude in 1965 when it was still top-secret. I could see the pilots with their spacehelmets on throught the cockpit windows and the red pin stripes that surrounded the fuselage.I did not find out what it was until 1975 when I saw it in an Air Force recruiting station. I have seen videos of UFO's that looked and acted exactly like the one I saw on television, and have downloaded pictures online several years ago of the object that I saw as photographed by others all over the world. Those pictures show the same black-appearing underside that I saw when looking up at the craft, and also the shiny metallic chrome-like upper surface when obseving the craft at an angle from the side.  I am convinced that the black on the underside only appears black because it reflects light, and at certain angles, much like a mirror can appear to be black to an outside observer.  I am a science teacher and an amateur astronomer with an 18"" Obsession telescope with Binovision. I am thoroughly versed in astronomy and the sciences and I can tell you unequivocally that this craft was definitely not of this world. A few years ago I downloaded a picture taken by someone in Switzerland in 1975,the same year as my observation, and I have e-mailed it to you using your hyperlink. I hope this is helpful.

In this event, I saw (four to six blocks high in the sky)an oval shaped ship Ca. 450 feet long and 250 feet tall. The color was changing, but basically a very light gray and covered with a (seemingly partly frozen mist of smokey, foggy white), very much like frozen carbon dioxide clinging to the surface all over, except in certain areas. The areas would change covering, and I could see and witness the change and the exposure of a very detailed mechanical system or device. There was a matrix or grid pattern of vent holes, which were about two feet in diameter each and two feet apart. These were checkerboarding (although round and not aquare)an area of about twenty feet or 40 feet in diameter and basically round, but not perfectly round due to the shifting nature of the fog covering. The grid pattern of holes had a thick brownish, mixed with blackish, smokey substance flowing at the rate of approximately two gallons per second streaming from each port (hole, exhaust port) into each adjacent hole, and also the same substance was streaming from each adjacent port into each other adjacent port, so that all ports had the substance streaming both in and also out and from each adjacent port in the same manner. I can draw a picture or series of pictures dipicting these events in great detail. And, later, a minute, another area would be exposed on the skin (surface of the ship) and repeat the same event. I watched this series happen two times very clearly, and on the third time, the ship was being partly hidden among sirrus clouds partly and was crossing over Broad Rock Road four to six city blocks high in the sky, about the same distance high as when I first spotted the ship.  It was difficult to stare at the ship without blinking my eyes. I was not comfortable with the thought of not having a camera or of not being able to continue learning and watching. As I stared more and more, the ship was slipping into the sirrus clouds almost as if the ship were to some extent creating the clouds or some of the clouds.  I did not want to loose sight of it. I was riding my bicycle and had stopped at the corner of Broad Rock Road, one block south of Orlando Street. In seconds, the ship sped away. I looked and stared and searched the sky in the direction it was travelling, and I was disappointed that it had vanished or gone out of my sight. I have never gotten this off of my mind at any time since then, except for a few days at a time.  I think about it veru often, every few days or weeks. I tell people about it, draw pictures and make estimations regarding the activities of the mechanical parts. Maybe this was a cover, maybe a propelling factor, a disguise, or a cooling system. This was on a late summer day. This could have been engines, exhausts, or gas exchange for changing the dimensional atomic makup of the density factor in apparent spacial configuration. I have developed a series of (plans), which depict the apparent configuration of the atomic and subatomic properties. It is theory and hypothetical, but it explains the phenominum in this way. When I speak of emmiting lights, I am speaking of the fact that I saw light from it or light reflecting from it. I did not see any things that would be defined as headlights or metallic fixtures. But, I do seem to possess amazing clarity as to the possible makup of the ship.

It was a split second reversal and continued passing the other direction until I lost it behind a tree stand. We took the event lightly but I have never forgotten it.

The duration of my stargazing session was probably from around 8 PM to nearly 10PM that nite. Just to be safe, I'd say that the hours from 730PM to 11PM found me outside looking up.  Well about the time I get up to go inside, my mom or dad, comes out back to get me. Here's the odd part. I'm right outside a little ways into the back yard (which is chainlink fenced for our dog) to be apart from the ambient light from the house. We had sliding glass doors to the back yard and a small concrete patio.  So I'm out in the yard and instead of going right into the den through the sliding doors I get up  and walk north to  the yard fence gate and go through it around to the carport and enter the house through the utility/laundry room into the kitchen. I took off my coat and may have had a blanket to put away and then go into the kitchen which opens into the den.  Huh....no family in the den??? Wonder where they went, I'm thinking? About that time they all ( both parents, older brother, and younger sister) come back into the house through the sliding glass doors into the den. The ensuing conversation goes something like this. Where'd you guys go?-I ask. Out back looking fo you! -they replied. All of you?-I ask. Yea,...did you see it? See what? The UFO! No,........you guys are kidding me, right? NO! didn't you SEE it? No, I didn't. Where was it? What did it look like? It was right over the house, It was HUGE, black and made no noise! They all were looking at me quite seriously and no acting or practical joking was going on because my disbelief and smiling about their responses should have cracked at least my little sister's composure. She was about10 -11 years old at the time. You guys are joking, right? No! they insisted. How big was it? What color was it? What did it do, where did it go? What did it look like? WHY didn't you get me? They thought I was also looking at it the same time but didn't see me because I was walking around the house and went under the carport. Plus they were all looking up.  My dad, a 20 year Army pilot then got a sheet of notebook paper folded it in half and drew what they witnessed. It was silent, dark grey or flat black in color without insignia of any kind visible. No panels, windows, landing gear, protrusions or cockpit were visible. Four small red lights located on the underside that were constant in nature were seen. The altitude was twice a telephone pole above the ground as it flew over telephone poles and the tree tops in our neighborhood at the time were lower than this.   Size of the craft was in the 60-80 foot width and 45-55 foot length. Flat was the general profile description my family gave. The drawing my dad did within a couple of minutes of the sighting was that of a trapezoid, not a true triangle, but an equilateral triangle with the apex missing  at near the half-way point.  No rounded edges or bulges. The small red lights were located near the corner points of the craft. Altitude and speed remained constant during viewing. They viewed it for about 90 seconds to two minutes as it went from North to South across the backyards of Victoria drive (map availabel upon request) crossing Rucker Blvd and continuing  on out of view. Estimated speed was between 5 and 25 MPH maybe closer to 10 MPH. My dad held up his hand palm down and demonstrated a slow, smooth flight. He also indicated that he could have hit it with a baseball, hand thrown. Kind of amazing to me after all these evenings that I'm out back with good quality ""big eyes"" as I call them (binox) and my normal path into the house would have put me right into the den with the family, but noooo, I go slowly around the house under the carport while the first of my family members to see the craft calls the rest outside to witness the event and I miss the whole thing.

No one has taken me seriously because I was so young and could not recall the exact year though I know it was 1975 0r 1976. I remember it was 8pm and my brother and I were having a stick fight (like a sword duel) outside of the house when my Mother (now deceased) went into the house.  While we were playing I noticed a light in the sky and pointed it out to my brother. Within a blink of an eye it was close to 200 feet away from our road and then it dipped down and hovered over our driveway in front of us. Now it was about 20 feet away from us and it looked like a meteor with craters and it changed from orange to white then to red. It was about the size of a volkswagen bug. It hovered there for a couple minutes and made no sound, absolutely silent. I asked my brother what it was and he said he didn't know. My brother was 7 or 8 years old at the time, but I recall the UFO better than him. I asked my brother, what if aliens come out of it? That's when we ran to our door which seemed to be locked. My Mom opened the door and said it wasn't locked.  We never saw the UFO again but I recall not getting much sleep that night. Years later I looked in the Newtown Bee (a local newspaper) for articles about it, because others had been witnessing UFOs at the same time, I came up empty handed. I knew it was in the paper because my Mom told my brother and I that it was published. I know I don't recall dates and ages well but the UFO itself was real and I remember it like it was yesterday. I hope this helps others who may have witnessed the same object in Newtown. I know it WASN'T a meteor because it would have made quite an impact in our driveway.

I was crying, too, because whatever it was, it was making us all upset.  After about five minutes, I don't recall what happened, because for whatever reason, I fell alseep.  Weird, I know, but I swear it happened.  I woke up sometime later, and we three were sitting there, shocked, and the light was gone.  My mom and her friend - to this day - swear they had missing time, about 10 minutes worth.  I hope this helps... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I have never talked about this with anyone except my sister and parents. I was about six at the time, and had never heard of the word UFO.   My father was a pilot in the Army, at one time we lived near Edwards AFB saw lots of wierd things the government was flying easily explainable.  We were at my neighbors house in Glennville Georgia its located approximately 30 minutes away from Ft. Stewart.  ((witness #1)) who was also six, ((witness #2)) about eight, and his older brother about seventeen, my sister who was eleven and me.   We were jumping on ((witness #2)) trampoline and ((Witness #1)) pointed to the sky and said look at those lights over there.  There were two bright white lights in the distance. They looked like very bright street lights to me. Just ignored them and kept on jumping. I can't tell you the exact date when it happened but it was in the summer of either '76 or '77.  ((witness #1)) had to go home to eat dinner and it was getting darker. Sometime later we decided we better head home as well. Before we set off down the road I looked over at the lights and they appeared to be getting bigger.  I dismissed them again and walked along side my sister.  My sister says she was watching them the whole time and that they were following us.   I noticed the wind started to pick up and dust was blowing everywhere which I was farmiliar with because helicopters do the same thing. My sister screamed out run they're following us.  At which point I looked up over my shoulder and saw a craft wing that looked alot like the Stealth.  But it had lights on it that had such a bright clarity to them like halogen lights but brighter and white.  It made no noise and its movements were serpentine in motion it moved very slow almost hovering and it made no sound.   I took off running and left my sister behind.  I remember running into the house hysterical saying its got my sister, its got my sister.  Soon after my sister came in crying in a panic too.  So my dad went outside to see what it was and there was nothing.  It left without making a sound.  To this day my sister never talks about it, it was so horrifying. My dad being a pilot said that planes can cut their engines off and glide.  I excepted that and when they declassified the Stealth Bomber I thought that would explain it.  I saw the Stealth and it makes a lot of noise.   Nothing I have seen flown by the military that I know of can compare to the technology of what ever that was that me and my sister saw that summer night. My sister can give you a better description because she was watching it the whole time, but she won't talk about it.

Then all of a sudden there were 2 orange ball shapes, about 10 sec later another appeared from below horison, they traveled up, stopped, one circled other, then 2 more came up, they made a square formation, then about every 10 to 20 seconds another orange ball appeared.  At one point there were 5 together still, then eventually they dispersed and either flew south or faded into sky. I DID TAKE PICTURES and called a neighbour,who also saw them, she also had company who saw. The pictures do not show the red ball shape, however some show the shape similar to that of a mosquito, within a smokey area.Other pictures show what looks like a swirlling of smoke. They appeared above trees of an island, which is on the Saint Marys River, where we live. You can see a night marker of the shipping channel, in pictures that show ufos, that marker is about 3 kilometers away. In photos they seem closer than the markers to our home.

I looked up and my eye was immediately caught by a bright light moving upwards and to the left at speed. I tracked the object as it moved and the light became less bright as it ascended upwards. Then it faded into a mere speck of light but stayed completely still again. The object was about 65 degrees and was white in colour. I then watched as it got brighter again and looked as if it was on it's way back down again. It then moved down and to the right at an incomprehensible speed covering a significant distance in an instant, before coming to an abrupt dead stop (not a controlled gradual slowdown). I told my wife what I'd seen and together we watched the object go bright and then fade and then go bright again, all the time it darted from side to side, up and down in a series of eratic instant movements. We watched it from 10.30pm until 11.20 It stayed there until at least midnight, after that we went to bed. My wife went inside complaining of a sore neck after watching this thing for 50 minutes.  I looked around the sky and seen another object which was around 30 degrees this time.  It was orange coloured and much closer I guessed since the light was bigger and far more noticeable.  It too was getting bright, then getting faded again and was engaging in the same sort of eratic dancing manouveres as the first object. This time I had a good point of reference.  There was a telegraph pole to the left of the object and I stood watching from a fixed position while the object disappeared behind my line of sight behind the telegraph pole and then re-emerged again.  It also moved up and down some estimated 10 degrees in altitude all throughout the time we watched it. A third smaller light could be seen in a different portion of the sky.

The object exited the clouds, growing slowly in brightness until it was in the clear starry sky.  The slow brightening of the object showed how low the object was. A jet would have instantly appeared. This object was in the low surrounding clouds.  The object traversed from west to east, at about a 40-45 degrees above the horizon. We were facing north north west.  It had no blinking lights. It was white in color. The brightness remained constant upon exiting the clouds up until it disappeared into another cloud blank to the east.  The object made no sound. It was very quiet out. Our property had just flooded and we could hear wate trickling 50 yards away. We waited a few minutes but heard no sounds of a jet or a Cessna.  I looked for an exterior structure around the orb as it passed across the many stars. The stars remained constant. It was only a sphere with a slight haze surrounding it.  The speed was consistent with a jet at 30,000 feet, and much faster than a Cessna. We live within 3 miles of the local airport, so we are familiar with their night time speeds and flight patterns. Thsi was not a Cessna.  The object also had what I call a ""bob and weave"" motion to it. It did not fly in a completely straight trajectory.

In the winter we lose the leaves that obscure the skyline in front of our kitchen windows. I'd say we are about 3-4 stories high.  Now that the leaves have fallen we can see the city pretty easily through he tree branches.  Since it was a clear night out and we were cooking dinner I was in my kitchen and looking out at the sky line and sky - we eat late.  I could see the typical air-traffic approaching Logan as well as the high altitude military and international flights that go over Boston daily.   Immediately my attention was drawn to a VERY bright  white light, slight reddish hued edges at first, that seemed like an approaching airliner but it didn't move, or so I thought.  It was very twinkly.  Wondering if it was a star or a planet I continued to look at it until I noticed, thanks to the position of the tree branches, that the light was indeed moving but very slowly (there was little to no wind outside).  I called out to another person in the kitchen to come to the window and have a look.  He saw it immediately (you'd have to be legally blind to miss it) and he was at a loss as to what it could be since he saw that it was indeed moving but more so like hovering.  He went to see to dinner and I kept watching.  Suddenly it got brighter and I could see on both the left, right, and the bottom edge, the light became more oblong, that there were two red lights that could be seen partially through the bright white in the center.  The other person heard me yell out and came to see it too.  Just as suddenly as it brightened it started to dim.  The white light part turned all red and just faded out til it was gone -  like CRT TV's that have the center dot that fades out.  The whole time typical aircraft were flying above and near(ish) the object.  It was much larger and brighter than any of them regardless of altitude.  Thinking it was a star, I thought I would try and see if it was there the next night.  Venus and Mars have been pretty big in the sky over the last months so I thought I'd wait until I could rule it out.  Of course it was cloudy the next two nights but the third night was crystal clear (11/17/05).  Not one star would have even come close as to rule it one in the same.  Not that you can see a ton in the city anyway.  There were none in the area where this seem to be in the sky.  As a point of reference, the Prudential Tower was directly below it's position.  From my point of view I'd guess the light was 40 degrees altitude/10 degrees azimuth.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,42.3416629506008,-71.06563371161549

Since I had taken her out at 11:30 p.m., before I went to bed, I thought it quite unusual, but took her anyway. I was outside with enough time to sit down on my front steps when a movement in the southwest sky made me look up.  I will do my best to describe what I saw. If I had to compare the object I saw in the sky to something I have seen in my life, I would have to say it had a rectangular shape and moved somewhat in an undulating way, like a jellyfish. The outline and brightness of the thing against the dark sky was very crisp and clear. It was bright, glowing white. It had a white oval disk, which I’ll now call a head. The head seemed to lead what I’ll now call a tail. The tail was the same width as the head. The oval head was solid white and distinguishable from the tail because the tail was transparent but streaked with white light. When I say transparent, I mean I could see the dark sky behind the tail part but I could not see the dark sky behind the white oval. The tail moved in graceful, undulating like way. The object never stopped moving. It seemed to me it had a destination. At times it seemed to almost dip as it moved across t he sky, which made it seem fluid.  It made no noise.  My thoughts at the time: What is THAT? It’s so much bigger than a star or plane. It’s so defined and crisp, it looks like a cartoon or a fluorescent light. The light is coming from within it. It’s graceful. It flows. It’ll be gone before I can get a camera. I’ve never seen anything like this before. I didn’t feel threatened but I was a little scared.  When I first sighted it, it appeared to be moving at me, coming from southwest direction but then began moving west. As it did so, the tail seemed to undulate, almost as if it were blowing in the wind, like you might see flag or a scarf do in a light breeze. However, there was no wind that night. The leaves were not blowing in the trees.  At some point after it began moving west, my dog noticed it. She had just finished relieving herself when it must’ve caught her attention. At 2:30 am there were no other people or animals around to distract her. My dog, a beagle, has never barked at anything in the sky before, but she looked up and began a frantic, sharp bark. She has a bay type bark but when she noticed the thing in the sky, her bark was frantic and sharp. As I recall, my dog was looking up in the direction of the thing in the sky but her head was moving as if she couldn’t quite focus. I was really surprised that she was barking at something in the sky and was having a hard time myself because I couldn’t understand what it was I was looking at.  I’m a nearly 50-year-old professional and have never seen anything like that in my life. As it was 2:30 in the morning and my dog was barking frantically and I have neighbors, so I had to pull her inside. The object in the sky was moving in a northwestly direction in an undulating way when I last saw it.

If anyone else witnessed this object, we would very much like to receive reports from the witnesses.

It was too high to be a streetlight, but I thought that it could possibly be an indicator fr airplanes.  Regardless, I was transfixed.   As I drove closer, expecting to find the pole to which it was attached, it seemed to drop in the sky.  I assumed this was just spacial relation due to my coming nearer, but it dropped vertically in the sky and gradually moved across Michigan Avenue as I was driving straight ahead.   Driving under it, I simply could not take my eyes of it. If it had been a plane, it was flying unusually low, and had a very strange shape.  Given that I've seen many planes flying at night, and the constancy of this objects light (as opposed to the strobe action of planes), this was not a plane.   So enthralled by the hovering craft, that just seemed to linger over the building opposite the side it just crossed, I pulled off to the shoulder and tried not to let it leave my sight.   In the time between me taking my seatbelt off and clamboring to the passenger window, it was gone.   One of the strange things I noticed about this was my inability to identify just how close it was.  As I got closer to its location above me, I could differentiate it from a mass of really bright light, into a grouping of lights that centered a greenish/blue light.  I thought that it could be some remote control objectt because I was stumped as to how close it was, and what it was doing.   There is no possible way that could have a plane.  The brightness of the light, the motion, and my inability to identify anything at all common about that object tell me one thing - I witnessed something incredibly out of the ordinary.

We informed flight services of incoming traffic in the opposite direction after a few seconds they cam back a told us that earlier in the day there had been a helicopter fly by at a funeral. I didn't think so because of the manuevers and the fact that it was at night.

After landing we pulled off the runway and stopped to watch the lights. they seemed to be all separated none of them were attached to another. about a quarter of a mile out they all turned north heading 360 degrees and few off that way. we watch untill they were out of sight.

I looked up and at first I didn't see it, but then all these pin point white lights were darting in and out of the clouds.  Everytime you could see lighting flash inside the clouds these dots of light would zoom into the tops of the thunderstorm and then shoot back out.  It reminded me of a game of tag. There were so many of them.   Once, a plane came from the north (a passenger plane I think) and a light chased it for a few seconds then abruptly headed back to the clouds.

I had already heard about the ""globes of light"" and seen the video-tapes of the Ligurian Ufological Center, but I was at the same time captivated and sceptic. Now I am even more intrigued since I have seen with my own eyes this extraordinary event and I am not alone, also my friends and their wives have seen it. We all agree in to say that what we have seen is an ufological phenomenon. Now we wonder: what will they say those pilots of the airplanes that have surely sighted it? F.M. & c.""

There was a slight haze (maybe reflected light off of clouds) around the lights. My first impression was fireworks or flares of some kind, however, these lights were hovering, and not falling, (like flares) or extinguishing (like fireworks). The large cluster was visible for about 2 miles (driving at 45mph), then were cut off from view by a shelter belt.  After passing said shelter belt, three were still visible. We then drove towards the holyrood area just to gawk. (Hey, it was interesting OK?) The size of the lights never seemed to change, though after six miles, perspective demonstrated the lights to be over 300 feet in the air. Only two were visible at this point, and much higher than the red warning light on Holyrood's grain elevator, and possibly at great distance, since they seemed to stay in a given area thought the red lights postion changed with distance our vehicle traversed.  These two remained until 10 to 15 minutes after we returned home (three more miles). I do not know or claim as what they were, as I just saw hovering lights. However, the color was wrong for any type of aircraft searchlight (second though I had) or aircraft designator or landing lights (third thought).",2005-05-11T00:00:00,38.5688,-98.5723

As the car approached closer and closer to the remaining sphere it was still stationary with no noise from the craft.  Did not stay near the craft out of fear from the outcome.

When I turned back around the light was STILL in the exact place it was before. It just hung there like a star, but unlike any star I ever saw. So of course we pointed the telescope at it. When I zoomed in and got a look at it, it was sooo weird. It reminded me of a rocket ship, the way the flames shoot out of the back, except they were flashing lots of colors. There was definetly some sort of solid object in the middle. So thats all it did, stay in one place and flash red, blue and green. After taking my eye from the telescope, I noticed another one,in the same area of the sky. It was a little further away or something because it wasn't as bright, but it had the same flashy colors. So, after looking at it a little longer, we went inside. The next few nights we watched for it. Each night for the past 3 or 4 we have seen them in different areas of the sky.

We took a closer look with binoculars and a telescope. The best way to describe it was that it looked like a candle flame - one that you would see in a drawing or cartoon. It had the same teardrop shape and through the telescope you could see that there was a central ridge of blank dividing the two orange flares. This object moved slowly vertically into the sky, and disappeared. It was immediately followed by a second object of the same description, which appeared over the mountain ridge and then slowly ascended and disappeared. About 5 minutes later, a third object repeated this same pattern. The entire incident took about 15-20 minutes. The objects were very far in the distance. The objects moved almost directly perpendicular to the horizon, indicating that they were ascending.

As I looked up, I noticed saw a small airplane (propeller) crossing the sky.  I was facing south west and the sun was going behind some buildings.  It was a clear day.  Few clouds.   As I was watching the small plane fly over (it was headed NW), I noticed what looked like one of those small mylar balloons pass between my view and the low flying plane.  I got up from my weight machine and walked over to the window to get a better look.  What was strange was that it was difficult to focus in on.  They seemed out of focus to me.  I could see that there was something there but I had a hard time keeping my eye on it.  But I kept staring at it expecting it to move with whatever way the wind was blowing.  But it didn't move in any particular direction.  It simply seemed to float around a very small area in the sky.  I don't think one of those silver mylar baloons would do that.  They would probably float away.  But this ""orb"" did not.  I thought it was reflecting light but I think it was somewhat ""bright"".  Here is the weird part.  Once I got used to looking at it, all of a sudden other orbs ""popped"" out at me.  They all seemed to be floating around each other.  They didn't cross paths or move over each other, but they did seem to waver around a bit.  They were all shiny and somewhat ""bright"".   I've since thought about it and realized that the setting sun might have had something to do with why they ""popped"" out into my view.  I think increased infrared light from the lowering sun has something to do with being able to ""see"" them.   I've since seen the Mexico City ufo video footage and realized that my orbs look just like those UFOs.

It was really foggy and directly across from us was a light pole, that was in front of a very large clearing between two forests. We were stopped waiting for the light to turn green for our turn to go. My girlfriend and I were in my 1981 RS Camaro. The light finally turned green and I began slowly turning left to go down U.S. 37.  About half-way through I noticed the fog behind the light pole beginning to seperate and the crest of the UFO appear. I immidiately stopped and watched. Subsequently everyone else 4 other cars I noticed also stopped. The object emerged through the fog and the light of the light pole shined on it. It was colored like coal, black but shiney. It had alot of contouring, similar to that of the UFOs in the movie Independance Day.  At first the nose of it (assuming the nose) was pointing down and it looked like it was about to crash into the ground. Maybe a few feet from the ground, it then began to slow down and pull up. Almost like a computer in slow-motion. After which, It just hung there and didn't move.  It was very very big, from what I could see sticking out of the fog, it had to be as wide as the clearing itself. At this time their is now a Super Wal-Mart in that very same clearing to give you an idea on its size. The object made no sound at all, except for the sound of the air rumbling around it. And their were no lights of any kind that I could observe. It was probably 80-90 ft in front of us, about 20ft from the ground.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,41.09336991071429,-85.1455725

They appeared to be maybe chasing each other.  It really could have been birds by their movements but I couldn't see any wings and they were so small that, if they were birds, they would have been very high.

We sat in our loungers watching the sky for about a 1/2 hour or so, but only saw the usual satillite or two, and a shooting star.  Then, just before we were getting ready to head in, I caught something out of the corner of my eye moving in the sky toward us from over our house, coming from the South East, headed North West. As I focused on it, I could see the outline of a black, triagular craft, with seven yellowish, very dim lights on the bottom.  Three of the lights were along the bottom left, three along the bottom right and then one light at the tip. The body was very black against the sky and the underside lights looked just like round, recessed lighting you'd put in your house, but with the dimmer turned way down.  It blended so well with the sky that had I not been staring straight up, I probably would not have seen it.  As it moved, the bottom of the craft seemed to always be facing us, since you could not see any depth to it...it looked very thin and flat.  At this point, I started pointing up and yelling for my husband to look ...he did and to my surprise, he saw exactly what I did...a big, black triangle, flying quite low, at what appeared to be just a few thousand feet.  It made absolutely no noise and moved very smoothly like a glider through the sky.  It came from over the front of our house, passed over our backyard and then disappeared as it moved behind the trees at the back of our property.  As for the speed, it was moving moderately fast, but slow enough that we were able to view it for 1 1/2 - 2 minutes.  I had seen something very strange in the sky many years ago, but was alone at the time and had no one with me in order to do a ""reality"" check.  This time, though, I could not believe that my husband was actually seeing the same thing that I was.  Those few minutes were very surreal. The whole experience was quite exciting, yet very disquieting at the same time -- what was it that we saw?????

Now - today - she says and I know she's not lying that because of my blunt ""see nothing"" she didn't say much more about what happened,  Imaging a university at closing time when all students go home.

They didn't see her.  Now the whole thing made me think of a story I read long ago of somebody in Waterloo and saw suddenly a part of Napoleon's army (from 1815) passing by - hurling - crying - smell included etc.  I can imaging the past comes strangely to live but in this case : This passing by of that balloon which created a real physical tunnel effect - and you saw that tunnel effect 15 minutes later still present !

I tried to sleep through the sound, again still thinking that someone was mowing the lawn.  But the sound went from soft to loud, like it was moving far and near.  I still could not get back to sleep and was already intrigued by the unfamiliarity of the sound.  I decided to check it out.  I looked out the window and I saw in the sky just above the trees bright ligts, white, blue and yellow, moving very slowly horizontally.  That was the one that was making the humming or whirling sound. I woke my husband up because I thought I just saw a UFO.  He also saw the lights but he dismissed it as just a helicopter hovering.  And went right back to sleep.  I observed it for some more minutes because I could not believe that it was only a helicopter.  I know how a helicopter sounds like.  But this one was really different.  It hovered close to our building and I thought I saw a light beaming from it down the ground, like a huge flashlight looking for something.  If it was a police helicopter then where are the police cars?  Nothing was happening in the area, no movement of people or cars.

Then, as weird as it sounds, we got bored and decided to go on our journey assuming that we would read about it in the newspaper the next day.  The next day, the Philadelphia newspaper had an article about a citing of a UFO near Baltimore Pike, which is probably 20 miles from where we saw the object.  My memory is that the object was more circular or oval; however, my huband remembers it as cigar shaped.  I think that it was a silver metallic color.  It was hoving over a very congested area of the city.  People were walking on the sidewalk, but I did not notice anyone else looking up, and we did not tell anyone to look up.

((Sentence deleted, at request of source of report.  Describes position of witness.))   We observed aircraft arriving and departing Limestone AFB regularly as this was an active base during the cold war. We had interceptors stationed there and at Bangor International and often these aircraft where deployed to intercept suspicious aircraft that would fly down the Newfoundland and New Brunswick coast off the Eastern seaboard enroute to Cuba. Long range Bear Bombers regularly made the trip and were regularly intercepted and shadowed. This night I watched and object from the North approach Limestone at a very high rate of speed. When a radar sweep moves around it does so at a constant rate of rotation. During the time it paints a target and the next time a slow object moves but centimeters on the screen a fast one might move several.  This object moved 10's of centimeters and just as suddenly topped over Limestone. I watched the object not move for several moments nad then our set did not paint it. Usually that means the object is on the ground and not discernable by radar beam. After a short time maybe 8 to 12 mintes the object reappeared and hovered again. It then made a direct path north and was off the scope in a matter of a few sweeps. I remember this only as I heard of the ""sighting"" in the ensuing days. I did not discuss what I saw as at the time what we saw on the Radar set often had National Security implications. An example of speed we sometimes tracked very high speed targets that could move from one side of our scope to the other in less than 12 sweeps. These aircraft were used for reconnaisance and very fast. We tracked the Concorde on it's maiden flight when it landed at Bangor International. It took about 25 or more sweeps to cross the scope. The obejct that night departed Limestone and was out of range in less than 5 sweeps. That would give it a velocity in excess of 4,000 MPH. All of our Radar signals were sent on to NORAD. They were also often recorded for analysis purposes. Whether this incident was I do not know. We tracked objects all the time that seemed faster than what we knew of. This was the only one I recall where a ground sighting coincided with a radar observation. I can say that the raw radar imagery was seldom viewed as most systems used the SIF/IFF transponder data. I may have been the only person watching. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",2005-04-16T00:00:00,,

There was a little side trail of to the right, we drove to the end of it. It was mostly clear, not to cold with just a little snow trying to fall.  A great alaskan night. We were making small talk looking out into the night sky when I noticed the red dot moving accross the sky high up, traveling in a south easterly direction. I pointed it out to randy because the dot seemed to move pretty fast for a high flying Jet. As we watched we noticed it getting bigger. We did not see any other lights. It got bigger,I told ((name deleted)) it must be a plain getting ready to land at the local small air strip and wondered why his landing lights where not on.The last thing ((name deleted)) said was that the air port was of to side of us and not in front of us. And yes I could clearly see what he was talking about, this red ball was now getting huge, coming directly at us, just above the trees.I dont recall him or I saying anything at that time, just looking out the windshield. It stoped above the trees in front of us, it was awesome, at least 25 or 30 feet accross,it felt strange sitting in the cab of the truck looking out at this big red Ball,I could see like a liquid moving from the right to the left on it's surface wich gave me the sence that it was round. Every thing in front of us was in a red glow but not bright.I remember saying;what the hell is this, randy was silent.I dont know how long we looked at it, then suddenly there was this very loud metalic crashing sound, but not like a car crash, a lot shorter, but load.The red orb was gone.  I know we both jumped.The truck was cold, I jumped  out of the truck thinking a tree had fallen on it,but there was nothing.It mast have been snowing because we had 6 or 7 inches of snow, and not a track or sign of what might have made that awfull sound.((name deleted)) started the truck and we got the hell out of there.

I was west of Tangier,Morocco.  Additional witnesses were my wife ((name deleted)), tour guide ((name deleted)), and a taxi driver.  The day was sunny and the sky was clear of clouds.  The landscape was arid, barren and obscure of any vegetation.  I could view approximately 25-30 miles of horizen.   The taxi was directly west of Tangier moving in an easterly direction.  I observed a bright, stationary light in the sky in the direction of the city.  The light appeared as a large conventional aircraft with running lights on and that would be flying directly towards you.  I asked the tour guide ""where is the airport?""  He indicated to the right and south of our position.  I noticed that the light did not change in intensity or altitude as a descending/ascending plane would have.   After observing the bright light for about one minute, I observed three silver disc move out from the light and stop.  They remained stationary for approximately 20-30 seconds before they maneuvered slightly outward and upward from the light.  They moved very rapidly, almost in formation, and became stationary.  Two additional sets of three silver disc moved out from the light and jockeyed around in different positions.  They moved rapidly to positions and became stationary, other than an occasional adjustment by singular discs but basically remained in sets of three disc per formation, comprising a total of nine disc.   I approximated the size of the craft to be 30-35 feet in length and 6-8 feet high.  Their movements were basically smooth and in formation.  The first set of three disc moved slightly in their formation and I had the perception that they were playing or were ready for a ""drag race""  After observing the entire formation of ten craft for approximately one minute, the first set of three disc took off at a very hight rate of speed towards the south.  They had covered approximately one-third of the 20-25 mile horizon, when the two other sets of three took off.  Nothing appeared to be any type of mirror reflections of light.   All three sets of disc after taking-off were only visible for approximately 4 seconds before they moved out of my range of view to the south.  As soon as I lost sight of the flying disc, I looked back to the area of the lighted craft, expecting to see the light or a dark silouette like a plane would appear with its running lights off.  Nothing was visible.  The craft was gone.  I did not have a video camera, or camera.  Of course, this type of photo or video would be valid proof of aircraft technology far beyond public comprehension.  I would be a millionaire and very famous individual had I possessed cameras that day.  The vehicles traveled in excess of several thousands of miles per hour.   I am a retired Navy Commander and have been in association with current technology that the military openly possessed.  These vehiles surpassed the military SR 71, F-16, stealth bomber, Aurora or any other fathomable aircraft that we could imagine.  The incident I observed in November 1976 might also correlate to the contact that the Iranian military pilot had in September 1976 in which a spherical disc came out of a light and circled the Iranian pilot prior to rapidly disappearing.   I heard that additional sightings may have occurred in Portugal and England during the fall of 1976.  I have nevery observed any military aircraft equal to the speed and maneuverability of what I saw that day.  I did relate this story to several military colleagues at my duty station in Rota, Spain but was not prompted to file any official report to any higher authority.",2005-04-16T00:00:00,,

While camping in a remote area of western NC under crystal clear skies in mid February, my friends and I noticed a light moving erraticly in the heavens at what appeared to be great altitude. This light was 'brighter' than and 'larger' than the stars and moved in a stop and go fashion under no normal flight plan operation. The light seemd to cris cross the sky at great rates of speed and then began to descend closer to our location.  We were surrounded by mountains in a secluded valley and the light went down behind a large ridge in the heart of the wilderness area and a glow appeared from behind the ridge and began to move from one end of the valley to the other. As we sat mesmerized, all of a sudden this very large craft making no sound rose up from the valley floor and was almost as large as the ridge itself.  The light we had seen earlier in the sky was apparent that it was the underside of the craft and the craft was circled by many flashing and mulit colored lights. We could 'feel' someone was inside and knew that we were there. This behemoth craft lingered for a moment and then shot skyward with no sound and moved as fast as one can think. Faster than our eyes could follow and all of this with absolutely no sound but a strange sort of vibration in our stomachs.  We stood there in awe for a few seconds and then began to hear the rumble of something coming our way into our little secluded valley in the middle of a wilderness area. All of a sudden several jets appeared deep in the valley and directly over our camp so low we could see the lights on the wings quite clearly. We counted several jets but in rality this may have been only a couple making passes over our location. It was if the jets came to investigate what the larg craft was and I must tell you that there was absolutely no comparison in the kind of propulsions between the craft and the jets.  The craft was in space again and we could see the same light moving somewhat erracticly and then was gone. The odd part of the story is that I had built a large fire and we noticed that it was burned down to ashes. The really odd part of the story is that we were supposed to continue backapcking for several more days and we simply left the next day never speaking of the incident in 4 hour drive home or for that matter remembering it.  A few months later at an outside evening event several people were talking about UFO`s and suddenly my friend just burst out crying and yelling at everyone that they didnt know what they were talking about and that only he and myself and our third friend knew what was going on. It was at that moment that we all three had a sort of collective memory and began to relate to each other what took place that night and even remmbering not speaking about it until then.  This event has caused great stress to all three of us for the past 25 years and is accomapnied by strange dreams and I have tried to report this to several investigators through the years only to get no response. I should think that if Federal jet aircarft left the ground that night in the deep south, probably from north Georgia, that somewhere there is a flight record of that event. I just want to know if you can help. It should be added that my friend and I are sort of aviation buffs and I can tell you that after many airshows and a wife in the air force that this craft was like nothing that we have available to us.  Also at the risk of ridicule, a few months later the movie 'Close Encounters' came out and we were all completely stunned at how close the final scene was to what we experienced that night. I just cant explain how large this thing was. Thank you.",2005-04-16T00:00:00,,

We had both recently received our pilot's licenses and were avid flyers.  My friend's father owned a flying school at the airport.   We had just returned from an evening of night flying and had put the airplane in the hangar.  The night sky was very clear with stars showing brightly.  At this time of night air traffic in the Minneapolis area was very light.  During this event there were no aircraft operations at the MIC airport.   My friend and I were talking outside at the airport and noticed some colored lights hovering in a stationary position directly above the MIC airport.  At first we thought these lights may be a helicopter, balloon, or some other type of stationary craft.  As my friend was interested in star gazing and had his telescope at the airport building, we got the telescope out to look at these lights.  We both observed, over a period of at least 10 minutes, three lights, in a tringular configuration, consisting of green and red lights, each of these being in a triangular shape, hovering directly over the airport, altitude unknown.  We believed the lights to be maybe about 10,000 feet MSL because it took the power of the telescope to clearly see them.   The three lights appeared to ""wobble"" in the triangular configuration and they did not move or change altitude.  We were both very surprised that the lights, which we believed were attached to some type of solid, trianglar object, ommited no sound whatsoever.  Other than the lights, we could not actually see any type of object to which they could have been attached as it was dark night at this time.  The MIC control tower was closed at that time, so we could not contact them for confirmation of what this object may have been.  After about 10-15 minutes of observation the lights just disappeared.

Approaching the intersection of West Smith and State Rd.,A t-intersection with a stop light.The light had changed to red as we approached.Came to a stop and waited for it to change.The Medina Co. fairgrounds is to the south side,with the racetrack near the rd.The Standard Welding Co.Building on the opposite corner of the intersection,and behind it,a small woods with trees approximately 25-30 tall. While waiting for the light we noticed what looked like car headlights beaming directly overhead of us coming from beyond the horizon above the tree tops.Iimediately rolled down my van window and stuck my head out and as the lights got brighter and bigger on thier approach I basically climbed out the window and sat on the sill of the door. All the sudden a craft appeared over the treetops,about 20-30 ft.above them,coming straight at us.The headlights shot thier beams about twice as much in distance than a cars.4 lights in all,two large ones toward the center,two on the outside edge.You could see a glare behind these lights as though there was a glass panel behind them. The craft was traveling about 5 mph.,and made no noise what so ever.It traveled directly overhead of us.there was no mistaking what it was or what it wasnt.Never have I seen anything like it,on tv or otherwise.If camcorders had existed at that time and I filmed it,it would have supplied undisputable proof that they do exist.It closely resembled the mini-sub on the old tv series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. I turned my van around and proceeded to try and follow it out of town.It had gained altitude some,its speed increased,but you could still see the beams peering out into the night sky.It turned towards the south,and I took lake rd.to the south trying to catch up to or at least follow its track,and finally it started to zig zag across the sky and gain more altitude,until it flew towards the northeast and so far ahead we gave up the pursuit. The next day I went to visit my best friend and told him about it,He said that when his mother came back from chuch that morning,that another couple in the congrgation had seen the same thing.There was another car at the intersection that night,sitting on State Rd.They could not help but see it as well,although we never colaborated our stories.His mother is still alive and she may be able to remember thier names.

A very nice sunny day with only patchy cumulus clouds.  Driving home on US Rt.40 near Brier Hill Pennsylvania I witnessed a fairly large saucer shaped craft just hanging about three fourths out of a cloud that was just a little bigger than the craft. The ceiling I would have estimated to be about 3 to 5 thousand feet.  I couldn't exactly estimate the size but, there was a farmhouse below and the craft looked about the same size as the house about 50ft across. Given the altitude - the craft must have been a couple times the size of the house. I saw the craft for 15 seconds or more.  I viewed it as I traveled towards it going east to west on Rt. 40. Almost wreaked my car, ran off the road before I could stop. When I stoped and looked back up the craft was just disappearing into the cloud.  The craft was flat black in color and was a classic flying saucer shape. Like two pie pans welded together as in the drawing enclosed. The ouside edge was sharp looking and the sun reflected off it like the paint was worn off and the metal was showing.  The upper surface and the lower surface were flat with a concentric ring which was only slightly raised. If this thing was in the night sky you would not see it, beautiful design, very simple and clean. The surface was smooth and there were no visible antennas or windows showing. Although I saw the upper surface and the lower surface as it went into the cloud, I did not see any lines for hatches or doors for gear etc.  There was no noise comming out of the cloud and it just seemed to drift with the other clouds in the area. I watched the cloud for a few minutes and then went home in amazement. Though about going back to the area with a camera but, I couldn't be sure of which cloud contained the craft, pictures of clouds wouldn't carry much weight. I travel quite a bit and always think about this big flying saucer when we are flying through clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2005-04-16T00:00:00,,

It had been cloudy and raining for days and having a clear sky was something special that night.  Suddenly we saw 3 or 4 glowing orange lights moving North almost directly overhead.  They were small, about the size of your thumbnail, and unblinking.  By definition, these were of course UFO's.  They were not like any other flying object either one of us had seen before.  We stayed in place on the roof watching the sky to see if anything else appeared and about 1 minute later we saw the same thing.  These were also travelling North.  Again, maybe 4 minutes later we saw a larger group headed North.  This time I remembered to count them.  There were 8 of them.  This time I was watching very intently to see if there was any movement that would show them to be using anti-gravity technology.  I was looking for any sudden sharp turns or accelerations.  There was one object that made a sudden change of course.  It had been traveling in a 3 o'clock position to an object then suddenly moved to a 6 o'clock position.

We got out of the van for about 5-10 minutes, but it was cold so we jumped back in.  My friend had cleaned all the windows before we left so it was crystal clear.  About 5 or 10 minutes before we started driving again, we saw a dark cloud about the size of 3 football fields flashing a white light every other second or so.  The light was flashing from inside the cloud.   The size of the light was about 60-100 feet in diameter.  This lasted about 5-8 minutes.  It seemed to be heading in the same direction as the other aircraft.   I would say we saw anywhere from 30-50 crafts in this fleet.  Amazing.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,,

I looked in the vicinity of where the object was to see if it was an aircraft but then noticed how far off it was and realized it was huge.  The size of it is what got my attention.  By the size and how far off it was it had to have been over Mexico.  It seemed to morph from a cone shape into a circle.   I would not dismiss the possibility of it being a cloud.

I kept waiting for them to get closer and bigger, but even though they finally flew over, they never got bigger, I never hard any sounds, and they were MUCH higher than jetliners flying over either, into or out of the airport.  And even as they leave the airport, they are much higher than a helicopter. When an actual helicopter did actually fly over, then is when I realized these three items were WAY too high to be helicopters, as I had originaly wondered about.  One item, the front one, looked as if maybe it was a large rectangle item, and did turn 90 degrees a number of times.  Their fomation stayed consitent.  In the past, others have reported the ""sighting"" over Phoenix at night, and the lights.  This time, there were no lights, but the sun had not yet gone down. I am a man, aged 64, sane, and have never before believed I've ever witnessed UFO's.  This sighting was way too weird, and I can be certain they were not normal aircraft.  Even very high aircraft, you hear some noise, not this time, and no vapor trails.  Movement across the sky was steady, and rather slow.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

In July of 04 my family consisting of my dad,mom,older brother and myself were traveling east down a popular stretch of road in panama city beach that is parallel to the beach for about a 20 mile stretch called front beach road. I just looked over the Gulf like I have countless times in my 21 years of growing up here. About 1/4 mile of the beach were there reddish-orange lights about 300 ft above the water. I roled my window down to get a better look and asked my brother (who is in the coast guard)if those were signal flares. He replied yes and told my dad to pull over, luckily there was I large stretch of open beach were we spotted them. We rolled down the windows and we slowly realized something wasnt right. the lights were stationary and in perfect alignment as well as space from each other. My brother replied ""those arent flares and a curious silence came about us as wew tried to figure out what we were looking at.There were 5 lights, they kept blinking in random patterns(one side to the other or 1 would turn off and on while another did the same in reponse. the night was perfect for visibility the moon was full and to the south shining down onto the Gulf waters. There wasnt a cloud in the sky so I still dont understand why I along with my familydid notseetructure, it was just these lights. had there been a structure I would think we could have made an outline of it becuase there was moonlight behind it but we saw no obvious shape. The lights went on for only about 30 seconds and they dissapeared for about 5 seconds then all of a sudden on the horizon the southeast we saw the same lights only 2 this time turned on and off one time and we didnt see them again.  Months later my roomate and I were traveling down the same road as we did every day because we lived in a house on the beach about 2 miles from my first sighting. it was about the same time at night and I saw one the lights agian! This one was a single light with a more orange-white color to it. I shouted ""look at that"" my roomate Immediately saw it and I pulled off the road at almost the same spot as before. I told all my friends about what I had seen before and they didnt really care because you cant emphasize how amazing it was to see what I had seen. i pointed in my roomates face and said  ""Y told you"" and he was spaechless like I was the first time. We watched this light for only about 15 seconds and the light either jetted south at a rate of speed which no U.S. aircraft could match or the object literally went down into the water. I still dont know what it did to this day. We then went to our house and stood on the porch and looking over the Gulf and we saw an event of lights whish I cant put into words. I dont know how far they were from us but they were definately more than 2 miles out. i saw countless bright red lights popping up all over the sky close to the water not up in the stars.We also saw the orange white lights again but not in the numbers like the red ones. We watched for over 30 minutes and we heard and saw military planes coming from the east (from Eglin air base9 as well as from the west(from Tyndall air base) they proceeded out into the Gulf. at one point I saw a string of lights go off at once which really resembled counter measures that are released fome fighter planes to evade missles. I should mentionthat none these lightsdidnotdo eratic manuvers but the red lights appereared  stationary when they ""poped up"" in lage numbers (between 20 and 50). we went back inside beacuse it was so cold and to this day Feb.15, 2006 I have yet to the the mystrious lights which I will NEVER forget. Oh yes and the lights never had a sound or a trail to them. Everytime I look out to the Gulf at night i still hope to spot these lights again. Please E-MAIL me if you have any questions about what I ve just told you. I would be gratful for any explanations for what I saw.",2006-03-11T00:00:00,30.289213333333333,-85.81383666666666

It was way up their dont' think it was from earth, but outer space.  The blue of the fireball stuck out against a solid blue sky, i was quite impressed and quite puzzeled by it.. The reason I think it was from space is for the fact that it did not make a sound and an explosion that big I was expecting the bang as I continued to walk but heard nothing.. What would it take to make an explosion of blue flame, atleast the size of 4 football fields(looking up from the ground) appear from outerspace?? my first thought was a space craft blew up but when i got to my buddies i couldn't find anything on the news.

If you will observe real close on the 9 o'clock position of the orange cube you will notice a white object shaped like an inverted space shuttle or a cross like appearance just above the blue waters.  What makes this picture very legitimate and makes this object really interesting, is that this evolution that we are about to do is weapons testing and target shooting using all the armaments of the ship. There is no way on earth that any kind of sea vessel will be any near our ship. We are thousands of miles away from the nearest land and theres no way a target shooting will commence if theres any ship near us or worse be visible to the naked eye.

I guess technically what I saw was NOT a UFO...becuase it was not flying. However, there is no other way for this object to get where it was. I live in a National Park in Canada. I commute each work day in and out of the park. I know this stretch of road very well. When you travel a route as often as I do...you recognize things that are not usual. On this particular day, the sky was fairly clear of clouds...and the sun would have been to the south at the time of my sighting. I'm thinking the object would have been...as the crow flies...maybe 5 miles(8km's) from the highway. And up at the top of the mountains that surround our town. What I saw was the classical UFO Flying saucer. It was perched up behind 2 mountain peeks. Probably 2/3rds of this object was visible. It was VERY large. I suppose that if you were not from this area...and saw this thing..you may think it was some kind of manmade structure. But I assure you...there is NOTHING at the top of this Mountain Range. Not before my sighting...and not since. If I can find someone who can help me to measure the distance from the highway where I saw this object more accurately...or the distance between the 2 peeks where I viewed it...I will pass this information on to you. The thing that I find very curious about my sighting is what 'I' did. Nothing. I just stared at it. In disbelief. I didn't even stop my car. I do not know how long it stayed there or which direction it flew to. But since that time...I have seen incredibly bright lights 'behind' those peeks. I even took a pic with my digital but when I zoomed in on it...all you could see was distorted pixels. I keep my eyes posted on that hill on a daily basis now.

We see and hear jets/planes/cessna's/helicopters everyday, all night long.   However, the odd thing about this craft was that, it was triangle shaped, and it had odd patterned lighting.  They were arranged to illuminate the craft, and the lights were all white.  Whereas, on the normal aircraft that we observe everyday, there are an array of colors like yellow, white, blue, etc.   Anyhow, the lights were not only arranged oddly, but they blinked and glowed in a very transe like manner.  They blinked so fast and in some sort of pattern, it really stood out like an oddity, nothing that we're accustomed to seeing.  I was on the balcony of our third floor apartment when i saw it, so I called out for my sister, and she came out and dismissed it as a plane.  But, I just had that ""odd"" feeling in my stomach.  Anyway, this hasn't been the first time for me to have these ""supernatural"" occurences.  I believe I was visited by ""aliens"" one night while I was sleeping.  I woke up several times, paralyzed, and couldn't speak or move, but I was able to think clearly.  I could not see a clear figure, but I was very terrified and frightened and the being that was in front of my face was telling me to go back to sleep, and was putting something into my ear.   The second or third time that I awoke, I couldn't take it anymore, so I started praying telling the being that in ""Jesus Christ's name, to go away, and leave this room"".  And it finally left me.  I did research and found out that there are a lot of people who've had the same experiences as I, and there is a site that you can learn more at:  www.alienresistance.org   I Believe that all of these sitings and experiences are part of what Christians believe to be the ""Great Deception"".  What this means is that Aliens are going to show themselves and try to get people to worship them.  In reality these ""aliens"" or ""Gods from above"" are really demons.

I tracked it for about 10 seconds then I noticed it another red light just like it moving in the same direction but slower, like the first one caught up with it. Then after passing it the first object came almost to a stop made a small maneuver then zoomed past the second slower object it just passed. Then it slowed down while moving back across the sky a little then doing the same thing, turning around.  This went on for a while back and forth, also the little red lights would seem to hover or stand still periodically, and get super fast for a few seconds before returning to that same path they were on. It was like they were on a patrol.  After about 30 minutes of this a third red light appeared, but only moving faster in one direction (west) then disappearing, not flying so far I couldn’t see, but completely vanishing!  After 40 minutes the two original objects disappeared. While staring into my binoculars at the same area and slowing scanning back and forth I noticed a small bluish-white light moving west. I track the object that was moving faster than the 2 red objects earlier. Then it started getting dimmer and vanished. It took about 2 or 3 seconds for it to fade away.  I stood there staring at the same area with goose bumps all over my body. All I could see was dark night and a few faint stars. No with my lenses glued to that area nothing was moving. Then what looked like three stars in a triangular pattern in the night sky suddenly started moving... south and fast! I tracked the 3 bluish white lights for about 20 seconds then 1 by 1 each dot/object disappeared, faded, vanished. I then threw my binoculars in my car, got it and took off.

Objects would darken for a couple of seconds and then be up or down a large distance in an erractic pattern traveling through the sky when flashing resumed. Travel speed and rapid change of direction was inconsistent with that of normal aircraft, fighter jets do not move up and down and across the sky that quickly.  Objects would move East and West then return to center of our viewing area (facing south) occassionally two or three bright bursts of light could be seen in their trail of flight. After about 25 minutes a jet could be heard, it was fast as you would expect a fighter jet to be, the lights had a regular blinking pattern, it circled above and moved towards the blinking light objects and seemed to pursue one of them to the east horizon, the jet followed the object out of view.  The objects reappeared, there were four, more flashes went off. By this time clouds were blowing in and visability became difficult and we could no longer follow the objects visually.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,44.0654,-89.2821

We finally decided to pack up and leave and see if we could get some sanity back into our lives by going to Acadia anyhow.  We arrived late in the day a couple of days later (I don't remember the exact day). After setting up camp, we drove to the Ocean Drive near Sand Beach and walked the walkway in the dark. After walking awhile we went out on the shoreline rocks to just watch the surf and stars and listen to the ocean. It was a nice clear night without any moon at that time.  The planes had been flying for a couple of days again, and there is a path they tend to use over the Bar Harbor area that is directly overhead and runs in a SW to NE direction.  As I was watching the planes, and looking over the stars, I noticed a satellite moving across the sky from W to E in a line that was slightly off perpendicular to the route of the planes - still some distance from the exact route the planes were taking.  Looking further west I saw another satellite.  I pointed them out to my wife.  They were average star brightness and appeared just as I've seen many satellites moving across the sky.  I continued watching as the 'satellite' moved closer to the path of the planes (no planes nearby at the moment). As some more planes flew overhead (they sometimes flew 3 or 4 at once) from the south and came near to the path of the 'satellite', the first 'satellite' stopped dead still in the sky - as still as a star. Once the planes went by, the 'satellite' started moving again - at the same speed it had been - without any apparent acceleration time - and then suddenly made a right angle turn moving ahead in the new direction at the same speed it had been using before. There was no apparent loss of speed as it made the right angle turn.  It did this several more times - in different directions. Each turn appeared as an exact 90 degree turn - and then it moved in that direction for a few seconds before making another right angle turn again. Anytime a plane came near to the location of the 'satellite', the 'satellite' stopped dead still in the sky.  The other 'satellite' as it came closer did exactly the same thing in relation to the planes!! We were just blown away and I couldn't imagine any spacecraft or plane that I know of that could manuever and hover so abruptly. Once past the lane the planes used, they continued on until they grew fainter in the sky.  Both my wife and I are 50 years old (47 at the time of the 'incident'), with college education.

Michigan), IL Shape: Other Duration:15 mins",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43940.html,"Brightly lit, digital-moving flying fish-shaped object with a crest of white-yellow fire emitting from its tail. A friend and I were coming back from a coffee shop (late night midterm study session) and decided to walk along Lake Michigan to get back to our dorms, which were also on the lake.  We were commenting on the low cloud cover and how strange it seemed, and were joking about it being Friday the 13th (though technically the 14th as it was after midnight).  We heard a weird whirring digital sound, followed by the sight of an aircraft free-falling directly towards the lake.   My friend immediately perceived it to be a crashing airplane and instinctually climbing the rocks to dive down into the water (certified lifeguards do these sorts of things without thinking--I, on the other hand, just stood there like a dum-dum). JUST AS IT WAS LITERALLY A FOOT AWAY FROM SPLASHING DOWN into the water, it recovered itself and swooped RIGHT over us....it was NOT a plane.  It was most certainly a UFO.  Its swooping motion was SO smooth, that it looked as though it were not at all recovering from a near-crash, but rather, it was as graceful and digital as possible.  The sound could be be described as a digital piano chord, very pleasing, soothing and attractive. Its shape can best be likened to a fish (picture a generic fish, like a goldfish) with its upper fin and back fin comprised of a yellowish-white glowing fire, which seemed to be propelling it much in the same manner that a fish's fins would.  The body of the craft was totally visible to me, mostly because the craft was SO SO SO well lit, that it's lights drowned out the shape.  I did, however, get a really good look at the underbelly of the craft, which was an amorphous huge contact-lense shape, and violet in color.  It was quasi-transparent, and if I had logic under my belt at that point, i would have made an effort to peer into the bottom, when it flew RIGHT over me.   Instead, I just started crying, both because I knew that what I was seeing was something to totally behold, and because I was instinctually scared, though it didn't have an ominous vibe at all.   After recovering from its seeming near-crash by swooping over us, it proceeded to head South--towards downtown, precisely following the scape of the lakefront.  For instance, if there was a part of the beach which jutted out, its flight-path would follow. From my awesome college campus, we could see the Eastern-edge of the downtown skyline, and we sight-followed it almost all the way there, and then lost track.  My friend ran to his dorm to grab the phone, and we began calling 911, 411, 0--""all circuits busy.""  When we finally got through, the lady scoffed at us and hung up. We went to stand out where we originally saw it crash through the clouds, thinking that was it, and then, at the same time, we both saw it--AGAIN!!  It was coming back down North, again following the beachscape.  I thought it was coming towards us, so we began running away, as silly as that may sound.   While I was running, I was still looking back at it, and saw it come to the point where it had crashed through and then move VERTICALLY, very quickly and disappear above the very low cloudline almost exactly where it came through.  In addition to the fishlike shape with the fire-crest propulsion system (at least that is how I perceived it), here is more detail: The front of the craft had an upside-down ""U"" shaped lime-green, sequentially flashing (like chaser Christmas lights) nose, and the body had a number of sporadically placed lights that were hot pink, red, deeper purple...it was like a flying night-club, and obviously not meant to be inconspicuous, which really threw me off.  This sounds like a description of someone on acid, I know, but I need to ITERATE that my friend and I had just come back from a coffee shop, where we were studying.  No alcohol or otherwise was at all involved.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

I thought it looked like an airplane with two small lights coming near, I thought she just wanted me to sit with her, and talk I said it's an airplane, and I need to get home it was very cold, and my heater in the car had not worked for at least 2 years no matter how much money we put into the car it just would not work, even letting it ilde for an hour never helped the heater.  I decided to please her and get out to at least look. I left the car to idle, I walked about 8 steps and I saw the lights get closer still thinking it was an airplane (mind you I lived just out the gates of NAS pensacola for 3 years, I watched many night flights of many planes including a stealth in hover, so I feel that I can not be fooled by this.)  It came just a block away from where I was standing,  It became huge it looked like the shape of the sun from a distance it was completely round, and was extremely bright like the sun with a white glow, then it made a swift turn, one side to the other like opening up.  You could still see the size, I saw the center up and down was black and it still glowed on the right and left side.  It then began to drop stuff from the bottom (although there  was a black space between the circle and the stuff coming out, glowing like gold particules.  I was so intent on seeing the stuff falling, and the fact that it was right above the Fairfield school district concerned me.  What was it dropping?  I thought, then in a matter of seconds it stopped dropping the stuff, I looked up a little, and it was GONE.  I returned to my car in what seemd like 3 to 5 mins. and the heater in the car was working great it worked for 2 more days and stopped. After this I litterally sat on my roof looking for these things, and from a distance I did see them again twice. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

After stargazing for a few hours we decided to go galaxy hunting with some of the larger telescopes.  I noticed something very strange in my telescope while viewing the moon while the others were pointing their telescopes in another direction.  I noticed something strange and alarming..it was a UFO.  It looked very much like an airplane but was dark grey and looked as if it had armor on it and it had far too many, what I'm guessing were, windows on 3 levels. There were also some flashing lights but I couldn't see them without the telescope. It was moving incredibly fast but there was no sound and before I knew it it was out of view..  I tried looking for it again and managed to see it and the strangest part of all was that it had to have been flying upside-down because it was as if I was looking at a plane, a very unusual plane for that matter, from above.   Another strange thing happened..one of the other astronomers was using an astronomy program on his lap top to move his telescope to certain astronomical bodies and when I saw this thing the program went crazy, sifting through dozens of star charts at a rapid pace then shutting down.  How bizzare! I was a little taken aback when I found this ""A witness to a UFO sighting on October 13 in Trenton, OH submitted the drawing below.""  It looks so similar..but his depiction is on a much smaller scale.  Unfortunatley I was unable to keep whatever it was in view and I asked someone else to look for it..no one could find it.

It was Thanksgiving 2001 and my mother and I were on the way to visit my grandfather in Iva, South Carolina.  We were travelling southbound on I-85.   We saw what appeared to be just 2 or 3 fireballs in the sky.  I thought at first that they were airplanes, but over the course of about 30 minutes, about 50 or more of these objects appeared in the sky.  They were going in all directions...up, down, side to side.  Some were stationary for a while, and then just shot up into the sky...or to the side...or straight down!   It was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen.  We saw cars parked on the side of the road observing this as well, but as yet I have been unable to find any newspaper article or other eyewitness account of the event.  It was so obvious and so clearly seen - I know there must be others who saw it as well.   The best way I can describe the appearance is that each one looked like a fireball.  They were very small, so I assume they were very far away but I don't know how far.  They were covering the whole horizon.   Since this happened right after September 11th, I was terrified that we were under a terrorist attack, but when we called someone to have them flip on the news, they saw nothing of the event on TV.   Once I got home after that weekend, I looked on the internet, posted to message boards - and found nothing.   I am certain that what I saw was NOT some natural light phenomenon, nor was it airplanes - unless there were 50+ experimental aircraft in the sky.  These did not move the way normal planes move - they were going in EVERY direction imaginable.   I can't explain it, but I would very much like to know if anyone else saw it.

It looked like it was at a high altitude.  We were on board American Airlines flight #2262 (a Boeing 757), enroute DFW-STL, at gate C11 awaiting gate departure. It was about 11:30, probably a little before that.  I knew what I saw was too fast for any plane, even a military jet. I could only see a white light, no other color lights. I know it couldn't of been a shuttle because those have been grounded since early 2003. Whatever it was, it looked like it was going to escape the atmosphere very shortly.  There were no stars that were visible, since there were many lights at the airport, so I know I didn't mistake it with a satellite. It was too low to be in space yet, but getting close to escaping the atmosphere. The light was easily about 35,000 feet, I would have to say anywhere from 50,000 to 150,000 feet. I'm sorry I cannot be specific on the altitude of the aircraft, or whatever it was.  If I had to take a guess, I would have to say it was around 80,000 feet.

I knew not even a helicopter could make such an abrupt maneuver and thought immediately it could only be a ufo.  Being a risk taking 19 year old I decided to roll down my window and check it out.  I tried to see what it was but the light was so bright I couldn't actually see the craft.   The wind coming in my ears at 60 mph was loud but I couldn't hear an engine or helicopter propeller.

His father told the boy to shut up.This responce by his father bothered me so I told the boy "" ya those are stars"" The boy again insisted that we look up. At this point I looked not straight up but looked to the south of our location and spotted what looked like a chevron shaped object moving silently through the sky.  The object was larger then an airliner had sharp edges to it and the entire surface emitted a white glow. The object reminded me of a giant peice of glass. I was completely shocked at the sight of this object.  After the object left I asked my friend to draw for me what he had just seen, I didnt want to influence his mind in anyway. His discription of the object was just as I had viewed it. The object I might add was on the same flight path to kirtland AFB that many planes use .  My friend and I grew up under this flight path and spent many a summer night trying to reflect spotlights off the wings of planes as they would come in for a landing. We both became very adept at I.D.ing types of planes day or night. What we saw was not a plane or a balloon or anything else that we had ever seen.  This whole experience was like seeing a ghost and left me very un-settled.

I will NEVER forget this night sighting.  I lived on the corner by the dunes of Lake Michigan on Georgia Ave., in Michigan City. I took our black Labrador, Kahlua, out for her nightly beach walk. We started up the sand dune trail toward the beach, when suddenly(and for the first time ever) my seven year old dog pointed toward the beach end of the path and her backhair was standing up.  I looked and saw a glimmer of shimmering light and figured she had sensed some neighbors sitting around a bon fire on the beach. I took a brisk walk with her to the end of the path, and upon reaching the beach overlook, I stood dumbfounded.  There were NO people on the beach but off to our left(West) and approaching  us at a slow speed were three glowing spheres of strange light.  I looked down at Kahlua and she was following these objects and didn't move.  (She was not leashed) They were about 5 feet above the shore where the small waves were meeting the sand.I could see the foam of the small wavelets illuminated by the spheres ,directly below them. They were in an echelon formation (like jets fly off each others wing tips). One sphere was ahead of the other two and they were each off to one side and behind the lead sphere.  Their surfaces were of a yellow/pink static light that ran around the globes like little lightning bolts but thin and many.  It was very quiet ,except for the breeze rushing past our ears off the lake.  I remember seeing lightning way across the lake near Chicago (which you can see the taller buildings on a clear day).It was miles away and barely saw the lightning.  These globes were about 3- 4 feet in diameter and a few feet apart and moved Eastward directly in front of us.  That's when I got a good look.The static surface gave me a good view of their outlines and they were perfect globes. I got goosebumps and hair must've stood on my arms. I pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming.  Kahlua never moved except for her head while staring at these spheres with me.The globes kept moving and seemed to speed up and we watched until they became a single light (due to distance) and they disappeared downshore as they moved out of sight toward New Buffalo,Michigan.  I often wonder why I and/or Kahlua never walked or ran closer to see these at close range?  It seemed I didn't want to move. I was afraid.I had lived and walked this beach for at least 1 year and never saw anything as puzzling as this. The globes were controlled and never wavered once in their flight. I reported the sighting to the Michigan City Police the next day but they just laughed and said it was probably ""airplane lights"". No way...not 80 -100 feet in front of me along the breaking waves and illuminating the foam only.  I sent this report at the time, to Dr. J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern Univ. but never heard anything more. I'm a blue collar worker with some collage and was sober and wide awake at the time. I also knew the beach area at night since I lived just a few minutes walk from the water's edge and spent much of my my free time there.

As the moon shone down and it just appeared to wisp upon whatever invisible material the cylinder was made of.It looked like glass but we know thats impossible, so it would be as a molecular structure that I knew nothing of. We went searching for the end of it as it seemed to touch the earth. We dorve a little way,maybe 1/8 of a mile and it seemed to end in the woods.We were in a semi-country neighborhood so we just couldnt go trapesing in the trees and leave our vehicle and it was fascinating. As we tried to find a closer entrance to the woods , it started to fill with what appeared to be smoke,and the amazing thing was the steam never left the confines of the cylinder,even though it was invisible except for the steam it held. The steam began rising and as we got to a better viewing area the steam turned darker like smoke and the cy;inder kept it's three dimensional shape thill the smoke became totally black and the cylinder started to rise simultaneously it became more two demensional and looked like a telephone pole in sillouette and then became like a solid object and seemed to pass in front of the moon,rise up further,then cross the moon and move out of sight.

I have always wanted to report this but never knew who to tell unti last night.  I think something very interesting about my encounter is that it happened again in 1989.  The first encounter happened when I was 8 years old with my friend ((name deleted)) also 8. We were camping out in his front yard. He and his family lived out in the country. We were about to go to sleep in his Pop up trailer and all of a sudden there was a very deep thrust noise and the trailer began to vibrate.  We ran outside to see what was happening and looked up and saw a very large cigar shaped object hovering above us. Lights underneath the craft of different colors seemed to flash from left to right one after the other across the bottom of the craft. We ran inside to get binoculars and accidentally wake up his father who than came out with us. We were outside again within seconds and the craft was gone.  We did think we could barely see it hovering on the horizon for some time but it was too far away to see anything. Chad and I were avid model airplane builders and were very familiar with military aircraft. We knew what we saw was not a blimp because there was no way it could have hovered over us and then been miles off the horizon within seconds.  My second encounter happened in 1989. Also in Midland, at my child hood home. At approximately 2am again I had pulled into my driveway after leaving my girlfriends home. I decided to listen to a song before I went inside. As I was sitting in my car my car began to vibrate and I heard a very low base noise.  Suprised, I made sure my woofers were turned off in my car and turned down my stereo. I noticed lights reflecting off my sisters car and immediately looked around for other cars and there were none in sight. Then I noticed the lights were reflecting off the top of her car. I got out, looked up and saw once again a large cigar shaped object with lights flashing left to right across the bottom of the craft.  Both times it seemed to to be about 100 yards long and about 100 ft. in the air. Once again I ran inside to get binoculars and ran back outside (waking my mother accidentally). once again it was gone. As I scanned the horizon I could see it.

Early summer about 1978, my friend and I were watching the stars with a small telescope and binoculars on my garage roof.  We did this a lot.   This night we watched two star like objects ""chase"" each other for about 20 seconds.  The rear object matched the lead objects direction and course, so we felt the rear object was chasing the lead object.  Then we saw a bright beam of light emmit from the rear object that struck the lead object. The lead object dissappeared.  The rear object stopped for about 5-10 seconds then took off in another direction dissappearing from our sight.   We don't know what we witnessed but, it sure looked like some type of combat dog-fight in our night sky amoung our stars. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

My wife woke me up this morning because she thought she heard a noise outside our house, such as a prowler or animal. I walked around the house to check on things and look out various windows into our front and back yards.  I ended up back in our bedroom where we have a set of French doors with windows looking into our back yard/Northern sky.  Immediately my eyes were drawn low into the sky where I saw an extremely bright white light.  It actually looked like a close cluster of lights rather than a single solid bright light. The object hung completely still, low in the sky.  My first though was that I was looking at a helicopter, but upon closer inspection there was simply too much light coming from this object.  With the distance it appeared to be at, 2 miles away, the area the light was occupying would have been about the same size as an entire helicopter. The light did not fade or grow in intensity either, so the object was not moving toward or away from me. It appeared to simply hover there.  I stared at it as it hung there in the sky for at least a couple minutes. I remember thinking that I wished it would move or turn so that I could get a better idea of what it was. You know, we all have a pretty good idea about how an airplane or helicopter should appear to move in the sky.  Although it looked and “felt” odd to me, I still wasn’t ready to call it a UFO.  My wife noticed I was still staring out the window and asked me what I was looking at.  Not wanting to sound crazy, I simply said “the sky”.  About 15 seconds passed after she spoke to me the object started to move, very slowly, to the east. It maintained its low altitude in a perfectly straight line as if it was on rails. I see airplanes in the sky from my back yard all the time. The amount of light this thing was putting out was simply abnormal, even if you consider the possibility that I was looking at airplane landing lights, or a helicopter “night sun” spot light pointed perfectly in my direction.  What finally made me think that I was not looking at an airplane or helicopter was the way it moved.  Its movement and acceleration was not smooth.  It would sort of surge forward a little, slow down, surge forward, slow down, surge, slow etc. The object’s total speed was very slow, so the surging was sort of subtle, but was still very noticeable.  It did not move smoothly across the sky as an airplane or helicopter with momentum would. I should also mention that’s it’s acceleration from stop to its “cruising speed” appeared instant and effortless. As for sound, it was silent.  There was no aircraft or other types of sound other than normal early morning ambient, which is pretty quiet in La Quinta, CA at this hour. We have a local small aircraft strip nearby about a half mile away, but the planes landing and taking off from there can be heard and seen quite easily. There was no wind this morning either, it was calm.  At this point I wanted my wife to witness what I was seeing, so I said calmly to her, “want to see a UFO”? She was still awake from being startled by what she thought was a noise outside our house, and because I was still investigating. We were both very lucid.  She said, “There is no UFO”.  I then told her to come and look, and she could tell I wasn’t joking around, so she jumped right out of bed and walked over to me quickly. In our decade plus of marriage, I had never asked her to come and look at a UFO.  I pointed the object out to her, which wasn’t difficult, and she watched it move.  I told her to note how it was moving in a (for lack of better word) “surging” fashion, and that airplanes/helicopters do not move like that.  She agreed, and we watched the object disappear behind our neighbor’s roofline. After this I stepped outside and tried to get another glimpse of it, but it was gone.  It’s important to note, that if you look to the North from my back yard in La Quinta, you can see mountains, which are part of the San Andreas fault line.  The base of the mountain is only about 5-6 miles away from my house.  It was easy to see that the object wasn’t very far away, and was very low in the sky. If I had to guess at the altitude I would say 400 - 500 feet above the ground.  I am an IT professional, and my wife is an interior designer for one of the local home builders. I have an extremely open mind when it comes to subjects such as UFOs, but this is the first time in my life that I felt the need to report a sighting, and it’s the first time since childhood that I saw something in the night sky that was strange enough to qualify for me.  I am open minded, but also very analytical.  I wasn’t simply looking at a “bright light in the sky”.  What prompted me to make this report was how it moved, as described above.  If there is a logical explanation for how a “known” aircraft can exhibit a perfectly straight, visibly “surging”, very slow movement across the sky, I would like to know what it is.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,33.65794508196721,-116.27032786885246

People In Multiple Sites Witness Same Thing. On yesterday evening, I observed 2-3 unusual objects in the sky. My trip began on U.S. Highway 82West as it leads out of Tuscaloosa, AL towards Columbus, MS. I made a left turn at the junction of U.S. Highway 82West and AL State Hwy. 86East. AL State Hwy 86 leads to the city of Carollton, located in Pickens county. Midway to the city of Carollton (a distance of some 20+/- miles from the junction of US Hwy 82 and AL State Hwy 86) I observed what appeared to be a ""shooting star"" pass from the right side of the sky to the left. I must point out here that my primary occupation requires me to drive extensively. As a result, the road(s) I was traveling on was very familar. In addition, since a great deal of my driving in general is done in the evening and night, the sight of ""shooting stars"" is equally as familiar. What made this particular ""shooting star"" stand out to me was the intensity of white light displayed as it tracked across the sky. So much so that I half expected to hear a thud or see some type of impact crator. Again, it must be stressed, that at that paticular point in my minds eye I had simply seen a ""shooting star"", no more. After making what amounted to about a 20-25 minute stop, in Aliceville(a town about 12-15 miles past Carrolton), to complete some work, I proceeded to take AL State Hwy. 17South to reach the city of York, my destination in Sumpter County. As I reached the outskirts of the city of Aliceville, with the thought of the unusual ""shooting star"" still fresh in my mind, I observed yet another ""shooting star"". This one, the second ""shooting star"", tracked from left to right across the sky and emitted a somewhat dull pale orange color as it passed. Nevertheless, I was still of the mindset that the two objects I saw, less than an hour apart, were just ""shooting stars"". In fact, I would probably still be of that opinion if I had not observed the third and most impressive object. I had been continuously traveling along AL State Hwy. 17South( i have to point out that this particular state hwy.runs almost parallel with the AL-MS state lines and serves as a lifeline to some of AL's most rural communities. there are very few lights of any kind, except when passing through one of the small rural towns aforementioned) and witnessed nothing at all unusual. That is until I arrived at the junction of AL State Hwy.'s 17South and 28West where I made a left turn that would take me to the city of Livingston in Sumpter county. Almost immediately after turning on to AL State Hwy. 28East, I observed a spherical object in the sky to my right (this would have been along the South-South West horizon). Initially I thought that it was a star. The object was not illuminated in any intense way, but instead seem to emit a greenish-bluish glow or tinge. I slowed my vehicle to about 15-20 mph and to my amazement, I could see that this greenish-bluish object was hovering in the sky (as a point of fact it was moving so slow that it appeared to barely be moving at all). I looked around the sky and at first I saw nothing else in the sky besides the spherical object. Then a few seconds later I saw what I percieved to be a low flying airplane in the Eastern part of the sky. It, the low flying airplane(?)blinked about six times and then it was gone from view, but the sphere continued to leisurely hover about. I was able to view this spherical object in the sky about 10-15 minutes until I reached the junction of AL State Hwy. 28East andUS Interstate 20/59, which passes through the city of Livingston, in route to Meridian, MS(about 40 miles away). At about the time I reached the interstate either the spherical object had gone or it was obscured by the lights of cars, businesses, etc.. The conclusion, about 6 hours and 150+/-miles later someone who could not have known what I had seen, said very casually and somewhat jokingly, ""hey guys, I thought I saw a U.F.O. tonight"". I let this person tell everyone present what they thought they saw. When other folks started laughing, i started crying because I knew that what I had seen was real.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,33.1071,-88.1528

I'm not sure because I don't know exactly how large it was. I guessed maybe between 3 and 7 feet in diameter. It seemed to fly at a speed only slightly faster than I was driving, so I sped up a little bit to keep side-by-side with it.

Also the object was very bright much brighter than lights from planes which I saw near it (next to flight path)  but it was much further away than the commercial planes and it had brighter lights. Unlike the planes it which have several lights, it did not have any it was emitting light from itself; it looked slightly less bright than a star. It could not have been a comet because the object was flying parallel at an average speed and then it suddenly (not gradually) increased in speed. It was definatley not a plane because living under a flight path for all my life I can distinguish between a jumbo jet to a unconventional looking hazy light.  Other planes were in the vicinity of the object but they were going into land on the airport or had just taken off.

I am a Plant Manager in the manufacturing industry and my scuba diving buddy is programming technician for an international printing company.  We are both forty years old and niether of us really had much of an opinion about UFOs until the night of our sighting. We had traveled from Effingham, Illinois, to Mermet Springs, Illinois, in the southern most part of the state to go scuba diving at an old rock quarry which had been turned into a scuba faciltiy.  We had ran into some severe storms on our way down but it turned of quite clear once we got to Mermet Springs.  My son and a friend of his had come along to camp out with us. After we arrived we sat up our camp, grilled some brats and ate. We then took our chairs and sat them so we could see the sky clearly because there was supposed to be a meteor shower that night after ten o'clock. We sat and talked for a while and were looking up at the stars waiting for the showers to begin. I was sitting to my friends right with my head leaned all the way back looking up when I noticed a light ""pop on"" in the sky to my right. I thought perhaps it was the north star but it was not. I kept my eye on it trying to figure out what star it was when it made a very sudden and tremendously fast move accross the sky moving to my left. It stopped as suddenly as it had taken off. The light sat there for about five seconds, flashed off then back on one time and then took off at a perfect right angle from the direction it had first moved. It traveled extremely fast. It was moving away from us this time. I could see what I would call a ""light trail"" behind it. After it made this move and took off it vanished and we did not see it again. During the time that the light was visible during this event, neither my friend or I had said anything, moved or alerted the other one as to what we were seeing. Once it was gone I simply turned left to look at my buddy. He turned to look at me and simply said ""yep, I saw that."" We then talked about it for a little while basically trying to rationalize what could move that fast and stop suddenly and then take off again at a right angle to it's previous path. We could not come up with anything that made any sense based on our experiences. We both finally decided that we had seen a UFO and thought that was amazing! To describe the object all I can really say is that it appeared to be a bright light which very much resembled the North star except for this was much brighter. I could not see any shape at all since this object appeared to be very high up in the sky. Neither my friend or I can say what this object was but we both know for sure taht it was not a meteor, aircraft, reflection, star, or any other object known to us.

As we watched it, it grew brighter, to the point where we could make out the sparks at the edges.  We both kind of laughed nervously as it traveled from west to east and seemed to get bigger, indicating maybe it was getting closer.  It passed over us and we turned and watched it disintegrate.

I was standing outside of my vehicle on an unlit area of a local steet in Latham New York.  The location is near Latham Circle, and between Route 9 and interstate 87. The time was almost exactly 8:10 PM, as I was just about to attend an 8:15 meeting.  There is a fair amount of light pollution in the area, but the night was very clear and I had good visibility of the stars.  For example, I had full visability of the Big Dipper.  I am an avid sky watcher, and am accustomed to observing airplane traffic.  I was facing approximately East NorthEast. From my position, I was facing in the direction of the Hudson river, which was about 4 miles to the east, but out of my line of sight. Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement above and I looked up.  At an approximate altitude of between 2,000 and 4,000 feet, I saw a black diamond shape lit at each corner with a dim orange light. Specifically, one each of these four dim lights marked each point of the diamond. I will call these lights ""corner lights."" The lkights did not blink or flash.  The vehicle blocked the stars behind it as it passed with absolute silence, as best I could hear. Bear in mind that the area was fairly noise polluted. I was lucky to see it, as the entire presentation, while flatly unmistakable, was quite subtle. Neverheless, it was HUGE. I would say that it was a couple of hundred yards long and a hundred yards wide.  It was gliding to the North at a constant speed (probably about 100 MPH), and I believe that it was roughly following the Hudson river.  This next part is very interesting. There was a fifth, and possibly sixth light of the same size and color weaving between two of the leading corner lights.  This more rapidly moving light spun apparently random circles and figure eights around the leading (northern) corner light and the around the western corner light. I have never seen anything manmade move with such speed and maneuverability in the sky as did this fifth light. All of the lights moved ahead together as a unified group, notwithstanding that there was internal movement within the group.   As I watched, and as the vehicle drew away from my position, all of the lights drew together into a tighter cluster, and then a very tight cluster, and eventually a single point of light that I lost among the stars and the light pollution.  This pulling together of the lights was not merely a function of increasing distance from my vantage point. I happened more quicly than that. A truly amazing, and awe inspiring experience.

When first seen, there was a pear shaped glowing fan of gasses behind a single bright fireball.  The fireball was moving approximately North to South.  Behind the globe of expanding gasses, there was a contrail? twisting off to the west/north-west.  The westernmost end of the twisty trail was red with the fading sunlight.  The trail became a very bright white as it got more twisty and blended into the expanding pear of gasses.  After about two mintes, the point of light disappeared, no new gasses were added to the pear, though it continued to expand in size and fade in intensity.  The twisty trail stayed bright for several more minutes, the colors shifting as the sun set.  After twienty mintes, nothing remain visible of the twisty trail.  Attempting to follow the point of light to the south, about three minutes after it disappeared, it appeared again, continueing in a straight line.  The new pear of gasses forming behind it glowed reddish (like the sunset).  My guess would be a meteor skipping across the top of the atmosphere.  The initial outgassing causing it to spin, spewing its gasses into the twisty trail.  Finally just melting away on each skip into the atmosphere.  On the other hand, it may have been something totally else.  If you know, I'd like to hear back what it really is.  It occurs to me that the oldest part of the trail was the red of sunset, suggesting that it may have been low in the atmosphere.  From mid trail on, including hte initial pear of gasses, it was bright white, suggesting it was in full sunlight, not scattered throught he atmosphere.

A genuine craft not of manmade origin unless holograhic.,Orlando,FL,2002-05-05T13:00:00,disk,1 minute,"Occurred : 5/5/2002 13:00  (Entered as : 05/05/2002 13:00) Reported: 2/25/2005 7:55:48 AM 07:55 Posted: 5/24/2005 Location: Orlando, FL Shape: Disk Duration:1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42346.html,"A genuine craft not of manmade origin unless holograhic. As result of Jenning's derisions as to the improbability of actual alien craft operating on this planet, will share the following, which I reported to NASA and the Police, back when I saw it.  I was driving a tractor/trailer, (Automobole Transporter), southbound on I-4,south of downtown Orlando. As I came to an overpass, I saw at the extreme East side of the overpass a UFO, that had apparently moments before lifted off the ground, because it was very low and moving slowly.  I got on the radio and said, ""Does anybody see that?,"" and there was no reply.  I worked it out in my mind as to what it could be other than what it appeared to be, and there was nothing of manmade origin that it could be other than some kind of holographic projection from an aircraft or satellite. It appeared to me to be approximately 35FT in diameter. And it was not shiny, nor illuminating light. In fact it was the exact opposite of the typical UFO story, the craft was a color of beige, brownish red. It was sporting and shotrt strut like antenae, that had about a 80 degree bend at the elbow.  Also, the harder I looked at it the harder it was to see it in crystal clear clarity, it was as if there was some kind of energy field around it. There existed a certain blurr to it, though not to the point of obscuring it. Again, this is in broad day light and it is at low altitude. The craft actually passed over me, movong from my left to my right.  I exited off at the next exit and saw it still. It was moving along I-4 toward Orlando. There were condo units that it was moving toward. The whole thing was unbeliveable because it moved low and slow, (i.e., 50 mph?). It move higher than when I first saw it, which is why it appeared to me to have just lifted off. The area where it would have lifted off from is woody.  I have no strange tales of alien abduction to share, nor  seeing at little green men. I saw what I saw, and it was real, not imagination, and not man made.  Remarkably, I attempted to write it off as anything but what it was.  Barring a holograhic projection, it was an alien craft of unknown origin.  The antenae was the same color as the rest of the craft.  It was by trying to see the see the detail of the antenae, that was on the side of the upper part of it, that I first decerned that it possessed a blurr to it, as if it emanted an energy feild of some sort. and it was just enough blurr to obscure 100 percent visual acuity. The color was odd to me for is contrary to typical UFO sightings? Was it camouflage? It's color closely resembled typical Florida roofs and ground terrain. Not much is it? But it is what I saw. No big deal. What I found interesting in retrospect is that it apparently did not give two bits for our interdiction capabilities, it was was low, slow, and in your face. Always thought if I ever saw a UFO it would be at night, never did I ever believe that I would see one like I did, in broad daylight near a major city.  35 ft. diameter does seem conducive to what we know of the requirements for interstellar flight, so where does it come from?  To me, in truth, man is technologically speaking, retarded. What we think is laughable. For here is a craft that defies the intellect of our monkey scientists, who would say it does not exist because our understanding prevents it's existence.  Apparently, the occupants of the the craft I saw possess a different viewpoint.  Most scientists are waking talking  boobs that are indoctrinated in schools of learning from our masters, and therefore possess no independent thought.  They are unable to think beyond the confines of what they were rotely taught, and as such - a typical scientist is a boob.  So spare telling me what I saw was impossible because it defies are science??????   And then these self appointed scientist rubes will say because it defies our monkey science then it must have been imagined?  There is a lot of truth to the original, ""Planet of the Apes.""   Peter Jenning's is one of the temple apes apparently.  By the way, shortly thereafter I purchased a camera phone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

On the night of May 28th 2002, I was sitting outside stargazing and invited my girlfriend of the time to come outside and view the sky.   As we sat and watched the stars we noticed approx. 3 to 4  military jets going from porterville, ca. heading north when reaching hwy l98 and then returning to porterville and continuing this cirle at which time an aircraft like a C140 joined in this picket fence.  Id say they were about 5000 feet up.   This went on for at least a half hour. We were between strathmore and lindsay calif. towards the foothills. At approx l0:05 pm we were gazing to the northeast when my girlfriend noticed exceptional large lights in the sky approx l/4 mile up the the air.  The craft flew within a 1/4 mile from us to the north and was approx still 1/4 mile off the ground.  The craft stopped directly north of us.  It stood still (hovering as some would say) but no movement.  No noise at all.  Again no movement from the ship with the exception, the large panel lights.  I assume the panel lights (rectangle) went all around the bottom of the ship but we observed 3 and l/2 of these.  The size of each panel light would be approx a little larger than a double wide mobile home.  These panels were strobing at a slow strobe.  Their were additional lights on this craft, but because of the exceptional purity of the lights i focused on the panel lights.  These were light red in color and stayed light red untill after a minute the craft started moveing towards the west.  At this time each panel started turning purple from the outside going inwards, towards its center. Again these were still at a slow strobe.  Since this purple didnt appear untill the ship started moving I can only say this must tie in with the flight system it uses.  Again the clarity of these lights would make normal light look dull or muddied.  As it moved to the west I ran to the road west of her house and ran north because of a tree blocking my view.  As it flew at a very slow rate of speed  30mph? I was able to view it much clearer from the horizon of the west.  The craft was boomerang shape in front and as i looked from the ground to the ship about three times I would be able to say it was approx. 3 football fields long.  Very large.  When my girlfriend and I later compared our experience she said it was like a six sided cut ruby shape,  So i can only assume it changed shape, (perhaps the reason it sat still for the minute above us).  Although she was able to make out the shape when it was north of us I was not since she sees better than I.  I am sure of its shape as it flew west but only its front since it was at night l0:05 pm.  I can say that the dogs for miles around barked all nite as we retired at 4:30 in the morning were still barking.  This is in the country so one can hear quite a ways. I have since moved to Three Rivers, CA.  I have found two other witness's and they were with others.  They said that the center of the ship was clear and that they could make the stars out.  Either a force field, something like glass or clear plastic that one can see through.  I didnt observe this because of the ships position from us. Ive heard that others also seen this craft in our area but have not met these people.  I assume that the military did set up a picket fence to observe it, whether or not they saw it I cant say, since it was low to the ground and they were much higher up.  We did call Lamore Naval Air Station, and they stated they didnd have anytthing up at the time.  We also called National Institute of Discorvery science.  They called back the following morning wanting to know the pattern of the strobe.  That I couldnt give them.  I can only say that each panel strobed slowly and indepentantly of each other. Many people say they have seen a UFO. I can say I saw an Alien Space Ship.  Very close to us for such a large ship. I would be willing to take a lie detectors test.  I stand by what I saw and Im sure the others that ive met and saw it would do the same. Two additional facts to report towards this is that NASA was tracking a an object of unknown size and material that went a third of the ways between the earth and the moon that night and orbited back out to space.  Haveing no where else to log it, it is labled Asteroid 2002 KG4.  I couldnt say if it in any way was related to the craft I saw.  Additionally a friends fiance, spotted a small alien craft near woodlake at about the same time period near a reservoir in woodlake calif.  Again I stand by what i saw and was not intoxicated in any way.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,36.1491,-119.0921

On 7/9/2005, I had to let my dogs outside for a few minutes.  It was very late on a Saturday night about 2:00am. I live in Dunwoody, Georgia.  It was a dark night with a lot of clouds, and very damp.  It had been rainning alot, due to the hurricane named Dennis, off the Gulf. A bright white light got my attention, above my house.  It was about the same height as a plane would be.  It made no sound.  I looked up at the entire sky, and I noticed this object was brighter than the other stars.  There were only 3 stars in the very dark sky.  But this particular one was over my house, and it was the biggest and the brightest one. I went inside and grabbed my telescope.  I actually compared it with the other stars and it was nothing like them. When I came outside, it seemed to be jumping around in a irratic movement.  Through the telescope, I could see it better, and it looked like a sphere, that was like a mirror ball, but shaped oval.  The object seemed to be revolving counter clockwise, as a mirror ball would do, shinning in different areas, at the same time. After observing it through the scope for a few minutes, it would hide.  It seemed like everytime I really locked onto it through the scope, it would hide behind the nearby clouds. I noticed it would even go backwards.  I guess I witness my first UFO.  Within 2 to 3 minutes of hiding, it would return to the same location.  I would grab the scope and witnessed the sphere revolving as if it had little mirror squares on it.  It continued irraticly jumping around, up & down,  and especially back and forth.  I payed particular attention to it when it would go backwards.  I watched it go backwards for quite a distance, noting that our planes do not have this capability!  But it still managed to return within seconds, pretty close to the same area. I watched it appear and dissapear, in the same area, for a full hour.  The entire time, it rotated and shinned like a mirror ball, bouncing around.  Then I realized it was extremly late, and I had to go to bed.  The mirror ball looking sphere was still there went I left it about 3:00am.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,

I was working on the roof of my home in the early afternoon when I noticed something metallic to the south approximately 30-35 degrees above horizon travelling west to east.  The object was visible for approximately 40-50 seconds. The object was very bright silver/metallic sheen.  The ""color"" of the object was reminiscent of very highly polished stainless steel. I could not judge either altitude or speed, but it ""felt"" like it was very high and quite large based on the appearance of the object...which would also indicate that it was moving very quickly.  It ""felt"" like it was moving rapidly.  I realize ""felt"" is extremely subjective, but we see conventional aircraft fairly regularly, both large commercial and smaller, due to being approximately five miles from the local municipal field and also approximately 90 miles from MSP airport in Minnesota.  This object did not resemble either type of aircraft and it is normally very easy to identify the approximate altitude (very high, high, low) of those aircraft.  The object simply did not ""fit"" with what we normally see here. I watched this object for the full 40 seconds or so and it initially reminded me of an early 20th century airship or Zepplin.  I have seen the Goodyear (and other) blimps on a few occasions, and this was more elongated like the airships.  It was not ""stubby"" like a blimp. The object was blunt and rounded at both ends and was noticeably wider in the center...almost football shaped, but less pronounced. When smaller aircraft pass overhead, we can clearly hear their engines.  Although we cannot hear larger commercial aircraft, the shape is quite distinct, including seeing the wings quite clearly.  This object did not have clearly visible wings. Finally, it seemed to move ""smoothly"" across the sky.  Again, this is a very subjective evaluation, but the ""smooth"" poped into my head as I was watching the flight.  I currently work in the quality control department of a national manufacturing company.  My duties include running the test and evaluation program and all government and industry certifications of the products.  Prior to this job, I retired from the military where I worked in an intelligence field related specifically to trained ""observation"".  I held a TS/SI/SCI clearance while in the service.

I actually thought it was Mars at first and so did she but it was too big to be so and as we soon found out it moved too fast as well.  I should note that three of us saw the object at first but my other sister went inside so she did not actually witness it move away as it eventually did, to our surprise, at about 11:40 PM.  When we first noticed it, which didn't take long, it was positioned about NNW.  I estimate at about 25-30 degrees in the sky, 90 degrees being looking straight up into the sky between the East and West horizons.  It moved up into the sky seemingly orbiting at first.  Like I have stated it came off as Mars at first but too big.  We were alarmed to actually see it move before our very eyes, again too fast for a planet or a space station which NASA proclaimed.  Maybe a sattelite but no because sattelites don't move up in the night sky and all of a sudden change directions within a 20 minute period of time seeming to change its mind or course.  Well again it moved up to about a 40 degree angle if you were to say east to west was 180 degrees- 90 being looking directly up in the sky.  Now here is what gets strange My sister took a flashlight that she had and turned it on and off.  At once, as if it was responding, started to blink and moved more noticeably faster but back towards the West moving slightly south as it did so and vanished over the horizon. I did not notice any dancing around, I would just like to add that Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is just a couple of miles away also to our NNW. Coincidence? This is no hoax!

Myself and other witnesses were F4-Phantom Weapons Control Technicians in the USAF.   My eastbound view was of mountains on horizon with first glow of sunrise behind mountains.  Weather calm and completely clear.  1st large oval rises up from directly behind mountians due east from me.  Motion is slow, floating like a blimp or balloon.  At first I thought it was a large blimp with a mirror-like exterior reflecting the sunlight (sun was below the eastern horizon during the entire encounter), object was extremely bright, yet had a distinct oval outline.  After rising a few degrees above mountains object stopped all motion.  Total time to rise up was about 2 minutes.   Second identical object then began to rise just to the left of the first object.  Second object moved identically to first, then stopped next to first at equal altitude.  Third identical looking object then began to rise just to right of first object, at same slow rate, until it was at equal altitude with other 2 objects.  All three objects remained still for about 2 more minutes.  Very curious sight at this time, but all witnesses still thought objects were blimps.   Right-most object then begins to rise slowly above others, stops completely, then moves from a complete stop to a point slightly above the horizon almost directly due south of us (visible out the right side of the car) in about 2 or 3 seconds then comes to a complete stop again.  No acceleration or deceleration was apparent.  Middle object then does exactly the same, stopping next to the other above the southern horizon.  Third object then repeats the same exact manuever.   When all 3 were stopped hovering next to each other then all 3 objects slowly decended torwards the ground until disappearing on the southern horizon.  Objects retained their extreme brightness throughout the entire encounter, even when in a position near the southern horizon where there was no sunlight to reflect in my direction.

We were both Fine Artists. We wanted to get away from Los Angeles, the school system, and the ""rat-race."" We were living in a Lake side Home, at the time of this incident.  I, being a night-owl, had a habit of watching late night TV. It was a cold winter, clear night, after a rather large snow fall. Our Lake-side Chalet type home had large windows, overlooking the Lake--a great view.  As usual, I was alone, on the upper level, watching TV, hoping to become sleepy. The rest of the family were downstairs, in bed.                              During a commercial, I looked out the window, onto the deck, and saw 3 bright, round objects over the Lake. They looked like 3 full moons, in a row. The first one was large, middle one, was smaller, and the 3rd one, was the smallest--like the ""3 Bears"". They were moving along at a steady pace, over the Lake--white in color, very solid--very self contained. no light radiating outside their perimeters. There was no sound.  I wanted to call my husband, but knew that by the time I went downstairs, and awakened him, they would have disappeared around the curve of the Lake-which is the course they were headed.                          I am very much skeptical of UFO sightings--so I thought maybe they were weather balloons, or, ect. I never heard of anyone else that saw them, so I still don't know what they were. I have heard of other sightings in the Lk Arrowhead, Big Bear area. My husband is more of a UFO buff than I, having had a sighting when he was an Airforce Pilot. He was a little disappointed that he hadn't been awake to see what I tried to describe. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

This prompted me to perform an internet Google search (‘Triangular UFO Napa’) which led me to a website in which she had previously posted her recollection of the event in 2002 as per the link below: http://www.scifi.com/ufo/encounters/laura_enc.html   My account differs slightly and given the years since, this is probably to be expected. I am writing to corroborate our story and acknowledge that this experience was a true incident. (If for some reason you need to corroborate this sighting with another’s from that area and year, you may contact me via telephone collect. In fact, if you have such information, I would like to read about it)   My personal recollection of the incident follows below:  As I recall it was a dark moonless night, but clear as the stars were visible. We had stopped briefly for some KFC takeout in St. Helena and were heading up 128 on our way to Lake Berryessa to meet some friends for a weekend boating trip.  At the crest of a small incline in the road which gave us a southwest view of the valley which was then about 20-30’ below us, Laura first noticed a bright light low on the horizon and pointed it out to me. (To my recollection, it was probably about 11:30pm when we made the initial sighting. When we arrived at the lake it was more like 1:30am as per her account).  My quick assessment was that the object (then perhaps 3/4+ mile away) was just a helicopter perhaps spraying the vineyards, but she remained skeptical. As we proceeded along the grade, it was evident watching the light that the craft was coming slowly in our direction moving perhaps at 10-20mph. Laura was not given easily to fear, and her apprehension made me nervous as I recall.  All that was visible was a very bright circular light which hid the details of the object except for perhaps a hint of a horizontal wing form. The surrounding vegetation in front/below of where the object was flying was illuminated by the intense white light emanating from the craft. The object appeared then to be about 15-20’ off the ground.  As we proceeded a bit further up the grade with the object creeping ever closer and higher, we came upon a bend in the road which had a turn out and was surrounded by a grove of eucalyptus(?) trees. I instructed her to pull over and stop the engine so we could hear the motor and determine what the object was. We watched the object come towards us for a few minutes more. It continued to ascend and it wasn’t long before it came directly overhead.  Now directly overhead, the bright light centered on the craft was now facing forward and above us per my recollection. With the light shining away, it was easy to distinguish the triangular shape of the craft against the black sky and stars. Using the height of the 25’ trees as a gauge and having watched the ascent of the object, it appeared then that it was approximately 50’ overhead and perhaps 35’ wide. I would guess it was perhaps 5’ tall in height, but because of the light in front, it was very hard to gauge the shape/size of the object until it was immediately overhead.  My recollection differs here in that I do not recall the object making any sound nor do I remember any colored lights underneath. It was dead quiet as it passed overhead moving at perhaps 15mph and proceeded to climb still higher until it disappeared over the hill behind us. I believe that I saw what appeared to be some sort of metal support system underneath, but it was so dark it is impossible to say with any certainty.  Now rather anxious about what we had just witnessed, we didn’t wait but a minute to start the engine and get out of there. As we were heading around a corner shortly afterwards, two sets of glowing eyes were seen in the bushes alongside of the road. I guessed it was just a pair of deer given the height, but neither of were willing to stop the car and find out what it was, although in hindsight I’m relatively certain it was in fact just a pair of deer or other wildlife as it was a wooded and secluded area.  Now nearing our destination, we came upon a rest area which had a public telephone and stopped. With the hopes that someone could corroborate what we had witnessed, Laura got connected with the Air Force (likely Travis AFB). As I recall from her discussion, the AF indicated that they hadn't spotted any objects on radar nor were any test flights scheduled for the area that evening that might account for the mysterious object we had just seen.  We arrived at our final destination, thankfully, meeting our friends, but late, about 45 minutes by my recollection (which differs from her account of 1 ½ hours). We excitedly told our friends of our experience and they stared at us in utter disbelief and had a great time poking fun at us. Later as we were all sitting around outside gazing at the night sky and talking, we simultaneously witnessed 3 (?) bright objects which came shooting out of nowhere and stop in about a 10 o'clock position on the northwestern horizon, very similar to what we had seen in Yosemite Valley the summer before together along with a different group of friends.  The objects hesitated for a brief moment hovering perhaps at 2000’, and then darted in and out like a game of cat and mouse and with one final push, shot upwards and were gone in the blink of an eye passing through the thin cirrus cloud layer above. That incident lasted but a few seconds in all, but it was enough to convince our friends that perhaps we had seen something after all.  I personally don't recall any jets going after the objects neither before nor after as Laura recounts, but it has been many years and I may have just forgotten. With Travis AFB fairly close by, it wouldn’t surprise me if there were jets in the area at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Then we thought it might be a helicopter since it wasn't moving.   Mr ((name deleted)) cut the engine on the boat but there was no sound coming from that direction.  As we sat there pondering what it might be, the light intensefied and started moving slowly at first coming our way.

I have been tutored by ((two names deleted)) who are CoastToCoastAm paranormal investigators to observe and be skeptical while observing the world around me.  On January 4,2006 at around 5:20 pm I was watching the sunset (which was to the South-west) that was a beautiful purple-pink when I noticed a small black oval shaped object flying across the sunset. It took me half  a second to realize that it could not be a plane, than I started to yell at ((name deleted)) (who was with me) ""look, look"". When he finally was able to see it, it was just a little past the sinking sun .The object was extremely black.  It absolutely reflected no sunlight and was amazingly dark and maintained this color throughout my observation.. In an instant after Dan realized what I was seeing he  ran  inside and told me to keep my eyes on it, so while he was gone I moved toward the other side of the yard to keep it in sight. all the time moving along the top most mountain ridge (in the direction of North-west) about 10-20 miles away over what I believe to have been following the Blue Ridge Parkway. The object carefully maintained a course to fly just above the top edges of the mountains peeking over Mt Pisgah. What stumped me most was that it was flying much too fast to be a conventional jet and it left absolutely no contrail at all. When ((name deleted)) got out of the house and handed me the binoculars the object had just gotten out of sight behind the far side of the sky from us. The whole sighting lasted about 30-35 seconds . When ((name deleted)) and I went back to ponder it he figured out that the object had been going about 8,000 m.p.h using google.earth, our location, and the duration of the sighting.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,35.4608,-82.4715

So, the other week I stepped outside my front door here in Southern California to light up a cigarette(i know, i know)...it was a really nice sunny day out for January, as I stood there I happened  to glance at the sky above me and i noticed an object. MY first reaction to seeing this was, ""what the hell is that?""  I looked around and during this whole event no one on the streets seemed to notice and i have never heard any mention of it since in the media or elsewhere. The best way to describe what i thought i was seeing was like how planets can appear real bright at sun-up or sun-down.  The only problem was that it was around 12:00 in the afternoon.  The sun is very bright in So. Cal. at 12 noon even during winter. This object did not move like what you think of in a zigzagging craft.  In fact, it moved rather slowly across the sky comparable to the moon's path across the sky that day which happened to be the only space object i could see that day.  Or, at least, it should have been the only thing i saw that day. This started to lead me to believe that it was a satellite. However, i have been to the desert at night and seen satellites with my own eyes. It appears to me that satellites move across the sky at a good pace.  Am I wrong? Anyways, i observed this craft or object or whatever for about 1 1/2 hrs.  During this time, i was able to go in and out of my house, watch t.v., go out and check on it again...and i took some pictures... What prompted me to write this was the reaction i got from friends and others when i showed them these images.  In the photos, you can see the bright object next to a cloud for perspective.  I have about 5 pictures of the object itself.  I also took a picture of the moon and an airplane during this time to give perspective on the object's shape. If this object is man-made my guess would be that it is a satellite with a shiny body and two dark panels on the side. The bright middle and dark sides is the characteristic shades/colors of this object.  My camera is only 3.2 megapixels, so i wish i had a more powerful camera that day.  Maybe it is a secret government spying satellite. I honestly have no idea what this object may be...but it is certainly open to debate.  I had never seen the object before and I never have since and it doesn't keep me awake at night.  just thought others might be interested in my observation. That's ma story and im stickin to it!

The ball was about half size in relation to the moon and the tail/flame was about 20 moon lenghts or if the fireball was about a mile or less away (as it appeared to be so) then the tail length may have been about half a mile long.

We saw another person standing, a woman who we talked to - she said she witnessed it also and heard a boom in the ocean where it had crashed - she thought it was ""the military doing something strange"". Shortly after the fireball, maybe 5-10 minutes later I saw a silent helicopter going along the coast, shining a light on the surface of the ocean.  We left and went a few blocks away, close to my home on Vulcan ave in Encinitas.

My friend was with me for about 30 minutes he saw a shooting star or a possible satellite fly across the sky he sighted this for about 3 seconds two days before I saw a very similar thing the night continued and we saw nothing else.  My fried was then picked up by his parents at 19:00 on the night I went back to sky watch. I was watching for 15 minutes and recorded no events. But then at 19:23 I saw two lights fly across the sky I was in utter shock because the thing was so low in the sky it was only the height of a two story building it had not engine noise what so ever that is another thing that really startled me about it I watched for about 20 seconds as it flew past I quickly acted and ran down two stairs that leave off the patio and then I had to get up a flight of 8 stairs these are stairs because it is a house that was built on a slope so there are stairs down to the garden which is a very strange layout. I got up the stairs and got my camera ready I saw the two lights as it past out of sight behind a tree. There is a massive double gate at the top of the stairs and it is chained it is chained because we have recently been getting burglars attempting to get into the garage and steal like they are known to do I pulled endlessly on the chain but it was no use it just would not come on I am not sure if this is due to the cold temperature and the chain was stuck on by ice or frost or something along those lines but it would not come off. I ran down the stairs and round to the other set of stairs which is at the other side of the garden and is a very long way away I got up those stairs but when I got up the stairs there was nothing at all to be seen. But I am 100% sure this is a UFO it could not be identified I just do not know what the hell it could be.  Military Fighter  This is one thing that is really odd about the Sighting I think the government could be chasing this thing as before the sighting I saw a military jet go over which is unusual for that time of night I heard the roar that fighters make and it flew overhead leaving a trail that fighters commonly made it had all red lights flashing and all the other lights were on and it went off into the distant in a Southerly direction then a few minutes later was when I saw the UFO go toward the East then about 2 minutes after the sighting the fighter (possibly the same one) came back and went off to the East it think it was the same because it had all the same lights on it. So I think the government could have possibly been chasing this thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))",2005-12-16T00:00:00,,

On Friday evening, we were driving eastbound on 90 east in MASS.  We were generally in the area of the highway that is south of Pittsfield. Though the sighting duration may seem odd (4 seconds), and leave too many questions for the average skeptic, please allow me to elaborate before you hastily draw a conclusion. I was the driver of the vehicle and had a passenger in both the front and rear of the vehicle.  A rapid movement in the corner of my eye, slightly above and to the left caught my attention.  A green ovular/cigar shaped ball of pure, very green (and unchanging) energy was there, cutting perfectly horizontal to the surface of the earth from right to left.  It was heading from south to the north as we were traveling east. As I caught the end of its horizontal manuever it suddenly, and drastically, changed directions in an impossible fashion.  It was a movement that would be be impossible for any known earth technology.  It was also something that defied the physics of a plane, comet or fireworks.   It suddenly headed downward and at an angle to the left of my position.  It suddenly vanished a hundred feet above the treetops.  The ball of pure light was described by the frontside passenger as ""a green lightsaber type energy.""   Coincidentally, she saw it about 1 second after it caught my eye.  She screamed out, ""Oh my god a plane is crashing!""  Then she suddenly froze up and sort of stuttered when it changed direction and blinked out of existence.  Right when it was over the trees it illuminated them slightly which was strange.  It radiated a green ambient light that matched the color of the energy.  She became very shaken and emotional.  She took out her camera in the event there was another appearance of the craft but it suddenly died entirely.  Ten minutes later, further down the road, it turned on with a 100 percent full charge.  She started talking to the passenger in the back who did not see the craft because of her position. The roof of the car blocked her line of sight.  She began getting teared up and inexplicably emotional.  We both agreed that we felt very vulnerable.  She began saying that she felt as though she was a child laying in bed.  Before she could go further with the analogy, I completed the thought by saying, ""...like when you feel completely unsafe and prone when there are no covers over you.""   She became more shaken and said, ""That is EXACTLY what I was going to say!""   Though we were driving from the New York area to New Hampshire, a 6-7 hour trip, it took forever.  We did get lost at one point but we couldn't take into account the FULL three to four hours that were added to our trip time (total of 10 hours or so).  We had no notice of any sort of incongruity that might come with ""missing time"".  When we finally arrived at our destination, the other witness talked to her friend that did not see the ship in private.  The non-witness came out to the living room and told me the witness was tearing up and clearly shaken.  The other witness had no prior interest in UFO phenomenon or anything relating to the subject matter. I  myself have always been interested and I have to say that this was 100 percent unexplainable and absolutely extraordinary!",2005-12-16T00:00:00,42.47261239669422,-73.27416033057851

I live just east of Lincoln Airport in Northern California. they were silent and moving in a perfect arrow formation. They looked to be about 700 to 1000 ft up, (airport pattern altitude), almost overhead of me but a few hundred feet west and moving very fast, apx 300 or 400 knots. They were close enough at first that I could see their sphere structure, but no lines or dots or ribbing or anything, just opaque globes. They appeared perfectly round and exactly alike. They flew like they were a single unit but I could see space between them. There were no lights or twinkles or anything like that. If I wouldnt have been gazing right up there I probably wouldnt have noticed. They were mostly white but ever so slightly orange tinted. Their coarse looked like due north and about 6 or 7 seconds into my event the formation made a slight but instantanious course change of about 5 or 6 degrees west. It appeared to be a perfectly angular turn with no perceptible curve. That really blew my mind. I watched and strained to hear a sound as the formation became so dim I could no longer see it. I never heard a sound. It was really dark, visibility was very good, the moon was rising . The whole thing was over in about 15 seconds. I know what I saw, I just dont know what it was I saw. One other thing that occurs to me,if you check out your maps you will see that at that speed and course they would very shortly be over or near Beale Airforce Base which is a pretty secure base, (SR71 / U2 types).",2005-12-16T00:00:00,38.937,-121.2519

First off, I am not a liar nor do I have anything to gain from this report. I know the chances of a UFO sighting is rare, and I know that multiple encounters almost never happen. But I beleive this is due to the fact that simply no one is looking up or noticing what is around them everyday. I felt compelled to seek this site out and tell my stories since my latest sighting is the third within 48 hours. But I have had several encounters with these objects over the past 10 years. I will explain below. I will start with the first of the three sightings this week:  Sighting 1 -  On 11/17/05 at approximately 18:35 while driving east on Tellico Pkwy in Lenoir City,TN I noticed two extremely bright lights hovering approximately 200-300ft. over the lake. This was a familiar site to me as I've seen it before, so I pulled into the next boatdock that happened to be within site of the object. I watched as the object slowly creep across the lake and change direction several times before flying over the hills. I also noticed that it seemed to be purposely  staying away from the houses.   Sighting 2 - At precisely 22:50 that same evening, while sitting at a traffic light near the Wal-Mart/Home Depot plaza in Lenoir City TN at , adjacent to the highway in a field I noticed the two extremely bright lights again slowly hovering approximately 200-300ft off of the ground. The traffic light turned green but since there was only one other car on the road, I decided to sit and watch this object. I rolled down the window to hear a faint ""shooosh"" sound coming from the craft. It continued to slowly make it's way torwards me but the veered off away from me right before passing over. I turned my vehicle around and decided to try follow the slow moving craft, but in an instant, the craft quicky accelerated out of sight.  Sighting 3 - Earlier this morning,at precisely 5:42, I was heading east over Ft.Loudoun Dam in Lenoir City TN, when I notice the object hovering over the lake approx 300yds off the highway. Again it was very low to the surface. I pulled off to watch for approximately 1 min before the craft did a perfect 360 and headed north.  As I said before, I've had multiple sightings of what I believe is this very same type of craft. My very first sighting was approximately 10 years ago in Loudon out in the country. I'm guessing the time was around 22:00 - 23:00 and noticed the craft slopwly moving across the top of the treeline. I immediately knew this wasn't your everyday airplane. I followed the best I could with what roads I could find to lead me in the same direction. This went on for about 10 minutes. I managed to get within a few hundred yards of the object, but eventually lost it.  My next sighting would prove to be the best to date. It about 5 years ago. I was driving west on Hwy 72 in Monroe County leaving Vonore TN. It was approx. 23:00 - 24:00 When topping a hill I noticed a tractor trailer heading my direction violently swerve over the yellow line. I slowed to see what was up when I ten saw the craft about 400 yds in front of me hovering 100ft over the highway. I assume the truck driver was seeing what I was. Though I'm not sure if he stopped as well. I watched the craft hover across the highway into the wooded area to the left of me out of sight. And then to my surprise, to my right was another craft slowly headed northeast of me. It was about the same height off of the ground. I creeped my vehicle down the highway to watch this second craft when the object stopped and changed directions. I pulled off to the side of the road and I turned off my vehicle hoping to hear a sound. I proceeded to get out. I watched the second craft for at least two minutes when all of a sudden I started to hear this ""shooooooshing"" sound coming from behind me. I looked around and saw the first craft headed directly over top of me. It was now about 200 ft over me.  These crafts appear to be approximately 30ft in dia. I can tell it's either a diamond or cross shape due to it's lighting pattern. It has two very bright lights in front with one light on each point of the craft. The rear light appears to be red or green and usually blinking. To anyone not paying special attention, the lighting configurations may look like a common domestic aircraft, but their maneuvers are quite uncommon. The only military aircraft that I know of capable of this is the Marine's Harrier or the new F/A-22. But these crafts appear to be smaller and extremely quite when compared to the two. If these are indeed military, then they have managed to keep this secret aircraft under wraps for at least a decade. If they are visitors from another world, then what better camouflage than closely mimicking our aircraft's lighting designs. Ether way , I hope to get one of these objects on film very soon. I should also mention that all of my sigthings have all been in the colder months. Not sure what significance that is,(if any) but it's defintely worth noting.  If anything, I hope this report causes more people out there to look up more often and pay closer attention. It's very easy to get into a routine and take your surroundings for granted. I would imagine there would be thousands more sightings every month if not every week if people would just look to the skies more often.

S. military.  We believe that the report deserves special attention.  PD)) Flurry of small bright flashing lights going east to west in random formation as if they were bees that were disturbed. My wife had asked me to go with her on our back porch because she wanted to smoke and wanted someone to talk with.  That was when my wife noticed strange lights in the night sky and brought it to my attention.  There were dozens, perhaps hundreds of lights that were blinking white light in different intensities. They were traveling from over Keel mountain east to west direction heading towards Huntsville.  There was no organization to these lights.  My wife got her telephone and called her friend to tell her what we were witnessing.  While she was talking on the phone I noticed a group of these white lights formed a large circle behind our house out in the field and stopped for several minutes and began to flash wildly.  They didn't flash all at once but randomly wild with intensity.  They must've been two hundred feet away and about one hundred feet off the ground.  They were not equally spaced but they did form a perfect circle.  After a few minutes the lights from the circle that they created took off like a stream of bees flying.  They took off west towards Huntsville too.  I couldn't make out any shapes and didn't hear any sound.  There were more of these lights coming over Keel mountain when my wife pointed to a faint object overhead.  It looked like a faint burnt orangish disk that was stationary in the sky.  I went into the house and got my telescope out to see what it was.  The object was still there.   My wife is far sight and kept telling me that there was a second object overhead too but I couldn't see it.  What I could see with my telescope just made me more confused of what I was looking at.  It looked like a faint burnt orangish disk with knobs on the bottom like you see with some reflectors. The flurry of white lights finally ceased but the disk overhead was still there but faintly.  Afterwards my wife and I went inside because we were getting too cold.  We were speachless as to what we witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the multiple lights may have been, but we have written the witness, asking what direction the clouds were moving at the time of the sighting of those lights.  We suspect that the orange-colored object may have been Mars, which currently is quite prominent in the eastern sky at the time indicated.

I'm a retired ((rank deleted--senior, career military)). We are not comfortable about doing this. The sky was crystal clear that night.  The wind was a gentle ENE that evening.  High that day was 50 and the low for that night was predicted to be 25.  I agree that the burnt orange was Mars.  If my wife didn't see this for herself, then I wouldn't be writing you now.

My family were on a road trip to Utah in  September of 2005. On Interstate 80 in Wyoming, driving through miles of farm or pasture lands, on the 27th or 28th in the late afternoon, I noticed jet streams from aircraft at extremely high altitudes. This is normal and did not concern me. But as I looked occasionally due to bordom of the drive, I slammed on my brakes due to a fear that ""something"" may have fallen off one of these air planes and was about to hit the roadway.  As I kept my focus on the object, I drove very slowly, realizing that it was not falling. I guestimate the object was approximatly 300-600 yds above ground. It was almost directly overhead. It was difficult to make out shape due to what I first believed was a very strong reflection of sunlight comming off the matalic surface of the object. It had a compact form, and I believe it to be a spherical shaped object. It did not have wings, strobes, lights, or propellers.  It was still day light. My wife asked why it was so brite.  I told her it might be a weather baloon and it was reflected sunlight. My wife said,""No! We're driving west, the sun is over there (in the direction of our travel), it can't be reflecting the sun."" I became nervous at the relization that she was correct.  Then the object turned dark. This was as strange as the brightness. It did not just turn off the light, it became a black sphere in the sky floating above our car.  Then it took off.  I have never seen anything move that fast in my life. It traveled west and was no longer visible within seconds.  As we calmed our children down we tried to rationalize what we had seen. About 5-10 minutes later, my wife yells ""there it is."" Just as before, above us, slightly in front, extremly close.  Again, it turned black, and took off.  I took the next exit and waited.  Hoping (sort of) that it would appear again (may possibly be three seperate objects, or same one that ""circled back"" with out us seeing it). As my wife looked for the camera, it did appear again, but this time it turned to black much faster and, again, took off in the same direction.  Based on size above our heads, and when it visually was no longer visible as it travelled, I guestimate it travelled over at least 100 miles within seconds. No trail, no sound.

I live in reno Nv, I was on the football team;Hug Hawks.Game over my dad drove me and my girlfriend home, his truck did not have the dip stick for tranmisson, he knew of this and told us to go to the bathroom now because he is not stoping. About a hour into the dive i fall a sleep, my dad keeps go ahead on I-80 west. My dad had to go to the bathroom so he pulled over and his truck take a dive; rocking the truck. At the same time a cop put his lights up and pulls my dad over. He says my dads tail lights did not work, but he falt bad for my dad because he put over 5k in the truck and had the bill to show that he just took the truck to the shop. But my dads truck did not start, the cop called for a tow truck... We wait for a hour then my dad calls everyone to get some help, then my girlfriend said she got (AAA) to tow the truck. I my dad and girlfriend wait for a half an hour, then I start watching my game that I just played. After watching the game I heared the bus that I rode on to get to the game pass bye. I start to fell a sleep, then my dad wakes me in a vocie that I could tell something was wrong. He ask me to look at a light at some what the top of the hill, I say about 500 foot hill. I looked at the light I said its some house light, then right one time the light starts to movie to the right fast, going over all hills, rocks, bushes, and not rocking the light. It was a soild beam of light pointing right at me and my dad. Moving very fast the beam of light was all way on us. The light moved side to side about 45deg left and 45deg right very fast. Then I woke my girlfriend she said the same thing i said the frist time but I and my dad said just look at the light now all 3 of us was look at a beam of light high in the hill, as it start to move my girlfriend jumps in the truck. My dad pointing a flash light at the light and it stoped and as all way was about 5 feet above the ground, my dad truned off the light and the beam of light would start to move toward us. Right away my dad turn the light on the beam of light would stop but not for long. It would start to moving side to side, and come closer and closer to me and my dad. My dad was not very happy with what is going on he gaves me a knive, and the light. He starts to call the tow truck tell the what is going on and we need to get out of there. As times pasts it get down the hill and now in the valley, now about 500 yards way form us. I with knive in hand and light start to walk towards the light, the beam was moving side to side so i just walk in a straight line form the truck. I pointed the light at the beam of light and start to walk away form the truck about a 50 yards my dad was about 25 yard way. He was talk to the tow truck guy. I think it took them 3 hours to get there. But any way as I'm walk to the beam of light I heard no sounds, the beam of light came at me so fast it was not funny. It was so close I could see the bushes and the little hill on the land, at the same time I saw the light in a better veiw. It did not light up anything that was not in the beam, like a lazer. I ran to the truck and my dad fallowed, we all jumped in the truck and waited. As the light movie side to side it was about 200 yards a way. We just waited as it got closer then start to back up, but then it would move so fast i dont even really think any would go that fast then stop and move to the right and left. I was scared my dad was scared my girlfriend was scared. As we watched the light move for about 30 more mins. The tow truck guys came, the frist thing we said was can u look at that light, as he did he was like its nottin, just like me the beam of light started to move. He went to work get us out of their, 15 mins of look at the light we were got out of there. But as we left the light rose form the ground and start to fellow us about 5 miles the light went away. I cant say the light was a UFO or something esle, just because the street we broke down on name is Grave Yard or something like that. Just that makes me fill I cant say what it was, all i can say is I saw what I saw... It Was a clean Light like a lazer. ((name deleted))",2006-03-11T00:00:00,40.94276697247706,-115.78832935779818

Carmel. We were carrying on a conversation when my wife interupted and asked me what the blinking light outside my passenger window was in the sky. I figured since it was in the sky it was a plane and ignored what she was looking at. Again, she asked me about the light and this time looking for it where she was pointing, it moved from us observing it from the passenger window of my car to the driver's side. Having caught my attention with the rapid rate of speed, what had me in awe was now it was stationary. We were unable to make out a shape due to the cloud cover, but the lights spread at a pattern to large to be a plane. They now appeared dirrectly above us as I drove into town. I found myself leaning as hard as I could on my steering wheel to observe these odd lights.  The lights burst through the clouds reminding me of powerful spot lights or explosions, except the lights would flash in the exact same position in different patterns. The lights appeared to be a fire orange, but again more as a powerful spot light not a flame. Going from two to six to four, it changed constently flashing a different number of lights every second.  I immediatley called a co-worker from my cell phone to see if he could see the ligths from the town to the east of us. Picking up his phone the first words were not hello, but ""What are those lights in the direction of your house?"". Soon after the phone call the lights disappeared from what I could see, but the co-worker could still see them. I had turned around with no luck of resighting the strange lights. The next day I spoke with the co-worker and he advised he had seen the same type of pattern of lights. The only difference was that he described them in an orb shape. Another co-worker had heard the conversation and said she had seen the same type of orb shape with the same description of lights. I still am curious as to what could have caused not only a huge area of lighting, but to be able to move at the witnessed speed of the lights. Especially to come to a halt after the rapid speed.

It was sometime in November or December of 2005 in the afternoon around 4:30 pm. I was using the internet inside the house when I heard my two dogs outside errupt in a frensy of barking that seemed particularly alarming.  I tried to ignore it for a while, but it only got worse and I was alarmed too. I went outside to see what on earth was going on and I found my grandmother sitting in the garden.  She told me excitedly that she had been yelling for me for a while to come and see a strange craft in the sky though I had not heard her.  She had been watching it approach the house from the direction of Ventura Blvd towards Adolfo Rd., hovering, then flying in a path paralel to Lewis Rd. The dogs were disturbed, barking like crazy looking upward at the sky over our backyard fence.  I looked up and saw a light grey to silverish, reflective, solid disk hovering silently past the house rather slowly and indecisively and then picking up speed.  Amazingly, it had the solid metalic bulk of a normal aircraft but with a saucer-disk shape and  could slowly hover and ""float"" silently and weightlessly like a baloon and then pick up speed and follow a straight path.  It had a reflective, very shiny exterior.  I could see it very clearly and was amazed.  It was like no aircraft I have ever known to exist in fact.  It looked like your ""typical 1950's"" flying saucer. My grandmother said that she had been watching it approach for some minutes and that it had been very low over the house and had ascended a bit by the time I saw it.  It was oddly silent and left no trail.  I was surprised that my dogs were so disturbed by it since they don't react at all when noisy helicopters and planes fly over the house often and at times quite low since there is an airport and a military base nearby.  They seemed to be able to distinguish the unique and alarming nature of the craft as well as we two humans could. I want to stress that we had a perfect view of the UFO as it was directly over the house and we both clearly saw it.  As I watched it, it finally picked up speed, ascended and disapeared and reapeared in the atmosphere until about a block away it vanished. In the past, when I have seen footage of UFO's, I have believed that they were pathetic ploys for attention and the result of special camera effects.  I now know that this is not always the case.  What I saw confirmed the t.v. footage I have so long been skeptical of, expcept, in person the sighting is clearer and more dimensional and tangible and ""truthful"" than a camcorder can convey.  Sometimes the t.v. footage looks blured.  What we witnessed was a solid clear craft.  The truth of its shape was tangible though extraordinary.  I wondered in amazement that a flying saucer could silently and boldly skoot though the skies of a quiet suberban neighborhood in such a clandestine way.  I had to see it to believe it. My friends say they have seen strange glowing UFO's in the dark early morning skies before work that are ""star-like"" but absolutely not stars.  They note that there are many sightings around military bases and think that these are secret government projects kept from the public.  It makes me wonder.",2006-03-11T00:00:00,34.219553525641025,-119.03310224358974

I'm writing to report sightings on 2 different nights.  1st in November: I work night shift and was coming home (about 5:30 am Eastern time) when I saw what looked like a shooting start right in front of me and it ended behind some trees. When I turned onto my road (I was driving south on the road) my eyes scanned the sky to see if I could see any other shooting stars when I saw a pretty bright orangish-yellow light in the Western sky and I thought it was an unusually bright star. Once I got home and got out of my car (only 1/2 mile down from where I first saw the object) I could not see it anymore in the sky. There was a clear view from that point as my home is on a hill and there were no trees or clouds in the way. I thought this was strange. When I turned to the Eastern sky I could see what looked like the blinking lights of a plane going from North to South, but what was strange was the object flying about 2 thumbs widths underneath the plane. It was a large object, about twice the size of the plane, but glowed a dull orange color and kept up with the plane. I watched it until both of them disapeared trying to figure out what the orange thing was. I still have no idea.  After this I went inside where I saw my husband and told him what I saw. He just shrugged it off. I then went into my kitchen which has windows facing both North and West. Looking out one of the windows facing the west I saw another dull orange object low in the horizon, similar to what I saw following under the plane. However this one was stationary and very low and looked a bit bigger. Below it were the 2 yard lights that I see through the trees everynight that a neighbor on the other hill has on. This orange light was about twice the size of one of the white yard lights and a bit higher than them and was above the tree line back there. The orange light started to change after a bit and would change into a red color, and when it did this it would get smaller almost like it was going further in the distance (further west) and then it would grow again and become the dull orange color. It did this a few times over a 5 minute period, during which time my husband did come to the window to look at it, and finally went to a red that just faded to nothing. Neither my husband or I have any idea what this could have been.  My husband went to the bedroom to get ready for bed and I sat there waiting to see if the light would come back when I saw a small flash out of the corner of my eye a bit to the north (but still in the western sky) of where I was looking and there was a yellow light/star again in about the same spot the very first one I had saw when I was driving home would have been if it had still been there. This light started moving to the east and I had to move to the other window in my kitchen that faces north to keep track of it. When the object was almost due north of us it changed from a dull orange-yellow to a rapid flickering that red/blue/white could be seen in.  Due to the red and blue I was wondering if maybe this was just a plane, but soon this flickering light grew in size and became even more rapid and chaotic and the flight path became erratic bouncing up, down or short bursts forward at times. Then once it reached the northeast sky it changed back to a smaller glowing dull yellow-orange and came to a stop. At this point another small flash in the north western sky caught the attention out of the corner of my eye - seemed to be the exact place the other objects came from. It also immediately took the same path as the previous one when another flash again caught the corner of my eye and I could see yet another dull yellow light moving to the east. The flashes I never saw straight on - they were out of the corner of my eye. By this time my husband was back to watch and he also witnessed the two new yellow objects going across the northern sky from the west to east. Neither of these became erratic like the first one, but they both stopped in near the previous one in the northeast sky. One then continued on to the Southeast changing to a dull red and I lost sight of it out of the window. I moved to another room to watch it but I found it just in time to see it fade away. The other two didn't move and just sat there looking like two stars - And I would have believed they were if I hadn't seen them moving to that point earlier. I watched them for about 10 minutes before finally going to bed around 6:40 AM.  2nd in January: Driving home from work, again about 5:30 am Eastern an orange object caught my attention in the North sky.  It was lower and closer than the the objects in November and below the tree line.  It was more a cylinder shape with a sharper outline.  It glowed a dull orange.  I slowed to watch it but it didn't move so I continued on home - which wasn't far away.  When I got home I looked for it and it was there, now above the tree line and brighter, but not as distinct in shape as before - it looked rounder, so I'm not even sure if it was the same thing, though it was in the same area.  My husband also saw this one as I called him to come look at it.  The thing sat there in the sky for a few minutes and then started to bounce up and down in an erratic motion.  I kept asking ""what the heck can move like that?"" as it was even more erratic than the things I saw in November.  After about 3-5 minutes it settled down and stilled.  Then it slowly moved to the west before dimming out.  It left a smaller and duller red light that blinked twice before completely dissapearing.  What the heck could these things be??  We do live in a high-air traffic area, but planes are pretty easy to identify.  There have also been other times where we had slow moving orange lights, but nothing compared to these two incidents.

( I am in my 50’s ), and at approximately 9:15 p.m. CST on Friday, March 11th 2005, I took my dog out into our back yard. It was a very clear night and the stars were bright.   Maybe 10-15 minutes had passed by and I looked up at the sky just to gaze at all the stars.  Then something caught my eye.  Coming from the East was a pair of objects that looked about as bright as a star and traveling side by side and maybe 100-200 yards across from each other.  Both were a steady white color and traveling at what seemed like a high altitude.   But, behind them, and maybe at a slightly lower altitude, was also another object.  It almost looked as if the front two objects were leading the back object, or the back object was following the front two. I could not see a shape or anything other than the white lights of the first two objects.  The back object had what looked like three colors that rotated and they appeared to be towards the bottom. It had red on the starboard side, white in the center, and blue on the port side.  These lights were all about the same intensity as far as brightness. To me, it reminded me of a toadstool. That is, it looked like a disc on top and then like a short stem in the center and that is the area which the lights appeared to be coming from.   As I watched these three objects approaching the Des Moines area, the two white objects traveling together made a gradual turn and took a new heading of SSW.  As they made the turn, I could see stars in between them so this seemed to rule out the idea of them as one large object. No contrails could be seen.  The object with the rotating lights continued on its east to west path and as it passed over head I did not see any lights, but once it passed over, I could once again see these rotating colors.  The first time I saw it I was going to dismiss it as a jet that maybe had its landing lights on, because that would explain the white light in the middle.

Not registering that it was something like i have never seen before.  He laughed and then stopped and looked confused.   It moved fairly slow but slower than an airplane or helicopter at this height.  It was heading over the trees to the right of us with 2 big white lights.  Not regular sized lights but lights so big that they do not exist on this earth.  It headed over the road and stopped to the left in the sky no more than a 1000 ft. high.   It  completely stopped moving when we stopped to check it out.  When we completely stopped the bright white lights tured into two red lights with a yellow light in the middle.  It was too dark to see because the light just overpowed the view of any object behind it.  After ten secods it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was changing a lightbulb on an outside light of my residence.  I observed an aircraft in the distance traveling on a course that I have observed many commercial aircraft to take in a Eastern to Western fashion.  My location was North of the objects flight trajectory.   I continued to screw the light housing back on and was anxious to get inside out of the cold.  As I stepped down from the task, I noticed that the object that I previously observed was making a wide turn and was approaching a northern direction.  The craft was approximately 1-2 miles south of my location.  What really grabbed my attention was the wingspan of the craft.  It was low to the ground and had a truely wide wingspan.   There was no noise at this time, and the aircraft reminded me of a ""glider"".  I stood fixated on the object and I was amazed as it passed over, directly over myself and the house.  I could see that there were no wings protruding outward at any part of the craft.  The craft was a continuous solid diamond shape, with the ""tail"" longer than the front.  It looked like a giant kite.  The craft was noisy as it passed over, but I could not recognize what its propulsion system was.  It was not a ""prop"" sound, and it was not a ""turbine"" sound. The object had three dim white circular lights 3/4 to the rear.  There was a bright ""headlight"" or ""searchlight"" on the front tip, red and blue beacons on the ""sides"", and a blinking white beacon on the ""tail"".  As the craft passed over, I ran into the house to get my girlfriend and have her take a look.  By the time we were back outside,(30 seconds) the craft was on the N.W. horizon and looked like a conventional aircraft.

I arrived home from shopping and parked my vehicle in the garage.  Neighbors were walking westward down our cul-de-sac street when they passed in front our driveway and asked ""do you see the light in the sky?'  I stepped out of the garage and walked down the driveway approximately 20 feet to the street in order to see a trail of glowing orange-white light low in the western sky.  This trail of light had a ""switchback"" appearance to it and originated in the west and traveled across the low horizon towards my location in the east.  This trail glowed quite brightly with varying intensities across the length of the trail for approximately 10-15 minutes and then slowly disipated and disappeared.  Above the trail of orange-white light low in the sky appeared a very bright blue-white light traveling northeast to southwest high in the sky at a constant altitude.  This bright blue-white light illuminated an obvious and very large ""cone"" of smoke or spent gas behind it as it progressed across the sky.  This light burned much shorter than the low trail of light glowed - perhaps 5-7 minutes.  When the bright blue-white light extinguished it did so with a momentary super-intense bright white flash.  After the high, bright blue-white light extinguished the extremely large ""cone"" of smoke or gas eminating from behind the light was still visible for approximately 10 minutes until it too disipated and disappeared.  Throughout the event I was looking at the western sky with binoculars and sighted 5 aircraft that appeard to be helicopters operating along the low horizon.  Local radio news reports broadcast on KFYI AM 550 in Phoenix, AZ reported the event as a ""top-secret satellite launch from Vandenburg A.F.B. in California"".  I have witnessed several night launches of missles, rockets and space launch vehicles (some from Vandenburg A.F.B.) and none of these previous launches left a ""switchback"" trail of orange-white spent gasses in the atmosphere.  Further, if this was a vertical, space-vehicle launch, what explains the bright, blue-white light traveling northeast to southwest across the sky at a constant altitude and then extinguishing with a flash?  I could understand the news report as a ""satellite launch"" if the launch vehicle went out of control (creating the ""switchback"" trail of orange-white light) and the launch was pre-empted by ground control and the vehicle destroyed.  That would also explain the ""horziontal"", northeast to southwest travel of the bright, blue-white light at a constant altitude, the ""cone"" of smoke or gas behind it and the momentary super-intense bright white flash just before the light extinguished.

I looked over the road and beyond my Aunt's cornfield, midway between the tall pines trees and ground was a large anitque gold colored object, slim on both ends and large in center, rather like an oval stretched out.  Along the length (centered) was something that looked like port holes. The top was dome shaped.  I remember it just sat there, no movement, no nothing!  I looked for about five minutes because I had never seen anything like it.  I knew it wasn't a blimp nor helicopter or plane.  Living about 40 miles from an air base I was use to blimps, planes and helicopters. What I saw wasn't any of those.  This has haunted me for 54 years and whenever I go home for a visit I always ride over to just stare at the place where I saw that thing, trying to figure out what I saw and why.

My grandmother lived at the end of rowhouses and I was facing the other backyards and my aunt was facing the street behind me.   Along the street behind me were maple trees that were about 20-30 ft. tall and the yards all were separated by fences but they had no tall trees in them.  My grandmother's house was a 2 1/2 story house not quite as tall as the trees along the street.   As I was talking to my aunt with my arms crossed something came into view above her head and I watched in amazement as a gun metal grey disk with orange/white lights around the edges of the whole craft (I describe the color as orange/white because it is very hard to describe the color correctly)floated towards us over the yards.  I was in shock and did not say a word to my aunt I just kept staring at it as it came to rest right above us.

I was a loadmaster on C-130A aircraft shuttling out of Camh Rahn Bay, South Vietnam in 1966.  I was standing outside of the little barracks hut around 0300 hours awaiting the arrival of the motor pool to transport me to the flight line for a 0600 departure.  As I stood there waiting for the motor pool to arrive, I saw in the distance what I thought was an aircaft coming in to the base for a landing.  Usually, I would not have taken much notice of this because I had seen many different aircraft night landings.  But because this aircraft (object) had what I thought was a larger than normal white landing light, and was approaching the runway at an unusually slow speeed and wavering in such a manner as if though it were flying through a rough air pocket, I began to take notice of its approach.  Also, I could not hear any sound coming from the its engine.  I was certain that this aircraft was going to crash before it could land.  My first reaction was that this object was a helicopter, and the helicopter had lost engine power and was trying to make the runway to land.  But, as the object appeared over the runway, it just stopped completely in mid air and didin't move for what seemed like two to three minutes.  The bright light was still shinning but I still could not hear any sound from the engine.  All of a sudden, the object started bouncing up and down like a bouncing ball.  This bouncing lasted for about 5 seconds.  Then the object stopped bouncing and became stationary for about two seconds.  And, in another split second the object hurled itself about about 25 yards to its left and began bouncing up and down again for another five seconds.   The object then again stopped bouncing and remained stationary for about two seconds.  And again, in a split second, hurled itself seemingly back to where it had stopped in the beginning, and began again bouncing up and down.  But this time as the object bounced, it seemed to stop abruptly in mid-bounce (as if it had just noticed that I was watching it), and in another split second shot upwards into the atmosphere as if it had been shot out of a cannon.  It ascended upwards at maybe a 50 or 60 degree angle and at a speed faster than any aircraft I had ever seen before.  I stood there for approximately three or four minutes and watched the bright light on this object ascend into the atmosphere and grow smaller and smaller until it became smaller than the few stars that were in the sky and finally disappearing from my view.

Occasionally when we were outside at night you could see satellites beeping by or planes of all descriptions.  You see, we lived close to Scott Air Force Base. So we were accustomed to these things. However, one night when I was outside I was looking into the night sky when suddenly there was a very bright orange object (noiseless) streaking across the sky. It stopped abruptly over the town in the distance and started to waver. First slowly to the left and then the right, then up and down. It would seem to start to fall, then rise again very shakily.  By this time I had called my sister to come watch. While we were both out there watching this one, ANOTHER one came from out of no where.  When I say that I mean that again, there was no sound or noise, and it streaked by so fast that it was incomprehensible.  It then stopped dead in midair beside the other one, which was faltering badly in the air.   The second one lifted itself up and down accordingly and steadily to be close to the first one in trouble. It (the second one) then moved closer until they were ""joined"". A few seconds passed and then the orange light was much brighter. They then split apart in opposite directions so fast that you couldn't see where they went. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",,38.6303,-90.0121

Camper park near Homestead, FL AFB.  Saw something with red lights along the side and a white light in front rise from trees a half mile away.  Rose slowly, then moved horizontally out over the water for about ten minutes at a slow pace.  When it came over land, it moved extremely fast, then slowed down again over water.  It kept up this circular pattern the whole time.  It was visible for over an hour.  Made a jet engine whine, but very faint. There was a gravel road built up out of the water (the way they do down there) and the ship seemed to cross it a mile away. My dad drove us down to look. We found an Air Force car and a uniformed man who refused to acknowledge the thing we were pointing at.  He said there were just 'some boys out here drinking beer', and he wouldn't let us go any farther.  The craft was clearly visible, but he wouldn't even look over his shoulder.  We drove back to camp, and my boyfriend took a walkie-talkie with him and walked back down the road to see if he could get closer on foot.   The craft crossed over the road above him when I was talking to him on the radio. The radio cut out, and he came running back in a panic.  The radio worked again as soon as the craft moved on. Eventually, the craft dropped down, out of sight, like a balloon landing. It was no balloon.  When we asked the campground manager the next day, he shrugged it off.

There had been reports of UFO sightings in the Perth Amboy area for several days before this.  These events were even reported in a local newspaper.  My friend and I laughed about these reports as we both thought the poor ignorant fools were actually witnessing Venus and didn't know any better.  We were a bit cocky since we had a little knowledge of astronomy, and we were young.   Several minutes into our observing Venus, my friend said to me, what's that?  I looked up and saw two small lights moving in a northerly direction toward us, side by side, and about to move directly over my (parents) house. Since we lived in the flight path of Newark airport, I thought the lights were the wing lights of an airliner, and I said to my friend, it's just a plane, why?   I then went back to looking through my telescope.  My friend, who was older then me and a very intelligent kid, said, ""but there's no plane in the middle"".  I thought that was a silly thing for him to say, and I then looked back up.  Sure enough he was right; there was no plane in between the lights.   Now we just kept looking up at these small moving lights, not sure what they were, but not thinking UFO's.  We were just curious as to what aircrafts would be traveling so high up (20,000 feet or more), next to each other in this way.   When they were almost directly overhead, one of the lights came to a complete stop while the other light made a 45 degree turn around it and then both lights started to travel easterly, at a right angle from their original path.  This was absolutely shocking since there were no crafts either of us had ever heard of that could do such a thing.  We were stunned into silence as we watched the small lights continue their new easterly path.  After a few more seconds both lights stopped altogether, at a point that a small star was between them (we thought it was a star).  The two lights turned around this star in such a manner as to resume their original configuration as they had been when they were traveling northerly.   At this point all three lights started to move north together!  Obviously, the center light was not a star, but it was another craft that had been waiting for the other two crafts (lights).  Up to this point my friend and I didn't say a word, we just watched in sheer, silent amazement.  As the lights traveled north toward Newark airport, we started to talk to each other and ask, what did you see?   Neither of us has ever been able to explain the event.   To this day I do not believe that the earth is being visited by aliens, simply because of the incredible distances and time involved in traveling from solar system to solar system.  However, I do not know how to explain what we saw that day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

Back on June 6, 2002, I was camping at a place called Tuttle Creek, near the town of Lone Pine, which is near Mount Whitney (the tallest mountain in the continental United States). I know it was the 6th of June, because that was my 68th birthday.  I was with another retiree, a buddy of mine, ((name deleted)).  After a long day of fishing and BSing, we cooked and ate dinner, watched a VHS movie in my RV, then went to sleep. It was about 1 AM, and I woke up because, well, my buddy’s snoring was just too loud for me to sleep through.  I went outside and sat on the picnic table to have myself a cigar. After about a minute or so, I started to have this stange feeling, like the little voice inside me was talking.  It was then that a light or reflection above me caught my eye. I looked up and, low and behold, there was this triangle craft moving above me, I would guess, about 5-10 mph. It was about 1000 feet up, and and it didn't make any sound.  It was about 50-60 feet long by 30-40 feet wide, and had a reddish-orange light on each point.  The sky was clear and you can see all the stars, except for the ones that this craft blocked out. I pounded on the RV to wake up ((name deleted)). He came out cussing at me, and I all I had to do was point upward to shut him up.  He was just as shocked as I was.  We watched this craft for almost 5 minutes, and then suddenly the craft started to move faster, and within a few seconds it was out of our line of sight.  We stood up the rest of the night exchanging opinions about what we thought the craft was.  We came to the conclusion that it was either a new experimental secret government aircraft (we both worked on the F-117 Stealth Fighter, so we knew that it could have been a new secret aircraft), mass hallucination (that was ((name deleted))  2 cents), or an extraterrestrial craft.

Conditions were very bright and clear.  We were all out on our roof garden enjoying the great weather and my girlfriend, who was lying on her back sunbathing, suddenly pointed straight up and said ""whats that up there?""  At first my friend and I couldnt really see anything obvious and this wasnt helped by the brightness of the sky or the fact that we didnt know what we were looking for. However within a few seconds of scanning the area my partner was indicating, we managed to spot what had captured her attention.  It appeared to be a small shiny silvery-white sphere, just hanging there above us - it was impossible really to say if they were very small or very high, but they were probably at least a few thousand feet high.  Within a few seconds of spotting this sphere i noticed another one, and then another and then more. They were all in the same area of the sky and i think there were between 7-9 altogether, either just hanging there or moving very slowly.  At first we thought they might be birds but their movement was not consistent with this idea, no circling or anything - just stationary or drifting very slowly.  As we stood watching them, over a period of 4-5 mins they gradually moved into a 'V' formation directly above us and stayed stationary in this position for several minutes - we realised then for sure that they couldnt have been balloons either and this was something out of the ordinary. We became quite excited at this point and i ran indoors to get my camera and our friend dashed of to his car to get his binoculars.  However, by the time we got back the spheres had begun to break formation and drift apart. Looking through the binoculars didnt show any further detail,  but we could definitely see that they were solid objects.  I put my 70-210mm telephoto lens on my SLR and snapped off a few pictures, one at around 70mm showing 3 of the spheres in the frame and another at 210mm showing just one. I have enclosed scans of the prints.  Upon enlarging the scan of the 210mm zoomed picture a little more detail became evident, showing in fact the object is not a sphere but more teardrop or shell shaped. It also seems to show a small trail or maybe a puff of gas venting  ?  Anyway, as we continued watching they all just moved off very slowly in different directions until they were out of sight. I'd say the total duration of the sighting was approx 10-15 mins.  Unfortunately after later finishing off the roll of film i mislaid it and it didnt turn up again until a few weeks ago, which is why this report is so overdue.  Best Regards",2005-05-24T00:00:00,,

As we were enjoying the sounds of the waves and looking up to the stars on a very clear evening we were startled by an immense triangle shaped craft moving in our direction off of the ocean moving east to west at a moderate speed. The flat platform type craft moved directly over our heads and we stood in complete amazement.  There was absolutely no sound coming from above and a pin point light was at the tips of each corner. The size of the Dark craft blocked out the stars on a very large scale.   The craft seemed very large but as we were watching we couldn't determine how high off the ground it was.  We watched the mysterious craft continue on over the small city and disapear in the distance.   We discussed our experience and due to the fact that we were one hour south of Dover Air Force Base and in the middle of a war we reluctantly decided that it was some sort of very large experimental aircraft.  We researched what we saw to some extent and have never been able to get the image out of our minds.   Then this evening while watching the special put forth by ABC news we realized that so many others have seen this same unexplainable craft across the country.

I thought at the time, it was the lights from a radio tower but I never remembered seeing one there before. (I drove by this area for many years.)

Unfortunately the traffic was too heavy for me to turn around to check it out more thoroughly.  The next day, I drove by the area and there was no radio tower...so I realized that this must have been an ufo sighting. The fact that it was low to the ground, the light was white and rather bright at the bottom of the ship caught my attention.   Also, it was dark above so I couldn't see the top of it, but I believe there were 3 lights coming from the bottom.  I think there may have been a fourth light but it was red, which is why I must have assumed it was a radio tower.

PD)) An erratically moving object was observed during the NASA Channel's live broadcast of the Leonid meteor shower 11/18/2001. I don't remember if I reported this to you before -- I recall posting this information to a web site.  Early on the morning of the 2001 Leonid meteor shower (11/18/2001), about 1:30 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. or so, I had driven to a ridgeline near my home in Lake Arrowhead CA.  I watched the meteor storm, saw several hundred meteors and a great number of fireballs (some of which buzzed with audible radio waves).  I drove back home and turned on the NASA Channel's live coverage.  Thinking that my kids, who were at my ex-wife's house, might not have gone out to watch the meteor shower, I plugged a videotape in to my VCR and taped the coverage.  At this point I was more hoping that the droning voices would put me to sleep, but I was also enjoying what was an incredible light show.  At about 4:00 or 4:30 a.m., I was still watching the coverage.  I believe the feed was from Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona, but I'm not certain of that.  As I watched the coverage, a dot of light moved slowly across the screen.  I remember thinking, ""Oh cool, they've got a satellite on there!"" and it looked very much like a satellite -- a dot of light moving very steadily in one direction.  The ""dot of light moving in one direction"" then veered at a sharp angle and began moving away, then changed course again.  I must've had the dumbest look on my face.  My jaw dropped, and I said, ""Son of a bitch -- that's a UFO!""  I kept watching as it moved away from the field of view of the televised telescope.  Now, the shot was stationary.  I assume the telescope tracked very slowly to keep the radiant of the shower centered, but the camera/telescope wasn't moving -- it was this object that was moving.  No satellite can make changes in direction that acutely, nor can any aircraft.  As I mentioned, it gave the apearance of a distant satellite, but its movement was definitely atypical.  My videotape, BTW, burned when my home was lost in the October 29, 2003 Old Fire in the San Bernardino Mountains.  I wish I still had it, for on it was incontrovertible proof to me that something odd was in the skies that morning.  I don't know if anyone else has videotapes of that broadcast, but if they are available, I'd sure love to have a replacement copy!  I have to say I've always been a skeptic.  I felt that way about religion, too -- if I saw a burning bush or if God booked a showing on Larry King Live, then I'd be convinced.

At the time I noticed this object it became quiet any eerie.  All I heard was the wind.  The object never made a noise.  It flew on for about 2 minutes almost seeming to go up, not out in distance.  Then it sparatically went into a zigzag pattern while flying in a circle at the same rate of speed.  The object never blinked once through the whole encounter.

I,only me, then heard a voice say ' your friend makes us uneasy''. I asked him if he heard it , he said no, then i heard rustling in the field. the voice repeated. then i became sick and threw up instantly. after releiving my stomach of its contents, i turned around and realized i was about 100 yards from his car. from what i remember i only took at the most 5 steps from the car. How did i get so far away from the car? i cant even comprehend how i got that far away. At this point i knew any further contact was not going to happen because of the presence of my friend. i went home and tried to draw the object, it took several tries, until one made me sick to my stomach and throw up again. i still cannot look at the drawing or anything similiar without getting sick. since electronic devices i have seem to be malfunctioning all the time, one in mind, thats very annoying , my smoke detector, yes i checked the battery, replaced, checked again, but still it goes off with sets of beeps primarily 3 sets of 3 beeps , then 2 sets of 3 and 1 of 2. My tv changes channel by itself ,volume as well. i have talked to a neighbor i hadnt met and he said his tv was actually moving physically, by itself. he said he had marked it and tested it several times,and it still moves. his smoke alarm goes off now too. I can feel when the ship is close , its here every night, just off to the west every evening and night moves , flickers its lights and then disappears instantly. when i saw it the second time from a distance i felt a little sick, but not as bad, i then asked it aloud ""please blink twice, for me, just to prove im not crazy or paranoid. i got what i asked for and seemed to engage in a conversation with someone not there.   i have advice for all,  MONITOR YOUR SURROUNDIGS,AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, KEEP AN OPEN MIND. until recent month i have not noticed anything but once you notice, you notice alot of wierd shit happening, everywhere, at all times,.

It would not be exagerrating to estimate at least 400 feet in length. One light at the front, one at the back. No pulsing, no flashing.

As a soldier in the bush wears camouflage and greasepaint to blend in with the jungle... that's what it made me think of. I've seen quite a few UFO's and such in my life, but this was without a doubt one of the most indisputable sightings I've ever had.  No question that it was up there.

We stayed out there about another hour and saw no more activity...it was getting close to 3am and I wanted to go home and go to sleep. I have been researching and studying Irridium Flares for two weeks, what we saw was not an irridium flare. Sattelites move. These things flashed in the same exact spot. These could not have been airplanes, helicopters, balloons, meteors or shooting stars. I have been looking on the internet for anyone who have reported seeing anything like this and all I can find about similar events is on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena sights. I can not call these UFOs because although they were unidentified but not flying or necessarily objects. I will add here that this is not the first time we saw this phenomena at Palmer Lake...on July 6th close to 2am we saw the same type of phenomena also from the Palmer Lake area.

Instead of continuing through the city to our home, he turned back and headed towards the lights, which made our journey home through the country roads.  What we saw were about 8 and sometimes more very large round lights following the south side of Mine Rd. As we drove beside and watched them, trying to figure out what they were, we began to notice that some would suddenly go dark while another would light up nearby. They all stayed fairly close together and they continued their path directly beside us.  We turned left on Landsdowne Rd and they also turned with us. Landsdowne Rd is several miles long, so we drove slow and observed.They stayed beside us. We had no preconceptions about UFO's, therefore we did not feel any threat from this, just curiosity.  Suddenly a helicopter appeared in the sky on the north side of the road. When we heard the helicopter's engine and saw the small light in comparison, we realized that the lights that we had been following (or following us) made absolutly no sound.  When we turned right on the next road my husband decided to keep past our development and go as far as the small airport to see if that was their destination. They continued beside us and on past the airport. This seemed to be a never ending journey and we were beginning to feel a little strange about it so we turned around back to our house, which was just a few blocks off the main road. We could still see them behind us and they seemed to be hovering.  Once home, my son went to get his friend to tell him about this. They climbed on the garage to see if they could see them. The lights or whatever it was had crossed the road into a large unpopulated area next to our development. My son and his friend watched them hover in that area until they got tired and came in. Of course I had no fear then about abduction, etc. because I wasn't aware of such things. Today, I would not have taken it so lightly. The next day someone called into our local radio station and was talking about the lights and how none of the local military bases had anything like this in the air. I then knew that more people than my family had witnessed this. It was a very dark night so we couldn't determine if the lights were attached to one large craft or each was a seperate craft.

I then noticed in the SW direction that a fairly bright and large '1/4 moon' was visible, but was kind of 'odd-looking' in that it was featureless and had a bright orange-red 'glow' in a very overcast sky with no stars visible at all that night.   It just didn't look right at all;   so I pulled my car off the road along the road's shoulder to look at the object further.  We even got out of the car and crossed the road near a field to look at it further.  Then all of a sudden, the '1/4 moon' began to rotate itself slowly so that its flat part was then completely aligned up with the horizon.   The object then started to move slowly across the sky from the SW to SE, and in complete silence.    At this point my wife and I truly began to feel scared and at risk and decided that we ought to return to our car.  Furthermore we agreed that if it looked like the object was about to head in our direction, that we would quickly get out of there and make a run for it!!!   However, the object completely stopped in the sky and then began to retreat from us, faster, and faster and faster, until it reduced its size to a pinpoint of light and then eventually disappeared.    I contacted the local police, the state police, and the local airport to report the incident but they had no corroborating evidence.  Finally I contacted Mr. Hyneck (who was the Air Force Blue Book director at that time) who gave us forms to fill out and mail in to him.   My wife and I indepedently filled out the forms and then compared our observations.  We both,  as common eye-witnesses of this same event, described the event independently and found that our descriptions, regarding the facts and details,  were also in perfect agreement with each other.  Interestingly enough, a check on the position of the moon on the next night showed that the moon was located in the NW,  NOT in the original SW location of the object when first observed.  And this time also the moon looked its normal self.  We never again ever saw such a sighting as the above.  In the past, as a Ph.D. scientist, I had always treated news on UFO sightings as mere illusions, mistakened observations, overly eager people, or plain hysteria, or combination of all of the above.   After this eye-witness sighting above, seen together with my wife right by my side (which also remains fresh in our memories after all of these years),  I am now NOT so skeptical or cynical about ufos's;  and also have no logical explanation whatsoever regarding the event .....  other then that it occurred exactly as related above.

The bad thing was I could have woke my parents but I was to amazed by what I saw that I regret them not seeing and believing it. I would take a polygraph even to prove my truth.

On this night, around midnight or perhaps 1 a.m., they were coming home from a bingo game or similar small-town event, when they saw a large, brightly lit and low-flying rectangular object near a major thoroughfare, Kinderkamack Road.  It was so large and well defined that they first thought it was a billboard, and they remarked something like: ""Gee, why would the town put up a big billboard like that?""  Then they noticed that it was moving slowly and silently over the town. It just moved away, over some treetops, and that was the end of the encounter. They never reported it to law enforcement, and they never heard of anyone else in town seeing this object.  My name is ((name deleted)). My email address is ((e-address deleted)).

Stationary, solid matter.  Did not hover. May or June 1980 (Five Witnesses) Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  Location: N. Portland Avenue, Oklahoma City between 8:00 and 8:30 P.M.  We observed two bright objects, parallel to each other some distance away.  The objects were extremely bright and circular in shape.  At first, it didn't seem to be that unusual, because they were aligned with a transmitting signal tower (radio, television or cable station), the objects blended symmetrically with the tower, that is, until one of the objects shirfted its position.  The circular objects were still positioned on either side of the tower, except one of the objects was higher than the other.  Before the sudden movement, I had been ready to head back inside the building, but this definitely caught my attention.  Suddenly, the object on the left side of the signal tower moved diagonally up and out of sight, and the object on the right side re-appeared directly over our heads.  The movements were made simultaneously.  The craft over my head was approximatedly 15, possibly 20 feet directly above where I was standing.  If I had had a fire engine ladder I could have touched this thing.  For some reason, I was not scared, I just stood there looking up, saying - ""That's a 'blanking' UFO."" I must have said it five or six times, with no real excitement in my voice.  I stayed very calmed.  The craft remained there for about twenty, or thirty seconds.  I remember turning my head slowly, from left to right while looking straight up (head tilted completely back) to see the full scope of this craft.  When I regained my senses, I realized I was standing out there alone.  The other four witnesses had scattered, obviously frightened.  I don't remember how or when, but I must have gone back into the building to retrieve my purse and keys, because all I can remember next, is driving home.  While driving, I could see military jes flying in formation, two or three at a time, darting across the sky in all directions.  There was a lot of activity in the skies that night.  I had had the car radio on and the DJ was talking about sightings in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and several other states.  It could have been Arizona instead of Kansas, I just can't remember.  This only reinforced my sense of reality.  Anyway, the next day the radio person announced that the military, or some official agency had issued a statement saying the sightings were merely weather balloons.  When I was asked a few days later to describe what I saw, all I could say was it appeared to change shape depending on its angle of observation.  It wasn't circular as it originally appeared in the sky, or triangular.  It was more...uniquely shaped.  What I assumed to be the front was hexangular in shape, and the angles appeared longer toward the rear, and more so on its right side, forming a rectangle toward the back right.  This object had some unique dimenional geometry.  I remember thinking later that it had extraordinary aerodynamics.  I only saw the bottom and not the top or sides.  Although, I do recall a picture of the craft on the Phil Donahue show that would have aired sometime in '88 or'89.  Someone, I think in Texas had taken the picture of the craft at a higher altitude.  I only caught a few moments of the show on my way out the door.  This object did not hover. Hover to me, means slight movement while trying to maintain the exact location and altitude.  This object was stationary, solid matter, a solid mass suspended by some unknowned energy.  It defied gravity.  I do not recall any radiating heat, or hearing any sound.  And, because I could visually see the entire craft, I would guessimate the craft to be 1200 to 1500 sq. ft. in circumference with some type of grid outline on the bottom.  I think I saw lights within the grid, but I'm not certain.  It didn't appear to be shiny or brightly lit, while suspended above my head.  I seem to recall it was grayish-silver color.  What I cannot explain is the speed of this craft.  It's like it manipulated, folded or enveloped the air space in dimensions I haven't... Yeah! I can't explain it.  Its departure was fractionally subliminal and left no residual effects.  It was beyond my level of intelligence, nothing I could wrap my mind around.  This sighting as it unfolded would have had Einstein either scratching his head or beaming with delight.  Either way, I'm no Einstein or Newton.  It definitely wasn't a figment of my imagination.  I am not saying I saw an alien spacecraft from some other galaxy.  I'm simply describing an Unidentified Flying Object.  However, if we do have his type of technology here on this planet, then someone or some organization has developed a way to manipulate gravity and the speed of light.  Moreover, there must be a higher degree of mathematics, way beyond calculus and trigonometry that a secret select group of scientists haven't shared with the little minds of planet earth, because this definitely defies general physics and gravity, as we know it.  It is a form of energy that is mind-boggling.  To this day I believe I had a visual close encounter of some kind.  I have never wavered in what I saw that day.  Trying to explain the encounter is extrememly difficut, or next to impossible due to lack of knowledge and things beyond my comprehension.  I cannot remember who said this, but they captured my frustration in a nutshell:  ""For those who understand, no explanation is necessary.  For those who do not understand, no explanation is possible.: ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD))",2005-04-16T00:00:00,35.47186177914111,-97.52630349693251

I thought I had just seen a plane blow up and pointed this out to my three friends. We saw one of the three lights continue towards Charlotte while another turned north and the third light turned in our direction and seemed to hang in the sky. We assumed the light was at airliner altitude, but when I went out to the car to get some binoculars, I saw that the light moved against the backdrop of stars when I moved. This indicated that the light was much lower than we thought, perhaps only two hundred feet. The light drifted slowly over town and we followed it in a car, easily able to keep up. At one time, we saw a series of fire balls shooting out of the bottom like a Roman candle. This scared us, but nothing happened. The light drifted out of town.

Went outside to take out the trash at 2:00 AM.  It was a clear night sky with a bright moon.  I scanned the sky for several minutes as I always do, ever since my wife and I witnessed a sighting on November 18, 2001.  I spent about 5 minutes scanning the sky an then, out of the corner of my eye I noticed a formation of objects with a dim/amber/reddish ""glow"" float across the sky silently in a ""boomerang"" shaped formation.  The formation was heading North West.  Visible for aproximately 15 seconds before going out my line of sight.  As I continued to scan the sky - there were several ""formations"" of amber glowing objects floating across the sky. One formation after the other.  Some in perfect V shaped formation, other formations of various sizes.  At one point you could go so far as to describe it as ""fleets"" of formations....  I ran inside my house to alert my wife.  It took about 30 seconds for me to get her off the computer, and run outside to the front of our house and when we looked up in the sky more formations were floating across the sky.  Literally dozens of ambering glowing formations in several minutes.  We stayed outside for 30 more minutes but did not see any more objects in the sky, so my wife went back inside I continued to scan the skys, but also went back inside after a few more minutes of non-activity.  At 4:00 AM I had an urge to go check outside again, and within 20 seconds of viewing the night sky from my porch a giant Formation in perfect V shape formation floated beneath the moonlight sky.  I observed this for 15 seconds before the formation blended into the night sky.  I told my wife, and I went back outside.  In the next 15 minutes I saw 2 more formations float by.  At 4:15 AM my 21 year old son and his friend came outside to see what I was doing. I greeted them in the front yard, and told them I was scanning the sky for ""formations"".  Our son had witnessed these objects with my wife, and I back in February of 2005. And within minutes 1 smaller formation of objects floated across the sky, as witnessed by my self, my son, and his friend. His friend was completely in awe of what he caught a glimpse of.  We scanned the sky for a few minutes before going back inside at 4:30 AM.  At 5:00AM I checked again from my balcony and observed another V Shaped/Boomerang Shaped Amber glowing formation of objects float across the sky.  These Formations/Boomerang Objects have been witnessed several times before since November 18, 2001.  One of the reasons I was scanning the Sky tonight was because I had a feeling the sighting my wife and I had in November of 2001 would repeat...and it looks like it did, albeit not as intense as it was on November 18, 2001 .... but still a pretty good show by whatever those boomerang/formations are...",2005-12-16T00:00:00,37.40497461486939,-122.15793884795713

When we got closer the lights now formed a perfect rectangle; each light was .5 to 1.5 miles away from the other.  After ""hovering"" for about 1 minute, 2 of the lights slowly began moving out of the formation and the other two dissappeard.  These WERE NOT helicopters!  There was absolutely NO sound coming from them.  We traveled down the road another mile where we parked near my home in a large open parking lot.  At this time the sky became flooded with extremly low and slow flying as well as high altitude jets which seemed unusually quiet.  All of the jets seemed to be 737's and 767's and all had identical lights that I didnt recognize as commercial.  These jets were unusually quiet, had no window lights, and had dark colored paint schemes.  I believe the jets I saw were the aircraft in the following links http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/e-767.htm http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/e-737.htm  After about 10 minutes of watching these low and high flying jets, the strange objects returned.  Flying at about 1500 feet and making absolutely no sound, these craft seemed to move against all aerodynamic principles slowing down almost to a stop then suddenly speeding up extremely fast and reaching very high altitudes very quickly.  They had green red and white lights which pulsed in a bizarre sequence unlike any aircraft I've ever seen. After watching one of these craft for 2-3 minutes it dissappeared. My friend and I were looking in the direction that it disappeard when I looked away for a second and he screamed out "" did you see that!"" He had seen a white ball of light streak across the sky (half the distance horizon to horizon) in the blink of an eye. 5 minutes later, one of the low flying ""dark"" jets was flying overhead when my friend and I saw one of the ""hovering"" craft with odd sequential lights about 1 mile away over a nearby golf course. I immediately looked to the ""dark"" jet that just flew overhead and it banked suddenly very hard right and accelerated towards the ""hovering"" craft we had just seen. After this the skies emptied and after about 20 minutes and there were absolutely NO airplanes in the skies overhead. We stayed outside for another hour staring at the sky when I saw what my friend had seen earlier. A small egg shaped light streaked halfway across the horizon at rediculous speed. The one I saw was horizontal and the one my friend saw shot upwards diagonally. I've seen shooting stars many times and I assure these were not. WHat really solidified my sighting for me as being at least ""unusual"" was that no more than 5 minutes after I saw the light flash, a military helicopter flew overhead at maybe 800 feet with the brightest search light on it that I've ever seen.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,40.92160305676856,-73.78318689956332

As I looked out of the car windshield I got a mental shock as I thought a aircraft-crash is going to happen. It ""looked like"" in the first moment like a fighter plane with triangular solid shape (no distinctive wings) in a sort of stealthy transparent grey, flying straight down (totally vertical) from maybe one mile above ground (when I started to see it). I thought it will fly straight into the ground, at extremely high speed. I guess a speed of at least 1000-2000 mph.  I was in shock at this point and made a significant ""sigh"" that my female friend said: ""WHAT???!"". I  couldn't answer; my thought was: ""it's going to crash!""... But in that moment, maybe 600 feet above ground, it made a very sharp right-angular turn away from us, into a horizontal flight pattern, climbing up in an approximately 30 degree angle. But ""the object"" disappeared SUDDENLY after about one second into ""nothing"". No trail, nothing.  Due to being in the car I can not say if there was a sound; I heared no sound.  Observation: No conventional technology aircraft could have made a sort of 90 degree turn at THAT speed. The G-force of that turn would have been incredible (impossible to a human pilot) by earthly standards. The sudden disappearance was not just a fast fading out of sight, it was a SUDDEN;  disappearance.  I have a private pilot's licence. I am a graduated technical engineer. What I saw would be impossible to perform with conventional aircraft technology. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My mother, son and I were traveling Southbound on I-5 on our way to pick up my brother to go fishing. I was driving and felt a very strong vibration traveling up my arms from holding the steering wheel. This vibration was so strong that I could feel it in my chest as well. There was no sound.  We were passing Boeings, which is a small, private airport for private and smaller commercial planes. I leaned forward to look up through the windsheild (I was driving an Oldsmomile that had a deep, slanted windshield and it was necessary to lean forward to view the sky).  I witnessed a large (about 1/2 the size of a football field) saucer shaped UFO. I remember it being a pewter color,a dull silver, rather than the shiny description I have since read about. There were ""running lights"" flashing on the underside of the craft - much like the ""chasing lights"" now available for Christmas Tree lights. I remember them being blue in color. The UFO was a little higher than the freeway street lights (VERY close) and almost directly above our vehichle.  I remember yelling out in shock and excitement, ""Mom, it's a UFO...Oh My God, it's a UFO!"". I remember making the decision to pull over to the shoulder of the road. As I navigated over, I remember seeing 6 - 7 other cars parked on the shoulder of the opposite side of the freeway - they would be heading Northbound. I do not recall seeing anyone in or near-by their vehichles. I do not remember seeing any cars on either the freeway or on the shoulder of our side of the freeway - Southbound.  This memory was lost for 3 years!  One day, I was doing a mindless task - dusting furniture - and recalled the sighting. It was in Technocolor and VERY clear...only 3 years later! I called my mother, who was living in Alaska and asked ""When we were going to pick up my brother to go fishing 3 years previous...what did we see?"" Her answer was instantanious, ""A UFO."" I asked if she'd recalled this or had told anyone about it previous to my call. Her answer was ""No.""  Neither my mother nor I are the type of people to keep this memory a secret. we would have told close friends and family members. We didn't. We couldn't! We had had our memories blocked somehow.  When I recalled the sighting, my memorie goes from seeing the UFO to being in a rented rowboat at in Point Defiance Sound (located in Tacoma, Washington), our fishing destination. We were caught in a rip-tide and I recall all 4 of us having to lay flat in the boat to avoid being tossed into the sound by the extreme bobbing of the boat encountered in this rip-tide.  After my mother and I discussed this incident, I called my brother and asked him if he could remember if my mother, son and myself were late in arriving for our fishing date. He couldn't recall, as it had been 3 full years after this trip.  Neither my mother nor I recall seeing anything other than the UFO. I am filing this report in the hope that one of passengers of the other 6-7 cars may have a clearer memory of the encounter and wish to report this for the record.

I was just taking a walk during my lunch hour, it was past 12:30 and I just happened to look up, and there it was. I t was so high up in the sky, and I could barely discern the shape. With the naked eye, it seemed like the head of a pin was floating in space,it seemd to be either circular or comma shaped, I knew it was really high because two planes just happened to fly almost right next to it, but right away I realized that it was even higher than the planes. from where I was standing,I could see that it was hovering near the northern area of Santa Ana, Ca. near the Mainplace mall. And It was about 5 to 7 degrees north of where the sun was.   This object moved very slowly, probably about 5 mph, in a shoutherly direction. The object was very Bright, but it seemed to shimmer between white and a coppery hue. I finally got back to my Bldg. In downtown Santa Ana. And I stood at our parking lot for another 15 min. until 1 o'clock. So my sighting lasted about half an hour, and during that time it did not move anymore than maybe a couple of miles or so. (realize that this thing was so high,it looked like it barely moved). I came back out around 3 pm but it was gone at that time. The Crazy thing is that the next day (Friday January 6th) I was off and my wife and I happened to drive to North Santa Ana, to the Mainplace Mall.  And as we parked in the rear parking lot on the top of the structure, I was curious and decided to look up, and THERE IT WAS AGAIN!! This happened at Noon too.  This thing whatever it was must have been spying on the Citizens of Orange county for a few afternoons. I did not look at it for long because I went into the mall, by the time I came back out (an hour later) it was gone. I have always believed in UFO's but have never seen one until now, and it really gave me the creeps!

I was reading a magazine and then all of a sudden I hear this loud swish of air outside.  It sounded like a large aircraft flying over with absolutely no engines on.  Then I heard a second sound immediately after the first one.  I thought to myself that something is going to crash.  I remember the TWA 800 crash and I thought that it was going to happen again in my back yard.  However, I looked outside and saw nothing.  I thought maybe the object was on the other side of my house and I will hear it crashing soon, however, there was no crash.  it just swooped by with no sound whatsoever other then the sound of the rushing air around it.  I quickly finished up and went outside and it was the weirdest thing.  It was so quiet.  I have never heard it so quiet before in my life.  Not a single sound.  Absolutely no wind.  No sounds from cars or anything else, just complete peacefulness and a uncomfortable quietness.  I don't know what this was that flew by my house that night.  I thought for sure a large plane would come crashing down but nothing ever happened.  It was the strangest thing I have ever experienced.  I still get goosebums thinking about it.",2006-03-11T00:00:00,40.7128,-73.2962

It was about 75 yards away from me and I would say it was about 50-75 yards above the ground.  I passed by some woods and the thing seemed to travel right over the tree tops and it traveled just as freely as I passed some fields.  It appeared to be lighted from within.  There were no visible external lights and it was slightly larger than a basketball in size when held at an arm's length.  I've seen these spheres before, first time being in 1991 on my way home from work in the middle of the night.  Subsequent sightings took place while I lived in Florida and now I've relocated back to upstate NY (my latest sighting).  After a few minutes, this sphere came close to my car as I drove and it kept pace with me.  It was as strange a sight just as the previous times. I've made a few reports to this site before and I know that there really is something out there.

I live in San Pedro, CA around 3rd and Gaffey up from the harbor. Last night I was standing on my back porch which faces in a westerly direction. I was making a crude star chart to research and i.d. some of the constellations I could see. It was a beautiful, clear night with a few small clouds and a nice crescent moon. I was fairly intent on the sky trying to make sure I got the major stars in their proper position. The time is approximately 8:30 PM. As I’m looking up I see off to my right 2 glowing orbs moving directly together at what had to be a high rate of speed. They were moving in a very straight line in a generally south west direction side by side, closely together. Their path from horizon to horizon took maybe 4 to 5 seconds and then they, for a lack of better words, disappeared. The objects appeared to be glowing and were orange in color. If I had to guess at their size from my viewpoint, I’d say about the size of dimes, maybe more oval than perfectly round. I have an amateurs interest in astronomy and have done lots of star gazing over the years. I’ve seen meteor showers, comets, missile launches, etc. This was like none of those. After they passed, I was a little shaken, not quite sure what I had just seen. I walked back in and called a friend. I had to share this with someone! After I got off the phone I walked back out and was staring to the skies, a little stunned. After about 5 minutes (approx. 8:45) to my amazement I see another group of those glowing lights, this one containing a fairly tight cluster of maybe 5. These were higher and looked a lot smaller. These were moving  in a more westerly direction and their passage lasted maybe 3 seconds. These appeared to be flying higher or further away, so I couldn’t comment on shape, but they definitely had that same orange glow. I go back in call my friend again. I come back out and continue to stare at the skies in amazement. I guess about 10-15 minutes later, (around 9:00) I see one more cluster, maybe 6 or 7 of this time, moving at about the same position and direction as the second cluster. I continued to scan the sky for maybe 20 minutes more, but didn’t see anything else after that. I went in and made some notes and drew a picture of what I saw on the “star chart” I was making. I’ve been checking the news and the internet, hoping to find something that would explain this sighting, but haven’t seen anything other than similar sightings from different times in the past. I called the local police station to see if possibly there were other reports or info. they might have. They directed me to call NASA, which I haven’t done but may. I was really hoping there would be a logical explanation for this incident, but haven’t found it yet. Any help, comments or collaboration anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.

I was at the local track just before midnight with my dogs. just us, and was looking up at the stars when the movement of an object almost directly overhead caught my eye. The best way to describe this object was sort of like a boomerang or crescent moon shape, uneven on 1 side, dark to light brown in color.  A few words came directly to mind, ""Bird"", as in hawk or eagle, or pterodactyl. ""Wing"" ""Boomerang"" ""Kite"" ""Stealth"", and ""aircraft"". And an adjective that came to mind was ""gliding"".  I said softly, outloud ""What the heck is that"". I put my hands up around my eyes to block out the lights along the horizon and at ground level. It moved straight and swiftly towards the north at a constant speed. When I thought ""bird"", the thought came that there was no flapping and I've seen birds soar or glide and this was much more direct and constant more like an aircraft.  When I thought ""stealth"" or ""aircraft"", I subconsciously made a note that it had no lights and there was no sound, and noted the uneven 1 side. I even had a subconscious thought that it looked sort of prehistoric, yet was modern, as if it were a remote control aircraft built to look ""prehistoric"".  I was uncertain what I was seeing but certain I was seeing it. The lights around the high school are particularly bright, with numerous streets with street lights and houses just to the north as well. The sky directly overhead however was particularly clear and black, and the stars more visible than common. Although I saw it somewhat well, it was much more the movement that made me see it to start with, and follow it, otherwise it sort of blended in with the night sky.  It seemed to be moving at a constant height or altitude and faded into the sky within about 15 seconds as towards the north over town the sky wasn't as dark.  I clapped my hands at 1 point to see if it perhaps it were a bird and if I could get any reaction from it.  I could not really estimate how high overhead except to say when I thought of it as a bird, it seemed to be maybe 100 to 200 feet overhead. When I thought of it as an aircraft it seemed to be like a low flying plane, maybe 1,000 feet or so overhead. But again it seemed way to big to be a bird, perhaps the reason the thought ""pterodactyl"" or prehistoric came to mind.  I made note of the constellations overhead, it seemed to have moved between or through the constellations Leo and the big Dipper, right to left as I faced East. It was cold out. I estimated the time to be around 11:43 p.m. I looked up for a few minutes afterwards without stopping but saw nothing more. I then was looking up for much of the remainder of our time at the track.  I will make a few drawings of the object.  Misc. An example of the way it blended into the sky, in the movie ""Close Encounters"", when richard dryfuss's character is in the power company truck at the railroad crossing, as he sees the lights,and then it becomes silent, and he looks up directly overhead out his front windshield and you see the object moving in the sky, it reminded me of that somewhat, although this was moving faster and more steadily.  Another thought came to mind, the government tested the stealth aircraft in this region back in the '80s, and for a few years people in this region, particularly a county maybe 30 miles away, were reporting sightings of a ufo in the shape of a bat. It was later learned this was the stealth aircraft.  There is a rural county airport, Mercer County airport"", directly to the north in the direction this object was moving, maybe 6 or 7 miles as the crow flies from this location. This is not a south to north flight path for low flying aircraft for this airport. Aircraft approach the airport from the east.  I have never seen anything like such,, or something that I haven't been able to explain before.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,37.2942,-81.1832

My husband and I were traveling north on Morris Bridge Road entering Hillsborough County from Pasco County.  When I noticed in the west sky a bright Orange/Pink lighted cigar shaped object, which was also traveling southbound towards Tampa.   Since this was after 9/11, my first thought was that it was a missle of some type headed for MacDill or the city.  My husband (a former Marine weather observer), told me to stop the vehicle.   We sat in the vehicle for several minutes watching. The object stopped abruptly just north of Tampa, then changed from a horizonal position to a verticle position and it began to move away to the west so fast we could not begin to appoximate the speed.   My husband said that he had never seen anything like it and due to the fact that he was a former weather observer for the military and worked at several air towers making weather observations for the military, I really think that if it had been a plane, jet, other type of military aircraft, or weather instrument; he would have known what this object was.

Smith chevron sighting. This is a follow-up to my recent post here regarding the specific chevron-shaped object.  I have since done some research that would dispel two of my theories.   I contacted a retired B-58 crew member who confirmed that the leading edge of the wing did not glow when supersonic.  I have also researched the possiblity of the XB-70.  The Final Report on the the XB-70 program published in 1972 lists every flight of each of the giant delta wing aircraft.  A/V-2 had already crashed by the time of this sighting. A/V-1 was flying.  I have been unable to determine if the XB-70 did any night flying, or flying significantly away from Edwards AFB, CA.  From reading the chief test pilot's summary, I would highly doubt that this aircraft did either.  It was a very complex aircraft, often having malfunctions requiring unique support.  To intentionally stray from its support base would be doubtful.  Also, it was a very crudely equipped and instrumented aircraft in its experimental form.  Its single TACAN worked poorly, requiring the crew to rely heavily on FAA ATC for help with navigation.  There is one long-shot date of possibility. The aircraft flew on 8/24/67 for over two hours, reached over Mach 2, and an altitude of 58,000 feet.  If the actual sighting that I witnessed occured on this date, it would be an interesting coincidence. So, I believe that leaves this sighting on mysterious footing.  Other possible aircraft of the day are the CIA A-12 Blackbird and its followers, the YF-12 and SR-71. That will take more research and will probably be more difficult to find records in the public domain.

We were drving up hill and the winding road caused us to lose site for a couple different moments, but it became visable again each time our vision cleared.   We could not see the school, but we could see how the night sky was slightly illuminated by the presence of the school and associated ground lights.  It appeared that the hovering object was observing the location.  The object appeared circular in shape (not round, but more disk shape).  There were slowly rotating lights that I beleive to have been yellow and green in color.    After having watched this object and having seen it for a sustained period of time, and from different angles, there was no doubt that we were seeing an actual object and not any type of projected light or reflection, etc... As peculiar and interesting as the sighting had been, what followed was most remarkable...   I would suspect our distance from the scene to have been about perhaps a quarter of a mile, at the time.  We noticed that the object began to move slowly away from the ground illumination, and then, in a instant the object from an almost dead stop accelerated to an incredible speed that took it away from our vision in a fraction of a second.  It didn't just disappear, it disapppeared as a result of distance covered from our location.  We saw it go truly out of sight.  It left no light trail of any type whatsoever. What we saw was clearly visible and clearly trackable.  It was a clear night and we had even discussed the event as it was taking place.  Our view was excellent for the sighting.  It truly looked like it was observing the mountain top scene, and simply left when it was done.  It's possible we spooked it off as we progressively drew closer to the locale with our car lights pointing in its general direction. The event is etched in my mind and always will be.
