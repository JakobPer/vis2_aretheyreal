Many people were gathered at the corner of Wayne and Van Born rd.  The community is well populated.  I was at my upstairs bedroom.  My brother and I saw an oval shaped object in the sky.  It might have been 200 ft above the light poles. It was light gray in color with a red light about a 45-degree angle from the craft. The craft was spinning but in the same place.  No sounds were heard.  It hovered over this hamburger stand for at least 50 minutes.   During that time it shined a bright light from the front of the craft down towards the people below.  It stayed on about a minute or two.  About six times the craft would fly very fast off towards the west.   All you could see in the distance would be the red light disappearing.  As soon as you turned away to talk to someone, it would fly right back.  Each time it went out toward the far distance it would come back just as fast as it left.  It continued to hover over the stand for about 5-10 min each.  Then it would fly very far out, and come back again and hover.   After about an hour of this back and forth, it finally went away.

She started freaking out and said what is that over there. I looked over and saw three huge and bright lights that lit up one after the other and were all horizontal and next to each other. They were not your normal lights and the object was definitely in the shape of a saucer. The lights were very bright and very large however they were not blinding to the eye.  The moon was full and it was very bright so you could see the object very clear. The lights disappeared and then reappeared about .25 mile to the right. I would estimate that this object was a half a mile in the air and about 1-2 miles away from us. After it lit up two times it jus disappeared. There was no streak or anything as it went away. It simply vanished. There was also no noise. This happened in a very rural area and was definitely not anything military. I think the object was about 100 yards or larger across. This was definitely a UFO and nothing else. I am positive. My girlfriend is a non believer in UFOs and is now a believer. She was so nervous and scared that she started puking on the side of the road. I am still blown away with what we saw and hope someone else spotted this the same night and will place a report.

I was in the garden with my partner having a cigarette.  I was facing the East anf my partner was facing the West.  She asked me what some objects were that were behind me.  When I looked I could not believe what I was looking at as there were six global, orange, almost firey coloured globes drifting silently from the North, headed South, towards the English channel. I tried to obtain some footage using my mobile phone which does identify 2 of the globes but they are very distant, in the footage.  To the naked eye they were probably about a mile away and very easy to see.  They were in a random formation although one seemed to be the leader.  They were travelling slowly and quite simply disappeared one by one.  I went upstairs to see them more clearly by which time 5 had disappeared but one continued over the channel and then equally disappeared. The visibilty was good although there was reasonably low cloud in the area.  My step daughter witnessed the sighting independently from her bedroom.  There was a power cut in our street only, at the time. I reported the sighting to the Police and they in turn asked the Ministry of Defence to contact me.  I was given a number and left a message. For fear of sounding like a lunatic I have not reveled my name to anyone other than the MOD and police but I made an enquiry with the local newspaper and they told me that no one else reported these globes and the police said the same.  I find this odd as they were very visible in the sky. As yet I have not been contacted by the MOD which makes feel like a fool as all 3 of us saw them and nobody else seems to have.

At 21:20 I was on the back deck of our house calling the dogs in.  I watched an object move from the SSW sky to NNE.  It was clear night with no clouds. It took approximately 5 to 6 seconds to entirely cross the sky.  It was silent.  It was shaped like a short grain of rice.  It was the color of light pink beach glass softly glowing from within, and with a slight aura of white around it.  If I held my hand at arm’s length with a short grain of rice, this is about how large it appeared. I called for my husband to come, but it had already disappeared behind the trees.  3 to 4 minutes after observing the object, a commercial airliner crossed the sky from SW to NW on an approach path to Seatac Airport.  I am reporting this with the hopes that perhaps the commercial airliner saw something, or traffic control at Seatac. My husband is a fixed wing and helicopter Pilot.  I grew up around Seatac airport and McChord Air Force base.  I am very familiar with the appearance and flight patterns of conventional aircraft.  I also grew up watching for satellites and am familiar with satellite flight paths across the sky. This pink, slightly oblong object was very unique; like glowing pink glass. It needs be said that in my life I have seen alleged UFOs.  As a 10-year old (1966) my entire family (7 of us) watched an object above the desert in Utah.  It was composed of two large metallic objects with 7 small metallic objects in between the two larger ones.  We all watched it for over 20 minutes. While camping at Mt. Rainier in 1984 I and my children (7 and 4 at the time) watched as a blinking object flew a path ascending toward the mountain before suddenly streaking out of sight. Here in Shelton, I have experienced several occasions of a very bright flash in the night sky.  Sometimes it is one bright flash.  Sometimes it is a series of erratically timed bright flashes.  The flashes are always in one stationary spot in the sky and are not accompanied by any visual trajectory common to a helicopter or aircraft turning or flying; just very bright white flashes, and then nothing. This last Sunday, December 7th, 2008 at 16:43 I observed a very bright white light sitting stationary in the SSW sky above the tree line.  At first I thought it was the first star of the night, however, no other stars were visible and this light was brighter than any star or planet I am accustomed to observing.  I am also aware of metal objects commonly reflecting sunlight at that time of the day in the SW and W sky.  This bright light sat stationary for 10 minutes.  I had my husband get his detachable rifle scope with a high power telephoto capacity.  I propped it on the back of a chair and we watched the bright light.  It never changed position.  It suddenly just disappeared as I was viewing it. I hesitated in turning in my reports because I understand that in order to substantiate anything or lend credibility, it is best triangulated or viewed by more than one person at one place in time.  I was also concerned I’d come across like a quack because I have seen objects before.  I support all research and work being done in the field of extraterrestrial existence, however, and believe it is important to move forward and turn in a report when it happens with the hopes maybe someone else saw the same thing. I turned in the flashing light reports to MUFON, but the local investigator for MUFON in Olympia has a very jealous wife who felt uncomfortable with him talking to women (even though I am happily married and have no interest in playing around).  He began taking report my report from me but abruptly stopped telling me his wife was jealous of me.  !!??  That was just a weird extraneous experience but it effected how eager I was to turn in any report to MUFON.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,47.2389,-123.20610000000002

It was brown, and ""cigar-shaped"".  I waited for its angle to change to determine if it was a helicopter (a common sight patrolling the border), but it's shape was too evenly ""cigar shaped"" so I was certain it was not a Blackhawk, and it seemed to lack the vertical stabilizer and wings of fixed-wing aviation, so I stood there and stared at it. It was not at a very high elevation, maybe 1000 feet above the ground (I'm not a trained aerial observer, so I can't gauge elevation at all), and it seemed to be just ""drifting"" over the border, like a dirigible, though it's path was even and consistently south-southwest.

While still in his bathroom he heard a vibrating hum outside, then went back to his bedroom and looked out the window.  He saw within 20 feet of his window an object hovering slightly up and down, holding a position between our house and a wooded area approximately 100 feet away from our house.  The object appeared to him at this close distance to be approximately as wide as his room, about 12 feet wide, and approximately 5 feet in height.  The object was shaped like a flattened football with a dome on top.  My son said if looked down on from above the object would have been shaped like a circle.  The dome appeared to be made of green glass.  The object was colored all black except for a pattern of three sets of square-shaped lights on the side which alternated flashing lights of green, blue, and red.  The object appeared to be disc-shaped, but the left and right edges, from his perspective, had blue lights that glowed continuously and did not flash.  The object hovered there for a few seconds and then moved slowly up and away from our house.  The sky was clear and not raining.  Behind the object was a dark background of dense trees.  My son's window is approximately 15-20 feet above our basement patio, and my son said it appeared to be close enough to be partially over the patio.  The patio extends out from the side of the house approximately 15 feet.  I awoke when I heard my son opening and closing doors in the hall when he was going to the bathroom.  I heard him speaking to his younger brother for a few seconds, and then he came to my bedroom and told my husband and me what he had seen.  It was then that I checked the time and it was about 4:35 a.m.  My son was afraid, but calmly related what he saw.  Later this morning after breakfast I asked him with nonleading questions to describe what he saw and to draw a picture of it.  He described the incident the same as he described it at 4:35 this morning, and the picture he drew matches the description of what he described verbally.

After a few seconds, I realized that I was not seeing an airplane-- at least not one like I have ever seen before.  It looked like a cluster of several very bright lights arranged in a tight formation, scintillating.  I became quite excited and ran inside to get my camera.  When I came out the formation had moved overhead and further along its smooth northwesterly trajectory.  I took video of the object as it passed by and receded.  I videoed for about two minutes.  The cluster is visible in the video, but the details of the formation are too small to be clearly discerned.   The formation was composed of two or three very bright lights along with a few smaller and dimmer lights in-between.

I frequently go outside at night to watch the stars and I noticed this set of lights, which weren't supposed to be there. The lights changed in intensity and changed position as if they were attached to something.  When I first saw them, they were a perfect triangle.  They moved to form an elongated triangle pointing east, then reoriented again. I didn't hear any noises.  What seemed to be the ""center"" light was brighter than the other two.  The center light was brightest when oriented head on, forming almost a straight line, then turned again, becoming a smaller looking triangle. It didn't move quickly enough to be distinct, if that makes any sense.  But they definitely moved quickly enough as to change the arrangement of the lights within 10-15 seconds. I called my girlfriend out to see them, but all we could see was the center light.  Then, they began to move again and the triangle was visible.  I called her back out and she saw it, too.  She said it was creepy. At first, I thought they might be helicopters flying in formation.  There were no other blinking lights, but they did ""twinkle"" like stars, which is what made it seem so strange. I am not an avid ufo enthusiast, but I do like to watch the stars.

I do remember watching something on the Science channel about triangular lights which behaved exactly like these did about a month prior to this event.  I don't think that influenced what I saw, but it definitely made me watch them closer. After about 15 minutes of watching (it was fairly chilly), I came inside to check if there had been any reports.  I didn't really know where to look, though, and I found this site through a google search on how to report sightings. When I went back outside to continue watching, the lights were gone, as far as I could tell.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,61.53757924528302,-149.54210377358493

On January 20, 2009 I took my dog behind my apartment before going to bed.  I had just finished watching a PBS documentary.  We stepped outside at 9:56 p.m.  I put a white bandanna on my dog to see him in the dark.  The dog going out was a nightly ritual.  It was cold out and I was fully awake.  I waited for him to make his rounds and return. To the South I witnessed a reddish-orange light low in the sky.  I assumed it was a helicopter.  It dropped something and sparks of red made their way from the light to the ground.  I thought, ""I hope whatever that is doesn't hit someone's house.""  I then watched it move from south to north towards me.  I was waiting to hear the blades and engine of the helicopter.  I heard nothing.  The red light then proceeded to drop another sparkling type of light down toward the ground.  I was relieved to see it do this again as I was not sure if I could believe my eyes the first time I saw it do this.  The night was cold and there were ice crystals in the air; but this did not look like lighted crystals, it was different.  It looked more like what a meteorite looks like as it falls to earth with a tail coming down.  It did not make sense but I was just observing this taking place so I was not trying to make sense of it all. As it approached me it seemed to be higher in the night sky.  I thought I heard an engine which relieved me as I then thought it had to be a helicopter.  But, this noise was from a train in the area moving south to north.  This light object did not make any observable sound.  My dog was standing at my feet by the patio.  I was worried that whatever was dropping might hit him or me so I stayed by the back door.  I proceeded to put him inside. I then looked up and it started to drop another sparkly charge but this time I did not see the material come all the way down, it stopped almost upon starting to drop down.  Maybe the position above me was wrong for viewing it to the ground?  It then kept moving toward the northeast across the top of my apartment complex and I followed it as it moved.  I rushed inside to get a binocular so that I could see what it actually was.  This took fifteen seconds.  As I came back out I did not see the light anymore in the sky.  I walked north behind the apartment complex with the binoculars but could not relocate it in the sky.  I then went inside.  I watched television for another hour, as I always do until 11:00 p.m. As I thought about this it made no sense.  The light, the sparkly discharge to the ground, the movement from south to northeast.  It was all very nonsensical and hard to understand.  I do not know what I witnessed? It is the first and hopefully last time I will witness something like this.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,38.7314,-94.8282

I kept looking at it trying to figure out what it might be. I live across the street from a Navy helicopter training field, so I am very familiar with their sights and sounds, but it would have been too late for them to be flying anyway. It wasn't a plane- it had no blinking lights and did not move like one. It had fringes of red on the left and right sides and what appeared to be ""moonbeams"" eminating from it. It moved very slowly towards the south. I called my neighbors (to my west) on the phone and asked them to step outside and see if they witness what I was seeing. We stood in their front yard and watched it move away to the south. We watched it for approximately 10 minutes and they went back inside (since the temperature was around 30 degrees). I came back inside my home and thought about what I was seeing. I went back outside and it was still there, but lower in the sky. I went over to my neighbors (to my east), and they stepped outside into the street and also saw it. We watched it for a few minutes, and they went back inside their home. My neighbor (to the east) went online to see if there were any stars that were supposed to be visible, and I told them I would talk to them later to find out. I went back home at this point. At about 730pm, I went back outside to see if the light was still in the sky, but it had disappeared. I walked back over to my neighbors (to the east) to see if she had found out anything on the internet, and as I knocked on their door, I turned towards the SWS, looking over the helicopter training field towards Perdido Bay. I saw three orangish-red pulsating orbs. Two of them were close together, and the third was further to the west. At this point, I noticed that the orbs were fading out slowly, then would reappear in a different spot. They did this independently of each other. My neighbors came to their door and as we stood in their driveway, we all witnessed the orbs fading out then reappearing, moving westerly. They started appearing closer together. One would fade out, and then the other two would fade out. The whole episode lasted approximately two minutes before the orbs disappeared completely. We noticed that air traffic in the area picked up considerably during both episodes- more than usual. There was a distinct difference between the bright light and orbs versus the planes and helicpters that started appearing. My neighbor did say that Scorpius would have been the brightest star in the western sky, but when we came out to look for it, it was no longer there- with no explanation where it disappeared. The bright white light was no star. The three pulsating orbs were not stars. I'm not sure what we all saw last night.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,30.462935377358487,-87.26545408805032

I dont have enough practice on computers to cut and paste reports, therefore I will have to do my best without benefit of spell check, please keep this in mind when reading this reort, for it is both truthfull and verifiable. In the summer of 1975 it came to my attention that my aunt had a resort property just east of Lawrence Livermore Lab in Marsh Creek California. My Aunt who is now deceaced had kept a journal of numerous sightings she and others had exerienced for many years at the resort during the 70's. I had a freind that was in the same jr high class that was very interested in ufo's and when I mentioned an upcomming family event taking place at the resort and the fact that ufo's were sighted often he asked to be invited along. I only mention these facts at all because this individual happens to now be one of the worlds experts on ufo's. Since no names are to mentioned here, I think it's safe to say that if it comes a time for documenting this report his eye witness testimony would be invaluable.  Anyway on the day in question he and I spent the day scouting places where the craft had been seen to land.  On one spot the craft had set down and started a wild fire and when fire personel gathered on the ridge across from resort the craft landed back on the western ridge just north of the resort and sat and watched the fire being put out.  We examined both sites and the western ridge had three deep indentations that had apparently melted the soil into an almost glassy looking substance similar to black glass. There was no brush in this area because it was a fire break and a clearing and it why I beleive we were able to spot the landing site and melted soil. We were told that it was about time to go so my freind and I asked my uncle if we could get on the roof of the chalet to get a good vantage point to scan above the tree tops before we left and he showed us how to get up there and told time was almost up and watch the guide wires supporting the antenna. My freind had an old camera ! that you had to look down to view the object you were shooting and he took it out of it's case and just then I heard a low humming almost a vibration comming from the high western ridge that runs about a mile away rrom the resort.At this point we were about 40-50 feet above ground level and my mother and aunt were just comming out the front door calling for us to come on down to go. As the humming got louder I focused my attention in that direction and saw what appeared to be a structure, like stuts but viewable through its body. I called out to my freind and said ""This has got to be it"". Ashe looked were I was pointing he said he wasnt seeing anything, But as it got closer it began to fill in and turn a purplish color and filled out into a long cigar shaped craft. We both watched in awe as this object the size of a football field matterialized and just stopped right at eye level about 30-40 feet away and at about 50-60 feet above the ground. The craft hovered about 45 seconds and my freind attempted to spap a picture but tripped over a wire and as he got back up and tried again the craft zipped away at a speed I cannot desribe. Back on the ground everyone that had seen the craft desribed what they saw and my mothers desription gave it a black stripe right down the middle that was not observed from our vantage point on the roof. After this event I questioned my Aunt for more info on her sightings and experences and she told me it had been visiting for years and she had even reported it to the Air Force and after several meetings with them she was told to keep here mouth shut and she was crazy. Well she was not crazy and 33 years later I can still see it like it was yesterday. My friend as stated earlier was so impressed by the experience he made it his lifes passion and ocupation. There were other strange things that happened to me soon after and later in life. The craft appeared to follow us home {Fremont Cal} and I experienced lost time and knowledge of their propulsion systeem and motivations for their visita! tions. I cant explain this knoledge, but I do know that after discusing the propulsion ststem with my uncle {not related to this incident} that worked at California Berkley about the method of propulsion he asked how I could have such knowledge about such far away and cutting edge information. Anyway thats about it in a nutshell and if I could speak to someone with the right forum or willing to explore this deeper I believe that a lot of things can be unlocked.

Silent saucer shaped craft joining up with a very bright white light,Canterbury (UK/England),,1976-06-01T22:00:00,disk,approx 10-15 mins,"Occurred : 6/1/1976 22:00  (Entered as : 1976 22:00) Reported: 7/18/2008 12:14:34 PM 12:14 Posted: 8/12/2008 Location: Canterbury (UK/England),  Shape: Disk Duration:approx 10-15 mins",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64633.html,"Silent saucer shaped craft joining up with a very bright white light I live in the UK. When I was growing up I lived with my parents in the countryside in South East Kent, near to woods and with very few neighbours. When I was about 19 -20 years old I was seeing my friend and neighbour (same age) to the door as she was about to go home.  She lived about 200 yards along the road. As we stood in the doorway I saw a classic shaped craft emerging from the woods, low flying, just seeming to skim the tops of an avenue of trees lining a lane about 200 yards from my house. The craft followed the lane towards a big house (a sort of minor stately house) where a Justice of the Peace lived on her own. The craft was about the size of a small normal plane I would guess, completely silent, flying slowly and carefully, and as I said before, a classic saucer shape. I don’t  remember the colour of the lights –  but I later described the lights around the base of the craft as ‘disco’ light (showing my age now) the lights seemed to pulse on and off in sequence. Just above the stately house (which is hidden by trees) was a very bright light. It immediately made me think of the Star of Bethlehem as it is depicted in children’s Bible story pictures. The craft seemed to join up or merge with the light and the light seemed to grow and pulse with a surge of power (as if it was taking a big breath) before it flew off upwards and across the sky. When the craft merged with the light I could no longer see the craft – just the light.  It moved so fast it was hard to follow it with my eyes. Also it did not fly across the sky as a normal plane would but across and up. I also tried to signal to it, by turning the outside light on and off. (not sure why I did that). Later I found out that the lady who owned the house had also seen it, and I telephoned her, to tell her that I had also seen it. She was a very grand and dismissive lady but I managed to get out of her that she had seen ‘them’ hovering in front of her house. She told me that she had reported it to the RAF. Recently I was reading about cattle mutilations possibly being involved with UFO activity, and I remembered a boyfriend of mine being stopped by the Police, around the same time I had seen the UFO. He had been stopped and his car searched after leaving my house one evening, because there had been a lot of sheep mutilations in the area, and they had searched his vehicle looking for knives etc. There may be no connection at all, but it is worth mentioning here. Also, as regards the different shapes of UFOs: Go to the Pukka Pies UK website.  Click on Online shop. Click on Posters. Look at the poster entitled ‘ Pukka Pies Westminster Taste Invasion’-  now…....is that a cigar shaped UFO or a saucer shaped UFO? are people getting the two shapes mixed up?

UFO near nuclear plant,Grand Chain,IL,1976-07-01T14:00:00,fireball,5-10 min ?,"Occurred : 7/1/1976 14:00  (Entered as : 07-01-76 14:00) Reported: 7/6/2008 6:33:37 AM 06:33 Posted: 8/12/2008 Location: Grand Chain, IL Shape: Fireball Duration:5-10 min ?",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64345.html,"UFO near nuclear plant. I live in Metropolis, Ill. just about 15 miles east of Grand Chain. Let me give you the geography of were we are. Metropolis is the home of a plant that makes R238 or some kind of chemical for nuclear bombs. I beleive they call it ""yellowcake.""  Over the Ohio river (in Kentucky) there is another plant  that takes this ""yellowcake,"" and refines it into, well, only the government knows.  In other words there is a lot of uranium in this area. One Sunday myself and two of my friends were on the road between Joppa, Ill, and Grandchain, Ill. This road runs a mile or two north of the Ohio River, but there are places that you can see the river. And this spot was one of those places.  We just passed over the Cache River bridge and was coming on a little rise and curve.  My male friend was driving, a female friend was in the passenger seat, and I was in the back seat behind the driver. I've been down that road hundreds of times so I knew to look to the south to get a view of the river.  Something caugh my eye just over the Illinois bank of the river.  I'm no good judging heights, but I would say it was 1000 ft. over the trees.Well, I don't care if you believe me or not. I don't want any plubicity. What it was, was an airplane, I don't know much about planes but I swear to God it looked just like a piper cub, the kind where the wings are on top of the plane. ??  From the very instant I saw the plane I knew somthing was wrong.  The windows weren't transparent.  The windows looked like it had silver looking tinting, and the plane was not moving at all.  It was just setting there.   I don't recall ever saying a word to my friends.  As we were moving along the road  I kept watching the plane and all the sudden this huge green fireball came down to earth and exploded on the ground 3 times.  But made no noise at all. (Now keep in mind that that Kentucky nuclear plant is in sight just across the river). The wierdest part of this whole thing was right after the explosions (I'll never forget this), I was turning my head around to look foreward I watched my two friends heads turn back foreward at the same time mine did.  We never said a word about it just went on down the road like nothing ever happened.  It's like we forgot about it. Even though this happened back in 1976 we never spoke about this to one another.  EVER!  The female friend of mine died about 4-5 years ago of cancer and we never said a word about it to each other.  Every time we were around each other we just, I guess forgot or was blocked from saying anything to each other about it.   But another strange fact is that I can tell other people about what I had saw.  But after a few rolling eyes, I thought it best just to keep it to myself.  I'm getting older now and I had to tell someone that may actually believe me.  I'm just getting my first computer.  And if we were abducted I'm not going to be hypnotized to remember it.   Another funny thing is that I saw a show on ufo's once and they were talking about having small pieces of metal in thier bodies.  Well, in 1987 I had surgury on my arm for radial tunnel.  The Dr. showed me my x-ray on day and ask what those two pieces of metal were.  Smaller than a BB and lodged just above my elbow on my left arm.  I have never injured my are in that location. If you don't believe me, thats fine. I have never heard of a ufo looking like an airplane before either. But I swear this on my Grandma's. I forgot to mention one thing.  There isn't a time I go by there that I don't think about that day.  I moved to Texas in 1979 and moved back to Metropolis in 1985.  My wife and I went down that road one day and the state of Illinois has bought the same property that thing exploded on and put a resturant right over the spot. Let me give you my summation of what we went through. [maybe]  (1) If it was a UFO they can transform there crafs to look just like earth planes [because there was no dought in my mind that thing I saw looked like a plane]   (2) Some kind of mind control was used on us or we would have been able to speak to each other about what we had saw.   (3) And it scares me to think I've got some kind of transmitter lodged in my arm. I'll probably think of more things later that I wish I had said to you but had forgot.   But that's it and that ((deleted--""is true."")) ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))",2008-08-12T00:00:00,37.2479,-88.9699

After watching it for a minute, I told my sister to stop the car and we got out. The thing pivoted back and flew right over us. It was not very high in the sky and it had flashing red, blue, and white lights on the corners. It was triangle shaped. We could see a slow moving propeller on the bottom. We could hear a slight hum.

I flashed the floodlights from the side of the house and as a result, the points of light came together creating a flat linear shape that proceeded to accelerate in the direction of the house. As it approached the house, it was silent and approximately 300 feet over the house and trees. There were no lights (except for the floodlights) and it hovered making no sound! As I looked out the window, I noticed it was enormous, so large that it must have been at least 1000 feet in width, resembling one large wing in a wide triangle shape. I noticed enormous, cavernous bays (similar to aircraft carriers) underneath the wings yet there were no lights and there was no movement. Out of fear, I hid behind the curtains for about one minute and then built up the courage to run outside and look into the sky – there were no traces, no noises, nothing. It simply had disappeared, yet could not have turned as its wing would have hit the house and trees. It made no noise and had been attracted by the floodlights on the house. As we were younger children, our babysitter would not allow us to go outside out of fear as she could not figure out what it was either.

My girlfriend and I were exploring the backroads and small towns of the Appalachias and camping out of the back of my 1970 VW Squareback station wagon. It slept two quite nicely. And I'm 6'4"". We were a couple of hippie kids in our early twenties and I had found a dirt road off of US 421 at about 7:00pm as it was still daylight. This road had a lot of switchbacks and it was mainatined by Ashland Oil Company as we had seen multiple signs along this dirt road. I drove off of US 421 for approximately 15 miles and up to an elevation that might have been several hundred feet higher than where I had turned onto the dirt road. I stopped beneath a beautiful rock cliff that stretched about 100' above where I'd parked. The cliff was due east and a thickly forrested and very steep drop off was to our west. The car was oriented front facing north. We got our Hibachi out and cooked a couple small steaks and some veggies on it and hand about a third of a bottle of red wine between the two of us. We sat and talked as it got dark and we could make out a narrow band of sky and stars above us but most of the sky was no visible due to the cliff and the trees. At about 10:00 pm we decided to call it a night and settled into the VW for a good night's sleep. It was warm but nice and the sky was clear the humidity was low and there were no bugs so it was a beautiful night for sleeping. We had the hatch open on the VW with the rear seats folded down and the front seats folded forward as to aloow as much length for stretching out as possible so I would say that my feet were probably about 6""-10"" inside the car and my girlfriend was on my right side. I woke up and only could open my eyes but could not move. There was a LOT of brilliant blue white light (like an electric arc welder only more) shining into the car from BELOW our elevation, coming up the steep slope to the west. I could tell that it was from that origin due to the light shining onto the ceiling of the car and not down into the car. I must have been on my right side as I could see the VDO dash clock and it said it was about 1:00 am.  I should not have been able to see that clock as we were in the middle of nowhere and it had been pitch dark when we turned off the dome light at 10:00.  Sometime later a awoke again and this time I was lying on my back which struck me as odd as I had never slept on my back. I was looking at the headliner of the car and all I do was move my eyes.  There was a very even blue white light illuminating the inside of the car at this point but it was not very bright.  As I looked to my left I could see the B-Pillar moving away from my field of vision and I realized that I was moving out of the back of the car, flat on my back, unable to move.  I had the very definite sensation that there was something/someone moving around outside the rear of the car.  I immediatley thought 'bears'.  I remember struggling to move but all I could do was move my eyes and the last thing I remembered was seeing the inside of the hatch window glide by and out of sight. The next morning was very strange as my girlfriend and I barely talked, tossed our stuff into the VW and drove to the nearest town in search of a restroom with plenty of cold water to splash on.  We made it to Hazard Kentucky and there was a little festival going on in town.  When I found a restaraunt I went to the men's room and immediately noticed that I had about four days beard growth when I had shaved just 24 hours before.  My girlfriend was in even worse shape as she had started her period just the day before and she said that she was a ""mess"".  We both felt as though we had been drugged as we were kind of woozy and I remember pain in my neck and lower back and she reported pain as well. We didn't really talk much about that experience for the next six years.  We were married for five of those years and the experience only came up once or twice. Thirteen years later in Bloomington,Indiana I was reading a book by Whitly Streiber and another book about abductions that I just happened upon at the county library and I flipped to the photos in the center of the book and there were B&W photos of ""scoop marks"" on people's shins/lower legs. I about dropped the book because I knew that I had three perfectly proportioned scars on my right leg that were perfect matches to the photos I was looking at. I had know for years that I had these scars but I had never really questioned their origin.... That struck me as really weird because I can account for every little scar on my carcass but not these. And they are deep and would have been into the bone based on their dimensions. I've seen floating, dimly lit orbs once before this event when I was about ten and once after when I was about twenty-eight. That's pretty much it..... I worked in high energy accelerator physics for about seventeen years after this event and I felt that it was possibly some sort of abduction event even though I was immersed daily in hard scientific facts.

About to celebrate our 30th wedding aniversary.  Yet I will remember this as long as I live, as though it happened yestreday!  Married 8/19/78. arrived in bermuda for honeymoon 8/22/78.  We arrived around noon.  We stayed at a resort called The Reefs Beach Club. The resort is situated on a [u] shaped cove on a small cliffside. Around 7:30 in the evening we went to dinner. The area where dinner is served sits above the cove beach, about 2 stories up, overlooking the ocean and our room; which was off to the left down a long walkway and from our view appears as though it was situated on a jetty. You could fish from our balcony. It is now sunset and we are having dinner with friends and I notice off to the east what appears to be a helicopter with two big searchlights sweeping the water, out on the horizon. I notice the other guests are seeing this also. I also observed a man in a dark suit,sitting just behind me at a table with a camera and long telephoto lense, snapping away pictures like crazy. He was so out of place; in a suit and alone at a resort. After dinner we were headed to the beach for a walk. The break between the building was just outside our room. We were standing in between; about 30 feet from the water,when suddenly we were lighted up like R.Druyfus at the railroad crossing in close encounters of the third kind! An intensly white spotlight from the helicoprter was shinning on us no less than 100 feet in the air and 100 feet close.I am looking at this for a few seconds as the light starts to dim, I can see the element in the spot light glowing red as a flame inside burnes off, also what appears to be a gas line retracts from the rear of the light with a flame burning from that also.They both retract into  the bottom of the copter, So I thought.I look at my wife and exclaim thats no copter; its a flying saucer. I look to my right and the only thing I see is my wife running to our room yelling get away from it. I say come back , its not everyday you see one o! f these, and she yells I do not want them to take me again!Knock me over with a feather,I make note of that but continue to check it out. Its still hovering, about 35 feet in diameter.with a bank of rectanguler windows completly around its upper circumferance, several red lights appeared on its top part but went off when the spotlight did. I now notice all the people upon the balcony where we had dinner.They are screaming and yelling about it and takeing pictures. Flashbulbs going off like at the end off a rock concert. Hey I have one in my hand. A keystone 110 everflash camera ;it does not work ;great, but if I turn it around you use the lense finder as a binoculer.Thats what I did. O my God! I can see two et's to the right of the saucer waving to the people on the balcony I then realize one is to the left and looking straight down at me I now know what it means to have your hair stand on the back of your neck. That thing looked through me,not just at me.The et's were definately the grays as described by others.Those big black eyes. I will never forget them.I then notice the gray that was looking at me turn its head to its left. The saucer then starts to move out over the ocean.

My little dog jumped out of the truck and ran to some nearby garbage cans, I assumed she saw a cat. I just happened to look up to admire the clear, starry night sky. Almost directly above me was a huge, dark triangular shape. It had three lights, one in each corner. I was terrified. I shouted to my husband "" what is that?"" he said ""a helicopter"". It was no helicopter, this thing made absolutely no sound whatsoever and the sheer size of it blotted out the star filled sky above me. I called my dog a few times until she finally came back to me and I grabbed her up. The object will still hanging above me, motionless and without a sound. I ran up the steps to the house and as I reached the porch, the triangle darted off toward in a northeasterly direction.

Cloud was patchy with haze on horizion, beyond this sky was clear through breaks in cloud. Temperature was cold and had many layers on to stay warm. Full Moon at time, and light pollution made the cloud layer above me radiate ~orange (this is usual where I live). There was no wind. It was quiet outside. Was sitting facing North, surrounded by tree's and housing - obstructed view of horizon all round. Was reading an astronomy book illuminated by flashlight glancing up now and then to check on cloud cover. Glanced up one time;  Spotted object from aprox NNE at maybe 60 degrees elevation it traversed across the sky to the left of me and then behind me to maybe SSW. It was probably not above 60 elevation the whole way and ""seemed"" to be at constant altitude. I say seemed because of the speed of the thing. The object was very quick, at first I thought it was a meteorite - but it was not quite as fast as that, I have seen many ""shooting stars"" which are really fast, and less meteorites that leave smoke trails which usually seem slower, I can't say how fast this thing was - it wasn't as fast as the meteorites I have seen but it seemed in the same ""league"" as that kind of speed - that's the best way I can put it!  Object traversed sky very quickly perhaps <1sec maybe <2sec I can't say but it was fast. Object was definately round shape, had a noticeable but small apparent diameter, can only guess distance but ""think"" it was quite far from me so perhaps not ""tiny"". Object was silver or metallic, had a ""brightness"" to it or infront of it or around it (it happened fast sorry!). Though I can't say if it was illuminated by moon or ground lighting (orange in area) or if it glowed. Object was below cloud layer. There was no noise whatsoever. Object streaked across sky and that was that!  There's a chance it was a meteorite but the speed seemed ""wrong"" just slower its hard to say exactly. Perhaps it was, but I thought I would post this here in the hopes someone else along its groundtrack saw it, although at the speed it went I consider myself lucky to of seen it!

My rental vehicle was parked at the Grand Sierra Resort facing east and I was overlooking a small lake called MGM Lake. I was waiting for management to arrive at a new building where I was installing software. While I was in the rental vehicle listening to a college football game I noticed fish were jumping out of the lake. I live in Las Vegas and I very rarely get to see any wildlife 'in action'.  So I sat there and watched this for a few minutes when my eyes caught sight of what I thought were three birds. It was dark and I figured that lights in the distance had illuminated the birds. The birds were headed north but then banked to their right and completed a 270 degree turn. Now they were headed west, right in my direction. The area is very close to the airport and after I figured out the lights were not birds, I braced myself for a plane crash because the 270 degree turn was very fast, low, and heading lower. But once it straightened out, the lights started moving in my direction. I watched this object silently move across the sky (Had to be only 300 FT off the ground and I'd say roughly 1000 FT in front of me and I cannot judge the speed though I'd guess 200 MPH) and it went behind a tree line. I looked to the other side of the tree line expecting to see the object but nothing appeared. When I glanced up before the lights passed the tree line I could not make out any object but there were certainly three points that if you connected the dots you could make out a triangle. The rental car was idling but there was very little engine noise and I did not hear any noise from the object. There were no blinking lights and what made this even more interesting was about 20 seconds after the object went behind the tree line a plane landed. It was a small plane and I was thinking they had to have seen something!  I was in a complete sober state of mind.

ABOUT ME: I am a retired electronics Eng, 59 and working part time. I also have a FAA Private Pilot License and I am a backyard amateur A. I own a 12-inch reflector and a 6-inch refractor. On this night we were experiencing a warm front over the S.F. Bay Area. 20 degrees above normal for this time of year. The moon was ¾ full and just visible over the eastern horizon. Because of the moon lit sky (the suns light reflecting off the moon of course), birds were easily seen flying overhead at higher altitudes. THE SIGHTING: I was sitting on a backyard recliner drinking ice water using a  8 x 40 quality binocular to star qaize. My eyes were night adapted and just a few seconds before seeing the UFO, I was looking at the constellation Pegasus, I drifted my binoculars upward to look at a nebula when I saw what looked like a large black bird or object flying where my binocular was pointing. I thought how strange the shape as it did not have a bird shape. I continued to look into the binocular and followed this dark object heading 180 degrees south in a straight line. It was almost overhead, maybe within a ½ mile east of my home. It was flying with NO LIGHTS and NO SOUND. I live with 15 miles of SFO airport and see many planes turning and overhead for final approach with the red left wing light flashing and the green right wing lit. But this craft had no lights at all, made no sound. It was low enough be heard, but no sound was heard! If it was the size of a 747 jet, then I would say it would have been about 1000 to 1200 feet above SL. What was more unusual to me was its belly. It had 3 round disks shapes connected to it. So in conclusion, It had a TRANGULAR SHAPE, was DARK GRAY (lit by the moon light) with 3 ROUND CIRCLES ON ITS BOTTOM. No airplane wings or rudder or ailerons were seen. It seem to be running in a stealth mode maybe because of its low alitude, but the moon gave it away. I was lucky enough to have my binocular in that direction otherwise I would have never seen it with the eye alone. I followed it for about 7 seconds until my shed blocked further viewing. I ran up to tell my wife and boy but they did not believe me at first but the next day they seemed more convinced by my going on and on about seeing it. PAST SIGHTING: My first was in 1967 over the Pacific Ocean standing on the San Francisco beach and it was at night. I never reported it as I did not think anyone would believe be. But, I did tell friends and family. If you want information on that sighting I would be glad to tell you? I am interested if others had seen it.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

Fairfield, CT I figure I would submit my observations, though it has been a few weeks since the events had accrued.  I guess the events took place around the 1st of October.  I smoke cigarettes out side my home and observe the night sky every night.  I live around NYC region and see many planes travel over my home, and so I would consider my self capable of identifying a plane easily in the night sky.  My first observation.  I saw a bright light breaking through the tree line on a clear night, at a height I observe many planes around 11PM.  At first I figured it was a plane coming at me in a direct line, and I was observing a line of sight to its head lights, although it was brighter than most planes, so I decided to observe it longer than I typically would for other night sky lights.  The path the light was traveling was coming at me and it did travel directly over my house and off into the southern tree line.  What I would typically see when a plane travels in this fashion would be. First the head lights when it is traveling towards me. 2nd the underbelly lights as it traveled above me. 3rd the head lights would dim and fade to black as it passed away from me, and I would observe the tail lights and the underbelly lights.  Well this light didn't follow those rules and it sutatined its single point of light through it entire traverse of the night sky and maintained its lluminosity.  It did appear to be low in the sky although I can't declare how far that would be.  It made no noise.  After it passed beyond my ability to see it, I noticed that there were many planes in the night sky, more than usual, and their paths didn't follow what is typically the flying paths for airliners and personal aircraft comiing in and  out of the airports around my area.  Made me think that I wasn't the only person to observe this event.   A few days later, it was over cast but it wasn't raining.  I was observing the moon light breaking through the cloud cover and it resembled the NASA Black Brant XII cloud dispersal I viewed on Youtube.  I watched the moon light break through the clouds for awhile as it sustained the appearance of the Rocket launch for awhile.  I have to mention that I felt that something was going to happen, it was odd, and it made me uncomfortable.  I looked into the northern sky and observed a light break the tree line, it was followed by 2 other lights. They appear to hold the points of a triangle and were traveling to the south. When I declared to my self that this was not something that I had ever observed before, the 3 lights broke formation and the leading light changed direction towards the west and the other 2 lights followed, but didn't take the paths of what I would say are typical of things I have seen in the night sky (radical and some what random change of direction.) It was a short event and lost sight of them in the western tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

We all asked each other if we had seen it, we had. about 30 sec later it showed up again out the drivers window (north) and we all started yelling and I pulled over, by the time I had stopped it was gone. We got out of the car and  it popped up in front of us again. So I took out my little camera and waited, a few sec later saw it way far off to the north east, really dim then it kind of blinked out and it was right in front of us again but there was 2 of them. They just hung there for about 10 to 20 sec, I got some video of them then they just disappeared. All the cars that had been behind us had pulled over and were watching, and a man pulled up next to us and asked if we were seeing this! . While we were talking they re-appeared but this time there were 3 of them, they just hung there then kind of bounced up and down, hung there again, then they were just gone. I also go a little of that on camera. All of a sudden it seemed there were jets coming from all directions, there had been no sound until the jets showed up, and after the jets came we didn't see the lights again. They were very large and bright orange, similar to looking a street lamp from about 50yards away. It really was the most awesome thing I have ever seen. I have the footage on my camera but have not downloaded it yet, I also drew a pic but I have no scanner.  My son was scared out5 of his mind, my husband and I were both really excited, as was the man that pulled up next to us. The whole thing lasted about 20 min or so we stayed and watched for nearly half an hour more and saw nothing else except lots of jets flying around.

We were driving west on McKinley ave in Fresno CA on our way to a meeting. We noticed 4 hovering objects at a stand still on each side of our car about 3 miles up in the sky when we were at a red light. Once our car started moving they moved along side us, every time we stopped they stopped. They all looked alike and did not look like helicopters and not planes. Later on in the evening on the way back home we spotted another craft similar to the ones earlier just hovering at a stand still above the houses in our neighborhood. the object even brightened its lights from red to super bright white. it was still for about 3 minutes then slowly started to move to the right, then left then it either vanished or we just did not catch it take off. This is not the first time we have seen these objects in the sky. we seen larger ones the size of two commercial planes before. We just find it strange that the sightings have not stopped. Our children, my parents friends and my mother in law have all witnessed them. For some strange reason these objects have not gone away and seem to be growing by the numbers each day and showing themselves pretty boldly. If anyone has seen them also please post a report, we hope we are not just going crazy over here by ourselves.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,36.78825093333334,-119.78947053333333

It was somewhat windy, clear skies and able to see the stars. Looking in the direction of Google Map coordinates 38.273312, -104.667145, on the other side of Pueblo Blvd and on the other side of the river from where we were, we saw an orange light maybe 6-7 stories high. It was an orange sperical light that flashed on and off once. Then a few seconds later it turned on again, then seperated into three seperate orange spheres, extending away from us and to our left looking out toward PMI. The lights then stayed on for about 1 second, fully extended and remaining absolutely still and perfectly aligned to each other despite the wind. Then about 45 seconds later the three seperate orange sphere lights turned on, in the same direction and area as before, but one was closer to the ground and the other two were splayed out away from the other about 8 stories high, but each flashed on simultaneously and off simultaneously, all in a duration of 1 second. Then a few minutes later regular aircraft with required FAA lights flew over and kept flying over. The UFOs were not seen again afterward, and we only saw them at a time when it seemed no air traffic was in the immediate area.  We had parked there because we had seen UFOs there before and figured we might see on tonight. We noticed what seemed to be a bright, large planet out to the west. That planet had been in the exact same spot the night before, but tonight it began to slightly move around in every different direction, not staying stationary, and then it moved farther and faster from where it should have been in the sky. That's what got us to look in that general direction, and then we saw the first flash of the single orange sphere way to the right and close to the ground on the other side of the river. After the orange speheres, we looked back at what should have been a planet and it remained stationary and eventually sat below the horizon with the rest of the stars about 15 minutes after the orange spheres had stopped activity.  My friend who was driving and wants to remain anonymous called his friend who was in pueblo west on his cell phone after the second appearance of the lights and during the third appearance said that his cell phone recepetion cut out slightly during the call, especially during the third appearance of the lights, and after the lights stopped appearing the reception was back to normal.

At approximately 20:45 I went outside on my porch to make a phone call.  While on the phone with my mother, I noticed several strange objects in the sky.  I counted as many as six in all.  The objects appeared to be of several different shapes, however I could only clearly see 1 craft in particular, and i will attempt to describe the others by their light patterns. The most visable object was one in which the shape and light patterns appeared to morph. It started off as a round object with a single light, then went to an triangular shape with three different lights. It then morphed again into an oval possessing 6 lights, and finally a cross shaped object of eight lights. It moved at a constant, slow speed across the sky and traveled directly above me. The second most visable object was a very bright object which seemed to hover, and would during the duration of the sighting appear either farther away of closer and at varying points across the sky. However, this object did remain within a small patch of sky and did not deviate from it. The other objects I will divide into two catagories. The first catagory is what would best be described as ""Firecracker"" like objects. These objects would appear to ""blink"" and would then reappear at a different point in the sky. these objects traveled in a very erratic pattern and at very fast speeds. They apeared to possess one light each, and the light would change colors from yellow, white, and red at random. Approximately 3 were seen. The second group can best be described as ""slow and steady"". These objects moved slowely across the sky, but with an erraticness that could not be explained. Their light was constant, appearing white or red in the sky. Approximately 2 were seen. It sould be noted that I live on a waterway which emptes into the Atlantic Ocean and that there is a Powerplant on the body of water. There were also a good amount of aircraft that appeared after the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  The date indicated is flawed, so we have assigned a date above, which we assume is the correct one.

On the evening of 21 January both myself and my brother were watching RAF C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft. For almost the entire evening(18:00-23:00)they were noticable and I presume they were doing some sort of low level air training for Afghanistan or Iraq. At approximately 21:50 an RAF C-130 Hercules passed almost directly over our house at an estimated altitude of 2500 feet. Very quickly, we noticed that it appeared to be unusually illuminated as though there was a very powerful red light (like firework)on the top of the aircraft enabling us to only see the silhouette of the Hercules. The aircraft continued to fly in a straight line, yet the light moved from being on top of the aircraft to following it from a close distance. It did this for a short space of time and then suddenly burst infront of the aircraft almost half a mile in less than a second. The acceleration was unbelievable. The light maintained this distance for a few seconds and then once again burst backwards at very high speed and continued to follow the aircraft. The light then stopped in mid air, and then shot up into the sky at an immense speed. The light appeared to have a very intense, almost white, oval shaped centre which was possibly a 1/4 of the Hercules's lenght. When combined with the 'fuzzy' light which surrounded this bright centre the light was possibly half the lenght of the Hercules.  For the record I am 17 and my brother is 14. I am unable to say whether the object made a noise as the aircraft made too loud a noise to notice any other sound.

My fiancé was driving me home after she had gotten off work when I noticed a large bright object in the sky.  We had just passed smith springs road were it intersects with murfresboro road driving away from downtown Nashville.  I was in the passenger seat and saw it to the left and in front of the car. At first I thought I was looking at a helicopter as the object seemed to hover.  But, as we drove closer I could see that the object was long and flat on the bottom and far to large to be a helicopter. Once we made it to our turn at nashboro blv, we could see the object quite clearly and noticed that it had begun to move slowly.  Once we turned from murfresboro on to nashboro blv., the object passed over our car slowly and making no noise at all.  The object was low enough that if I had been on the roof of a nearby house I could almost have touched it.  After it passed over our car we watched it descend into a near by field. We drove around trying to get a better view of where it had landed but were unable to see more then a bright glow from the road.  Neither of us were willing to get out of the car and trek through unknown fields to find it so we drove around hoping we could get a better view.  After about 10 minutes of driving up both smith springs and nashboro blv we saw the craft shoot back into the sky at a steep angle.  After it took off we followed it until the object turned around and a plane passed over us a few seconds later. We made a u-turn at bell road back onto smith springs to follow both the plane and the object. We lost sight of the plane and never saw it again but we did find the object again flying low and parallel to murfresboro road.  We followed it down murfresboro till it came to a halt in the air and then a few moments later it turned and headed back the other way towards nashboro blv again.  Making another u-turn we followed the object turning off murfresboro and back onto nashboro blv. There it traveled straight down nashboro blv and I snapped a few pictures while driving after it.

Time: January 22, 2009, 1:15pm Conditions: clear skies,  sunshine,  and clouds far into the distance Location: New Tampa east of Bruce B downs several lights north of the I75 overpass. On the 22nd,  me and my boyfriend were heading to USF for my class that afternoon.  We were heading from our home down Cross Creek and traveling due south on Bruce B Downs blvd at about 45MPH.  It was a clear Florida afternoon with clouds only in the distant horizon.  Upon crossing the Tampa Palms region my boyfriend had spotted something in the sky and was laughing about how normally people who see UFO’s depict an object which seems very unlikely to be a UFO at all making the whole possibility even more far fetched.  I looked up and saw an object in the sky just beyond the power/telephone lines crossing the road, and once we had passed under these I could clearly see the object without interference. From the passengers seat of his SUV,  the object appeared to be close to a 45 degree angle from the horizon, and about 5 degrees to the left of our car’s heading which looked to be just to the left of the center of the windshield from what I could tell.  The shape was horizontally ovular with more of acute sides on the left and right forming near points.  The texture seemed to be quote slick as the light  reflection from the sun and shadow underneath were relatively free of distortion.  The color of the object to the naked eye seemed to be silver hues or possibly a very metallic white,  but either way the surface had very reflective properties.  The top was very bright white with sunlight,  but the bottom were tones of silver and grey with shadows that looked like slight reflections of the tree line below. Being an aspiring scientist I immediately thought about all the possibilities and scenarios in my head and concluded it must have been a weird shaped blimp for an advertisement at one of the local stores near Amberly dr.  I ruled out a plane instantly because it did not change size to indicate a northern or southern trajectory, and it did not waiver side to side in our view either.  For the clarity of the sky and close proximity to us,  I was able to rule out a helicopter instantly also.  The object made no sound,  had no impact on the tree line below, and no propellers or engines of any sort were visible. Me and my boyfriend stared at the object while slowing down in our drive and I made the comment,  “You know if this is what people seen when they reported UFO’s I can see how they make that assumption,   after seeing this blimp,  I would nearly claim it were a UFO if I had been startled or had bad eyesight myself.”   As we got a little closer I started thinking how weird it was that the blimp/balloon had no advertisements on it,  no personnel carriage underneath,  or no tie down to a building below.  We kept staring at the object as a full minute had passed with it in our sights and we still had no reasonable theories as to what it was. My boyfriend laughed and stated that it must be a UFO then,  and I agreed since it would be the simplest solution to the situation,  and right when I had said jokingly ,“Yay aliens,  how neat!”  the object vanished right before our eyes.  As bizarre as that sounds,  I know.  It reminded me of those home movies where a kid holds up a ball and says, “now it’s here………..now it’s not (and the camera recording breaks for a moment)”  then the ball is suddenly not in the kid’s hand due to 2 separate recordings being edited together.  It was a quick and abrupt vanishing act for this object.  Now neither of us were laughing. I continued watching, scanning, and searching the sky as we drove all the way to campus.  There were still no clouds around,  no chemical trails from an aircraft,  no noise of an engine accelerating rapidly enough to be gone that quickly.  Yet the object was nowhere to be found with no trace of where it went.  It was gone before I could blink right before my very eyes and for the first time in my life I had no clues to lead me to any sort of conclusion. We waited the last few days to see if any other reports surfaced in the news explaining what we saw,  but to no avail.  While I would love to have an alien encounter,  I’m not sure what it was we saw and am not entirely convinced It was a UFO,  I would like to put it out there for anyone who would like to find answers and put all these puzzle pieces together for us and the rest of the confused world.

I would estimate about the normal height of airplanes, going a bit faster than normal airplanes. The object appeared to have a large rectangular wing unit with lights (blue and white) that flashed from the inside to the outside of the wings in a parallel pattern.  I kept looking at that object as much as I could (I was driving), and then I saw another set of lights, much smaller. These were flashing red and white and moving extremely quickly at what appeared to be a very high altitude.  I used my cellular phone to call witness 2 at my house to tell him to go outside quickly and see the lights. Our house is in a valley, and by the time I got home and he got outside, the bigger object (with the white and blue lights) had gotten over our house and beyond the tree line. However, we could still see the smaller ones. They moved very quickly over our roofline and out of sight. I did not see anything more that was unusual after that.  The time span was about 15 minutes.   Witness 2: When I took the call I was upstairs in our home.  I headed downstairs and out the front door to see her driving down the driveway.

Nothing unusual to me as this can be a corridor for landing patterns at ATL.  However, the smaller object she then pointed out was moving rapidly, with a flashing I had not seen in commercial craft. About the time (and this will sound corny) it traveled under the constellation Orion, another smaller light appeared right behind.  It, too, began traveling at a speed I have not seen the commercial craft do.  I also could not hear any echo of jet or other propulsion noise from aircraft.  Normally, we would hear a faint engine sound.  It should be noted I did not hear this as the larger craft went by, either.  These two smaller lights were out of sight in less than 90 seconds. The one in the rear that had ‘appeared’ was traveling, using line of sight and my hand for scale, approximately three inches behind the other.  I t seemed as though these were extremely high in altitude, higher than commercial craft.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,34.1675,-83.912

First, the craft was much too large to be pulled by a plane and had no text or picture of any kind. It was a flat dark gray color. From it's position relative to mine and the apparent size in the sky, it appeared to be much larger than an airliner.

About 30 seconds after I first saw it it started to accelerate fairly quickly to the east. It traveled not to far and just disappeared.  I went to my neighbors house as they saw it much longer. They said it was coming from the north and was glowing a bluish color and as it got closer they saw what looked like sparks coming off of it. My neighbor said she was sure a plane was gone drop out of the sky. As it got closer the glow changed from blueish to a fiery orange. And then the craft stopped above them. That's when I got the call and rushed outside.  I have no idea what it was but the orange glow could not have been a normal aircraft.

I witnessed a brightly illuminated(blue) object in the sky.  It was just right there motionless(or so it seemed to the naked eye) not too much higher then out tallest building of around 12 floors.  It was unlike anything i have ever seen.  my husband pulled up next to me and i told him to hurry and look.  We sped home to witness this with out children and grab our binoculars for a closer look.  The object seemed to slowly move closer then stop.  At first the shape was round and bright blue in color. We took pictures.  It changed color to a solid orange/red, then began changing shapes. Pear shape, round, oblong, oval, as well as changing to being outlined in orange/red.  I made sure I was propped against car to steady my arms as we were looking through our binoculars and discussing everything we were seeing.  The object made irratic darting movements, causing me to constantly have to re-find and re-focus it. After about 5-10 min. it slowly slowly began drifting up at about a 70 degree angle. as it got higher it again changed color back to the brilliant blue only outlined this time.  By the time it was almost out of sight, passed the stars, it was barely even light outside.  It was awesome.  The weather was clear and this object looked and felt so out of place in our sky.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,33.50664583333333,-104.45876666666668

Between the hills to the north of town and the graveyard hill to the east of town there is a space that Kinda forms a v shape opening. As me and my friend where atop the bleachers we noticed in the opening between the hills a large orange object in sky. It appeared to resemble the sun except it did not extend light from itself. Also it was like the sun except it was like someone taking a ball and smashing down from top and bottom, making it oblong shape. The object moved from behind one hill and slowly moved across opening till it disappeared behind the other hill. After a few secs it reappeared and slowing  moved back till it went behind the hill it came from the first time. I was as though not everyone could see what we were seeing. I looked over to horseshoe court and was amazed that none of the adults playing horseshoes seemed not to see this large orange thing in the sky.

I want you to understand that the date of this FireBall streaming across the treeline from my position facing toward Hartford in the south and to the existing river coming from the northeastern sector of the state from the other side of the forest just outside Enfield, Connecticut was the exact path this Orb took heading in a northeastern direction. It appeared as I said as if the sun itself had fallen from the sky because of its massive size and the circular diameter of the sphere, it made no sound and nor was there a sound previous to its appearance to indicate a major explosion of some magnitude coming from that region of the countryside, it appeared as though it was approximately 10 miles or so from the street we lived on that ran parallel to the trajectory of the object in question and that of the river on the other side of the forest, it was heading in a north, northeasterly direction after I reviewing my homes position to that of Hartford and the river that passed along side of Enfield and headed directly toward the Hartford vicinity, the Smith Family lived directly behind our house on the next block, the Zimmermans a few more streets over from them, if my bearings are correct. The silence of such a huge sphere ROLLING across the tree tops and emitting whipping flames from upon its surface gave you the feeling that the core of this object was solid while its surface was entirely engulfed in a all encompassing mass of burning gases and surface material, no wind, not a whisper of the massive flight of this globe of fire could be heard, no crash, no explosion, its as if it was headed toward the coastline and gravity had no effect on its elevation as it traveled the distance from which I was could visually detect and remain captivated by its enormous size and silence as it moved through the evening sky to a destination I had no indication wwas close by.    I'd like to mention yet another personal experience, that wasn't so personal when you consider all the news at the time that was generated in the Community of Great Falls, Montana shortly after the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. It was months later and I had contacted a local priest from Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Great Falls . This priest has since been removed from active service with the general public, he has suffered a stroke on the left side of his body and his memory isn't exactly what it use to be. In the early 1980's, maybe around May of 1982, during that late spring month my wife and I was awakened by a glowing light from the back yard of our home that was hovering over our very large weeping willow tree. The air was still and the sounds in the distance echoed as if you were inside a tunnel.  Across the alley, on the next block at 2606-5th Avenue South a police car was parked in the middle of the street looking directly into our backyard, the sound of breaking glass could be heard for a very brief second from that location, the whole area of the neighborhood was as if it were in a vacuum.  Above our tree was a cloud that resembled a Maltesse Cross, its four triangular shaped inner arms were of a stewing blackness that could only be understood from the depths outside our planets atmosphere. The other portions of that Maltesse Cross between the cross figure itself was pure white and just as luminous as the light of a full moon on a clear night, even that of a bright florescent blub. It hummed as though discharging a message or extracting a source of matter that had called it forth in the midnight hour.    This experience has vanished from most all records in the area after a military investigator came to the area and researched the sighting that many residents of Great Falls had reported to the Great Falls Tribune and to Military officials at Malmstrom AFB the days following its appearances, this phenomenon occurred during a period when I was employed for about a 6 month period as a supervisior at a local Sambo's Restraurant. The incident was centered at 2605-6th Avenue South in Great Falls , Montana. These kinds of personal experiences for some reason attach themselves to the psychi of those individuals and never let go, who wouldn't feel a special bond to these events that defy logic according to investigators that remain true to their integrity? This is yet another unexplained event that now appears to be totally erased from the record books because of government involvement. The priest I mentioned earlier is in a housing facility run by the church for aging priests in Great Falls . This priest was contacted by me the morning of that Maltesse Cross had hovered over our tree. I spoke with Father Herinko a number of times about this event and told him that for some reason or another I was certain that Light would remain in the area for three more days and could be spotted above in the evening sky's canopy in its original shape in a northwest trajectory as a group of distinguished cloud formations resembling that Maltesse Cross or wheel with spokes; you think that during that time satillites would have detected this formation, maybe the military did! I expect the Great Falls Tribune that had front page coverage of this event from so many callers would still have information on this case in question, I think they do, but find it very difficult to locate. That priest after that event was over was removed from his position at Our Lady of Lourdes Church and placed in a small church about 30 miles out of town on Highway 200, I believe the town was Fort Shaw that serves about 150 perishioners. I found that stra! nge seei ng he was only in his earlier fifties and was the priest in charge of not only the church services, but the grade school it operated in the community of Great Falls . Well, that night of the Maltesse Cross incident I told my wife as we stood 30 feet from that tree looking up at the swirling mass of black ink and that extremely white soft halo that divided the two prominent features into very distinct patterns that I should go and venture up to the tree and climb-up and see what if anything would occur... she ruled against it and seemed only interested in going back into the house and finishing her sleep. The police car was still parked in the middle of the street watching the figure with, I suspect, much interest. I imagine the police report was sanitized, as well in this actual case of multiple sightings that week, it shouldn't have been. Maybe you can further investigate and inform me as to what your findings were! Another aspect of this event which was discussed with the priest was the Montana State License Plate on my Vehicle, "" Sacrum"". I had mailed one of these license plates to Pope John Paul II with a note that his life was in immediate mortal danger, that was 7 days from the attempt on his life where he was shot and a bullet struck his sacrum bone, go figure... I had never written a letter like that to anyone before, quite a coincidence, I had never communicated with the church prior to this event, but I did have an undeniable urge to get personalized license plates earlier that year... it was a plate that caused some interest with local officals, I retired that license plate after that incident. I was mostly consumed with getting my wife pregnant, my doctor told me forget it after numerous visits to his office... around 9 months after the Maltesse Cross incident we had a son... in 1983. His eyes were as if oriental, that's always puzzled me a bit. He's a good son, he works two jobs, has graduated from college with 3 degrees in business, I feel I'm very blessed to have him. It's funny how life e! volves, it's amazing the mysteries that sometimes make those blessings seem all the more important in our own particular lives. If you find the information concerning this event in Great Falls during that time frame drop me a line, at the time I failed to document this important event in my life seeing it was all over the news at the get go.

I picked up a few friends and we left out of Odessa Texas about 8 P.M.  It had been 100 plus degrees all week is why we left in the evening, as it was cooler.  As we got closer to Ft. Stockton, Texas, we could see big thunder storms building up to the south.  We stopped in Ft. Stockton for a few hours,to visit friends and let it clear up some.  We left out of Ft. Stockton about 11 P.M.  We took US385 to Marathon.  There is a road side park about 30 miles out of Ft. Stockton, we had just gone past there.  It was 12 midnight and raining off and on, and thats when we saw it, off in a canyon, about a mile away facing west.  It was a huge dome, the color of a black light, and you could see movement in it.  This dome was the size of a football field, and it was making a crackling sound, like electricity  I was out of the truck and standing by the fence when I realized that you could only see it when the moon was out from behind the clouds.  It was cloudy and misting rain, but I wanted to go see what it was, but everyone else was freaking: they said they were leaving without me ,even though it was my truck.  So we left, went down to the Bend.  Two days later came back the same way and searched and found nothing.  I really wish I had climbed that fence and checked it out.  This was quite a few years ago, and I think most of the people that witnessed it with me have passed on.  I have had a few encounters in my life, that are odd.

That time of year it gets dark quite early, it must of been around 8:00 p.m., ""the times are now just an approximation"". My son, who at the time was around 12 came running in the house saying there was a UFO right outside our house. Let me add at this point I was not one that believed in UFOs. I went outside and my son pointed south and upwards and said look! The funny thing was at first I didn't see anything, but I did notice it was unusually dark, then I noticed a very dim light, I suddenly realized that the reason it was so dark was that there was a huge craft right over our driveway. It blocked all the starlight! It was at tree top level and was moving north at a very slow pace, ""approximately a slow walking speed"". There was a very distinct humming, exactly like a large transformers hums, there was a very dull light in the middle and as it traveled down or driveway I made out a row of windows around the craft, the windows looked very large. I remember walking down the driveway with my son, and then the next thing I remember is standing out in the field north of my house still looking at the UFO, when suddenly it went from approximately 90 or 100 ft straight up in the sky to where it was a pinpoint of light. It just looked like another star. This happened in under a second. We continued to watch it for quite awhile when it took off in a northwesterly direction like a meteor and was gone in a second. There are allot of things I can describe if your interested, but this is the basic part.  I don't feel like I was abducted, but I honestly do not remember how I got from my driveway and then in the field. I ask my son about it and he remembers things the way I do, but what I find unusual is that 1. I didn't really focus on it that much after the initial day it happened until a few years ago. 2. My son doesn't seem as interested as I am, even though he is a very intelligent guy. I have a lot of knowledge regarding aircraft. This will always go down as the most bizarre day in my life. By the way, it seemed like I was being watched by someone in the window, but it was like you could only make out a shadow. I am now fascinated by UFO's and I know that there out there. Almont is about 20 SE of Brown City. I have never seen another unusual craft. This was defiantly a UFO, there is no other explanation for it, I am the type of guy that checks his facts, there is nothing on our planet that I am aware of that could do what I saw! The pilots would be dead just from the G forces.  It surprises me that there have been so many incidences in that area and I never heard about it. From my house to the field was approximately 1000 feet, “you would think that with what was going on, I would remember that sort of distance"". I am not really concerned weather anyone believes me or not, unless it is someone who’s job it is to investigate this sort of thing. They really need to have an open mind and check the facts. The last few years I have gotten increasingly interested in this subject and there have only been a few incidences that I have read about where people have been as close as I was. I guess I am just intrigued. It really fascinates me! The missing time, and it does bother me, when I put into perspective. I can remember everything about the sighting in detail except from the time the craft went from the barn behind my house until I remember standing in the field watching it go from an altitude of 90' to just another star in the sky in the blink of an eye. This is the most significant event in my life and I can't remember just that particular part. I did have dreams afterward about all the neighbors being around looking and me yelling for them all to watch, but its a dream. I have brought it up several times to my son who is really a level headed intelligent guy and he remembers the same way I do, but he for some reason never brings it up himself. I really have to catch myself sometime to really put in perspective the significance about what happened that night. It just amazes the hell out of me. I really do think that somehow my mind was altered to either forget about it, or just not think it was that big a deal. Think about that, how could a person with the knowledge I have about aircraft not act in some way . This was the size of a football field! What it did breaks all laws of physics and for several years I really didn‘t give it that much thought. It is not like me. I had transformers on appliances that started to burn out. I called Detroit Edison and they had to replace all the electric lines and main transformer on the line that followed the driveway right below where the UFO was following. This was within a month of the sighting. I remember the Detroit Edison crews telling me that all the insulation on the wires were gone. I thought that was a bit strange, but since then I have read quite a few articles about sightings near power lines with the same or similar results. I was so close, 90 ft. The funny thing about it was I didn't feel threatened, In a weird way I felt like it was something from our future, as bizarre as that sounds. I feel that we need to have confidence in our instincts; I felt like I was on display and was being watched. One thing I didn't mention and to this day I am not sure why I didn't act, is that I am a professional photographer. What a dummy! the shot of a life time and I didn't even think about it. This is another thing I cant explain, I take my cameras everywhere with me. The first ten years, I would occasionally ask my son if he remembered everything about that night and he would say yes, but not really want to talk about it. It seemed like more of a dream. WHY? Neither my son nor I am the type of person not to act on something so significant, an event of a life time .Another factor about that night was the route the craft was traveling, right down my driveway. My power lines go right down the drive and sometime that winter I had to call Edison out, they told me that the wires were completely bare"" no insulation at all"", and had to replace them, including the transformer. I am not sure if it relates, but I have read stories about these craft using power lines. It's funny, you hear people talk about UFOs and some people will tell you that they have seen one, but you never really stop and give it deep thought because it's a bit hard to fathom the reality about them. I am now a person that can speak the truth about these craft, guess what, you better start polishing your tin foil hat because they are here. Think about all the incidents over the years, especially with all of the NASA sightings, even hovering over the White House. They always have an excuse, a flair, blimp, and the best and most used, a weather balloon. I am sure that a good percentage of reports are something explainable, but I am here to tell you, some aren’t. Sometimes I will think about it and realize that my son and I saw something that would be no less significant than telling your friends you met Jesus Christ. Well, you know what your friends would think. That’s why there are so many people that don't believe, it’s really too big to grasp.

I am 34 years old.  I hold an associate’s degree.  I am also an expert in long-haul transmissions technology with six years of military experience in the communications field.  Prior to my military service, was in project management for five years with a large telecommunications company.  I lived in and around Garland, Texas, from age 5 until I enlisted at age 28. I apologize, as the date and time of my account is only a guess, as it took place over 15 years ago.  However, I estimated the date based on a few facts: I had recently graduated high school in May 1992; it was summer; I was driving an '87 Honda Civic during the incident, a car which I owned at that time.  The time was late evening, an hour or so after sunset. A childhood friend of mine and I were driving SE down what is today President George Bush Toll Way (TX 190) at around 2200.  Today, the area is very built up with shopping malls and restaurants.  But back in 1992, the only building in the area was a high school (my high school).  It was dark and, at the time, there were no street lamps.  As I'm driving, my friend points to the sky through the windshield and tells me to look.  He's pointing straight up through the windshield to a point directly over my car.  And, while it was difficult for me to lean forward over the steering wheel to see what it was he was pointing at, I caught several glimpses of it.  This is what I saw: three reddish hued lights in a triangle configuration, with one brighter light in the very center of the formation.  And, while the sky was dark, the space between the lights was even darker, giving the shape a distinct triangular outline.  Because I was driving, I could only glance at the object for a few seconds at a time before I had to put my eyes back on the road.  It was difficult to tell whether or not the object was moving along with us, or if it was at such an elevation that it appeared motionless from our perspective.  When I would glimpse it, I could tell the object was rotating slowly in a counter-clockwise direction, at an estimated rate of one rotation every 30 seconds.  We were now approaching a stop sign, and I brought the car to a stop. Without speaking, immediately after I stopped, I shut the engine and lights off; we exited the car and stood up in the road to get an unobstructed view.  To our delight, the object was still there, hovering silently.  Now that we were no longer moving, we could tell the object wasn't moving, either.  It was completely stationary (though it continued to rotate in place) and produced absolutely no noise.  As far as the size of the object, it was difficult to estimate.  But I recall that, from my perspective on the ground, the triangle appeared to be about the same size as the shape one can make by touching the thumbs and index fingers of both hands and holding them at arm's length directly overhead (approximately 4"" x 4"" x 4""). We continued to watch the object for another thirty seconds or so when another car began to approach us from the rear.  We quickly hopped back in my car, started it up, and pulled it to the side of the road to make way. As soon as the other car pulled away, we got back out.  But when we looked up at the sky, there was nothing there.  Nothing at all.  No noise, no lights.  Whatever we had been observing only seconds earlier had vanished.  I don't recall ever telling anyone about it, and I don't believe my friend or I ever discussed the incident with each other again after that night.  Of course, we haven't spoken to or seen one another in over ten years. I realize it's been many years since this took place.  In fact, I rarely even think about it.  However, it was several years ago that I first read an article or saw a news report about someone witnessing an object matching the exact description of what I'd seen so long ago.  Since then, I've seen or read many other separate but similar accounts.  And, since I've always been somewhat of a skeptic with regards to UFO sightings, I tried my best to pretend what I'd seen must've been something else...maybe something I would've recognized had it been daylight.  However, ever since that day, when I'm outside at night, I still find myself staring up at the sky, semi-hoping that I might see the same thing again, if for no other reason than to prove to myself that whatever I saw actually does exist. Though I still remain skeptical, I felt I should at least contribute my experience so as to at least add my account to the collection of other similar sightings.  Skeptic or not, I saw what I saw.

The dot moved VERY quickly and was unlike anything I had seen before.  I went inside to ask my wife to come out and look to see if she could see anything.  I then looked through the eyepiece again and an object that appeared to be the same, moved at the same speed in the exact opposite direction (a reciprocal heading).

A Solid Black Craft..... On the 9th of March, 1995, around 3 PM, I was sitting in the kitchen of my home drinking coffee and savouring the impressive view of the north shore mountains that border the city of Vancouver. Suddenly my attention was drawn to a triangular formation of three dark objects slowly approaching from a valley in the distance. Taking somewhere between 5 - 10 minutes to approach my location. As they did, two of the objects moved away to the east along the mountain range, the third coming to a halt almost directly in front of where I had now relocated myself on the verandah. I rememberd a camera in the house that had a telephoto lens so I ran in and got it and proceeded to note further details through the lens. In the clear blue sky the black craft had 2 distinct ""bumps"" on the upper surface, and though apparently stationary, was clearly rotating.It was so black no shadows on the craft at all. Not only was I awestruck , but also scared, though not quite sure why. At this point the UFO appeared to be the size of a dollar coin (Loony) held at arm's length. At no time during the lengthy observation did the craft reflect light from the brilliant sunshine. It was later assumed that as the object was visually just below the height of the distant snowline, then its altitude could have been around 3000 feet or less. No accompanying sound was heard. Suddenly realizing additional witnesses were close by, I called out to them and I was joined by 5 others. This group watched the craft through binoculars. It wasn't until the object began to move away to the west did I realize that the camera was not empty and had only 1 picture to take left on it!!  Trying to time a profile shot befor it got too far ..being unaware that all three UFOs were within the view finder I snapped a shot of it and when I got the photo back I could see all 3 in the shot.

I have finally decided to post this sighting after years of debate and finally choosing your site as a safe place to record this information.  Hopefully, others will file their report as well. My friends and I were having a BBQ in the backyard of my friends house during what i remember sometime in July of 1993.  I heard someone say, 'look up' and to my amazement I saw a row or a line of 5-6 off white lights, that would change to red, blue, green colors in a non-synchronized way.  This line of lights were closely linked together at roughly 1,000 ft above the Palouse on the edge of Moscow, ID about 1-2 miles from my position moving silently & slowly East to West.  At first, I thought what I was seeing was a very large plane with lights arranged along the wings but then i realized that planes would not be moving so slowly and I also heard no sound whatsoever. We saw a series of ~5-6 lights lined up in an edge straight row at what i would estimate around 1,000 feet above ground. The lights moved in unison, silent and moving slowly from East to West. It also appeared that the line of lights rotated together slightly around on a center axis as the entire object headed West. It had a slight aura and very subtle vibration as it moved over the town of Moscow to the West.  My friends and I saw this but we didn't contact anyone because we didn't know who to contact. It is possible that it could of been a military craft but my friends and I saw something very unusual indeed. I hope that this information is somehow useful.

While looking out towards the Atlantic Ocean, coast line began roughly ½ mile in distance from where we stood, I noticed a quasi orange/amber light very thin, and rough 1 inch wide (from my perspective) slowly flying from the south parallel to the coast line, then do a zigzag and dart off north. My initial thought was that this was a shooting star based on what I have seen in the past.  Also the shape of the object was very similar to a shooting star as well.  The thing that really caught my eye was at the slow speed it traveled.  Most shooting stars are gone in a flash not too mention the altitude of the object was in our atmosphere, not outside.  Once I noticed how abnormal it was I then brought the object to the attention of my friend to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating.

Between my home and Powhite Parkway I saw 2 ""shooting stars"".  I was the only vehicle at that time of morning approaching the 75 cent Powhite Parkway toll plaza headed north bound (there was only 1 or 2 cars headed southbound).  As I was slowing down to drive through the Smart Tag lane at the toll plaza, I glanced in my rear view mirror and saw a glowing oval shaped orange light right smack dab in the middle of the back glass of my minivan (on the outside).  As soon as I noticed it, it zipped off to the right (passenger side) out of sight.  My first thought was that I had almost been rear ended and in just a split second I was thinking ""But HOW?  I'm the only vehicle out here.""  I even drove slowly through the toll plaza looking to my right for the vehicle that I thought had almost hit me and saw nothing.  I was the only vehicle.  As I continued on down the road, I was wondering what the heck I'd just seen and was arguing logic in my mind.  The orange light had the shape almost of a vehicles parking light, but for a vehicle to have it's parking light that high up at my back glass, the other vehicle would have had to have been higher than me (and I think I would have seen that).  I also started noticing the parking lights on other vehicles and all car lights (other than headlights) have that black grid pattern thing within the light, so you do not see just pure orange or pure red, you also can detect the black grid within too.  THe light that I saw was not light that.  I may have only seen it for a few seconds, but I remember it clearly.  It was a pure orange/red light and when it ""zipped"" to the right, it seemed to have a light trail.  I was talking about the ""weird"" thing that I saw when I got into work and someone pointed out that we were supposed to have had a meteor shower yesterday moring before dawn.  Yes, that can account for the 2 ""falling stars"" I saw on my way to the tool booth, but I don'! t think a falling meteor would ""hover"" at the middle of the back glass of a minivan and then zoom off to the right (in a straight horizontal line, I might add).  I am just baffled by what I saw.  I drove through there again this morning paying close attention to the possibility of any orangish lights around the toll plaza that may have caused a reflection of some sort.  There are NO orange lights that close to the toll plaza.  Well, at least my husband and my parents DON'T think I'm crazy because they agree that it just does not make sense.  I only wish that my 7 1/2 month old son could talk and tell me what he saw.  He was in his carseat facing toward the back glass.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,37.375834640522875,-77.6171705882353

My father (recently discharged from the Army) viewed the behavior and maneuvering of the aircraft as unusual. Multiple people in our neighborhood were out in the evening viewing the aircraft with a collective uneasiness bordering on panic. Real-time media reports (radio & TV) followed the incident. The local paper had front page coverage, with photographs, the next day. Less clear memories include recollection of the unidentified aircraft hovering and/or landing at the airport and of military aircraft in pursuit (roar of jet engines and visible identification of military aircraft separate from unidentified aircraft). The timeframe for the sighting is only approximate, but -must- have occurred prior to the fall of 1966.

She started barking incessantly after a few minutes.  When I went to let her back in I saw that the home behind (and 4 doors down from) my parents home was encased in a bright white light.  The light was very strange in that I could not identify the source.  However, it reminded me of looking at a football field lit up for a night game -- the light is directed squarely on the field but darkness surrounds the field.  This is how the light behaved that shined on the house (and only that house and it's yard).  The light was much whiter and much brighter than what would be achieved by floodlights.  Furthermore, a band of relatively large colored balls of light surrounded the home itself.  To borrow from another analogy, it looked like a band of Christmas lights surrounding the home.  However, these lights were much, much larger than Christmas lights (about the size of a fist at arms distance).  The colored lights were bobbing up and down slightly.  I remember seeing red, blue, and possibly green lights.  No yellow color.  There was no sound other than my dog incessantly barking directly at this home.  The sighting lasted about 35 seconds (from the time I saw the white light), and suddenly the white light 'turned off'.  The colored lights remained around the home.  Therefore, the white light was 35 seconds in duration (but I caught it after it was first present), and the colored lights lasted much longer.  It was very late, and very cold in Michigan, and I therefore did not go outside to investigate further after the white light 'turned off'.  I am making this report because the light, in my opinion, were absolutely not floodlights or 'party' lights, and the source of the white light was far above the house & yard (but I did not see a 'craft').",2009-03-19T00:00:00,42.580552607709755,-83.03164308390024

I was outside on my sidewalk having a cigarette, when I happened to notice a very bright light flying to the east. I assumed this was just a plane landing at Harrisburg International Airport (KMDT), as my house is more or less on the approach to runway 13 there.  I paid little attention to it until it drew a little closer, when I realized that it was not one landing light, but about nine of them arranged in a huge triad formation. Above these lights were a pair of ICAO standard recognition/nav lights, moving with the landing lights. Actual assessment of the size of this object was difficult, as it was dark, and the low amount of noise it made would indicate it was quite high. The faint and indistinct noise signature makes it seem all the bigger, as visually it seemed gigantic.  It continued flying an easterly course a ways south of my house, until it disappeared from view. It did not seem to be moving particularly fast, certainately no faster than a commercial airliner. It made no sudden or erratic movements, and it's behavior seemed consistent with known laws of aerodynamics. This, combined with the fact that it had operating recognition lights, makes me certain it was terrestrial in origin, yet the sheer size of it makes it hard for me to explain.  I also have some background information about me that is relevant. I am a rather large aviation buff, and I am taking flight lessons at the Lancaster, PA airport (KLNS). I have a total of sixteen hours logged, all in an Evektor Sportstar light-sport aircraft.

I viewed the object while driving about 40 mph and viewed it for  about 10 seconds from first sighting it, to passing under it. The object had no lights and was the size of a basketball. Curiously the street lights had been out. The object was not difficult to see since my headlights illuminated the area. The object (metallic) had a raised band around the middle and 3/4 of the way up it had what appeared to be a round port or eye. The object was positioned right near a power line that stretched  perpendicular to the road which was two lanes. This object seemed like some type of probe. This was kind of bone chilling when you see something that close! It is my opinion that an invasion is taking place. I have seen too many this past year, and continue to hear and read of many reports around the world. Coincidently, Florida, or at least my area, experiences a high number of power outages. One occurred in the State which made the news shortly after my sighting. It was reported as of unknown cause and was being investigated. My background is as follows.

((sic.  January 23))  We were coming back down Kellers Church Road which is the road that runs directly behind my house.  Before making a left into my development, we noticed two distinct lights in the distance.  It was 5:59 PM because my brother had called his friend Matt right when we noticed it.  We initially thought it was a plane that was making an emergency landing or crashing because it was so low to the ground.  From where we were, I would say we were only a mile or two away from this object.  So, before we turned into my neighborhood we decided to continue down Kellers Church to figure out what this object was.  We went over a small bridge, went around a bend on the left and then another on the right where Scott Road and Kellers Church Road meets.  We went through a set of woods, and in the middle of it was a clearing.  In that clearing we saw an unidentifiable object which all of us had never seen anything like it before. We were SW of the object, and it was directly above the tree line, just sitting there hovering.  It could have not have been anymore than 150 ft. above the tree line, which is incredibly low.  We decided to come to a stop to try to figure out what this object was.  It appeared to have a diamond shape, with four lights on each angle.  There was an obvious dominant light on the front of the craft.  My brother tried to make out a video of the object using my camera phone for about 30 seconds, but nothing appeared on the screen.  My brother and his girlfriend’s sister both felt the object had recognized that we were in its presence. The front light then appeared to be shifting towards us.  My brother immediately told his girlfriend to please go, because none of us knew what this object was capable of.  She hit the gas and we proceeded through the rest of the wooded area.  We kept an eye on the bright light as we traveled in a circle so we could return.  As we were driving I turned arou! nd and c learly saw a spherical dome shape structure on top of the diamond that stood still, while the body was still shifting.  We went up the hill which led to a connecting road.  We made a right and continued to try and follow the object, but by the time we were back to our original location, which could have only been 5 minutes max, the object was out of sight.  We couldn’t find it anywhere.  The only thing we could see above were normal blinking, red tinted planes.  It was nothing we couldn’t identify normally.  This was something that none of us in the car had ever seen in our entire lives.  The engine also did not have any sound.

The atmospheric condition was partly cloudy. We had already started our descent and were probably about 3-4 miles up.  At approximately 18:30, about 30 minutes before we landed at LAX, I spotted a spherical metallic-looking object moving at approximately 150-400 mph either west-east or sw-ne about 1-2 miles above the ground, moving the exact opposite direction of the plane about a half mile to the south. It was about the size of a golf ball from about 100 yards.  ((sic--100 feet.)   I first spotted it at about 11:00 (direction, not time), and I was only able to view it for about 2-3 seconds before it disappeared from view. I didn’t notice any lights on the object, but it was reflecting the sun which was low in the wsw which caused it to appear bright copper. I didn’t notice any other physical features such as wings or a tail, and it didn’t leave an exhaust stream.  I’m 52 years old, and have been an amateur astronomer since I was a young child.  In my life, I’ve seen just about anything you can think of in the sky, but never before last night have I ever seen an object that I could not identify.  I’ve probably made over 40 cross-country flights, and am used to seeing planes and helicopters, but the object I saw last night didn’t resemble anything I’ve ever seen. Maybe it has a non-UFO explanation, but I decided to post the incident anyhow in hopes that someone else may have seen the object.

The lights were there for roughly 20 min when fighter jets came from the southwest and the lights moved away in remarkable speed. As the jets passed by and left the lights came back in the same triangle formation. My wife stated the local news caught footage of this, and did identify them as UFO's. A day later they came back with the same story and apologized to the people for the misunderstanding of the report, and stated the military was conducting weather experiments. I would like to know if anyone else witnessed this. Thank you.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-08-12T00:00:00,31.7923281835206,-106.3748488764045

We watched it fly smoothly out of sight in maybe 40 seconds. I was shocked and fascinated to see something so strange but my wife thought it was just some kind of military plane. At that time I believed there could not be such things as ET craft, decided she must be right about it being a plane and mostly forgot about it. I always felt that was quite an under reaction on her part.

I would like to inform you of a sighting that I had in the late 90’s and never reported (I did not know your organization existed).   The reason I am contacting you now is that, last night, Wed 07/09/08, I was watching the UFO Files on the tube and was shocked beyond belief at what I saw.  The program was describing a sighting that took place in the 1600’s or 1700’s by the crew of a sailing vessel.  The object in the animation, that was built from the written accounts of the sighting was exactly what I saw one afternoon in San Juan Puerto Rico.  I was doing a preflight inspection of my aircraft and while walking around the nose of the aircraft I saw an object ascend from a swampy area just off the concrete area of the apron, approx. 150 yards.  The object was a very shiny blue with the color slightly darker toward the top and a little lighter toward the bottom.  What caught my attention at first was it was a perfect sphere.  It rose slowly at first going straight up to a height of about 200 to 300 feet.  It stopped just for a second then slowly started moving in the direction of the city, toward the west.  As it moved it appeared to gain altitude slightly and veer a little then it gained speed until it was over the town.  At that point it went straight up at a very fast pace.  I lost sight of the object at that point.  Except for the slight veering it did while moving from my location to town all changes in direction were at right angles. Also it made now sound that I could hear. Why I thought this was not some natural object was because of it’s color, exact shape and right angle movements.  The object itself was exactly like what was described on the UFO Files last night.   What also is fascinating to me is that the object from my sighting and the sighting I reference is 300 years or more apart.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

This is near where the film Eddie and Crusers had taken place.  Anyway we were standing on the porch with a view of about 10-20 miles across the marshland when I noticed a strange light in the distance. I didn't pay attention to it at first we went inside for a few minutes came out and noticed this object was much larger as it had gotten closer and was spinning brilliantly.   Iam ex military and very familiar with aircraft and thought for a minute it was a blimp because there was a football field not to far from there and I could see the flood lights from the game but then noticed how large this object was.  I knew how far we were from the football field and the distance between us on the barrier island and the mainland which is where this object was, was about 7-10 miles.  It was hovering, spinning horizontaly, the best description is a Faberge Egg, multiple colors, each set of lights was spinning independently, in the opposite direction of each other. This object was over the marshland where there is nothing, no houses just some waterways. This object appeared to be about a mile or so from the mainland and 200 feet in the air. A safe guess would be to say it was slightly larger then a dump truck.  This event has been burned into my memory for a very long time and I can still visualy I guess, remember it.  Suddenly it just dissapeared.  My friend observed the same thing as well.  There is one small airport just outside of atlantic city probably 10 - 15 miles from the object and a commercial airport (atlantic city international) along with the FAA tech center with a Air Guard unit.  Also, a note...I heard no jet engines as they typically flew during the day over the ocean I do not believe their flight path goes over this area.

Two other craft in the vicinity were behaving the same way. We assume to this day that it was military experimental craft.  My dad is convinced that they were airplanes, and that's how my brother and I interpreted the craft at that time.  Thinking back, perhaps we processed these as airplanes only because we had no other exemplar to choose from.  I'd say that the craft were definitely the size of military airplanes, and they moved at a similar speed as airplanes, but I can't say that I know that they had wings like an airplane.  I assume they did have wings, only because we didn't make a mental note that they looked any different than airplanes.  The crafts were unlike average airplanes in that they seemed to communicate with each other in a unique way, spitting out these pillars of smoke and then randomly following them.

My experience happened in 1999. October or November of 1999 to be exact. I never reported it before because I never really told anyone about it before. I thought people would think I was crazy for claiming I saw a UFO. To this day, even though I saw one, and I know what I saw, I don't believe anyone when they say they've seen one. That being said, here is my experience. I was living in Raleigh, North Carolina. My job was in Rocky Mount, North Carolina NE of Raleigh. This night I was driving to Rocky Mount to stay at my parents house because I had to wake up really early the next morning. Since I was going to be in town a friend and I decided to get some dinner. I was driving to the restaurant on highway 64 going east. I had just passed the Nashville exit when I saw a long, thin yellowish-orange light just above the tree line. It was insanely bright and perfectly still in the air. It looked to be about three or four football fields long. Maybe even longer. I seemed to be about 10 miles from it so I knew this thing was huge. I watched it as I drove down the highway occasionally losing it behind some trees as the highway curved. The whole I was watching this thing and driving, I ran down a list of things it could possibly be. The list included a blimp, which it couldn't have been because it was too big and perfectly still, it wasn't the hospital that I was going to be passing because it was to high in the air and the hospital is the tallest building in Rocky Mount but not that tall, and I was absolutely certain it wasn't a plane. It was to big, to bright, and motionless. The last time I lost it behind some trees was the last time I saw it. I must have had my view of it blocked for 10 or 15 seconds maximum, but when the part of the sky it was in came into view again it was gone. I would have seen it fly away but didn't. In a matter of seconds I was under where it was floating on a clear sky so I would have seen it if it was still there but turned the lights off. I pulled over at the exit, again, pretty much right underneath where it was. I was looking up and noticed to small, fast moving planes flying in from the SE. These were obviously fighter jets flying in formation from, I am assuming, Cherry Point, which is an Air Force base SE of Rocky Mount. The two jets circled, in formation, pretty much in the same spot the object was and flew away, back toward the SE. I rolled my window up, put the car in gear, went to dinner and haven't spoken much of it since.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,35.95475538461538,-77.83203846153847

It was moving smoothly and steadily across and in a v-shape.  There were these light sorts of hazy amber lights.  I tried to count as they flew over my head--it looked like 6 lights and I couldn’t determine how far away they were, but I was so enamored, that I realized I wasn’t even breathing.  I watched as it continued to fly in a SE direction and then it disappeared.  I looked around for someone else to witness but it was too late. So, then I called my mother on my cell phone to tell her what I saw.  As I was speaking to her another one appeared so I got of the phone and ran to my neighbors.  It more or less was heading in the same direction as the last one.  By the time my neighbor got outside it was gone.  Of course, I was thinking to myself, ""I must have a witness or people are going to think I’m loosing it.""   Well, we waited a few minutes but we didn’t see anything.  I asked my neighbor if he’s ever seen a UFO and he said ‘Actually, yes about 30 years ago I was with my young sons and I pulled over to look at my car’s engine at night and they noticed a flying object that was flying sporadically and not like an aircraft at all.’   So, after that I went inside.  But decided to go to my other neighbors who has a roof top deck. We all went on the deck and I thought to myself, what are the chances we’ll see something else.  About 10 – 15 minutes went by and the same amber triangular lights appeared from the Northwest.  This time they were closer than the two other times.  They flew right over our heads!  5 lights total in a very tight v-shape absolutely silent and the lights looked like two equal lines in a cross shape.  My neighbor’s mouths just dropped open.  None of us could utter a word and then, like the others, it disappeared to the SE direction. We all shared what we witnessed then just a couple minutes later and shooting star/meteor looking bright light shot over our heads and fizzed out.   After that we didn’t see anything else.  Quite remarkable.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,33.8622,-118.3995

This light that I saw in the sky, which I first mistook for the Northern Star, was, to me, shaped like a star, just a speck of light, so bright, its like the Northern Star amplified times 10.  Even behind black clouds, I can see this light, a trait I have never before witnessed in any object in the sky. It would sit in the sky, completely stationary, for a while, about 30 minutes or so, then it would slowly move.. the most amazing thing to me is when it actually starts moving, all over the place.  It moves seemingly closer to me, or further. This may be the light glowing stronger or weaker, because the light would, after about an hour, begin to dim slowly.  It would dim, and re-light a little bit when it was out, then move more, and stop again, when the light was out, I could no longer see it. The even more amazing thing is, I think I saw the SAME OBJECT IN THE SKY TODAY, which makes me think that it might be a plane or something, using a clock, coming back every day, I do not know for how many days this has been going on.  I started at it the second day today, and it did the exact same thing as yesterday.. it was the most eerie thing I have ever seen in the sky.

Unusually low on horizon. Maneuvered like a jet/airplane cannot, hovered in air very close to my location. It was around 10:30pm and I was taking my dogs for a walk down the street. As I turned the corner to take my dogs to their favorite spot I noticed that in the clearing in the trees to the south at the end of the street, there were 2 very bright, crystal white stars sitting unusually low on the horizon line. One sitting significantly lower than the other, and slighty to the right.  As I continued to look I noticed that they had a reddish tinge to them at times so I thought they could be planets, but still very strange. I looked away for a moment to let my dogs go to the bathroom then looked back up at the objects. When I looked back up it appeared as if the lower of the two objects might have possibly been moving upward a bit, but the movement was so miniscule I thought my eyes were just playing tricks on me. That’s when the object sped up and began weaving from left to right in an upwardly fashion. This was when I first realized I was seeing something very ou! t of the ordinary.  The object continued to weave upward until in was parallel with the higher object. At that point seemingly stopped moving completely, but started getting brighter.  I realized then that it hadn’t stopped moving but was instead moving straight toward me. It was headed due north. I was frozen in place so I stood and watched as the object got so close that it seemed to be just right down the street I was standing on, maybe a couple miles in the sky, if that.  I stood there, dumbfounded for a solid 30 seconds, then a car came down the road. I stood in front of the car and tried to get him to stop so he could witness this too, but after a few honks of his horn I realized he wasn’t going to be cooperating with me. So he passed by and I continued standing there staring at this mysterious light hovering so conspicuously in the sky wondering if anyone else was seeing it. After a stare-down with the object for about another minute I began walking away keeping my head! cocked over my shoulder, making sure not to take my eyes off ! of the l ight. The very second that I started walking, the object followed. I walked about 50 feet then turned my body around. The light stopped moving as well and at that point I yelled, very loudly, 	“What do you want?” 	No response of course. 	So began another stand-off. After what seemed like about a minute I began walking away again, and once again the mysterious floating light followed. But this time after about 25 feet it began to ascend and head north east, gaining incredible speed in a very short time. It took about 10 seconds for it to completely disappear from sight, but as it passed by the moon I saw that it left a strange looking trail. The trail looked misty and translucent, but also unusually linear (unlike a jet, whose exhaust billows out of the back of the craft, and spreads out almost immediately). It also made a very low, faint humming noise that I had not noticed until it passed overhead. After the object disappeared  I looked back to the south to see if the other light was still there. It wasn’t. So I quickly scanned the sky looking to see if it had moved. When I turned to the north, in the exact opposite direction I had originally seen the objects, I spotted another light, but this one quickly ! shot up, then back down and out of sight behind a dense patch of trees. I then ran home and told my whole family. Theres no doubt in my mind that what I saw was not of this world. Whatever this technology was is far too advanced for anything I’ve ever heard of or seen besides the only obvious explanation. Aliens?

I looked up and noticed two stars as bright and large as Jupiter about 15 to 20 degrees above the SSE horizon, and asked ""where did those stars come from?""  They were about 1-2 degrees apart, somewhat more than the distance between the stars/nebula in Orion's belt. My partner asked if they were moving - and I could see they were moving in parallel in a southerly direction, when tracked against another nearby star. They remained bright for another minute or two, then gradually dimmed in unison, and disappeared.  They appeared to be objects at high altitude, picking up the sun's reflection, and large enough to resemble Jupiter (not small like a satellite). There were no blinking lights and no indication the objects were lighted themselves, just brightly reflecting the sun's light.  If sighted by anyone else, these objects may be reported as flying over north central New Mexico.  I suppose they could have been two airplanes flying in tandem at very high altitude, both brightly reflecting the late sun rays, but it would have been unusual to see two commercial planes flying in the same direction so close to each other.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,37.42148,-107.85291833333333

I could not see any big body attached to the lights. But when the lights went out I could see an object behind it, but I could not make it out. It was getting dark outside. Two of them split from the pack and headed more west at the same time of 4 more coming back into view. But I did get pictures and I will take in the camera and get them developed tomorrow. 25 minutes from seeing the first one the Air Force had 3 planes circling the area we seen all the UFO’s. They where not any air craft that I see every day, and that light that is was putting out was high in the sky. It was not any flares, and it was not coming from any type of air craft we have. I have lived by the Air Force base for a total of 10 years. And right by the Air Port for as many years.

Myself and two friends were coming home from the county fair and riding in a truck together in the front cab. The oldest friend was driving the truck; next oldest friend was riding in the passenger seat, and me (youngest) was sitting in the middle.  Arrived in front of my house in a small community called Wolf Creek, and my friend opened the passenger door and got out of the truck so I could get out. I lived out in the country and there was a small farm across the road from my house with a pasture and a hillside. Upon exiting the truck, I noticed a large object hovering about 8 feet above the ground that had a fireball appearance. This was only about 75 yards from us. Both my friends saw the same thing. There was a very low hissing type of sound coming from the object. At first, we thought is was a tall bush burning, but there were no bushes there to burn, and obviously none that would be 8 feet tall. After watching the fireball object for about a minute, the! large object started slowly rising up toward the sky and then shot up in the sky at a very high rate of speed. The night was very clear and one could see every star in the sky on that night. Not a cloud anywhere. After the large fireball reached, what appeared to be the edge of earth's atmosphere, it split into two with a slightly smaller fireball now trailing right behind it. Almost immediately after that, the trailing fireball split into two and there were 3 fireballs streaking toward space.  Each fireball disappeared from sight as it reached far enough out in space to be out of sight.  I have told very few people about this incident and am not sure if my friends have told anybody as I have not seen them in a very long time.  I no longer live in Spring City and now live in Ashland City, TN which is just north of Nashville, TN.  We all had no doubt that this was some sort of craft from somewhere other than this planet.  Since then, I have thought about this incident many times in an attempt to define what this craft may have been.  Not sure if it was some sort of major alien craft, but feel now that it could very likely have been some sort of probe sent here from another craft in space.  But that's just speculation.  I do, however, know that this was not something man made, and that there was no one at the observation site other than the 3 of us.  I have no further information to disclose regarding this sighting.

Event Location: On Farm about 1 mile North of Cowley, Wyoming  I was 27 years old, mother of  three small children.  I was sleeping and began dreaming of an airplane, it was flying closer as the sound grew louder until it flew through the window.  The dream was so real, it startled me fully awake, then slowly coming to the realization the sound was still there.  From our farm looking west, B-52 bombers could frequently be seen flying quite low in a north-south direction.  What I was hearing was consistent with a large group of low flying heavy bombers directly over our house going East to West. I went outside and stood on the steps looking up and to the west.  It was a moonless night and the only lights were the millions of stars seen in the clear Wyoming skies.  I could detect a smooth flying motion overhead moving west, and the sound remained a constant deep droning/humming sound.  I continued to watch still thinking it was a large number of large airplanes, but I was curious why they would be flying in such close formation so late at night and in the middle of nowhere. It was unusual, but thought they must be moving a fleet to the West Coast following the end of the Vietnam War. I wondered how many there were as I could not distinguish individual shapes, so I began looking intently for indications of wings and lights that should be at least on the tips.  I could detect no wings, no lights, no silhouette of a wing shape.  All the while the massive  object continued slowly on its westerly trajectory.  There were no lights either on the craft or in our yard to help illuminate to assist in giving a better indication of size, color, material, shape, and distance. As I continued to watch, a portal came into view.  It was in the underside of the craft and illuminated with a soft florescent light.  Over the years, my memory has become a little fuzzy on whether the color was green or blue, but it was a very pleasing color to the eye, not harsh and I lean to it being a pretty blue florescent.  The light made it easy for me to clearly see inside the portal. What I saw was an immaculate mechanical room.  There was what looked like a large boiler with pipes connected to it.  Everything was the same color, but the shapes were very distinct and familiar.  Very Earthly.  I continued to watch as the portal slowly moved out of sight.  It was interesting that the light was obviously very bright and illuminated a large room, but did not extend outside the craft.  After the portal passed from view, I could no longer detect where the portal was.  There was no glow of light emanating from beneath the craft.  I continued to watch, and after a few moments another portal came into view.  The light was the same and the room’s contents appeared to be identical to the first room seen.  Another mechanical room, with an identical “boiler” and connecting pipes.  Everything I could see appeared identical to the first portal. I continued to watch trying to see any details that might be visible, but it was so dark the shape was determined more by the absence of the stars.  It was long and cylindrical, there were no sharp edges.  I had a clear view to the West for about 15 to 20 miles.  The craft was so close it shut out all of the night sky as I looked north and most of the night sky as I looked west.  It was very low, but not able to determine exactly how low, and traveling very slow, but not able to indicate how slow except that I was able to get a very good look inside the portals.  So, maybe between 5 to 15 MPH.  Again, there was never a change in the sound, it was a continuous deep, humming or droning sound.  I never changed my opinion about it being consistent with large airplanes flying over head.  It was flying level in a true East to West direction.  I never saw the beginning or end of the craft.  What I did see was larger than a football field, but did not see the craft in its entirety. ! There were no unusual odors, no unusual wind movement, and there was no disturbance of animals (cattle, dogs, etc.) that I was aware of.  Everything was silent except the sound indicated. I started to become uneasy, even a little frightened and decided to go back inside.  My children were sleeping and I was just beginning to understand that what I had been watching was very extraordinary and there was nothing in my reference that explained it.  I sat quietly in the living room, did not turn on any lights to look at a clock, and just waited for it to pass. I did not look out the window, I did not want to do anything to bring attention to myself, our home, my family.  I continued to hear the sound for sometime after I went back inside and was relieved when the sound finally ceased.   I do not remember that the sound faded away as planes would as they went into the distance, rather it just stopped and became quiet.  I do not know the total duration, but it was several minutes from the time I first became aware of the sound in a fully conscious state to when it finally ceased. I did not tell anyone about this experience until some years later.   I looked for something that would explain what I had seen in logical terms.  I married a retired Air Force Pilot with thousands of hours flying time and over 4 millions air miles.  We attended many military air shows together, and I would look for anything that resembled what I had seen.    Over the years I never saw anything remotely like what I had seen years earlier.  My husband Bill was the first person related my experience to, followed by my children after they were grown.  I have also since told a couple of my siblings.  I told my brother after he related an experience he and my mother had with light orbs following them on a deserted highway traveling late one night in Wyoming. This is the experience I had as I remember it and choosing to report it officially while the details are clear.  It occurred on a moonless summer night, approximately 27 July 1976, probably after midnight.   I am positive of the year, the month was most likely July, but may have also been June.  My young brother was in the hospital in Billings Montana when this occurred.  The window of possibility is indicated below. New Moon in May 1976 - 29th  - 1st Quarter June 5th New Moon in June 1976 - 27th  - 1st Quarter July 4th New Moon in July 1976  - 29th  - 1st Quarter Aug 2nd   Credibility Factor:  I was 27 years old at the time of the occurrence with 3 small children.  I remarried a Air Force officer and pilot with a distinguished career.  I am a college graduate with High Honors.  My career was in finance, accounting and government finance. My work titles were Assistant Treasurer for a local large municipality and Executive Director of a Consortium of Cities and Counties where I managed Millions of $$ in Federal Funds, and Management Analyst.  I have been a long time contributing member of my community and believe, well respected. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2010-02-14T00:00:00,44.8833,-108.4696

It was fairly well-known at this time and in this area, that on many nights one could go outdoors and watch UFOs move in a variety of formations.  The ""light"" of each craft would vary from nearly invisible to extremely bright.  The objects were obviously many miles away, most estimates are that the objects had to have been in Huntsville and very likely above the Redstone Arsenal. Entire families and friends would gather on the back porch to watch the UFOs move in wildly varying ""formations"" if that term fits.  They would move up and down, circle one another, zoom back and forth, and generally each sighting event ended with the lights either disappearing or zooming directly up and out of the atmosphere. The individuals who observed the UFOs varied from a preacher, to housewives, to a retired WWII-Korea-Vietnam combat veteran (101st Airborne, winner of the Silver Star, etc.), and several then-enlisted Army and National Guard members.  These individuals were all very serious people who did not care for watching science fiction films, reading about UFOs, or even speculating about life on other planets.  These individuals would all be willing to testify under oath that what they observed were NOT airplanes nor any other form of then-known/conventional aircraft.

The object then began to emit a louder humming tone and began to tilt from a horizontal position to a vertical position.  Then the object lifted up and out of sight in a very rapid fashion.  There was no wind, no heat, no radiation burns, no known magnetic effects, no effect on the vehicle or any other objects around the vicinity.

It wasn't too late, being a school night.   From a distance, my mother and I thought that it was a blimp preparing for an emergency landing.  When we drove closer, we realized it was actually two ships.  They were larger than cars, maybe 15 or 20 feet radius.  They looked like what you would see in a Hollywood movie: disk-like or saucer shaped.  The center seemed more spherical.  They reminded me of pewter or stainless steel - a dull shine.  There were lights going around the outer edge, although now, we can not agree on the color.  The lights did not shine down on anything.  I didn't see any seams, doors or windows.  I remember getting out of the car and thinking that it was all true...all the reports that had been made at that time of sightings in our city.  The two ships were just above the two-story homes in the neighborhood.  They made no sound.  I remember only hearing the strange buzz of our street lamp.  It seemed like one ship was following the other, just above our street, just above roof level.   At first, I got the impression that they were trying to hide from us...they went down one street, them came back into our view...maybe they knew we saw them and came for a closer look at us.   I had run into the house and got my father, then the three of us were now out standing on our front lawn with our dog. The two ships slowly rotated, or maybe the lights were revolving around their perimeter. I took a step forward, thinking I would be one of the first humans to meet these visitors...but my father said, ""Stay right where you are.""  And being only 13, I did.  I wasn't afraid, but the tone in my father's voice scared me.  We watched as the ships slowly went down the street, one following the other.  They were over the elementary school I had attended, and for a moment I thought that perhaps they would land there.  But the leader seemed to move forward - like a slight pull or jerk - and then shot off to the right with a streak! of white light.  The the second one did the same thing.  They were gone.   We went into the house with our groceries, and I wanted to call the newspaper, or maybe the police...My mother looked very concerned and my father just said no.  He didn't want anyone to think that we were a bunch of nuts.   The next day, at school, I told my science teacher what I had seen.  He listened respectfully, since I wasn't the type of kid to be speaking up and never known to lie.  After a few minutes I kept asking him what could fly like that, without sound or air movement or anything...just gliding along like a boat on water.  Of course he said there wasn't anything and then I could tell he didn't believe me and some of my friends were looking at me kind of funny....so, I knew what my father meant...""Some kind of nut.""   But it really happened and it certainly peaked my interest in science, especially astronomy.  I now teach Math and Science courses at the high school level.  I tell my story to my students....but only on Halloween and April Fool's Day....after all, I don't want them or my principal thinking I'm some kind of nut.

I continued to watch the light until it faded away. The light did bob in the air and I guess it to have been ten to fifteen miles away.  While watching the light, I saw two air craft fly past the light, although the air craft appeared to be further away from me.  The size of the light was difficult to determine given the distance although it did appear to be as large as a normal commercial plane, although the light was very bright, brighter than what I would expect to see and have seen in the past on commercial planes.  I did not see any wings, flashing lights or any other indicator that would have made me think it was a plane, besides the fact it remained in the same place for about 30 minutes.

The light was visible just over the trees and as stated previously, much lower than any aircraft I have seen in the past. I attempted to contact the Naval Air Station and the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, both to no avail.

It then hovered for about 5 seconds then went straight down towards the ground out of my sight.  We proceeded on up the road to a hill top at which time we stopped the vehicle and got out and looked and from there you could see an object on the ground that had alot of bright light around it with a redish light or glow on the top. This object was out in a field somewhat near the forest line. From the distance we was from the object it was hard to get a good look at the object other than to see there was a good deal of light around the object. We was too far away to determine if there was anyone around the object but there was no noise to be heard from the location we stopped in. At that time we proceeded to continue our drive back into Dixon but the event occured over a period of about 4 minutes from the time i first spotted the object until the time we drove off.

It followed a straight-line trajectory at a fixed altitude which did not seem very high at a comparatively high speed. It was clearly breaking the usual observation pattern for a plane: if you´re not close to an airport, a plane looks small and if it´s night time, then you see one light fixed and a couple of another ones blinking, all flying slow. In this case it was only one light much bigger than one of a plane flying at a considerable distance away and even bigger than lights of the sea ships sailing along the Malecón at a prudent distance for a while before entering Havana Bay. At the same time the speed of the movement of the light was much higher than the speed usually observable for a plane, although it did not cross the sky in a single moment. Given that it was night time, it was impossible to see the shape of the carrier of the light, but given all the described above it was leaving the impression of being something small flying at an altitude, let´s say, below heaviest rain clouds. Given straight-line trajectory and fixed altitude it was DEFINITEVELY not a meteorite, but something piloted or directed (although who knows, not necesserily extra-terrestrial). I saw it when it was already flying along the Malecón from the Bay to the West of the City, then it disappeared behind the roof of my building and I ran to the hall trying to see it from the other side. And I did. Around U.S. Interest Section the Malecon makes a slight turn, but the light kept flying straight becoming each smaller and weaker until disappearing. I did not hear any sound at any moment, although it did not give me time to open the windows, and the whole thing lasted for about a couple of minutes tops.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

I was taking a walk in my neighborhood and looked into the sky and saw a rather large bright ball of light. The ball of light was moving slowly through the clear night sky at about the speed and height you would see a normal aircraft move. The ball only stayed at this speed for a few seconds and began to accelerate and instantly shot off and disappeared into the night sky.  There were no clouds in the area for the light to go behind and there was no mistaking this for an airplane.  Like I said the movement the ball made when it disappeared into the sky was instantaneous.    I proceeded to call a friend five to ten minutes later when I reached my house and decided to walk back outside.   Just as I was describing the ball of light over the phone it returned with the great speed it had left with.  The ball of light had shot back into the nearby sky and began to hover for a few moments in a circular motion. I then grew tired and watching the object and went inside to report the sighting.  I am 21 years old and a junior in college and have lived in this neighborhood for almost my entire life.,2008-10-31T00:00:00,34.31321771217712,-83.80587490774909

The height seemed to have been right at the height of the traffic lights or just above them.  They  appeared and then left.  It seemed like slow motion and as if time had stopped.  The two of us looked at each other and then away silently, never asking the other anything.  It took us a couple of days to even broach the subject when we both joked about possibly seeing a UFO.  Over the years we have joked with each other, but also saying that we both believe what we saw is closer to that of a UFO than anything else.

At approximately 9:03 PM the dog sat down and began barking quite loudly at something behind us.  We turned to see a bright light coming up from behind the house.   It was flying just high enough that it didn’t touch the top of the old oak tree in the yard.   Soon the object was directly above us and I had a very clear view of the craft.  It was almost shaped like the spade suit in a deck of cards.  The craft was massive and had to be at least forty feet, perhaps fifty feet, wide and perhaps fifteen feet high.  On the belly of it were several different colored lights.   On the exact center of the craft was a mysterious dome shaped light, it glowed a color that seemed eerily familiar, and yet like nothing I had ever seen before.  Also, it seemed as though the light were some form of cross between a solid and a liquid, as if it could hold its shape without need for containment but still allow objects to pass through it.   From this light an arm, with a long needle and a wire coiled around it attached to it, was expelled from the craft.  It was from the tip of this needle that a focused beam of light shot down from the craft.  The light hit the ground still concentrated, then seemed to explode in a flash.  Then the arm was pulled back into the light.  The craft then started to move forward slowly, and, being a fascinated child, I foolishly pursued it, however it sped up and blasted away.   Rather confused by what we just saw, my grandfather and I re-entered the house after what we believed to be only five or ten minutes.  My grandmother, however, claimed that we had been outside for nearly a half hour and the clock in the house agreed, while my grandfather’s wrist watch told us that only a few minutes had passed.

But I just read one or two events at www.nuforc.org/ that talk about going up in the sky so I'll repeat what happened to me here.  This was a strange night a strange weekend.  I was at a busy event and I was being attacked psychically by a ""friend"" while at this event.  There's a lot of detail around that but it just distorts the event of going into the sky.  Friday night was very strange.  The strangest night of my life.  I was in my hotel room with a magazine, painting my nails, watching tv, listening to the radio and smoking a cigarette.  Unwinding after a day of being a vendor to a large crowd.  A small form about the size of the ""friend"" I was meeting at this event appeared in my room.  It stood at the left foot of the bed.  It was invisible but I could see it somehow - the outline of it.  I wasn't afraid.  I was passive.  A correct reaction would be to get the blankety-blank thing out of my room.  Instead I kept on doing what I was doing, sometimes looking over at the thing.  I went to bed with that thing still standing there.  I was aware that it was creepy to go to sleep with that thing watching me. But that's what I did.  I went to sleep.  Immediately.  But  I really wasn't sleeping.  Right away, I was with my ""friend"" in a cave with a fire. That ""friend"" was doing something with the fire, it was somehow negative to me.  I didn't really know why I was down there.  Something intervened.  I flew into the clouds in the thunderstorm right above this hotel i was staying at.  I remember passing through.  And there was an allowance to let me through the thunderstorm. It was their given protection to let me through.  I remember seeing the whirling clouds up close.  Then I hurled out to space.  Sometimes we were in a spaceship, sometimes not.  They really didn't let me see them.  I was aware that one was male and one was female.  There were more at times.  We were inside the spaceship looking out or actually out in whatever environment we were in.  It was all very natural, very comfortable.  I loved them, they loved me.  it's like we knew each other all my life.  These were not my grandparents come to meet me.  They were something else from up there, way up there.  They took me all over the place.  It was fun and marvelous.  I let myself forget alot because it was too much.  I remember going to this giant, golden lit building.  It was huge.  It was like giants lived there.  I was facing a giant door.  I looked left and right down these giant empty hallways.  I was unafraid.  They were with me.  I couldn't see them.  The ones I was with said ""You are here because you can pray like that"".  I understood that if i prayed, i could get through the giant doors I was standing in front of.  i closed my eyes and prayed.  i prayed so hard i put myself in a trance.  i became a white light radiating love energy.  there was another white light with me.  i stayed in this state of being in a trance and being a white light for both nights - friday and saturday - all night in my ""sleep"".    They brought me up there so I would be safe from the attack happening to me.  it was weird waking up each morning.  i would wake directly from being a white light.  as soon as i woke up, i was wide awake and i would think ""how can i be this wide awake since I've just been up all night?""  on sunday night in my hotel room, i was afraid to sleep because i didn't understand what had happened the two nights before.  i understood that with my ""friend"" gone, i was safe.  but still i refused to sleep and finally slept at daylight.  i had a difficult reaction from the attack and from what i seen out there when i was up in the universe.  i had more than panoramic vision, it was like all around my head vision at certain points.  i couldn't look at the sky for a while.  i was constantly dreaming about the sky.  one time i dreamt i was showing the sky my artwork.  i was in utter blackness in deep space.  they really liked my artwork.  it  didn't feel like a dream, it is a memory.  then i realized i was putting my self in a trance in my sleep as i had the sensation of rocking back and forth in spirit form.  praying and rocking can induce trance.  they let me know when they are overhead.  i get a really strong sensation from them. it's really nice.  they really like me.  one time, something came really strong but i told them i was afraid so they stopped.  it really changed me, this experience.  i am alot more psychic, i always have been but now i tend to have psychic experiences with others more often.  someone seen me walking, running around while my body slept (at the same time, i was dreaming i was doing exactly what they seen me doing),  i seen a ufo with my dad a few years later, me and my dog seen a small lighted circle in the yard last year, we also heard a dog bark in the small room we were in where there was no other dog and then this year in may i seen a big green line in the sky created by something traveling north to south.

It then hovered for about 5 seconds then went straight down towards the ground out of my sight.   We proceeded on up the road to a hill top at which time we stopped the vehicle and got out and looked and from there you could see an object on the ground that had alot of bright light around it with a reddish light or glow on the top. This object was out in a field somewhat near the forest line.  From the distance we was from the object it was hard to get a good lookat the object other than to see there was a good deal of light around the object.   We was too far away to determine if there was anyone around the object but there was no noise to be heard from the location we stopped in. At that time we proceeded to continue our drive back into Dixon but the event occured over a period of about 4 minutes from the time i first spotted the object until the time we drove off.

I was looking into the object's interior and through the flames could see what appeared like moving anthropoid type shapes. Below at the back of the object a row of deep red lights moved forward and back repetitively. The craft was quite silent. After minutes the object began to move forward (south) for some metres then did a right turn, (west). When it turned I could no longer see the flames. Coloured lights were on the back and I watched it travel slowly across the undulating (rural) country during which time I rang my brother who lived in that direction, to advise him to go outside to watch for the object. A wide band of fairly dense cloud had come up from the western horizon and the object went behind the cloud, disappearing from sight. The sighting had lasted seven minutes. Note: At the beginning of the sighting I heard children's voices calling out so they may have seen the object but they were called inside by their club leader.

The protrusion was black and gave the general appearance of a small fixed wing aircraft in a gentle climb. The middle of was still gray, and the drooping section appeared silver in color.

I immediately knew that I was looking at something which was not “identifiable.”  All three objects were round in shape and appeared to have a metallic shine coming off of them.  I couldn’t really determine if this was light generated from within or reflecting from the sun.  They each were extremely small to the naked eye, almost impossible to see if you didn’t have excellent vision.  You had to be looking in the right spot.  Again, they were sort of close to the moon, which is the only reason I even saw them in the first place.  If you weren’t looking in that direction, you probably wouldn’t even have noticed them. As I continued walking and watching them, they were moving, but not like a plane or any other “normal” flying object moves.  They were moving rather slowly, yet when I would look at them again (after continuing my walk, then looking up again), one of them moved off and away from the other two.  I kept looking and staring, with breaks inbetween.  This went on for at least 30 minutes, at which time the third one had disappeared, then after awhile, the second one, then eventually all three of them disappeared.. They appeared to be hovering most of the time, although there was some movement, then when you’d look again, they’d be in a different spot relative to the “day” moon and relative to each other. Again, they were round and not like anything you normally see in the sky.  They definitely were not a plane or a balloon or a helicopter.  They were round and didn’t behave like these things.  Helicopters don’t go that high to my knowledge.  And, from the naked eye, you could tell they were a very far distance away (high up and far away).  Again, they couldn’t have been planes.

I was watching the news, when I noticed a bright light streak from the east across outside the living room window towards the west. The object was bright enough to illuminate the tops of the Ponderosa's along my driveway. The object was seen through the trees. I was looking south out the window. Of course, I jumped up, ran to the window just to see it disappear behind a clump of trees and the mountains beyond my ranch. The object was oval shaped, and was first seen about 45 degrees off the horizon at 160 degrees on the compass in the south, and  it came in from the east and was heading west, at a 45 degree slope. Lost sighting at about 200 degrees compass heading. My ranch is 6 miles out of Sprague River North, and 18 miles out of Chiloquin, Or. south. The object emmitted a bright white light, no tail, and actually illuminated the treetops on my place. Duration of sighting about 3-4 seconds, this was enough time to make out shape. Time was about 5:35 pm. Size, if I was to hold a nickel coin at arms length, that was the size of this object. I ran to the end of my drive which is over 1000 feet long with binoculars, and no other obects or aircraft were seen. Clear skies, temp about 48 degrees. Estimated distance of object, undetermined at this time. The area we live is very remote and rural, horse and cattle ranches. Little or no commercial aircraft traffic flies in this area. Only an occasional helicopter during fire season. What this object was ""NOT"". It was not a helicopter or private or commercial aircraft, as I did run out on my deck within a split second of seeing the object... no sound, or any collision lights red or green, or flashing lights. Could this had been space debris? Possibly. Could it have been the space station? No. Could it have been the Space Shuttle? No. Could it have been a meteor or fireball? NO, it had no tail, was a solid white very bright oval shaped object with a aura/halo around it. I have witnessed hundreds of not thousands of falling stars, meteors, watched comets, ect. It did not meet the characteristics of a meteor or falling star. Could it have been space junk? Yes, possibly. My background is the USAF, and I am familiar with many aircraft. It is undetermined at this time what this may have been. Summery; Reason for posting this report is to see if there were any other witnesses from this Southern Oregon location. Someone may have had a better viewing of the object from a better location and can fill in some more details on this.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

Two smaller craft of unidentifable shape but blinking with red and white lights were heading towards the north west. They were flying in formation - one was closely following the other. Initially, I presumed they were military jets, but I could only hear the noise of one aircraft engine. When they reached the spot where they bisected the flight path of the commercial aircraft, both smaller craft immediately turned at a 90-degree angle and began following the commercial jet. These smaller craft did not bank, as airplanes would do - they simply changed directions in an instant. Once they changed direction, they also changed color.  Instead of blinking red and white, they were blinking red only. Further, the location of the lights changed as well. Instead of appearing to be on either side of the craft, a series of red lights blinked in sequence as if along the side of a circular craft.  At this point, two additional craft appeared; they were even smaller than the initial two and they blinked with only white lights.  They flew near the initial group for a few seconds, then they flew off rapidly in two different directions (one to the southwest, the other to the northeast).

While waiting in my car and leaning out the window admiring the stars overhead and two distant aircraft strobe lights, one flying south toward Louisville, KY and the other towards the Northeast, cruising between 30 to 35 thousand feet, the object suddenly shot overhead. The UFO was an oval shape, burnt orange in color, altitude about 15-25 thousand feet, suddenly appeared overhead, traveled from West to East at an extremely high rate of speed.

No visible signs, or traces of propulsion, no audible sounds (its velocity should have broken the sound barrier and every window within forty miles?)

At approximately 00.15 hours (12:15 central/-6 hrs.) I was returning to one of the cabins at the Caney Conference Centre in Minden, La., when I stopped to view all the stars in the nice clear sky.  I noticed a bright light in the eastern sky and was trying to figure out what star or planet it was.  I didn’t have any of the astronomy books or magazines with me, but it just didn’t seem to be in the right place.  It was about 30 degrees on the horizon.   All of a sudden it began to move around slightly.  At first I thought it was just my eyes playing tricks.  But then it moved again.  It did this several times in about 10 minutes time, very erratically.  It would move up, down, left, down, up right, left, down, up, right, up, right, down, etc.; very random, but not very far, only maybe with in one or two degrees each move.  Then it stopped.  When it stopped this time, it looked as though there were two other lights, right next to the main/brightest light.  The brightest one was whiteish, the other lights were reddish (one to the bottom right) and blueish (one to the top left).  I had my 10x42 binoculars with me, but when I looked through them, it just looked like one big blob of light. After about 5 or so minutes of stillness, it started to move around again.  This time it did basically exactly the same as before.  Also, both times, it appeared to wind up in the exact same spot it started from.  Now, there is a small airport just down the road, but it didn’t move like any plane.  If it had been, and it was on approach, then the light/lights should have gotten bigger, further apart, and I would have heard the engine.  Not to mention it would have changed altitude gradually and not returned to the same spot where I first noticed it.  I continued to watch this lighted object for about another 30 minutes; so almost not quite an hour.  I stopped because I just figured it was some light/beacon, on a wire, or top of a pole, or something and the winds up that high were blowing stronger and moving it erratically like that. Well the next morning (being today) I went back to the same spot, only about 50 or so yards from my cabin.  THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL IN THE AREA OF THE SKY IN THE SPOT WHERE THIS LIGHT HAD BEEN AND WAS MOVING AR0UND.  I even took out my binoculars again to see if there was something further out and very narrow that I just couldn’t make out.  Well, there wasn’t.

The object was very bright and located southwest of me in the sky.  I ran inside and grabbed my Sony hi-def camera (HDR-SR11) and was able to take about 11 minutes worth of footage.  I was able to get about 6 minutes of a steady camera shot with a tree in the background. I’ve seen these objects here in Texas for over 10 years.

The flying object was not bearing any strobe light or light a plane would normally carry and not giving off any loud chopping noise a helicopter would generate and was not giving off a roar a jet would normally create. The light it was giving was too bright and massive to be any airliner as well.

Clear skies, daytime. This sighting occurred in June 1983 in Borger, Texas.  I had not reported this earlier because at the time it occurred I had no corroborating witnesses, no photographs, essentially nothing to substantiate the claim.  I doubted that anyone would have believed what I saw at the time.  However, this sighting stays in the back of my mind, so I am reporting it, if for no other reason, than to have closure. The sighting occurred about 17:30 (Local Time, Central Time Zone) in June 1983.  I was in my residence and heard what I thought was a really, really, loud jet.  It was so loud that I stepped out on my front porch to see what it was.  I looked up and the object was probably one-half mile away at an altitude of probably two thousand feet.  (These are only estimations.)   It was huge. I had a pair of 10 X 35 binoculars in the living room, so I quickly stepped back inside and grabbed the binoculars.  By that time the object was receding, so I might have been better off not using the binoculars.  I remember the object filled the binocular’s field of view, which at the time made me wonder just how big this thing actually was. What I saw was a large black boomerang-shaped object, moving from east to west.  It was travelling at a modest speed, maybe 200 miles per hour (again, it’s hard to estimate something in the sky without reference points.)  I remember as I looked at the object, there were three specific things that struck me.  The first was the size…I can only guess that it was 300-400 feet side-to-side and maybe 75-125 feet front-to-back.  The second was the tremendous noise the object made.  It was LOUD.  And, third, the fact that the object was lopsided; that is to say it was asymmetrical.  I wondered how it stayed in the air…it didn’t look aerodynamic. I think another reason I never reported this is the fact that it sounded like a really large jet.  Maybe it was…if so, it was like nothing I had seen before and have not seen since.  The jet sound made me think it was a conventional aircraft, but the shape and the size made me think it was something beyond classification. I did not notice any exhaust or smoke behind the craft. Since then I have seen video of the A1 bomber and other stealth aircraft.  On one occasion I saw an A1 pass directly overhead.  Believe me, the thing I saw in 1983 makes the A1 look like a toy. By definition, what I saw was a UFO, because it was not identified, it was flying and it was an object.  Whether it was of terrestrial origin or somewhere else, I don’t know  I wish I did.

I found this site some time ago and when I found it had reports dating back many years, I decided to see if anyone else reported what I saw many years ago.  Much to my surprise, I did. In the early summer of 1983, I was 11 years old, my girlfriend and I were having a sleepover at her house in St. Paul Park, MN.  After a few hours of fun running around the neighborhood late at night, we settled down for bed in the back of her fathers pick-up truck, which was parked in the drive way (no topper on truck). As we lay there talking and looking up at the sky, a very large black triangle, silently passed over us.  It had no lights on that I could discern.  It moved at what I would guess to be 10-15 mph.  It was just above tree top level. It created no wind.  It was very unnatural in its behavior.  Even though I was 11 years old, I knew this was not some normal aircraft.  My friend and I became very quiet and went right to bed after that. I told my family. They did not believe me at the time.  I have shared this with many people over the years including my husband, who heard this from me long before I ever found this site.  Needless to say I was excited when I found out someone else saw the very same thing I did (validation).  I feel confident it must have been the same night.   Redwing , MN is just south of St. Paul Park. My little school friend and I never really talked about what we saw at the time, but many years later, when we were adults, I tried to talk to her about it because I could never forget about it.  She said she didn’t remember it at all and acted as if I was strange.  I know she saw it at the time because it was frightening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

This area is known as the lower southern plateau, at the very tip-end of the Rock, from where you can see the Mediterranean Sea to the East, the Strait that divides Europe from Africa to the South, and the Atlantic Ocean, which lies to the West.   I remember sitting on the edge of a cliff and was facing the Mediterranean Sea.   Although the reader may find it difficult to believe, I felt compelled to look in the general direction of a natural elevation (the edges of the Upper Plateau) that stood behind me about 120 metres away.  Over this elevation you find a military enclave that includes an enormous and conspicuous white spherical radar.  There, I saw this metallic round-shaped craft, hovering motionlessly and making absolutely no noise or sound whatsoever.  It just stood there for nearly an hour, above the radar at about 75 feet from the ground.  Suddenly, it vanished as if it had imploded.   The next day, GBC TV showed footage of an enourmous baseball shaped craft, from where a small sphere descended into a nearby Spanish oil-refinery and then slowly climbed up again only to vanish seconds after.   Interestingly, there had been a wildfire on the Rock that was put out only one day before my particular sighting.  Thank you.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,,

A little before mid-day I was standing at the marked place (on wikimapia.org) waiting for my friend who was in a meeting. I was looking at the clear blue sky with very faint clouds and I saw this extremely shiny object in the sky. It seemed stationary and was very bright. I was amazed at the brightness and concentrated on it trying to identify what it could be and then I realized that it was moving very slowly, as if it was drifting. I thought maybe it could be a weather balloon (It probably could be, I am not sure. It was just a few hours that I was in Yavatmal and I have absolutely no Idea if weather baloons are released there. I believe weather baloons are white in colour but this thing seemed to reflect like it would be a foil. This thing looked like a perfect shiny sphere although in the  photograph it shows a different shape. I believe it could be because of 'camera shake'. The picture is taken from a Cannon PowerShot A560 zoomed to the maximum digital 16x. It does make it shaky and difficult to catch a object so far away on the LCD screen and click it with a steady hand. A few seconds later it seemed to slightly pick up speed. I am sure the wind on the ground was in the opposite direction this thing was going westward. It kept on accelerating gradually and then it stopped, looking brighter than before (or maybe I imagined that it looked brighter). It was hard trying to focus the eyes on it. Two of the workers there too asked me what it could be. I said it could be a weather balloon but I wonder if they knew what a weather balloon is. I wished I was carrying my binoculars that time. At that time I took a break by looking down cause my neck was feeling the strain looking straight up. When I looked up again I could not see it. It could not be, cause it was only a couple of seconds . . . It just could not disappear. It had not disappeared but it was way away westward and was moving really fast almost at the speed of a plane flying high. And then at one point it stopped and it started shrinking in size rapidly and then it was gone. I would attribute to the shrinking in size to it going higher and away. The accompanying photo was taken when it seemed to be steady. I could not bring it in frame (on the LCD) when it was moving faster. I realize now that I could have used the viewfinder instead of the LCD.  This is the only shot that I ve taken. Oh one more thing I would like to mention that earlier I had seen two vapour clouds (one stretching east-west and the other north south) that a fighter jet leaves. I did ask my friend that time whether there is a air base nearby. I do believe that 2 to 4 vapour trails are left by jets over Yavatmal skies each day. I forgot to mention the above incident to my friend but at least two of his workers have seen this with me. Could be even more cause I was staring at the sky like crazy and I am sure many must have seen me staring and they too would have looked in the same direction.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

Also a tail would come out sometimes on the top, sometimes on the bottom and sometimes on the sides. It never moved in those 75 minutes.

One triangle was on the left. It was an upside down triangle. On the right there was another triangle that was right side up. They appeared to be connected.

At about 8:30 p.m. I was assuming it was Venus, as it had not moved. I also assumed that the colors and tails we saw were just gas in the sky.

Remote area, no light interference. General location;  W. of Little Dipper.  Estimated  position eleven o’clock  E. NE. Planes use general air space frequently.  Air traffic regular; several passenger jets traversing simultaneously. Lights clearly visible at night. Following consistent flight paths. Planes visible by day. Occasional vapor trails; numerous -6 - 8 simultaneously with proper atmospheric conditions. Estimated altitude ~ 18,000 to ~ 20,000 ft. Small plane traffic less regular, mostly “puddle jumper” connecting flights -  2,000 - 5,000ft.  Also regular. Passenger jets always audible,  ~ 10 seconds after visible contact of plane’s sighting. Small planes audible propulsion closely associated with position. Typical routine.  Stepped out on patio, have a “smoke” and “night cap” before bed. Always observe night sky; sometimes counting numbers of lights of jet traffic or watching for “falling” stars. Observe Saturn disappearing into Eastern horizon. Venus traveling ~ 1 o’clock ~ South.

We were on the highway, and there were plenty of airplanes flying around. The sky was cloudy so instead of it being a dark blue/black color, it was sort of light purple and I could easily see the shapes of all of the airplanes against the night sky. hen I saw something flying that didn’t look like an airplane at all. It was triangular shaped and had an off-white light on each corner. It was flying very close to the ground and didn’t produce any noise. We drove almost directly under it. What struck me as most interesting was that it was flying in a straight line, at a constant medium speed, but was spinning around at the same time. At first all I saw were three lights spinning around, but as it got closer I saw that it was a triangle. It wasn’t large at all, and it looked to be about the size of a small commercial airplane, or even a jet. One of the lights on it was blinking as well. It was flying across the highway when I saw it, and I stared at it until it disappeared behind the trees on the sides of the highway. However, it didn’t look like it landed. I only saw one. I saw many other airplanes after that, including commercial airplanes, jets, and small individually owned ones, but none of them had the same shape, light color, or light blinking pattern as the triangular flying object did. I have always been interested in UFO's and have believed in aliens for quite a while, and this definitely looked like something that I've seen on UFO shows.

There were at least 4 shade areas to the north and two areas to the south.  I called my husband on the cellphone to tell him about the shade spots.  As I was running parallel to one of the large spots, I started counting to try and measure distance.  I counted to fifteen seconds before my view was obstructed by cliffs.  ( I calculate 15 seconds at 75 mph is approximately 1290 feet.)  I exited at the Golden Shores exit. (First exit in western AZ)",2008-10-31T00:00:00,34.506735795454546,-114.29056420454545

They were oval shape with an image in the centre, the images changed periodically I was mesmerised. We live quite near to Heathrow airport and when ever a plane took of the UFO's image would change to an aeroplane and zoom of vertically in a split second, no sooner had the plane gone the UFO sped back into  view (planes are taking off ever 1-2 mins). They would dart around with images such as aeroplanes, light bulbs, traffic lights and triangles. My family didn’t believe me at first saying it was balloons which had escaped until they looked and started to watch with me. We were all stund to witness this phenomenon. We sat for over an hour watching the sightings, we were spellbound, so intriguing and unbelievable. To see the speed which they moved was unbelievable, after an hour or so it started to cloud up and I lost sight of them.

We were at the beach on Sullivan's Island on the evening of May 24th, 2005, to watch the sunset.  It was the day after a full moon, and we sat up in the dunes because the tide was coming in.  After the sun set, and it finally became dark, the tide was so high that we were forced to stay in our position on the dunes.  It was while sitting, waiting for the tide to go out just enough for us to be able to walk back to the beach access, that we began to see lights in the outer harbor, between Sullivan's Island and James Island. At first we saw only one orange light. It was located at the inside end of the jetties of the Charleston Harbor. From where we were sitting, we were pretty much staring out towards James Island. My first assumption was that the light was a flare, that maybe a boat was having problems in the harbor. Then a second light appeared to the left, seemingly the exact same light just in another place. I thought that perhaps the would-be boat launched another flare. While staring out at the lights, we slowly began to realize that if it were a flare, it would have at least moved in the wind or began to fall out of the sky. These lights remained at a constant position. Then it seemed that on of the lights -- the one on the right -- began to split, first in to another orange light.. then, each orange light split off to include a red light connected with a beam. Two immensely bright orange and red lights connected by a beam. They continued to dazzle us with a series of brightening and dimming, growing and shrinking, disappearing and reappearing, but never in a different spot. The one on the right seemed to be more active than the one on the left. We were frightened, but after coming to terms with what I was looking at, I thought enough of the event to try to capture a photo. I actually captured 4, but with a Nokia cell phone camera which probably would have been only 1 mega pixel at that time. I still have the phone somewhere in a drawer, with a picture I took of the sunset that same day, but its retired and no longer has service hooked up. I transferred the four pictures of the lights a few days later, but I think you would have to have been there to recognize what they represent. I tried to capture a video, but it refused to show up the same as it would for a picture. In the meantime, we had been drawn to another series of lights in a slightly different area of the sky. After the experience I mentioned above began, at least a few minutes passed before a bright white light began to appear in the sky out towards the open ocean.  Since we were staring out towards James Island, we had to look to our left and up in the sky to see this one.  A white light would appear and disappear.  We were never sure if it was going to come back, but each time it did. At first I thought this was lightning, but there was no flash of light associated with it.  It was a steady light that was there and then it wasn't.  We were so amazed and occupied by the orange/red lights that were giving us a show in the harbor, that I don't recall exactly how many times it happened.  But, after several times of appearing and disappearing, as kind of a grand finale the light appeared as five or six separate lights that all streaked across a small section of sky together at the same speed, then disappeared for good. In the end, five or six bright rectangular-ish objects that are equally sized and evenly spaced between each other, moving the same speed and same trajectory. Both instances of lights occurred simultaneously, however seemingly independent of each other. The styling of the two sets of lights were completely different.  The harbor lights were bright orange/red, fairly constant acting, and the ocean light(s) were white and more seldom.  None of the lights made sounds.  There didn't seem to be any aircraft or cargo ship activity in the area at the time.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,32.7659,-79.8396

She resides in Upper St. Clair, PA, a quiet suburb south of Pittsburgh.  I arrived at her home about twenty after eight in the evening. There was a very light snow on the ground. I went to the house, let myself in and found her in the kitchen. After making some coffee and sitting in the kitchen talking for about a half an hour, she went upstairs to change from her work clothes into her pajamas. I went to use the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom faces the front of the house and the road. She lives on a very quiet road with very little traffic, but numerous homes. Behind the house is a very dense wooded area that prohibits any light from coming up the hill from the road below. The road behind the house is about a ¼ mile from our home. I was using the bathroom sitting on the toilet when I heard her go down the stairs. As I was finishing up, I glanced through the venetian blinds as I have a millions times in the past when I was younger. What I saw has occupied all of my time awake and while asleep for the last 24 hours. The shadow of her home was cast on the snow, a perfect silhouette. No car lights would have been able to accomplish this because of how steep the hill and how dense the woods are behind the house, even with sparse leaves on the branches. I yanked up my pants up, zipper down and shirt untucked and bolted down the stairs. My mother was frozen like a statue staring out the back window. What we saw at that point we will remember for the rest of our lives. In the sky only about 10 yards above the tree line, there hovered a perfectly quiet but blazing ball of orange light. I would estimate it to be about 15-20 yards in width. Not oval or cylindrical, but perfectly round. It was very strong and not pulsating or shifting. It was not blinding us at all.  I looked back at the front window, this time from the family room and still saw the house silhouetted on the snow. I continued to stare out the back door that leads that leads to the raised porch as I opened the door. No sound, no heat, no vibration just this spectacular ball of light as I stood on the porch. I ran back in to get a camera down in the game room on the basement level. As I ran to the back door under the porch, the ball became smaller and smaller as it seemed to be yanked back into the sky at an extremely rapid pace. I never got a shot off. I didn’t have time to turn the camera on unfortunately. Today, she asked the next door neighbors, who are an older couple, they saw nothing. Nor did a woman she knows through church who lives on the hillside about 1 mile away from our home, directly behind the house. I believe what we witnessed was not of this world. This was certainly not a noisy helicopter or some child playing a prank. This was a real, tangible, perfectly silent ball of orange fire well above the tree line. If anyone in this area had a similar encounter from the evening of 11/18/08 I would be highly interested in hearing your account of that evening.

The skies were clear, and there were quite a few stars.  I looked to the west, and noticed, what I at first thought was an aircraft at altitude.  I continued watching it, as it was flickering different colored lights (red, blue, and white) and kept my attention.  After some time (probably 30-40 second), I noticed it wasn't moving.  Further, it made no noise. I rose from my chair, and moved to a different position in my yard to make sure it wasn't leaves on a nearby tree causing the ""flickering"".  I stood watching it for another minute, and then went to the door to call my 13 year old son out to confirm what I was seeing. I told him to put his jacket on and come see, while warning him not to look at any street lights in the area (to preserve his night vision). I pointed the object out to him, and asked him what he saw (I didn't want to ""lead"" him).  He watched it for a few seconds and went through the same thought processes I did.  At first he thought it was an aircraft, until he noted it wasn't moving.  Then he offered that it might be a ""nova"" (he is studying just such a thing in school). I sent him into the house to get our digital camera, and I took several photos of the object, but it appeared that the camera was unable to capture an image. We watched for several more minutes, and noticed that it hadn't changed its location or actions.  The evening was fairly cool, so after 10 minutes or so, we decided to go in, and I would check it later. Thirty minutes later, I went back out and searched the general area of the sky, and the object was gone.  I looked lower towards the horizon to see if it was simply a star that may have gone closer to setting, but I couldn't locate it. I will be going back out at the same time this evening in an attempt to locate it again.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,33.2093,-100.2669

There was a bright star in the south (looked bright like Venus).  The unusual thing was that there was a second bright star (as bright as the other one) just to the west of the first one.  I had never seen one there before.  I told my daughter and she looked up.  She continued on the walk, but I stopped and kept looking at the second star-like object.  Since I had never seen anything like that before in the sky down here, I thought it might be a satellite, but it did not move at all.  Then after about 20 seconds, the bright light dimmed and then it moved quickly out into the universe.  It did not move in any other direction.  Then, it was gone and the star or planet that is usually there was alone as usual.  I saw something like that about 30 years ago in Kansas City, MO.  It was on the 4th of July and someone called it to my! attention.  We were out on a lake.  The bright object went in a straight line, then made a 90 degree turn.

What I saw was a sudden bright light; at first I thought it was just a bright star but the more I looked I realized it wasn’t a star at all.  The light was not a fiery white blaze a meteor would normally generate, it instead looked as though something was shining a huge bright spotlight in the sky towards my directing.  The flying object was not bearing any strobe light or light a plane would normally carry and not giving off any loud chopping noise a helicopter would generate and was not giving off a roar a jet would normally create.  The light it was giving was too bright and massive to be any airliner as well.

It then started traveling north. We tracked along side it at approx 30 mph till it took a west turn. It again staid hovering and we were able to snap three pictures.    As I took the pictures my camera did something strange and had an orbital glow in the lcd screen before the picture snapped.  It was also slow to respond.  This is not normal for the camera operation and I wasn't using a flash.   We followed around for a few minutes more as it tracked northwest across our neighborhood.  We tried to turn around and get a better spot to caputre video.  As we turned around it disappeared.  We drove a 1 mile square area looking for it but it was gone.   The weather was perfect.

I noticed strange flashing lights on the horizon in the west, north and north western part of my tree line.  They were a dull yellow and lit up the whole tree line when they flashed. Almost reminiscent of what distant lightning looks like, however,  I should note that no thunderclap was ever heard after these flashes.   There was about a 10 second interval between the largest flashes and perhaps 3-5 seconds between the smaller ones. The flashing alternated in the following pattern: West, Northwest, North. I should also note that I have seen these flashes in the past.   In the summer of 2003, I noticed the same pattern of flashes in the same quadrants of my back field.  I alerted my father to this strange phenomenon. My father who is a doctor was also perplexed by these lights.  He at first dismissed them as distant lightning, and I implored him to stay longer and watch and observe that there was no thunderclap.  He stayed longer and agreed that it was strange that there was no thunder associated with these bright displays of lights, he also agreed that the timing was almost exactly 10 seconds between large bursts of light on the treeline.  I was fortunate enough to have my digital camera in which I took some low-grade videos of the event.  The video is not very good yet shows a decent example of what the lights looked like.   When the lights flashed, it was brightest on the western quadrant of my field.  It appeared as if the lights were flashing at a distance of perhaps 10-15 miles away.  When flashing occurred on the brightest of flashes (every 10 seconds) it was possible to see cloud formations above the light flash (an obvious indication of the brightness of the light).",2009-08-05T00:00:00,44.7695,-69.4283

This sighting is one of the most unnerving experiences my wife and I have ever had.  I was a private pilot fo 14 years and never saw any image such as we saw that evening when I did night flying.  The dual objects appeared to be at 35 degrees off horizon.  At first I thought it was one object, probably a plane but if that were the case it why did it have orange balls on its wing tips instead of the traditional green and red wing lighting?   The object was approaching us heading southbound and we were facing true north. Intially it appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, 4-5 miles from us.  I cannot estimate the altitude but I'm guessing 3000-5000 feet.After 30 seconds of from first spotting, what I thought was one object turned out to be two.  One orange ball on our right started to lose altitude and converge toward the other orange glowing ball.  It  the turned sharply to our right away from the other ball and disappeared. Just prior to doing this it appeared to us that both orange objects appeared to stop in mid air.  About 10-15 seconds after the first disappearance, the remaining orange ball vanished.  I would say our entire viewing was 1-1/2 minutes. Upon returning to our home in about 5 minutes I called our local Salem Ohio police department and recounted this experience to them.

My buddy and I had agreed not to report what we seen for fear that we would be laughed at. My parents live on the west side of Craig, Colorado, and I left there to pick my buddy up at his place which was a townhouse also on the west side of Craig.  The weather was a clear blue sky without any clouds so to speak.  We had decided we were going to go the Village Inn to eat and as we headed east on Highway 40/Victory Way toward the Village Inn my buddy said is that a ""jet"" as he pointed to the south side of town???  I said yeah that's a ""jet"" as I looked I could see a jet flying along with a vapor trail.  He said not there over there!  I looked and said I don't know what the h*ll that is.  As we were driving I noticed a guy walking along the highway that was looking in the direction of the object also.  I said lets get closer to it and we drove east and turned south on to Ranney Street.  We pulled up underneath the craft around the area of 1st Street.  I estimated it to be about 100-150 feet across and it looked like the common description of a saucer.  It had an eleva! ted center area and was disc shaped and was made of a very reflective and highly shiny metal.  I could see the sun reflecting on the side of it extremely bright!  I collaborated with my buddy the whole time to confirm what I was seeing.  At a distance it looked like the object was sitting in space on an exact point without moving at all.  When we got closer I could tell the object was rotating about a central axis like a top at an extreme speed.  It was holding exact position without a bobble and didn't make a sound.  We sat there and looked at it in awe when it started rotating faster and faster!  I said it's speeding up on its rotation right?  My buddy said yes it is.  Then it began to change shape flattening out like a cigar with the elevated center area completely gone and then in an instant it vanished completely!  I asked my buddy am I seeing things or did it just vanish!  He exclaimed yes it vanished completely.  This first time seeing the object I guessed it lasted ! about 12 minutes.  I looked further south and said there it is! again! We sped south to the intersection that heads east to the golf course and airport.  It was hovering like before and we sat there and looked at it again and like before it changed shape and vanished!  This time the viewing was for about 5 minutes.  Then we seen it again east of the airport so we headed east and as we got up on it began to change shape once again like before and in an instant it was gone.  It never reappeared after this time.  The whole duration of us watching the object was probably around 20 minutes.  We honestly couldn't believe what we just saw.  If I was to see a UFO I always thought it would be a brief passing in the night.  I'll never forget this that's for sure.  We seen this object so often and I had heard of abduction and people having their memories erased.  We checked our watches pretty closely to make sure there was no missing time.  I think I would still be scared to be hypnotized.  My buddy was from Grand Junction, Colorado and I haven't talked ! to him in years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

This is one of five of my sightings and the most spectacular one out of the five. My friend and myself were heating and air installation employees who worked for Climate Control out of south boston at the time this took place. We were working on the sears building roof top,installing the last flue pipe on the job site that day.The sky was completely clear blue sky, no clouds anywhere, perfect visability! We had just picted up  our tool belts and heading towards the roof top stair door, i noticed a craft that i had mistaken for a small airplane at a glance in the distance that had hovered around the old Dan River Mills smoke stacks located closest to the worsham st. bridge area, down in that direction.After catching my attention i noticed that the craft was moving in our direction, straight at us. The moment that i realized this object was not an airplane was when it began to turn on its side at a 90 degree angle with no drop in altitude and not in a turn such as an aircraft would do.The object turned 90 degrees on its side and then it turned back to a level position as it was moving towards us on the roof top of the sears building, and keep in mind, this object was just a little bit higher than we were at eye level.Once the object returned to a horizontal position it was close enough to be fully visable with much detail.Once the craft leveled ot to a horizontal position i yelled out to my work mate and i pointed str! aight at it in total shock and disbelief. At that moment the craft turned upwards on its side at a 45 degree angle and shot across the sky at a speed so fast that the object became a streak of white light accross the sky, and there was a noticeable point of exit at the end of the streak of white light. Where the object streak ended in the sky there was something like white stars of light that shot back towards the direction of the streak of white light.Also this streak of light was not a vapor trail it was a split second exit, aweome and unbelievable.The craft was a disk shaped object with small areas on the top side like dark rectangular shaped indentations and the same on the bottom side of the craft as well.The object was a beautiful gold color like the sun and the classic disk shape like in the old ufo movies.The object had an appearence of a somewhat dulling effect of the light around the object but plainly visable. This was the first time i had seen anything like this! before, and until then i was a skeptic, not anymore!

Several sightings afterward. Kim, Terri, and I were driving to Nikki's house, Kim's cousin (about 6:30pm). We were all about 17-18 years old and it was Valentine's day.  Nikki and Kim were living about a 1/2 mile from each other in a remote farming area.  It was dark and the roads were icy. Kim's mother had reported numerous times to her family that there was a UFO that followed her to work daily.  Each morning the lit object would wait for her above the mail box and one day, she claims the object beamed down a light and flew over the hood of her car.  On one hand, I believed her because she is an honest ""no nonsense"" person, but on the other hand, it's definately something you need to see to believe!  Kim began seeing the object after her mother woke her up and pointed it out to her one morning. TO NOTE:  Kim has an uncle that is very paranoid of aliens being able to see him at night, to the point of shooting out the overhead farm lights.  He lived about 6-7 miles away.  My mother bought a telescope to watch the skies after seeing UFO's over Lake Miltona in the 80's.  My uncle has seen UFO's in Park Rapids, MN while jogging along wooded trails.  I have several friends and aquaintances who claim to have seen UFO's (about 10).  My husband says he used to watch UFO's while having field parties in Miltona in the early 90's. On Feb. 14th at about 6:30pm, my friends and I picked up Nikki.  Terri was driving and Kim was in the passenger seat.  I was sitting in the back seat of a 4-door car.  When we pulled into the driveway, Kim yelled, ""See, there it is!  That's what I've been seeing!""  We all observed a UFO hovering above the silo.  Nikki had also seen it and immediately jumped into the back seat.  The object was round and white in appearance.  Although it was bright, the light appeared to be self-contained, meaning that it didn't emit light like a flashlight or lightbulb. When we drove away, the object came straight down from the sky and then followed along-side the vehicle.  It was about the size of our car.  It followed along the ditches, move up over trees and power lines, then would dip back down along side us.  It was icy and we took back roads (gravel) for 8 miles to my mother's house in Miltona, MN.  All of us were hysterical and crying, yelling at Terri to drive faster.  There was no other traffic on the gravel roads and but Terri had to drive slowly. Once we hit Highway 14, the object moved higher up into the sky and moved behind us.  A large beam of light came down like a helicopter spotlight. I felt like something snapped in my brain. I'm not sure how to explain it, but it seemed nearly audible. This is the point at which I'm not sure exactly what happened.  I'm not sure if I imagined what COULD have happened,or if it actually DID happen.  The car was stopped. No one was screaming or crying and everyone else was staring straight ahead, motionless.  There wasn't any lights on the dash, no clock, etc., and the car wasn't running. I think there was a small man (being) next to my car door.  We had locked all the doors upon seeing the UFO.  The man telepathically told me to open the door and I refused.  It said, ""We're going to get in anyway.  Make it easier on yourself and unlock the door.""  I reached over and unlocked it and don't remember anything else. BUT, it was as if we DIDN'T stop the car. The light had come out and chased us, closing in on us slowly, and just when it was almost on top of us, a car came from the other direction and it was gone in a flash, going in the other direction. I had regression hypnosis to help me remember this incident, and as it turns out, I'm just one of those people who can't be hypnotised. What luck! But, I was able to recall details just from simply telling the story to the hypnotist over and over again. It seemed that each time I could remember another small little detail. But, when it comes to the spot where I'm not sure if we stopped or not, I was confused each time. I simply came up with, ""and then it was gone and we went to my house."" My friend also had hypnosis and swears that she and her cousin were taken up into a spaceship. I was not present at her hypnosis session, but she said it was pretty intense. Over the next two months or so, I saw the UFO several times at my house (daily, sometimes). It would come after dark and it seemed immediately after I fell asleep. I would wake up feeling as though something was staring intently at me and would open my eyes to see it outside my window. It would change shapes to the shape of the moon (half moon, crescent, full moon, etc.) and would also change colors (white, yellow, orange). It did not have flashing colors, but would be one full color at a time. Once, it turned blood red as I reached for the phone to report it to the police as a sighting. I was scared to go to sleep and felt like no one could possibly identify with me what I was going through. I eventually saw it less and less, but did start seeing it again about 3 years ago, spurring me to pursue the hypnosis. Before the hypnosis session, I swear that I woke to a female alien standing next to my bed reaching over my abdomin area. A few hours later I woke up laying crosswise on my bed without the covers on. I also had an incident where I woke up sleep walking, chasing a very short man out of my room. I dismissed it as a dream, but after going to the bathroom to take a drink of water, I noticed that the UFO was, once again, sitting outside the window! CRAZY! A few days later, I saw the UFO in daylight gliding across the sky. It did this for a few minutes, then quickly made a right angle and dashed away. That time I could see it was cigar-shaped, not round. I was curious as to whether or not other cars driving on the highway also saw it, but I guess I'll never know. I haven't seen it for quite some time now.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,46.1713,-95.3385

At first I was not anxious.

In the moment I was thinking, ""Okay, the tranformer just blew out,  I am about to loose power and all this work"", I heard  about 2 seconds later a close intense LOUD hishing-whooshing sound,  as if something passed over head and down. Then in THAT moment I  thought, ""Who's firing an illegal-grade bottle rocket"". Upon hearing  a second LOUD boom that shook the ground enough to notice, not violently,  I thought, ""Oh My God, has a house blown up?"". I turned to look out  the window to my west because the motion lights came on outside  due to the movment of the taller shubbery in a stiff sudden breeze. It was aleast a 20-25 mph gust from the north. The sonic incident  lasted a total of about 7 to 9 seconds, and there was no light of any  that I noticed. The gust of wind was short-lived. I was headed for  the telephone, so I did not time it. Fearing a gas leak/explosion, I called 911. This was at approximately  3:20 AM. The operator did not even ask details of my home address,  however, she did ask if I was near certain streets in my neighborhood. Within 30 seconds numerous police and fire vehicles were headed into  my neighborhood, and I went out to see and speak to an officer, telling  exactly what I experienced. My husband was asleep, but was awake when I  called for him, he says something woke him, but he did not know what it  was. He did mention feeling a tremble or shaking. He was upstairs. At 3:30 AM my neighbor was walking from the north end of Woodlawn Avenue,  to his house at the next block south. He does not wish to be identified. He is a retired, very well educated professional in educational and  technical fields. He was awakened by the second loud boom, percieved that  it was at ground level, and had headed down the street because he was  sure someone's house had blown up. We dicussed, I told of the preceding  boom and whoosh-hishh, and that strange wind gust. It was very cold, and  I went inside, and called your hot-line. Police and fire sirens were continually heard from 3:20 AM to at least 4:45 AM by me, going all around the surrounding area from downtown to  northern Greensboro. I checked the weather conditions, because I wondered that this could have  somehow been a meteor event that was somehow without visible light. The  ceiling was 3500 feet and below, winds were 5 mph, the clouds were thick,  the humidity only 44%, temperature was 29 degrees F. I am 50 years old, well-educated I suppose, and a professional musician. I often work at night in my home. Unless someone tells me otherwise, I  know that first BOOm was above ground, sonic in nature, and am doubtful  that it was produced by military aircraft. My father was a pilot, and  in the 1960s we grew up under a sky where the military practiced sound  barrier breaking. That whhosh-hisshh was a descending sound. The second  BOOM was near or on ground level, the floor did shake. The wind, possibly,  associated with the event, I can't be sure. There is an expansive park in the area where, from my perspective, this  event concluded, and the fast wind came from that area. As of now, no news  of damage, explosions, mischief, or anything else are known to me. If you  have more info or need more, please feel free to contact me. Thank you.

I saw a very bright light night before last (25th Jan 2009, between 7pm and 8pm UTC) [UTC=GMT; actual U.K. time] while driving a truck south from Bristol, U.K. 90 miles down to Devon, on the M5 motorway. It was in the South-Western sky, and kept getting even brighter so I could even see the diffused light through cloud, and then dimming and completely disappearing before reappearing again, and undulating in it's intensity. The frequency at which it grew and faded was several minutes, being there and going again. It would only take a matter of 5 seconds or less to fade or to reappear in those intervals, and when it faded it would quickly fade to a faint dot before disappearing, rather like those old TV sets when they were switched off. It was not that it was going behind cloud for this would happen in clear sky, and when it was at it's brightest and cloud was obscuring it, it illuminated the cloud somewhat. It was as bright as aircraft landing lights, but obviously it's behavior and position seems to rule that out. While I was in Devon, my friend could still see it some 60 miles away in Bristol, when I called her. (She, and my mother-in-law, have apparently been observing this strange light for up to a week, usually in the same sector of the sky). I observed this phenomena for about an hour as I drove south, seeing it up to my right in a roughly SW direction at about 50° above the horizontal plane. My latitude was about 51°N.(2°W). At first I thought it was an aircraft, but it was too high to have its landing lights on, and after a short amount of observation realized it was not behaving like an aircraft. It maintained what appeared to be a stationary position from my perspective for the hour I observed it, while I drove south. It certainly was not Venus, this I know for certain, I recognize that particular celestial body. Could it be some kind of supernovae? Or perhaps a very high and bright military craft, more likely in orbit. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

I could tell it wasnt a star it was shinning to much and it wasnt a plane cause it kept in one place for more then 20 mins.  So i went to go check out what exactly it was through the window.  As i looked at it. In the corner of my eye in the sky, to the right of this light about 100ft away was another object that caught my eye.  This object was much bigger in size like 3 times bigger.  Only this object was from what i saw for a split second kinda round a flash of lights around the side flashed in a row, then when i turned my eyes to look at it. The object was gone. I knew I saw something so i looked harder and when i looked the object infact had not dissapeared at all. it was still there just very well hidden. I cant really discribe it. It was as if the object had and was trying to blend in with the sky. It did really wel too.( at this point I called my mom to come and look at it incase my eyes were playing jokes on me or if i was krazie) After i pointed out where the hidden object was and then she too saw it. and was lost of words.) I only noticed it cause there was those flashes of quick light and there was a tiny outline of light and an object that was pretty big in size. The object stayed there for almost an hour then slowly started to completly dissapear. I tried to take a picture of the object but when I did the object was to well hidden to show up and the window gave a flash reflection when I tried.)  As for the other light that was there. that too had dissapeared about 2 mins after i started staring at the other object. the bright light literally just dissapeared in the blink of an eye.

The original object started to move in a north-east direction.  It took fifteen to 20 minutes to slowly move about 2-3 miles in that northeasterly direction.

I could not find my car keys, so I was using the spare keys to open the car. I was unable to open my car and after trying several times, one of my friends in the other car came out to help me.

I pointed it out to my friend, who was standing a few feet away from me at the time, and asked her what she thought it was. She said she did not know, but that it was flying very low. The object we saw shaped like a saucer, and it was flying at around a 30° angle to the ground. We could see there were lights at the bottom of it, arranged in a pattern I have never seen on an airplane or helicopter – there were three bright lights (one was orange/red, the other blue, and the third white/yellow) that were very large placed around the circumference of the aircraft. The lights were not beams; they did not illuminate the ground. Some other characteristics of the aircraft that made us sure it was nothing we were familiar with was the speed and agility with which it moved, the UFO seemed to glide through the air at a very high speed without making a sound. It also looked much larger than any plane or helicopter flying at that distance. But the most unusual part of this sighting came when, more or less 45 seconds after first noticing it, the object passed behind a house. We waited around five seconds for it to come out from the other side of the house, but the object didn’t appear. I then started to run down the street to see if I could see it at a different angle, but it was clear the aircraft was no longer there.

There was no sound.  However, she could feel a vibration in her throat and lungs (may indicate a low, sub-sonic vibration).   In the blink of an eye, the ship zipped sideways and disappeared out of sight.   She fetched the cow home and never said a word about the incident to her family.  I asked her why.  She said her parents wouldn't have believed her and she didn't want to be laughed at by her brothers. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

We looked to the North and an object was raising up from the lava beds.  It was round and shiny on top.  It was not more than around one quarter mile away and maybe 300 to 400 feet high.  We had just eaten our lunch, so it was mid day.  A very clear and sunny day.  It was a FLYING SAUCER, plain and clear.  We had apparently disturbed a landed craft.

It was Christmas Eve.  The location was Bellmawr NJ.  It was very late, possibly midnight or later.  It was snowing lightly. My family was just leaving my aunt’s house at a Christmas Eve get-together, exchanging gifts, etc.  It was very late.  It had been snowing lightly but steady enough that there just a dusting of snow on the car.  My father cleared the windshield off quickly with his hands.  I remember this because he didn’t have enough to make a snowball to throw. We started toward the end of the street (St Charles Street, facing southeast).  At the moment we came to the street’s end (St Egbert st) a very, very large black/gray delta shaped object appeared over the tree tops (there used to be a field there, now occupied by homes).  The delta shaped object was very low, perhaps just two hundred feet, and moving slowly enough that it was almost hovering – heading or facing northwest.  It was large enough that it obscured most of the sky.  It was silent.  The leading edges of the delta shaped object were brightly lit in what at the time seemed the strangest possible way.  A single light on each of the two leading edges ran the entire length of the leading edge.  It emitted collimated ‘sheets’ of light, which slowly swept across the ground, homes, and trees from each leading edge. I was in the rear left seat, with a clear view out the car window.  My brother, three years older, had jumped across the back seat and his body weight was on top of me while he gawked out the car window on my side.  I remember my mother saying something, sounding emotional, frightened.  It was at the moment my mother said something that everything seemed to spiral down to some dream like state, like being drugged into unconsciousness. I became aware of four beings, three males and one female.  The female was speaking, or more like singing to me.  It seemed the three males were ‘singing’ to everyone else...I mean everyone else in the area around the ship and car.  I became aware of the presence of our car from another perspective, perhaps looking down at it from some altitude, at the tops of the homes and trees.  The female voice kept singing to me.  It was the sound of a lullaby but had intense imagery and concepts attached to it.  I understood that I was to take it all in. Then I gradually became aware of being in the back seat of the car again.  My brother was no longer on top of me.  My parents were sitting perfectly quiet in the front seat.  There was no sign of the object.  My mother looked at my father and nudged him.  He looked at her, then grabbed the wheel, and just started to move, (the engine was still running) then suddenly stopped.  There was about three inches of snow on the car.  My father had to get out and clear the windshield and front of the car before we could go on. Around 1985 I asked my brother if he had any recollection of the event.  He stammered and said he had, but thought it was just a really weird dream or dreamlike memory.  My father had no idea, in fact, didn’t remember Christmas Eve at my aunt’s house.  My mother couldn’t remember the event.  Oddly, my cousin, who was in the house that we left that Christmas Eve night, remembered that something weird happened, but couldn’t remember what it was.  When I asked what kind of weird, i.e., walls melting weird or can’t remember where she put the keys weird, she stated that she had dreams for many years of that night but wouldn’t go on about what kind of dreams.  I felt that she didn’t want to talk about her weird dreams. I’ve been looking over the years for a record of a sighting in that area and time, would have been Christmas Eve, 1964 or 65, but have found none.  Seems inconceivable that no one else saw this event.  The area is very close to Philadelphia Int’l airport.  However, at that time of night, the airport and tower would have been closed.  I’ve wandered if the three male singing voices were a type of sedating effect over the general area. There is one sighting noted 12/24/65 in Davidsville, PA of a ‘light,’ nothing more. I note that this doesn’t seem to correspond to any of the typical sightings noted over the years.  But that is my memory of it.",,,
"abducted as a child in Tampa, FL, in the 1960s",Tampa,FL,,unknown,unknown,"Occurred : 6/30/1965 02:00  (Entered as : 1960s) Reported: 3/20/2010 5:03:18 PM 17:03 Posted: 4/13/2010 Location: Tampa, FL Shape: Unknown Duration:unknown",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74742.html,"abducted as a child in Tampa, FL, in the 1960s   I was a sleeping elementary school age child, in my own room and in my own bed in Tampa, FL when suddenly, there was light in my room,except the room had no overhead light and I hadn't turned on the light next to my bed. This bedside lamp was the only normal source of light in this room. It was off but there was still much light. This had never happened before. I had a fast impression of someone being next to my bed. I saw, momentarily, what I perceived to be blue jeans on a man's lower body then, with the light still on, but no one next to me,there was suddenly a lot of noise and commotion. In the next instant, ""The Sound of Music"" record played very loudly, presumably from the little portable record player in our living room. My room shared a common wall with the living room. When it went on, I sat bolt upright in bed. My first thought was that someone was there to murder us but I dismissed that idea with the thought that murderers probably didn't make all of this commotion-a killer would be quiet. The music was turned up so loudly that I couldn't believe that my siblings would do something this unusual and dangerous, knowing how violent our parents were. Whichever child was doing this was risking a horrible beating FOR SURE. I touched my bedroom wall with my hand to prove to myself that I was awake. The wall was solid and normal and I could see and feel the paint. I believed I was awake and I laid back down, in terror. Someone was present and making a tremendous amount of ruckus. I was shaking. Then there was a staticy feeling in the air. The room was now dark, the music stopped. I went into shock when I then saw 4 grotestue, blue, wrinkled troll-looking beings in what looked to me to be blue overalls. They were lined up in front of my closet. I thought they looked like drums because they were as stout as they were tall. They weren't tall like a human, they were maybe 3 1/2 - 4 feet tall9maybe smaller) and so wide they were like squares.I must presume that the light must have been back on for me to see them so clearly, to be able to make out color but I didn't think about the light. I was rapidly processing that these were real aliens and this event was really happening, then I was paralyzed. I felt like every molecule in my body was being pulled through the soles of my feet. I fought with all of my will but could not stop the paralysis or the pulling, which was happening very fast. I was totally and completely terrified. The next thing I can remember is being on a grate-type bridge walkway that went into a building or something large. I had the thought that ""this is definately happening to me and no one, not even my mother, will ever be able to help me. I wondered if they were going to keep me. Then, things get confusing in my own ability to be sure of the order of any of the following things that happened. In the place with all the grating, someone was somehow, maybe telepathically telling me that there was a problem somewhere. I was shown a darkened room with giant preying mantises just walking around. I think there was a window or something between me and them because they didn't seem to notice or care about me in any way. Then I was shown a cloaked being in the same room I was in, who I automatically presumed was an old what-ever-she-was because she was very wrinkled and seemed very weak. I was shown this from a perspective of first being behind ""her"", to her right. I saw the dark cloak then the being who was at my side walked me up to look at her face. He told me more about the problem these beings had but its vaque to me. My impression was that whatever the problem was it had led to her appearance and weakness. I remember being in a smaller craft, seeing the stars go by very fast through a window, feeling very alone, and once again realizing that this was real. I definately thought then that I was the only human in this craft. They didn't treat me like a child. There was no comfort offerred, no food, no water, no blanket and no one to help me. It was all matter-fact, like in this transport the beings were just performing a normal routine thing. Again, I'm not sure of the order of events as I only have snippets of scenes in my memory. I remeber walking, with no resistence and not much fear, concern or even interest now. I just went along willingly. I don't know who was with me at this point but my best recollection is of someone short. We passed two human-looking beings to our left. There was a little girl with dark brown or black hair just kind of standing to the left of a large glass cylinder. A human man with dark hair was in the large cylinder. It looked like a large test tube. They didn't take any significant notice of me and oddly I now realize, I didn't make any effort to communicate with them. We never made eye contact. I never even tried to. As we kept walking, he(?), the being, now on my right, continued telling me I don't remember what-until he had me look down at small horizontal portals or screens that showed different military things including an arial view of a large rocket with smoke and ""things"" flying around it. My impression was ""war"" I felt sadness and I definately said or thought loudly ""If you know all this, show me how I'm going to die"" and he did. He showed me a larger vertical screen and I watched myself, as an adult woman with long dark hair walking alone into a high floor of a ski chalet. There was a large picture window and I looked out upon a beautiful scene below of trees and lots of snow. Now, at this point, I feel more like I'm living it rather than watching it. I walked toward the main living room type area. Maybe 8, 10 people were in the living room, most sitting on sofas and some just milling about. I remember thinking that there should be no problem here because I knew most or all of the people. I started to walk to a sofa to sit down and a man just came up behind me and slit my throat. It felt like a true event happening in real time. I felt like I was blacking out, dying, and my last thought in this scenario was ""I can't believe this could happen. I know all of these people. Why isn't someone helping me? Was this a plot they were all in together?"". Then I was back, standing in front of this vertical scene, with the being who had no emotion about my death scene. None. I asked so he showed me. It was just a matter of future history, nothing personal on his part in any way. From there, things are very ""fuzzy"". I felt like I was lying down, in a different place, kind of flooating, then on(?) a white table, with doctors around me and the table, mostly to the left side of me. I felt euphoric-a feeling I would now liken to a narcotic only more exaggerated. One of the doctors said my name!  I felt something like a metal rocket-shaped 'thing' being inserted. I was somehow okay with this!  The next memory is of me in a small spaceship, traveling in my parent's yard to my bedroom window. The being piloting, to my left, was very blond and looked almost like a human male adult but my sense was that he was not human. His skin was too white-opague and his demeanor was like ""nothing"". There only seemed to be room for the two of us in this craft but I could see all around us. I think he telepathically mentioned ants and aloe vera as we flew over some. I'm not sure if I really remember the aloe vera-ant thing or if I conflabbed it. We were very low to the ground. We neared my window and I thought ""Oh, we're going in my window"" but we did not. Still in the small craft, I remeber vividly that I felt very raw (emotionally, not physically), invaded, disappointed, very saddened. Something had been taken from me, from my body. I felt a sad emptiness and the being imparted to me ""Its done. There's nothing you can do about it"" My regret seemed to surprise or confuse this being. Maybe even irritation would describe his affect. This was the only millisecond of ""feeling"" that I received from him. ""Disturbance of the norm""  I heard two whistling, spinning noises, I felt cold, I felt a little spinning then I SAW my own bedcovers UNDER me as I flew into place in my own bed. I don't recall waking up that morning but I obviously did and just went about the morning like it was a normal day. I remembered later in the same day that this had happened. I was walking from my elementary school lunchroom, in line with my classmates, headed back to class when I remembered. I knew the word schizophrenic and knew if I told my mother she would take me to a psychiatrist and that would be what they would say. I knew it had really happened but believed I was the only person in all of history that this had happened to or would happen to. I made my mind up on that sidewalk that day that for my own protection, I could never tell a living soul. I have no idea if this was one event or numerous events that my mind has spliced together. I only remember the paralysis and sucking through the feet feeling happening one other time. I was even more terified the second time and totally determined not to go again. With all my will and strenghth, I moved my right little finger and the paralysis was broken. I've never had the feeling again, never been taken anywhere and have had no conscious awareness of any aliens anywhere since then. The most important thing I can tell you is that when I returned home from school that day and went to use our restroom, I had a straight red line from my naval to my pubis. It was shocking to me but also forced me to admit the reality of this whole thing to myself. The red line looked like a perfect surgical incision had been made and closed but there were no suture marks, no staples, no apparent source of closure. The red line was perfectly straight and is visible to this day. It has become a thin brown line visible from about 3 inches from my naval down to the top of the pubis. I definately welcome inspection of this ""scar"" by medical researchers. No doctor or boyfriend has ever noticed or commented on it. Later, maybe 5 or 10 years later when I first read of animal mutalations, I had chills and anxiety. I felt certain this was the work of the beings who took me. I was a straight A student but a compartmentalized nervous wreck from then until recently. I could not become truly emotionally connected to anyone and I lived in complete terror that something like this would happen to my own daughters. When they came to take me the second time, I felt I was marked in some way or how would they know to take ME again?  Since in the death scenario I had long dark hair and was an adult - once I became an adult I dyed my hair blond, kept it short and knew I would never live in or go to places with ski chalets and snow. Now 54, I find myself in Colorado because I need to live near my oldest daughter who lives here. She is my primary care giver and I truly need her help - so I'm here. I have a devastating terminal disease. Prior to this disease I now have, I lived only in hot places -FL and NV I was so determined to not live out the death scene. I have neuromyelitis optica and I am now blind. My immune system is shredding my nervous system one cranial nerve at a time. This began in the 80's.It is a very rare disease and one of the few conditions that causes both blindness and paralysis in the patient, then leads to death by the failure of the intercoastal muscles.  I hated the beings my whole life. I hated that they took an innocent, already traumatized child without even asking the child. It was a violent kidnapping in my opinion. Now that I am aware of so many stories similar to mine, I'm calmer in one respect(I'm not the ONLY one) but now, I'm very concerned for all humankind. What is going on?!  I have been diagnosed with PTSD from chilhood abuse and adult onset PTSD from going blind. A more correct diagnosis would have been lifelong PAS, I have no doubt. To clarify one of answers regarding number of craft seen-I said 3. I may have seen one from the outside, in my yard, during the same event but everything else was inside a craft. I count them as 1-the grating & preying mantises, the little girl, the death scene and the medical stuff 2-the craft in which I was flown rapidly by a military type ""crew"" and 3- the tiny ship from which the blond took me across the yard and into my room. I had a horrible childhood in every possible way because of the on-going anxiety and terror from this event, the constant beatings from my adoptive parents and a year of molestation by my 5th grade teacher. I became a life-long loner. In the 90s, I told one friend and both of my daughters of the event. All three said they believed me, which makes it possible for me to tell you now. I also told a boyfriend who was a paramedic and is now a nurse in a infant and children's trauma ward in LV. He did not believe my story was real but does believe that I believe it. He believes that this is a cover story created by my mind because I cannot accept that I was raped as a child. He doesn't believe in UFOs and thinks we are alone in this vast universe. I was NOT raped as a child. Beaten by parents, molested by a teacher but there was no rape event. I can't really care if anyone believes me or not. It doesn't change any of what happened. I feel like my whole life was stolen from me. I've not had one day since the event that I felt normal or that I fit in anywhere. There is some relief in knowing that people, lots of people worldwide, now know of these kinds of abductions and that there is at least investigation being done now. I used to pray that one day there would be a registry or someway to tell legitimate researchers and scientists what happened to me in the hope of one day really understanding why they picked me. Because I believe it neccessary for my good mental health to forgive them, I do, to a point, but I still hate the little, blue drum-like ones who took me with absolutely no regard for me, my terror, my youth. I like to think that if they ever came along now that I wouln't be frightened of them. I think I would be bold and demand some answers this time. I worry about, but also look forward to some kind of event where all the abductees are made known to the world so people will know that this really happened to lots of us and perhaps, is still happening to some people, especially children. I believe I saw 6 different kinds of aliens : 1-the horrible little blue drum-like ones who took me, 2-the preying mantises,3- the ""crew"" of the shuttle 4-the ""explainer"" who walked me past the two humans and showed me the ""war"" pictures and my own alleged death. 5- the doctors and 6-the very white man who took me home through my ceiling. Very oddly, I have no direct recall of any of the ""greys"" with the big eyes, claimed by so many abductees but I also can't tell you what the""crew"" or the ""explainer"" or the doctors looked like at all. I don't know why I can't remember something this important, but in 40+ years I've never remembered their faces. I was adopted at birth from McDill AFB and have speculated that the doctor who knew my name might have been a human military doctor. In 1979 I had to have an emergency surgical procedure (a right oophorectomy) because my right ovary had become gangrenous from ""torsion of the tube"". No eggs were visible in this ovary upon removal nor upon follow-up microscopic examination. No doctor was able to explain this or determine where my eggs were,  or if there had ever been any in that ovary. I had a normal pregnancy in 1980 and gave birth to my second daughter. She has extra vertebrae in her neck and was born with eyes so almond-shaped I worried for a time that she might be mongoloid. She is not. In 1983, following the 1979 removal of my right ovary and a 1982 surgical procedure to eliminate some of the remaining left fallopian tube to insure contraception, and with my partner having had a vasectomy, I was told that I was pregnant again. I lost the baby and all the attending physician would tell me is that the baby was not normal. I was not shown the baby. In 2008, following 7 years of total menopause and having no partner for 8 months, as my boyfriend had died, I was again told I was pregnant. I was 52 years old. I was hospitalized for 3 days and all 12 blood pregnancy tests came back positive, as well as all urine tests. The hospital lab was in a bit of an uproar about ""the old, blind pregnant lady with no partner"". I was released into the care of my family practioner who administered a blood pregnancy test in her office two weeks later. It came back negative. (The emergency room doctor seemed extremely interested in the fact that I had torsion of the tube in my 20s but he never elaborated. He just seemed very excited and interested in this fact. So much so that I wondered then and I wonder now, WHY was this of so much interest to him? As his name is on the medical record as the admitting doctor, I hope one day someone will ask him why this was a big deal to him. No other medical professional has ever raised an eyebrow when I mention it, yet he was incredulous and focused on it at length. He then performed an ultrasound and determined that my womb was empty. He admitted me, baffled). Because I had chemotherapy in 2007-09 for this neuromyelitis optica, my doctor believes I was experiencing endocrine changes. I think this is likely correct as I have had no other encounters since the 60s of which I am aware. Truthfully, I think the neuromyelitis is a result of both the chil abuse and the abduction. I think it was all too much for my nervous system. I see a very qualified neuro-opthomologist who has no idea at all why I have this disease. I've never had the courage to tell any medical professional treating me or any mental health professional of the abduction because I believe they will label me ""insane"". I'm not. I have been troubled and anxious for 40+ years. I have attempted suicide too many times to count (okay, 5). The most recent event, in 2008, was a compulsive act that I felt was not entirely of my own accord. Suddenly, one afternoon, I wanted very much to put a screwdriver through my left wrist, which makes absolutely no sense to me. I did not do that but with almost an uncontrollable intensity, I took an over-dose of Wellbutrin and Prozac. Somehow, I took just the right combination for the drugs to balance each other out and though I spent the night in intensive care, I had almost no effect from the 15 pills or more that I ingested. No nausea, no vomiting, no convulsions, not even a hiccough. I can't believe how out of control of myself I felt while taking the over-dose. It was a manic event that still doesn't make sense to me. Never have I heard of ""death by screwdriver"" and I'm no handyman. Usually, I don't even own a screwdriver and have never at any other time thought about a screwdriver in any odd way like this. I am a mother. If I were really going to intentionally kill myself there is no doubt that I would leave lengthy letters of explanation for my adult daughters. I would make logical plans, I would give away treasured momentos, I would say good-bye to those I love, yet, I didn't do any of this. I just felt  this over-whelming impulse to put a screwdriver through my own wrist. Instead, I took lots of pills very quickly. I remember counting 12, 13, 14...like they were M&Ms, instead of strong medications. I was a medical professional myself (an EMT and medical writer) and NEVER would I do this. And yet, I did. The other 4 attempts prior were clustered from 2001 to 2004 and were also compulsive acts. No planning, just action that seemed to be out of me instead of from me. I tried to jump off a mountain (my daughter decked me to keep me from doing this), I ran out into traffic (everyone stopped), I went to a desolate location in an attempt to die from exposure and starvation (this was clearly going to take a long time and be painful) and I asked someone I didn't know to get heroin for me so I could over-dose. I took twice the amount they said would be dangerous and waited. All I got was a headache. Obviously, I'm not very good at suicide. I don't think I will ever try again because now, if I felt the compulsion, I would resist totally. Enough of my life has been taken from me by others. Once I made the connection that the US military was probably involved in this, which was only recently, I began to feel much stronger but also even more angry. What do I think? I think I was taken by aliens but that the doctor who knew my name was human and that both were somehow benefitting from whatever they did to me. I truly think I was selected because I was an adoptee from an AFB and was already traumatized. Obviously, all of the medical information I am recounting is verifiable through medical and hospital records, which I'm happy to provide to any legitimate researcher. I welcome the opportunity to have truth serum administered and would agree to be hypnotized by a medical professional. In both scenarios I would ask that a video recording be made of the entire questioning procedure and I would want a trained UFO researcher present in both cases. Its taken my whole life to put these snippets together. I remembered some of it that day but was an adult before I realized why I always had to have a rectangular white dining table. I could almost remember but not quite, then one day in Sarasota, FL, following the purchase of my 3rd or 4th white rectangular table, I remembered. I was on one. I think it possibly emitted white light. How else would I know it was white if I was lying on it? I don't remember anyone removing my clothing, nor do I know how my clothing was returned to my body. Unlike the other stories I've been reading on the Internet, I was not shown any babies or told anything about hybrids. I wasn't asked to touch or hold anything or anyone. I now think they took eggs from my right ovary and I think they left the fallopian tube and ovary malpositioned which resulted in the torsion. It might have been intentional because the gangrene certainly made it impossible for doctors to tell what had happened to my right ovary and eggs. I believe they take children because we are closer to their size. Even now as I write this, I feel sick to my stomach and sweaty. I would give most anything to know the whole truth of what happened to me - and apparently others- and WHY. Finally, let me say that I am a professional writer and have been virtually my whole adult life. If I were going to make up a story, I promise you, it would make a lot more sense than this. I WISH I was making it up. Though it happened to me, it remains almost too incredible for me to believe but the scar is still there. Before she passed in 2003, my mother and I spoke of the scar. All she really said was ""yeah, you have had that for a long time."" I don't know why she said this because NEVER did I show it to her or tell her about it in any way. She never commented if and when she really ever saw it, yet she acted like ""yeah, aliens, no big deal."" No surprise, no questions. I thank you with my whole heart for providing this forum to people like myself who have kept this horrible secret inside ourselves for our whole lives. I hope someone will contact me and help me sort it out. Due to the blindness, phone contact is the best way to reach me. I would accept a collect call but I only have a cell phone and they don't permit collect calls. I can't read my own e-mail and must have others read it for me. I would prefer not to have to talk about it with anyone except a valid researcher. Thank you very much - and if you are connected to the military in any way DO NOT contact me. And I better not have any MIBs hanging around once I submit this to you. I am so NOT even kidding. If I am contacted by ANYONE except a UFO researcher, I WILL DENY that I wrote this and swear that it never happened. If you are truly valid UFO researchers, I hope you will know by content that this DID happen. Please give me a chance to provide the little proof that I have (the scar).

Since a number of highly credible sightings, which included photos during the summer of 1967, I am using the 1967 date but I can't actually remember the date other than I am positive it was summertime. Object was spherical, metallic-grey (gray), scratched or scuffed surface, perfectly stationary and seemed very close (<500 ft). Vague memory of ""heat waves"" eminating around it but couldn't be mirage as it was well above the ground.  More like an optical distortion.  Appeared spherical due to sun shaping it as it would a ball. Hovered over golf course and was brought to our golfing party's attention by other golfers so there were more than 3 percipients.  Sky was very clear blue and the weather was sunny and warm and object was almost due West.  Gave up trying to make sense of it and teed off. Looked back halfway down the fairway and it was still there but slightly more SW direction which is another reason I feel it was very close.

As I turned off Main Street, I noticed a bright flash in the sky to the north.  I turned my head to the left and saw the sun glint off of something in the sky.  It had to have been highly polished and metallic.  I live in an area where I see all kinds of crafts: jetliners, blimps, private planes, I even saw fighter jets over my house after “9/11”.  This looked different, very different.  I didn’t turn my head back and proceed on my way.  I actually pulled over to the curb and stared.  What I saw were two objects.  They were close enough that I was to be able to discern certain features but far enough away not to be able to be precise about the features.  They were moving in tandem at about 200 mph (the same speed of an airline on approach that I typically see at Laguardia Airport and were under the low hanging clouds, which I estimate were at 2,000 feet or so.  One was larger and appeared to caplet-shaped.  The other was smaller and followed the first.  It was spherical but not perfectly round.  What was dramatic about this was that they were incredibly close to one another, as closer as fighter jets from a squadron that fly in formation.  At first, I thought the larger was towing the smaller but then I dismissed that thought.  Then I observed that there is no way that air traffic in the NYC metropolitan area would be allowed to fly so close to another craft. They flew in a perfectly straight line but never did the distance or perspective between the two change.  I observed this for a good 30 seconds as they moved off and away.  As I biked off I had to analyze what I saw and decide whether, in fact, they were UFOs or not.  What convinced me that I believe they were is the fact that no noise emanated from them and I don’t recall seeing any wings on these crafts.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,40.75329126637554,-73.81827794759825

Once we got on the bridge, my passenger and I had a clear view of the object.    It appeared to be a few thousand feet in the air, located in the bay between Bayonne and Elizabeth, NJ.  The triangular pattern of its three blinking red lights made me suspicious that it may be a jet liner heading for Newark Airport, but it looked nothing like the many other planes in the sky and was not on the normal approach pattern to the airport.   The object, when first viewed, appeared to be saucer shaped, with a raised flat top.  As we moved further along the bridge, the craft appeared to elongate into a cylindrical shape, however it seemed that the orientation of the craft to my car changed so I assume I was just getting a different view of the craft.   The craft, in addition to the lights, had a strange whitish blue hue to it that illuminated its body and made it stand out against the night sky.  It appeared to be moving slowly eastbound, but it is hard to say if it was really moving at all.

One of my friends mentioned, maybe its government top secret stuff, but why would they throw a huge light on it unless they were trying to make it disinformation...? WHO KNOWS!!!It kept moving every time it turned black, somehow, reappearing and moving north, from the south west.I believe we stood around for maybe a little under ten minutes, but my knees started shaking and my eyes were watering, and I can freak out pretty fast if I'm not expecting a creepy night, so we decided to get some rum and sit inside like normal old folks in this mobile community.-I'd also like to mention, there were many many aircraft(helicopters) in our small airspace, and after a whi! le the s ky became completely covered in dark high up fog!?what for?",2008-10-31T00:00:00,35.26286675126904,-120.62478857868018

On 9/20/08 at approximately 10:30pm I was sitting on a back porch by myself. It was  a very clear night with good visibility. I was watching plans that were off in the distance, the airport is about 30 miles from the house.. Most of the planes  were coming from the North then heading East. Then from behind a large tree to the North I saw what looked like 3 balloons tied together forming a triangle shape. They were not lit up , more like illuminating from the lights below and the moon. The object looked silver and moved very slow with no sound. Then it moved very fast covering a large distance, then slowed down again and then went backwards a ways. At this point I called for my dad and aunt to come see. I realized it was not balloons. This was far to big to be. The object kind of hovered in the same spot for a few seconds, looking  like a ball would look floating on water. Then it made a fast movement to the South West, then turned West and what looked like straight up, then it was gone. About 2 minuets later two military jets flew by. They both went to the East. Finally my family came out and watched the sky with me for a while. All we saw after that were  commercial airplanes.  I have had several sightings all in Arizona. This was unlike the other two objects I have seen.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,35.71733365853658,-78.8808643902439

A third light of equal brightness maintained position roughly 5 degrees higher at an 11-o’clock position during the entire observation.  As I drove west toward the lights, I observed the lights maintain a distance from one another that at first blush the lower two could have been lights positioned on the wing tips of a commercial airliner.  As the lights moved closer together, I assumed it was an airliner, even though I could not see a wing structure or fuselage; it seemed to be moving away.  The only major discrepancy was that the lights brightness and size remained the same. Just a few seconds after the lights nearly merged, they separated, moving quickly apart in an upward/downward arc, positioning themselves in a vertical configuration.  As I continued west, I lost sight of the objects, as area I entered was predominately covered in a low-lying fog.

I had him explain what he had seen to me since they dimmed out and I was unable to see them myself.  A few minutes later he said he had just seen the lights again but they had gone out already.  I looked in the area of where he was saying he saw them.  I saw a red light further to the right of where I thought he was pointing, from a tower, and he said that was not the light he saw.  At 06:32 p.m. he told me the lights were back.  I looked over and saw two orange lights in the sky above the tree line, parallel to the ground.  I saw a string of orange light that was not as bright as the lights, shoot from each ball of light in an upwards arc back down to the same level as the one it originated from.  When the strings of light would come back down to the same level of the ball of light, a new ball of orange light would appear.  The ball of light it originated from would dim away.  The string of light would then dim away from the originating ball to the new orange ball of light.  The two lights were the same color and the distance of the strings appeared to be the same but the lights were not arcing/forming new balls of light at the same time.  The lights repeated this process about eight times each and lasted approximately 30 seconds total before both lights went out completely.  The lights were moving from North to South.

Further observation showed that the object was denser than what was immediately thought to be a small black cloud in the otherwise cloudless night sky. The object was slanted about 30 degress from bottom right to upper left. The bottom of the craft was flat with sharper edges on the two bottom corners and the top was flat but a little more curving. The object was completely black with a small change of color going towards dark grey from top to bottom. The object was motionless and after several minutes of observation began to turn in on itself, implode into a small sphere and then vanished into nothing. The object then appeared to quickly return to its original shape. This happened again, and the second time it disappeared competely. About 5-10 minutes later, the object appeared again, although this time was above the shoreline towards the pier down the left side of the beach, a distance of about 50 miles from where it was originally seen.

Then it got even brighter like a thrust or something and shot across the sky moving parallel to the canal. What ever this thing was moved faster then a plane. I continued to watch this to me a UFO until I couldn’t see it anymore. Thank for your time, and if you have any questions please contact me.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,37.9855,-75.84939999999999

As I was driving home, I had noticed that the moon was completely covered with clouds and on the other side, the sky was clear and the stars were bright as ever. 2 of the stars were extremely brighter than the others so when I got home I got out of my car and stood there looking up for awhile. I went inside and my fiance came home not too long after I came in.  I was telling her what I saw so she suggested that we go back outside and look again.  It was now about 2:45am and she quickly noticed exactly what I was speaking about.  They were bright orange and shiny, and located in the southern part of the sky. We both continued to look up when all of a sudden, one of the bright things started to move - first in a clockwise direction, then it went up, down, side to side and back into a circular motion. That continued for about 5 minutes when all of a sudden there was a burst of light with a trail - it almost looked like a shooting star but it never fizzled off, instead it created the trail and stopped abruptly and all of a sudden appeared another bright thing that started also moving in a circular motion, and side to side. We watched these 2 things move around the sky zipping back and forth, and creating a circular motion for about 20 minutes.  We came back inside and my fiance went to bed.  I couldn't sleep so I went back outside to see if these things were still in the sky and they were - in the same spot that they were before.  Now it was about 4am.  The objects were still moving but this time, were a little slower as if they were just hanging out.  I stayed out there for about 15 minutes and then came back in. This all occurred Saturday night/Early Sunday Morning. Sunday night / into Monday morning, one of these objects was back but this time it was in the western part of the sky.

I decided to go out for a smoke before bed. It was about 4:45 am or so. I live in a suburban area about 20 minutes drive from an active airport.  My house is directly under a flight path and many planes fly overhead on a daily basis. I am very familiar with the appearance of planes flying at night. I can recognize them at varying distances, in all weather conditions including foggy nights, (I live in a very foggy place.)  If it is visible I can usually say if it is a plane, because of the light colour and flashing patterns that are common to them.  Anyway, around 4:45 some time in late October of 2009. I was outside having a smoke. It was a clear night and I was admiring the stars I could see from my porch and the drone of the nearby airport, contemplating the shape of the Universe, after watching some videos of lectures regarding the subject.  Suddenly there was a thick arc of white light which bent from the sky toward the ground as if it were and arc fitting nicely into a 90 degree angle. I could not see if it stopped beyond the horizon as the treeline was obstructing my view. I have observed both meteors and satellites with the naked eye. They do not resemble what I saw. This was a thick white streak at least several meters wide, and quite distant. Though what was most impressive was the speed at which it traveled. I saw the 'object' for no more than a second. And it initially appeared quite high in the sky, a little lower than the moon.  It appeared as a white arcing flash of light which left a trail that subsided  pretty well instantaneously. I was awestruck and my first thoughts were: “What?-So fast!” The other thing that struck me was the odd blur on the periphery of the arc.  Perhaps it was a natural phenomenon, like none I had prior seen. But my guess it was some sort of gravity manipulating craft. This is partly based upon my understanding of theoretical propulsion systems, and some of the more credible reports I have read regarding US and Canadian government activities involving UFOs.

Which reminded me we must finish up so I don’t miss any of the game. I told the girls “wave” to the blimp. It was at that point I noticed a white object above the blimp. Vanessa saw it too. It was just sitting there not moving. I asked Stephanie to get my binoculars. We watched this white egg shaped object for maybe 5 minutes when all of a sudden as I have the object in view, a dark object fly’s up right next to the white one. They are just sitting there together for about 2 minutes then the dark one speeds off to the south. They were both the same size ,same shape just different color. We turned our attention back to the white one which had moved to another area in the sky. At one point it looked as though it was close to the flight path of planes.

I was in my second story bedroom, when a bright light caught my eye. Our house is quite close to the local airport and is almost directly under a common flight path taken by incoming airplanes. It is therefore extremely common to observe planes with bright, white flight lights approaching from the south. For a number of reasons, however, this was different:  1. Even indoors with the windows closed, you can always hear approaching passenger planes. They are very loud, because they are very low. This object made no sound audible from inside the house. 2. The path taken by planes on their approach is completely predictable (essentially, they go over our neighbor's house to the east). This went over our neighbor's house to the west. 3. It was moving very slowly. Because it was a light in the sky, I feel it's hard to say how far up it was; it seemed like it wasn't much higher than 2 or 3 times the height of the tall, mature trees in our neighborhood. Could be wrong about the height. Regardless, it appeared to be making the progress of a car going around 5mph (if it was as close as it appeared). 4. The light was bright amberish orange, unlike the lights of the passenger jets that pass overhead ... bright white at first and then red and blue flashing lights as they get closer. Because it looked odd, I went outside to our porch to get a better look. I found it in the sky again outside. I could still hear no sound. Again, it seemed strange because it was moving so slowly. Its path was completely straight and it moved from roughly south to north. I tried to film it with my cheap digital camera, but the camera was unable to pick up the small light. After a minute of observation, it had finally reached a point parallel with our house. Then, the light dimmed out completely. As I turned to go back inside, a speck of light shot very quickly upwards from the point where the light had dimmed. This final observation, of sudden insanely fast movement, is what really spooked me. I've seen plenty of lights in the sky that have seemed odd, but I always felt that my impression could be a misinterpretation of something mundane.

As I continued, it became apparent that I was looking at a ""triangle UFO)- one light at the front, and the other two on the sides. Having grown up in Dayton, I know that this had no colored wingtip lights. I could then see a slowly blinking red light on the bottom (it was dark and I could not make out the actual form. I continued driving and rolled down my window to see if I could hear a jet engine- no, only wind and road noise. Looking up, when the red light came on, I could see the solid flat, dark surface of the area right behind the light. I rolled up my window and then caught a glimps of the craft in my rear view mirror. I could see two red lights on the back end. The craft was right over the median grass strip of the highway, moving East to West, very slowly. Size-wise, it would have been the size of one of the C-5A cargo jets that Wright-Patt has on base. No way this was one of those, which I've seen for years and years, practicing touch and gos at the base.

A friend and I were on a road trip in CA heading North on the 5 Freeway in the Fresno and Merced counties area.  At the beginning of sunset we both noticed four distinct very bright objects in the sky that seemed to be reflecting the sun's light.  From where we were they looked like grains of rice or possibly disks, they were angled diagonally but one seemed to be more circular (probably due to the angle we were looking from).  The objects were completely stationary for the entire time that we saw them- NO trajectory or flight path, NO smoke or trail- completely stationary for at least 4 or 5 minutes until stratus clouds rolled in and the sun went down.

Interestingly was it seemed to have a well-defined start and end from a direction of WSW to ENE or a heading of 60 degrees from north.  A very small of indistinguishable shape object in the front seemed to be the source of the smokey emission. After the passing of a minute or so, the apparent emitting object was a visual one-inch at 20-inch arm’s length ahead of the trail. The trail appeared to be 4” long.  To observe better, we drove under a cross-country power line to give us good visual reference at distance to observe two more features, one of which was the trail and the object appeared not to move for about 2 minutes and contact was lost with the object either as darkness was approaching or just too small to see.  The trail after 5 minutes of observation seemed to begin to break up.  Its total length never appeared to be greater than 4 inches at the 20 inch arm length. The color of the trail was much darker than a jet would have been. My explaination.  The dispersion of the trail gave the appearance of something at altitudes between 5,000 and 50,000 feet running an internal combustion engine with piston that had just broken an oil ring or an oil leak in an engine causing a black smoke to come from the engine until the engine exhausted all its oil and locked up or shut down.  Though the sun had just set, the sky was well bright enough to distinguish this event from a standard jet trail by virtue of the darkness of the apparent smoke.  The other unique feature was the sudden start of the trail and the sudden end to the trail and the extremely small object continuing with a 060 heading after the smoke trail finished.

It was completely dark that night and the shape of the object other than the lights was difficult to distinguish.  It was difficult to get a distance on the object as it was so big.  If it was close to us (within say half a mile) I would estimate it was 300 to 400 yards or more in length and maybe 80 to 120 yards or more high.  If it was further away, it was bigger than that.   The object was flying in a northerly direction at a fairly slow speed and not at high elevation.  It flew out of sight heading over the mountains.

It was late at night, my best guess would be around ten p.m.  My family was sitting around the campfire and I walked out to look at the lake.  Across the lake directly West of where I was standing on the opposite bank were three lights that formed a triangle.  The triangle it formed was huge and originally I though that it was merely the intersecting  of three tower lights, perhaps from the plant that is in Ponca City or from oil rigs.   As I continued looking at it, however, I noticed that it was moving.  It was moving very very slowly and was very close to the ground.  Since I knew it was moving I started to consider maybe it was three military airplanes flying together in formation and I was looking at their front lights.  That didn’t match up either though because as low as it was there is no aircraft that I know of that could fly that slow.  Also, I ruled out that it was three separate aircrafts because the lights started to turn off one at a time.  One would turn off and then come back on, another might flicker and go off and then come back.  I watched it for about 5-10mins and then left.  I have never really believed in aliens and what I saw intrigued me but that’s about it.

It traveled what to me seemed miles before turning back. On another occasions, and this really frightened me, I was going to work at the shipyard where I work. It was about 9:30 at night. I looked to my left and sitting up in the sky was an object with orange light in the outline of a commercial jet. But this was way to large to be a jet and it was not moving.  It just sat there what I believed to be right over the river. I drove on a block before looking back up. The orange lights were replaced by 3 large white lights in the shape of a triangle. Very huge. I set my eyes back on the road and suddenly there was this bright light that seemed to me like someone setting off a flash on a camera. It lit up the trees and the rooftops, and when I looked back the object was gone.   This object to me later as I went over it’s size had to be as big as a football field, or damn near as big.

Not long after the radio traffic concerning this light began, a deputy reported that the craft was moving off in a south easterly direction and soon afterwards, the shift supervisor for dispatch ordered talk of this incident silenced and they must have switched over to a tac frequency as we heard nothing more about it on the scanner.

The fuselage was not round but it was more like a boat hull but not noticeably rounded at the bottom, either. From the bottom of the craft to the top of the fuselage, it must have been between about thirty and forty or so feet and it must have been sixty to seventy feet to possibly eighty feet in length. There was arching violet to purple colored electricity all over the hull and wings of the craft but particularly the wings. The electricity reminded me of the kind you see in a TESLA coil. I could feel, smell, and hear the noises of the exhaust gasses as the ship hovered. There was a hatchway, a debarking/embarking stairway passage door, and there was a man about six feet tall standing in the hatchway. The hatchway was at the bottom of the fuselage, and behind him, you could see a staircase going up to a higher deck inside the ship. He just sort of looked at me, and I looked back. I didn't act surprised, and in another instant, the ship zipped away. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

It was darker than the night sky, no lights, but also seemed somewhat transparent in that the outside/frame/shape was more clearly defined than the middle.

I could barely hear it when it went almost right over my head moving off to the southeast. I’d like to know what I saw.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,37.103904615384614,-80.42051846153846

From what I could see of the front of the craft at that moment, it was equal in width to a large 747 jet, and had two large solid white lights on each end, and a small blinking redish light somwehere else on the object. It was fairly low to the ground, and I watched through my passenger windows as it flew over my car and temporarily out of my sight, so I turned out my driver's window, looking back and forth to the road, to wait for the object to re-appear, but not seeing it for approximately 20 seconds. I looked forward and saw the object was now in clear view, but substantially ahead of me on the highway still traveling south. At this point I could see that the object was a solid black triangle against the dark bluish night sky, all sides the same length. The rear was a point, and the front was a flat side. The small blinking redish/pink light was on the tail and the large white lights were on the face of the two front tips of the triangle. It continued moving south away from the highway until out of sight. There was another large white light far away in that southern direction as well, though I saw no detail of it. If it was an airplane though it certainly saw this object as it was moving in it's general direction.

The dates I listed of the sighting are approximate as it was a long time ago when I was young. I've never seen anything like it again, and would never claim to anything that I did not firmly believe I saw. I  am 45 years old, and saw this when I was approximately 10-11, so I'd say it was in 1975. I havn't told anybody about it until a couple years ago as I thought nobody would believe me. I can see it as clearly in my head as I could when I saw it as a kid. It was a clear, bright sunny blue-sky day around high noon when I was walking home to my grandmothers' from a cousin's house on one of the backroads of Noxen. No drugs, booze, glue-sniffing etc. I was a pretty clean and straight kid and had just spent the morning hanging out with my cousin. The road runs along the back side of town at the bottom of a mountain known as Schooley's Peak. The peak of the mountain is clearly visible from the section of road I was walking. Something caught my eye and I looked up at the top of Schooley's Peak and there was this large bright metallic silver cigar shaped smooth object hovering at an angle of approximately 20 degrees directly over the top of the mountain peak at an altitude I would guess to be about 50-75 feet from the top of the peak, just well over the treetops. It was large, and the length of the craft was a longer  than the hover altitude so I'd say it was somewhere around 75-100 feet in length. There were small dark horizontal slits dead center of the object running the entire length. If I were to guess I'd say there were about 15-25 of them. There was no sound, no lights, it was completely silent and just hanging over the mountain top. I observed it for about 10-15 seconds, I remember a feeling of fear setting in and I looked away for a moment, then looked up again and it was gone, just vanished silently and did not return. I don't remember anything else after that happened that day, I don't even remember the walk the rest of the way home, I'm sure it was due to the overwhelming sight that I saw. I just found your website today and searched Noxen, PA. I was surprised to see there was another sighting there and decided to post my experience. It's a very small, backwoods town. The only thing unique about Noxen is that it is bordering a very large area of deep woods with practically no population at all, and no passable roads with the exception of some logging roads and rudimentary dirt roads. I'll sketch a quick drawing of what I saw and include a google maps link to show the area I was in. Thanks! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I mean to be alone with this! my whole life and find this is no way a coincidence.  What I really want to do is see if we can compare sketches of what we saw.  Please help me this is so important to me. I need to tell you what happen to me as a child though because I probably have thought about it every day of my life.  It was somewhere between 9-11 pm...I don't know exactly what I was doing prior to going into the bathroom, but I went into the bathroom and was standing in front of the toilet.  Immediately to the right of the toilet is a window that you can freely look out.  I glanced out the window and was immediately captivated by what I saw.  Above the tree line was this craft hovering above the trees.  Around the bottom of the saucer was lights flashing in a sequence all around the bottom of it, lights going in circles.  These light panels so to speak were also windows.  In the center on the top was a cap that may have been clear.  I knew the second I saw it exactly what it was, which was a UFO.  I also knew deep down inside something was aware that I was watching it.  It wasn't a scary feeling of any type, but I knew someone was aware of me.  It mostly hovered the whol! e time in the same place.  I knew what I was looking at and was so excited that I ran into the living room and was screaming for my parents to come and look at this.  We ran back to the window for me to show him and I pointed out the window.  He was starring out the window going, ""where, where??""  Here is the total bizarre thing...the UFO was sitting there as clear as can be and I am starring at this thing pointing and screaming at it and he just could not see it at all.  I also was then set in with a feeling that for whatever reason, it isn't possible for him to see what I can see.  As this was going on, I can still feel this really weird awareness.  This sense that they are aware of me, and I am aware of them, and at this time I am only able to see it.  I don't know how that is possible but as a child this was all crystal clear to me.  I also was aware that they were now leaving and I watched it slowly move away from me as it is leaving, again I had this awareness inside ! they were leaving and still can feel them watching me as they ! moved aw ay, and then there was just this sudden zip away from me and it disappeared. I am going to try and explain one other thing that is probably going to sound absolutely nuts!  Truth is, from the time I saw the craft out the window, to the time I ran out for my parents, I really have no idea how long that time is.  It feels like it is only a moment, but something deep down inside me feels like it was actually a lot longer, but ""made"" to feel like a moment or two.  I feel like I just completely lost a sense for solid time during this period.  Even after the whole thing was over, I still had this feeling of ""lost time.""  My memories feel fluid, but even today there is this feeling of lost time somewhere in there like something happen to me but I really have no idea what. There is something else that is very odd and probably completely off the wall.  I have no idea why I associate what I am going to say with the sighting but I have always wonder this my adult life.  I have also never told another soul this in the world because I would think somebody is completely nuts if they told me this.  Around the time of all this in my life I have noticed a little bump under my skin on my shin that's like a small pellet.  I didn't have any type of accident, there is no scar, no childhood accident that would of cause this but my whole adult life I have always felt that something was put there by them somehow.  I have no memory of anything like this at all happening surrounding the craft, but something sick in my stomach tells me otherwise.  One of these days I am going to get that thing cut out and find out exactly what it is. Anyway...the report you have I am certain by his description of the craft that we witnessed the same thing.  Is there some way of digging a little deeper into this?  Oh...I don't want what I reported to be put out to the public...it's really embarrassing. Thanks ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2010-04-13T00:00:00,40.781,-73.2522

My little dog jumped out of the truck and ran to some nearby garbage cans, I assumed she saw a cat. I just happened to look up to admire the clear, starry night sky.  Almost directly above me was a huge, dark triangular shape.  It had three lights, one in each corner.  I was terrified.   I shouted to my husband "" what is that?"" he said ""a helicopter"".  It was no helicopter, this thing made absolutely no sound whatsoever and the sheer size of it blotted out the star filled sky above me.  I called my dog a few times until she finally came back to me and I grabbed her up.  The object will still hanging above me, motionless and without a sound.  I ran up the steps to the house and as I reached the porch, the triangle darted off toward in a northeasterly direction.

It had the appearance of molten glass and as it grew larger what looked like static electricity dissipated from its perimeter.  It grew dimmer as it got larger then simply just vanished only to reappear as a smaller more brighter sphere as before. I felt I co! uld throw a rock at it and hit it as it was so close.  Then it vanishes again. we could see stars in background where object was. Sped home to retrieve a Polaroid camera when we returned we waited at the site, Object never returned.

I now believe it was not a dream but an abduction experience.  This occurred in Huntsville, Alabama at night. I have three memories: I was placed in a seat that looked like plastic similar to fast food restaurants.  It was curved and had a high back that protruded above my head.  I was not belted in the seat but I was stuck there and could not move.  My eyes were open but unable to move so I could only see in front of me.  There was a man sitting across from me in a same type of seat, and he was not moving either.  I could see more seating behind him but with the design I could not see anyone sitting. The second memory I woke up and was on a table in the middle of a room.   I was laying with my head in the south and my feet in the north.  My eyes could not look around, but I could see part of the ceiling and part of the wall on my right.  It appeared to look rounded and somewhat reminded me of commercial office partitions, grey/silver and flat.  I did not know where I was, then my head rolled to the left and I saw a woman walking up a small ramp to a door that I heard open with a ""swish"" sound, like a hatchback car when you open it.  I could see a little of the hall way and it appeared to curve slightly. The woman was wearing a red bodysuit and seemed to be physically fit.  I saw her head was different, it was larger in the back like it was deformed and her hair was blonde and extremely thin like a chemo patient that is losing most of their hair.  She was on the west side of the room and to the left of me. She had to know I was looking at her from behind because after the door opened she quickly turned and looked at me.  I saw her in the front view before she knocked me back out apparently with her mind, she did not say anything.  Her body seemed human but I have never seen a face similar to her. She had a bigger forehead and bigger eyes than a human, her nose was extremely small, almost no cartilage and reminds me of Michael Jacksons small nose.  Her mouth was small too with very thin lips. The last memory I was in a different seat facing west looking at black windows.  I saw the seat I had been in and it was emply, I still could not look around but I saw a door to the north behind the seat I was in in the first memory.  I was next to the wall and remember the rectangle rounded windows. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date during 1981 is approximate.

AKA county rd.[529] on there way to TOP's appliances which is at the corner of [529] and NJ state HWY 27. Now I know this has taken an incredibly long time to reported by I can remember there accounts of this very vividly. And no, this report is not intended as a joke or hoax. They say simply that they saw trapezoid shaped object with clearly distinct multicolored lights momentarily turning on and off while the object was comming from starboard (meaning from their right side facing front) and going in a generaly port direction (to their left) while making sharp right angle turns and ""whipping in different directions"" that's exactly the way they described it's movement ... They estimated it's size to be comparable to a typical 737 type passenger jet airliner and it was at a consistantly continuous altitude of several thousand feet above the ground (close to the same height as a airliner usually is in that area). They both insist that it could not be a reflection because they actually pulled to the right hand shoulder of the road and watched the thing go by. They say that no other vehicles were passing by in either direction when they were stopped. Unfortunately in addition to having no other witnesses to their account they do not have any phy! sical evidence of it either (photo's or anything else). There location where they pulled over was just in between the camp Kilmer U.S. Army reserve center and a small strip mall. All those years ago that part of Stelton road was not as developed as it is today.

It was an indeterminate color and either possessed it own source of light or was reflecting light from the sun, i.e. it appeared to glow brighter and dimmer.

I was primarily looking at deep sky objects. I was focused on the Andromeda galaxy and wanted to look for the double cluster galaxy since know its location. I was looking towards the North-Eastern sky when suddenly I noticed two objects that I was never familiar with.  There were two objects which were orange-ish in color. They appeared to be shaped as spheres. Both of the objects appeared within the eyepiece I was looking in. They appeared to be somewhat of a faint orange color. I can almost say that they were faint because they were in space around the Earth’s orbit and not in our atmosphere because I stopped looking in the telescope and tried to see them with my naked eye but could not. As I looked again in the eyepiece they were going in a south-eastern direction and suddenly made a quick turn going towards an easterly direction. One was below the other towards the lower right. The one below was sort of bouncing around or more like dancing around in no particular pattern. This stuck me as odd behavior.  They kept their same formation and distance as they moved down the sky. I followed them for about 30 seconds and quickly called my 14 year old son outside. I asked him to take a look through the telescope and he saw the same objects I did. I tried to view the objects again, but they were probably below my fence and out of sight. I have seen helicopters, falling stars, satellites, & airplanes through my telescope and there were not any of those. I’m not saying they were UFO’s, but I certainly don’t know what they were. This was definitely a strange first moment for me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The lit up clouds were darker the further away from the city like it always would until it got pitch black.  Well right before it got pitch black, I noticed this very long and straight dark patch.  I just thought it was a cloud, but when we kept driving, I noticed that it was a perfectly straight line coming from this blackness.  We kept driving and we started to go under this black object.  The object was not moving through the air.  It wasn’t moving at all. I told the girlfriend to slow down so she could look at it but she didn’t want to stop the vehicle and possibly wake the baby. We drove under the object and that is when I knew that it wasn’t anything from this world. It was dark with no lights, and the part I could see that was out of the pitch black clouds was at least 2 kilometres long. The bottom of it was flat and perfectly straight. It wasn’t very tall. I would guess around 50 meters tall. When we drove under it, I saw that both sides were perfectly straight, narrowing from the base (which was in the clouds) to its square ended tip.

My family was taking advantage of fine weather one evening, and had hauled a TV outside on the spur of the moment to watch a movie.  At the time listed above, I saw what resembled a very large meteor (but was not a meteor or space shuttle) traveling from north to south, as you look from the west at a downward angle of appx. 40 degrees.  The total visible path of the object was around 8 inches with your hand held at arm's length, though the visible light trail was around 2 inches long and 1 inch wide.  It lasted around 4 seconds, and had a very visible color tint, which I saw as green, but could have been a trick played by my eyes, since it was, after all, nighttime, and I had been looking at a television.  I fetched my DSLR and telephoto lens, but nothing ever showed up again.  Please continue reading, as I will tell you the results of my foot search. (The movie was ""Swing Kids"" not a sci-fi movie or anything at all!  This rules out any influence from the movie making me ""want"" to see something.)  I have seen meteors lasting for over 8 seconds, and shuttles re-entering the atmosphere, and this resembled them, except that it seemed much, much closer.  The dimensions of said trail are seen above.  I estimated, based upon the horizon, trees, etc. that the object was 1.8 to 3 miles away. Later that evening, I wondered if the object could have been a plane crashing in the area, and decided to go search.  I pulled out my GPS, marked 3.5 miles, and set out.  I trespassed for hours, and the only civilization I observed was a large oil well complex, with a small metal building.  I got the number to the oil company, and after a little asking around, I found that they do not have any aircraft in our area.  Therefore, I have not resolved what I may have seen. I don't believe in ailens, there were no ""substances"" in use, either!  In addition, I called the attention of my mother and brother to the object by saying, LOOK, LOOK!  Upon which they responded, ""where?"" and the object was, by that time, gone. Thank you, any information is much welcomed.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,31.652585714285713,-94.56937802197803

I watched it as I walked. It very very slowly descended directly downward for a long time. I assumed it was something falling from space. Then, when it looked like it was just about to reach the top of the mountain, a smaller light fell or was dropped and took a few minutes to fall onto the mountain and disappear. The light then began to rise in a diagonal straight line heading southward at a noticeably faster speed than before for about five, or at most, 10 minutes. It flashed and disappeared just before crossing paths with a commercial airplane headed West. (It looked nothing like the airplane.) I had seen a similar light in the same area a few days ago, but it had just hovered there. I had thought it was some sort of astronomical body, a star or planet maybe. Any suggestions?

Anyway I left my office here and traveled west on Rt.40 to turn around and head east towards Dunkin Donuts. While sitting in the left turn lane I had the feeling of being watched (my hair on the back of my neck was standing up) so I paused at the intersection and looked upward into the sky. There it was off to my left, a solid white, extremely bright circle with a slightly smaller bright circle of light off to the right connected by a line of bright whiteness again.  It looked like a dumbbell sort of. I looked down at the road to refocus my eyes and rubbed them for 3-5 seconds and looked up again and it was still there.  I have never ever seen anything like this.  No one else was around or on the roadway.  I am not sure if this was one ship or two connected together.  I was terrified and drove off making my U-turn and heading down to Dunkin Donuts.  I did not observe any other aircraft in the area and the object(s) blacked out the background.  They were just slightly smaller than the size of a water bottle cap held at arms length.  To my eye they were about the size of my thumb at arms length.  I would estimate the altitude of the object(s) to be anywhere from 1000 ft. to 10,000 ft. It was difficult to tell.

You asked me on the phone why I waited so long to report my experiences to anyone.  In actuality I have shared my experiences with family members and friends for years, but not until recently did I think that anything that I had to share would be relevant or of any importance or interest to an official UFO investigative or reporting agency. In recent months there have been several televised reports: UFO Hunters, UFO Files, etc. on television that I have watched that have convinced me to pass on some information that may help.  I am not writing for any recognition or monetary gain.  However, I am willing to take any type of lie detector test, medical test that you or someone else may want me to submit to, in order to verify any information I am sharing with you now or in the future. 1.) I have been in the medical laboratory field just short of 20 years, so you will be able to appreciate my confusion while I was watching a report on cattle mutilations when a prominent doctor (omitted name per your instruction) said, ""I am not aware of that many similarities between bovine blood and human blood.""  Either this is a doctor I would never want to go to or he was telling a boldfaced lie. In the laboratory there are several types of automated pieces of equipment to analyze everything from thyroid function to bacterial infections and STD’s.  All of these machines need to be calibrated with positive and negative controls, nearly ALL of which are made out of bovine blood, BECAUSE IT IS SO SIMILAR TO HUMAN BLOOD. While working for one of the top DNA and GENETICS companies in the US, nearly all of our research incorporated the use of bovine blood, because of the similarities. 2.)  During one of my dad’s encounters with, for lack of better words, the aliens, he asked them why they were here.  The answer he received was that they are here to harvest our planet’s abundant resource of bdellium and its anti-gravitional properties.  Do I know anything about bdellium?  I haven’t got a clue!  But that is the answer my dad got. He was also convinced that their being here was not a good thing for mankind.  He said they had cloaking abilities and that they could be standing right next to you, and you would never know. I had a first hand experience when I was in the backyard playing catch with a friend of mine.  We both saw a bird in mid flight hit what seemed like an invisible wall, make a loud thumping sound, and then it fell dead to the ground. 3.)  From watching one of the episodes of UFO Hunter, they had two men who tested with unusually high ck levels.  If you have any more information on that, I would appreciate receiving it.  I am currently on full disability.  I have had cancer four times and am now struggling with a rare endocrine disease, similar to Addison’s, but I am not responding well to treatment. At some point in my youth I received a straight incision on my backside that I have memories of receiving while surrounded by many “beings”.  My dad was there.  My mother was not and when I have asked her questions regarding what it is and why I have it, she has no recollection of me ever having an injury there. At the very least, my body seems unusually prone to sickness. I have had several encounters over the years, starting with seeing something in the park on my 8th birthday.  My brothers and I saw a glowing ball of light hovering in front of the screen door while my parents were in Pittsburgh. My older brother was watching us and we were terrified.  All clocks in the house stopped. We moved from Pa. to Ohio, and things continued.  My mom and I were out taking a summer drive and just talking when we saw something flying over us.  It went very fast and kept making abrupt changes in direction.  We looked for a road to turn around on and when we turned into a drive to do that we were stopped by what looked like military guards that ordered us to stop and get out of there.  My mom explained that was exactly what she had intended to do anyway. As recently as this year I watched a very large whatever go over the house here in Tx.  It wasn't like you could see it.  It blocked out things as it went overhead.  It was totally dark and totally quiet. There are many more encounters that I could share, but it is not these little incidents that matter.  What I felt I needed to share was the info on the bdellium and the bovine blood.  If it helps, I am glad.  Do I believe we are being visited? Yes.  Do I believe we should trust them? No. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-08-12T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

They were way too small to be blimps and shiny metallic. I would estimate they were about 2.5 miles away or less, and following the path of the 5 freeway. I also thought it was odd, because they appeared ""locked"" in formation with absolutely zero individual movement. I immediately went for my camera, because they just didn't seem to belong. As I was fumbling to grab my camera, I lost track of them once getting into the turning lane onto Hollywood Way, as they were blocked by the tall buildings.

The date I have provided is approximate only because I witnessed these craft on a daily basis for over two weeks. I already have numerous sighting statements on record at MUFON that I made daily during the sighting period.  My first sighting of the star-like craft was made in the afternoon here in Phoenix while I was outside on a break. I was looking up at a jetliner that was cruising overhead out of Sky Harbor International airport and I noticed what appeared to be a star shining directly over my head at about 2PM in the afternoon. I was perplexed as to why I would be able to see a star in the middle of the day when suddenly the 'star' started to move very slowly and then stop. I watched it make these manuevers for about 6 minutes but my break was almost over and I had to go back inside to work - however, I thought that I just had to figure out what it was I was looking at. It was so far up that I figured it must be at about a 60 thousand foot level or so. It started moving again and then it just 'popped' out of existence altogether ! I was freaking out at that point. I began to deliberately look up at the sky for the duration of my breaks and lunches and sure enough, every single day I saw these star-like craft just appear out of nowhere and for the most part they would just move across the sky until they were no longer in my range of sight, but the thing that really got to me was the FACT that they would just suddenly appear out of nowhere. About the 3rd day of my seeing these things, I watched a total of 5 of these things appear from the same part of the sky and then move off into different directions until I could no longer see them. On one occasion I watched two disc shaped craft fly over our building at about a 20 thousand foot level and fly side-by-side from west to east at a very fast rate of speed and disappear off in the horizon over Scottsdale Arizona. I would have to estimate that they were flying at around 2000+ miles per hour because of how quickly they traversed the sky. No sound at all came from any of these craft at any time.  I did on 2 different occasions have other employees outside with me that watched the UFO's with me so I at least had witnesses to verify what I was seeing. I don't know what I saw other than the fact that these craft made moves and achieved flight speeds that exceed any known aircraft that I have ever witnessed in my lifetime. Phoenix is has a major air force base to the west called LUKE AFB and it wouldn't surprise me to find out that they have been tracking these craft yet they will never admit it.

The sightings happened on four seperate occasions, and will be described individually:  1.  My wife and I were laying on a beach just outside Barcelona on a perfectly clear day.  I first noticed (and then her as well) an orb which had a yellowish-red appearance high in the sky.  There was no contrail.  Its movements were erratic and appeared to follow and almost elliptical pattern.  It grew smaller (which I took to be movement away from the observer) and then disappeared.  Approx. 10 min. later, it returned to the same place of initial observation and followed the same pattern.  It again vanished within ten minutes.  Total time of observation approx. 30 min. 2.  I was alone and walking to work when I noticed the same object in the sky over the moountains directly west of Barcelona and above the Collserola Communications tower.  I was unable to observe for exceedingly long because it eventually drifted behind the buildings to my west. 3.  Approx. two weeks after the sighting just described, I observed the same object, but this time I was able to follow it for almost 45 minutes.  It behaved in much the same pattern as previously.  Initially, it apeard to be roughly half-oragen and half-red.  It drifted back and forth in what appeared to be arranged patterns.  Eventually, its size changed.  It grew smaller and the color changed to golden, and then almost white with a metallig shine.  I again assumed this to be its rising higher from my observational position.  It eventually disappeared high above. 4.  Approx 4 weeks after initial sighting on beach I was walking to the supermarket where I observed the object MUCH closer approximately 1/2 mile from my position.  It was a clear day in late March.  The object can only be described as a donut lying on its side, spinning much in the same way a coin would spin when rotating to rest flatly.  The center was lighter colored and the ""edges"" darker colored; almost brown.  Others around me observed this as well, though most eventually continued on with their business.  I followed the object visually for approx.  ten minutes.  It stayed perfectly still in the sky (save its own motion).  It appeared to hover for quite some time before beginning to move slowly northbound.  It speed progressively increased until it had risen higher in the sky, giving it the ""traditional"" reddish-orange appearance and then subsequently metallic white before disappearing. During this reported time period, there were other reported sightings in Malaga (a suburb of Barcelona) as well as along a few major highways.  The objects did not exhibit any common aerodynamic characteristics, jut as they did not appear to be affected by air currents.  Their movement patterns ruled out any influences by upper air currents (returning to their initial positions).  These sightings have yet to be explained.

Soldiers had obviously been drinking, but i decided to humor them and listen to their story.  They claimed to have seen 3 reddish-orange lights appear in a triangular formation and a fourth a little ways off that flew around the (clear, dark)sky, and then faded out of sight.  As I was in the process of listening to them, suddenly one pointed at the sky, where I saw a single light had appeared in the sky, it remained stationary and then faded out after 10 seconds or so.  I tried to dismiss as a flare, but then realized their was no noise or smoke trail, and it was too high.  after another two minutes 4 lights appeared, 3 in a line and one lower to the right.  As i watched the furthest right light in the line faded out, just a 5th light appeared on the left side of the line, almost as if a giant cylindrical object was slowly turning. after 15 secs or so this display faded out completely.  myself, the two initial witnesses, and 2 more soldiers witnessed this.  afterwards at roughly 2 min intervals, the single light would reappear. this happened 3 more times or so. Background of reporter:  22 year old male, intelligence analyst for the US Army, completely sober at time of sighting, (am sipping a beer as i write this report however), highly skeptical about aliens, but willing to admit that this was a flying object I could not identify, and am familiar with most of the worlds aircraft due to my job. Location:  Ft. Gordon is the signal center for the US army, lights looked like they were possibly overhead of the new NSA expansion being constructed on post.

I get off work at 10:00 pm. As I was driving home this past Thursday evening (November 20, 2008) after work, and at around 10:15 pm I spotted an object that I cannot identify, so I am filing this report. I believe it was probably a meteorite or meteor, but as you will see below it does not fully fit into this category. I work in Ft. Myers, Florida, and live in Cape Coral, about a 10 mile drive from work to home. I take a back route most of the way,, which is dark, with very few  street lights. All of a sudden I noticed a bright light going up from my right to high overhead, in front of me. My first thought was that someone was setting off fireworks, and this is indeed what it looked like at first. When fireworks are first ignited and shot off, they can ascend with a bright light and with a little wobbly motion. Then they burst when they reach a certain peak. Well this light started out like that, a bright light ascending, with the little wobbly motion like fireworks. However, when it reached a peak, instead of bursting into a fireworks display, it shot straight across the sky at very high speed flaming or flaring up as it went, as a meteorite would burning up in the atmosphere. Then it went out and disappeared. So it appeared to be going up at first, then across the sky accelerating to a very high speed. I am not a pilot or very familiar with height or speed, but even when it appeared to level out and shoot across the sky, it really didn’t seem to be very high up in the atmosphere at all. This is one of the inconsistencies with the meteor theory. The other inconsistency, of course, is that it appeared to be going up at first, maybe from the ground. In short, I don’t know what this was, but I was looking in the paper and listening to the radio for reports or a meteor or an unidentified flying object in my area for that night. I haven’t heard anything, but I am sure of what I saw. The sky was clear, and anyway it was low enough to be under any clouds that did exist. If anyone else saw anything in this area on that night, I would like to hear about it. Also, and this may be way off base, the next night there were several large helicopters flying around the area at the same time, and in the same general area.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,26.58139708890637,-81.84065302911094

The craft was unlike an airplane because it had three lights which if you connected with a line would make a triangle.  In addition they were not blinking lights.  It’s hard to say whether the lights were from a single craft or three separate ones. Other members of my family dismissed it as an airplane or helicopter, but I don’t think one would fly right into the fireworks.  Perhaps, I am wrong and the aircraft was very far away and merely looked like it was in the fireworks but that still does not explain its unusual appearance and its abrupt disappearance.

I am a 43 yr old woman, and I was going to collect my 3 children from my mothers house, who lives about 1 and a half miles from my home.  It was a very warm evening, sky was clear and sun had just about gone down. The sky was still quite blue, and the moon was very bright.  I had just gone out to my car at the front of the house, and I stopped to admire the evening sky over the river thames. There is a small open park in between my house and the river, and a lot of open sky without any obstruction.  I immediately noticed a very bright flame in the sky, right above the park and not more than a mile high from the ground.  It was definitely not something that I had ever seen before, and it was obvious to me that it was something out of the ordinary.  At first, I was just watching it, wondering what it could be, and trying to make sense of it.  The more I watched, the less I could explain it.  I went quickly to the park and also to the other end of the street to see if anyone was around to witness it with me, but there was nobody.  I hadn't really taken my eyes off it all the time.  I then took a photo of it, as it was raising further and further upwards and to the left, with my phone camera.  I then knocked on my neighbours door, and before she answered, I noticed the flame had gone out and there was a grey object left, floating up and away to the left. My neighbour came out, and she looked up and saw it.  She said to me that it looked like it could be a UFO.  I said I had taken a photo of it, and I would put it onto my computer and see what it looked like once I could zoom in.  I put it onto the computer later that night, and after zooming in on the object, I have no doubt it was a UFO I saw.  The object has an obvious shape around the flame, as though the flame was in the centre of the craft, and the craft looks like it is metallic and has definite angles.  The next day, my neighbours husband said he heard someone in a local shop saying that they had seen something in the sky and they thought it was a plane crash.  I dont know if they were talking about the same thing I saw, but what I saw and photographed was definitely too bright and stayed too long for nobody else to have seen it.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

After having our barbeque we sat and chilled talking for around 2 hours. At around quater to 11 at night, one of the adults said ' whats that bright light over in the sky. I couldnt see and ran around the table to see it, when i looked through the gap of two houses i noticed a ditant light that was pretty bright. It quickly moved from quite low to really high. Probably the maximum height you would see an aircraft. At first we all though it was a helecopter, but having watched UFO files and other programs i was sceptical. The bright orange glow dimmed and it looked like it was travelling towards us this was about 10 seconds in from we first saw it. It quickly changed direction and started travelling away from us, at this point it was very high in the sky. But i said to my mother that how could it be a helecopter as it was going away and the lights were still facing us and it was a constant glow, also it was way to high for a helecopter. Shortly after moving away it slowly started to fade and completely vanished.  After woundering what it was you could tell the adults knew that this was no ordinary craft, however we didnt rule this out. At about 11 we all noticed the same bright light in the sky again at exactly the same place. It was high, had an orange glow, wasnt making any noise at all, and was hovering in the same spot. I ran upstairs to get my binoculars andmy dad fetched the camera, as i got back the light started to fade and we didnt have time to photograph. However a week previous to our sighting our next door neighbours had told my mum and dad that whilst in their back garden late at night, they to had seen a orange glow move extremely fast in the distance and slowly fade then see it around 5 minuits later once again. They recorded a video on their phone but once i had seen it i wasnt convinced. However after seing the object myself i am a strong believer and fullly believe them.  Having seen this i really want to see this again and capture it myself as my words allown cannot fully describe exactly what it was like.

I took a quick look out the window but didn't notice anything and soon returned to the comforts of my bed. Approximately 45 minutes to an hour later my dog jumped off the bed and ran to the front window. He started whining and running back and forth looking out all the windows from the first floor of the house. Since it obviously seemed something was bothering him outside, I got up again and looked out the back window. But this time I was startled to see a very strange large glowing Red Orb in the NorthWestern night sky gliding towards the East and seemingly descending into the woods behind my house. I will try to describe the scene and this object as best I can, so you can hopefully picture and possibly help me in figuring out what this object might have been. Looking North from my first floor rear window and Approximate 300 yards away there is a large tract of woods intertwined with a large creek and a field about 40 acres in size-including the woods it's  about 200 acres of undeveloped land. I first saw the object in the NorthWest sky(500-800 feet high)on a slow Easterly downward trajectory. The object had what I can only describe as a Reddish glowing Orb(half the brightness and size of the full moon)on top of a structure that you could clearly see was being illuminated underneath it. The structure looked to be cylindrical or rectangle in shape and was vertically suspended under this glowing orb. The size I would estimate was 20 feet long(up and down)and 8 feet wide(left to right). At this point the object was about 400-600 feet in the air and descending into the woods. Because of this I knew I wouldn't have much time to watch the object since it was descending in altitude. At this point I knew I had to make a decision and if I should try to grab my video camera. I knew it was a risk but I made the decision to grab the camera to document the sighting. I ran from the back window grabbed the camera and yelled for my wife to wake up and look out the back window(hopefully so she too could witness the event). I quickly grabbed the camera and returned to the window but was just briefly able to see it again as it descended deep into the woods. My wife made it to the window but unfortunately just seconds late. Please note-being around aviation for the most part off my life I can definitively say this object was definitely not a airplane or a helicopter of any kind. The only possibility that I have to consider and can't be 100% certain about is that this was some kind of unknown military drone-I don't feel this would be a very good possibility though. The light I've tried to describe on top wasn't your conventional light and certainly not a beacon light of any kind-It was more of a bright soft red glow, quite strange actually. I spoke with Mr. Davenport at NUFORC and will closely follow his instructions on documenting this sighting. He suggested I contact The FAA, News Broadcasting Centers, Law Enforcement and anyone else who will listen. His instruction also entailed trying to locate the site where this object possibly landed. I will of course follow all of these additional details and therefore will keep you updated when any new details arise. I Thank You for giving me this forum to post this unexplained event and again will keep you posted of anything I uncover. Thank You",2009-08-05T00:00:00,38.8175,-77.6308

It had a large wedge of red and a large wedge of white light. It was bigger than the full moon, and stationary. The sky is dark. The moon is a bright crescent tonight -- it’s off to the north east, as I can see it clearly in the sky. I saw the object only a matter of seconds, as when I went under the trees and around another bend, it was gone when I came around again. This is the second time I’ve seen such an object in this area. The other time was several months ago, when I saw the same thing -- round object, large, with red and white lights. It was hovering over the boulevard and lasted for 45 minutes or so. I saw it as I was driving, and then parked and went up into my apartment on 12th floor. I watched it from my balcony. I am convinced what I saw was not a plane, nor was it the moon or a star.

I looked up at the sky as I walked from my car to the house to look at the clouds.  Almost directly overhead, in a clear patch between the clouds, I saw a brilliant, glowing orange V-shaped object.  It appeared stationary when I first saw it.   I went into the house to get a small spotting scope that I use for bird watching and returned. Using the scope, I saw that the V object was not solid orange, but had alternating sections of orange and white.  It had some type of structure to it that I could not quite make out due to distance.  The best I and describe it is a length of a crane or bridge, with it’s intricate crosspieces, bent at a 45 degree angle, painted orange and white. I was not a wing shape at all, as the arms of the V did not have much width to them.   The object would drift in and out of the clouds as they passed by to the NE, the clouds sometimes partially obscuring the object. I would estimate the size as similar to the wingspan of a commercial jet aircraft.  The object seemed to maneuver periodically to remain near the edge of the clouds.  I watched until the cloud cover thickened and the object was not visible any longer, about 5 minutes. I realize this is almost 5 years ago and I am just reporting it now.  At the time, I assumed that, due to the color, it was some sort of experimental device.  I also considered the date (day after Valentine’s day) of the sighting, that it may have been a balloon arch that got loose, but I have since had the chance to observe balloons released into the sky and they did not behave or look they way this object did.   I am reporting it now since I see so many reports of V and triangle shaped objects, maybe this is some piece of the puzzle.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,33.93964338565022,-117.4001158071749

I was about 19 at the time, and the other witness with me was about 24. I distinctly remember it being the 4th of July because we had heard firecrackers and fireworks going off all night however I noted to myself that we saw no lights from the fireworks at all and only heard the noises very far off.  The night was perfectly clear and the baseball field had no lights so the night sky and stars were very bright and easy to see, there was no moon that I can recall. We were lying on our backs watching the stars, comets, satellites and planes for about an hour and during that hour a small pinprick of purple light became visible almost directly above us. It was bright enough to easily track and very obviously purple colored. At first it was the size of a star and almost unnoticeable among all the stars in the sky, however it grew slightly bigger after a few minutes (probably as large or larger as the north star on a good night, with a slight purple glow around it making it just that much larger than the stars, however not quite as bright) and flew around in a somewhat erratic manner. It only moved a matter of inches across the sky from my perspective though obviously it must have traveled much further since it was so far away- though I have no idea if it was within the atmosphere or much further out. It was traveling very fast considering we had been watching satellites go by that night and they are extremely sluggish compared to this lig! ht. The pattern of its movement were strange and all I can really remember from that night is that it seemed to zig and zag around at random the entire time we saw it, sometimes stopping to hang for a few minutes before moving again, it’s size and color/brightness waxing and waning slightly without pattern. It only moved within a small quadrant of the sky, almost like it was circling something. A reference for its speed I had in my mind at that time was that if a plane was at that height and moving across the sky at a steady speed, the purple light would be moving double that speed- not exactly zipping around but still much faster than a plane. Because we were on our backs and it was almost directly over us it looked like it must have been out among the stars, however at a different angle it might have been within the atmosphere and much closer than what we thought. After staring at it for about 15 minutes it simply flew/faded away (with a little bit of a tail like a tiny c! omet) and nothing else happened in the sky that night.

We were on Mercury Blvd. on the East side of the EAFB dry lake bed. Think Space Shuttle landing strip runway that runs West to East in front of the notorious “South Base” Birk Flight Test Center.  We noticed a very large black triangle shaped craft coming off the runway and slowly gaining altitude.  We pulled over in time to have it come directly over our heads.  It appeared to be quite “thick” almost as though it were a balloon with somewhat puffy panels on its sides.  Underneath were very bright lights that reminded me of recessed counter top lighting.  Once it passed us it gained altitude VERY RAPIDLY and it blended in with stars above and was no longer visible.  It was way cool indeed.  We were speechless for a bit and felt very lucky to have seen it. Our thoughts were that the lights somehow adjusted to the star patterns above and also adjusted for altitude for viewing angles.  It was completely silent.  Obviously we assumed this was a re-con craft because we watched it carefully and lost it not to be found again.  We are talking seconds here.  It was definitely not an alien craft.  After asking around Northrup came up more than once.  Who knows?

About five or six miles east of my house. This was approx. 5:15 AM, when I woke up to get something to drink from my throat being too dry. This object I say was for sure not a star, it wasn't the planet Venus, and it sure wasn't swamp gas lol. I saw a spherical amberish red light in the sky. This light was stationary and extremely odd looking. It was simply said, a true ""fire in the sky."" The light often dimmed and then would come back lit, at times, within a fraction of second, this thing would shine extremely bright. The best way I can describe it was like a superconducting light bulb that just would shutter immense light at a very short period of time. Then, there was a second & third one. Fading in & out. Anyway, after knowing that this was something unnatural, I ran into my bedroom and got out my 8mm camera BUT the battery was dead. So, secondly, I grabbed my digital picture camera and jolted outside. With only having limited disc space and recording time, I started filming. Let me tell you, this object was wild..I was pretty captivated by it..but that would soon change.   Here’s a link to the short video I filmed:   http://s67.photobucket.com/albums/h313/euphoria5150/?action=view&current=Dustins_UFO_video_clip.flv   After taping my short video, I watched it, instead of just one bright object, the camera was showing three of them, different colors and dimming on and off.  This blew my mind, right, so I looked back up into the sky and there was only one object. As soon as I did, something happened…something rather frightening. Just as if, this ""thing' could sense what I was doing and where I was at, it plotted a course toward me. Within seconds, this light was getting a lot larger and it was apparent that distance was the factor. Yes, this UFO was coming directly toward me. Now, don't get me wrong, it didn’t make any cool Arial movements or swoop down toward me. It came directly toward me like it was following some GPS flight plan. Best way I can describe it, like seeing a white light at the end of a dark tunnel...just getting larger and larger and larger. Within about eight seconds, this thing was half the size of the moon and still coming directly towards me. Once that light started coming toward me, I totally didn't feel very 'warm' about it. I thought. After that, the object stopped in air again and remained stationary for a while. I ran inside and was peering out the window, the objects were gone.. That's the kind of fear this thing gave me. Let's just say, I didn't get any sleep last night...none at all.  I will be happy to post the video that I took before this thing started coming after me. No, I didn't take any more video after that, my shaking hands couldn't even hold up a piece of paper at that point. This was a true story, I'm a Rhodes State College Graduate & I have extensive technical background. I have never seen anything like this and it's I'm so very passionate about.  Hope you enjoyed my experience, because I didn’t!  ((name deleted)) from Ohio",2010-02-14T00:00:00,,

I had an experience a couple of years back. I was on my way home, I was driving a bit too fast and then it flashed really bright, I believed I drove threw one of those automated speed cameras. Well guess again, I didn’t and I realized that when I turned my head to the left and the light became constant, it was coming from the woods next to the road, there was a tree line close to the road a little hill up and a house on the top. The light was coming from below the house almost at the top of the hill, ca 150 meters away from the car and was directed strait into my car, when I say bright light I mean it was so white and so bright it reminded me of a blitz but it wasn’t because it was now constant light. My window wasn’t all the way up and when the light was turned off I saw several white shadows in the forest right next to the road running after my car, believe me when I say it was running really fast, I could hear a lot of cracking sounds as the debris from trees where stepped on, and the sound of something running through high grass. I never turned my head to side window again, it was like something told me not to look, I just kept looking straight forward and kept going, I didn’t think to much about it then, but I was wondering about the light, Never before had I seen a light that bright. A couple of km up the road I noticed a triangular arrangement of lights, red, green, blue, it was on the ground close to the mountain wall, it had 1 light above and 2 on bottom, the sides were not strait it was slightly rounded. At first I believed it’s probably just an entrance to a military facility or something. It was really dark and there were no lights except those 3 colored lights, they didn’t light up the surroundings and I could barely see a shape between the lights. Thinking about it later I asked myself these questions: Would the military put an unguarded entry (no fence or anything) right next to the main road? Have u ever heard of a door being marked with red, green, blue lights? Why didn’t I notice it when I was driving the other way?  I think the blue light was on top and the red and green was on the bottom, this is 2 years ago so I don’t exactly remember how the order of the colors was. I was on my way from Notodden in Norway to Porsgrun. Could it be that this was some beings not humans that chased me, and those lights where coming from  landed craft?    I’m hoping this site allows comments because I would really like to figure out what this was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2010-02-14T00:00:00,,

All three of us were in a state of shock. The object emitted a near-blinding light. The object then proceeded slowly across the botom side of the lake and vanished just as quickly as it had appeared. We immediately left the lake and went back to our cabin. All three have sworn to silence, this is the first time that this information has been shared.! At first, I believed that this was an intense iridium flare and it only appeared to be getting closer because the diameter of the phenomenon was increasing. But I can confidently say that this was not an illusion and that the object was at a low altitude and very near to our position.  A hill visible about two miles from the lake was lit up entirely so that proves that the light was in between us and the hill. I have no idea what this was. It moved swiftly, slowed and hovered momentarily, then disappeared. There was no sound that was emitted from the object, and no trail left by it. No one else that we could see was on the lake but I am sure that a few othersmust have seen it. Two aircraft were nearby, one was an unidentifiable high-flying jet. The other was a small single or dual engined propeller aircraft approximately 3-4 miles away that appeared about five minutes after the object vanished. To note: I have always dismissed stories of extra-terrestrial beings and UFOs as! irrational and ludicrous. Therefore I am not considering this! inciden t to be a visit by some green skinned alien from outer space. I Believe that this WAS however some man-made craft or some extremely rare natural phenomenon. Scenario A seems more probably because the ""maneuvers"" the object performed seemed crisp and defined unlike something that would be a natural occurrence. To summarize: The object first appeared to be am Iridium Flare or something of that kind. Next, the object became increaringly brighter to a pont where it was difficult to look at directly, The light was white, and white only. The object then leveld off near the lake at a low altitude; 2000 feet or less. Absolutely no sound whatsoever was emitted from the object. It then proceeded to move across the forest, and stopped near the lake. It hovered there, then moved across the southern portion of the lake. As it was in motion it disappeared in an istant. Gone, just like that. I have absolutely no explanation for this. At first it appeared to be an iridium flare, but the rest of the incident proves that it could not be. It was very low to the ground and moved silently. I follow aviation closely and know that the government produces advanced aircraft. But putting a massive light on a silent and stealthy airframe would make absolutely no sense. What in the hell could this be?",2010-02-14T00:00:00,45.334300000000006,-93.56769999999999

I was waiting for the green at the second stoplight when a craft entered my vision from the right, about tree line level, directly over the freeway, flying slowly and completely silent. I clearly saw a large and, I think, rectangular craft. I did not see a cockpit, wings or tail. (I admit I was pretty astonished and didn’t look as carefully as I would if I saw something like that again.) It was not like any aircraft I've seen nor did look like the pictures of the triangular stealth jet.  It was possibly the length of a large jet (747)and seemed to be about as wide as the freeway lanes.  The flashing red light was in the middle of the bottom of the craft. There were bright white lights across the end and what appeared to be lighted windows along the side. The traffic light changed almost immediately and I drove under the freeway, looking up and observing the bottom of the craft.

From the spot of the car to the sighting is around 4 miles and we were walking. We have been walking for a little over a hour or so and decided to stop for a little bit to have a cigarette and look over a bridge. After standing for a while about 5-10 minutes looking over the right side of the bridge we decided to start walking home again, when we turned to keep going I looked over the tree line to our left and there was a strange looking light, almost like a star but slightly bigger and not one solid color. As we stood and observed this object it seemed to change colors, from red to purple to blue, and so on. It seemed to be getting closer and then started moving side to side and up and down. I took a chance and grabed a white led light i have on my keychain and flashed it at the object. When i did so it seemed to move more and the lights wer! e still changing.

The time of day would have been mid-day in June or July of 2008.  We have been hesitant to report this “sighting” as we haven’t heard of any other instances where no actual craft was seen even though the sound and feel of the presence of a craft was unmistakable.  It was either close to noon, or possibly 1:00 PM and we were doing some clearing of our property in the eastern foothills of the Hualapai Mountains, approximately 16 miles east of Kingman, AZ.  Our exact location per GPS was 35 ((deleted))N , 113 ((deleted))W at an elevation of 4,125’. To explain the “sighting” is difficult, as it started out as a noise, which we were used to hearing in that area, as military helicopters, usually in threes, occasionally fly over our property, from west to east.  Having served in the Marine Corps, I am very familiar with this sound and usually stop what I’m doing and locate the choppers in the sky.  This was totally different.  The sound was of something absolutely huge.  We could hear it approaching and stopped what we were doing to locate the “object”.  As it neared, the sound became almost deafening until it became a feeling that literally shook the ground.  I was walking all over the area searching the skies for an object.  When the sound became directly over our heads, it remained for some time, as if hovering.  Our only guess was that whatever it was, it was somehow not visible to the naked eye, or as we assumed, “cloaked”.  At this time, there was no point in moving around, as I had searched every available spot in t! he sky for an object, to no avail.  After what seemed an eternity (actual time in the vicinity of three or four minutes) it seemed to move on, slowly, as it had arrived. To date, we have not heard of any other instances of a “sighting” with no apparent craft observation.  We’d love to hear if anyone else has had this experience, but have no idea where to start.  I’m just very glad that my wife and I shared this experience, as I have not or would not share this experience with anyone else for fear of being considered “whacko”, or prone to over imaginative.  We just had to finally share the information with somebody. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2010-02-14T00:00:00,35.220108796296294,-113.90181018518517

I live on the 17th floor of an apartment building.  My bedroom window faces east.  There are a series of condomiums at 30-35 floors each, approximately 10 km away in the east.  The light I saw was above the set of condominiums, although I believe the light was much further away and only appeared to be above the condos.  I first thought the light was an airplane, but understood that planes do not take-off or land at Pearson International Airport between early morning hours.  The light first moved to the south at a slow pace, then disappeared.  A second later, it would light up again, only it would appear further north.  My guess is it moved approximately 1 km north from the spot when the light went off a second earlier.  The light moved again in a slow speed to the north this time, turn off, and re-appear further to the south approximately a km away again.  The distance it moved is just my estimate.  This movement would randomly continue for 15 minutes.  Because I was in awe, and aware it was not anything familiar, I watched the entire event which lasted approximately 15 minutes.  The light finally dissipated for the last time and never re-appeared.  I google searched the event several days later, and found that a report was filed on a UFO website which described a sighting in the very same area and approximate time,  although the sighting was reported earlier in the evening.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

So, I stood there watching it fly, spinning, the turning into a sphere, then disappearing and coming back.  It repeated that for about one minute, and then it was gone.  I stood there for another minute, but it did not come back.  There was no lights, or any other thing besides the flat circle.  I was going to take a picture with my cell phone, but it would not turn on.  So I thought the craft in the air was intercepting with my phone somehow.  Once it was gone, my phone turned on.

Was not looking at sky but eyes drawn to sky by radiant light suddenly appearing in the sky. It was as bright as an airliner's landing lights, when viewed about ~2000 feet above and ~2000 feet away from you, aimed in your direction. The light suddenly and rapidly dimmed into the very low apparent brightness of a satellite, and it cruised at satellite speeds directly overhead towards the southeast. I'd say when I initially saw it - when it was really bright - it was about fifty degrees of arc above the eastern horizon. I'd normally think it was a satellite. Speed was right, direction was right, and it crossed in my vision with the Sun below the horizon, and could have hit the satellite at just the right angle to make it very bright. But this thing was BRIGHT. It would have been a massive satellite to glare like that from so far away. I watch the ISS sometimes - actually look where it is on the internet and plan for it to fly over me in that very type of lighting situation - and it wasn't the ISS. In that lighting situation ISS does not get as bright, and then does not get so dim, as this thing did. The other odd aspect of this thing's illumination was it did not ever get totally dark when it crossed the terminator heading to the southeastern horizon. When I've observed the ISS in the same situation, it rapidly turns a gorgeous red and then fades into black at some point before crossing the other horizon. The ISS is spectacular when it does that. This thing did not disappear when it crossed the terminator. It was a very interesting phenomena.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,43.56891901408451,-116.56197605633803

I looked back to where the planes were, and saw a huge white light in the middle of the sky. It looked unfamiliar to me. There were no flashing lights, or anything else that may have caused it to be recognized as an airplane. It was moving very slow. I was going about 40 mph (because I was the only one on the parkway). It slowly glided down the sky, and ended up on my left side, over the water. It stayed in that position, seeming to be following me, for about 7 minutes.

I first thought nothing of it and presumed it must have been light from a car headlight. Then it happened again, but this time the light moved very quickly and zigzagged through the window. Thinking that some kids were playing with a torch, I looked out of the window so see the source of the light. I waited there for roughly 40 seconds before I noticed a light 0.5 miles away on the other side of the lake, behind a small wooded area opposite the harbour. It appeared to be a ball of light, perfectly spherical with what I would estimate to have a diameter of 15-20 feet and pulsed slowly. The sphere moved at a jogging pace and weaved aimlessly through the trees. It would appear to slowly move down to the lakeside and stop there after completing a circuit of the wooded area. The sphere appeared to rotate as it would beam light every 1 minute, which I believe I first saw beaming through my bedroom window. I woke my wife and she was curious to what it could be, so she went to look in my son’s room for binoculars. By the time she returned to the bedroom the light had stopped, but then over the lake, probable 0.8 miles from the wooded area where we had seen the light, a strobe light flickered and then disappeared over the banks of the lake at 25 mph.

The number of witnesses would be 3.  You could say 4 because it was a neighbor lady who called us up to asked us if we saw what she was seeing.  She has since passed away.  She lived right on the lake. We lived right across the street. The Street is called Lake shore blvd. We walked across the street while my dad stayed on our porch. They stayed in one spot for a long time. Sometimes they would appear to get closer. I remember being ready to run if it got to close..lol.  While one stayed still the other one started moving way over us.  My dad watched it as it passed over him. completely silent.  At this time it was pretty high up there. I don't know if I can give you an accurate measurement.  It went up into the sky completely vanishing out of site.  The other light. My memory has faded some on this. I think it to disappeared somewhere over the lake.  I think our sighting might of been in the summer. I'm Most certian they were NOT helicopters. As I said.  They were both completely silent.

I had contacted the Phoenix PD and the dispatcher’s words were:  ""I’m not sure what you saw but I’ve been getting calls from all over the city about it.""   Luke AFB had no comment. A little about me:  I’m ex-military and was a jumper for the Army Parachute in West Germany in the early 80’s and had jumped from and flew in a number of aircraft through the years.

I always used the back roads because it was a quiet easy drive.  I was near the reservoir in Copley, when in my rear-view mirror I saw a light moving up behind me.   At first, I thought it was a motorcycle; however, as it got closer I could tell it was something entirely different.   My car started to hesitate and all the light on my car suddenly went out.  I pulled my car to the side of the road and stopped.   All at once the light totally encircled my car it was very bright almost blinding and made me feel dizzy and nauseous.  I remember hearing a whooshing sound and feeling static in the air.  Seemed just a few minutes and it was ahead of me moving up the road.  I began to follow its direction and past my road, when it shot up into the air, then up over the lake, then was gone.  I guess it was probably about the size of a semi-truck only round about 15 to 20 feet across.   I pulled over again and sat there awhile wandering what?--again what was that?  When I arrived home, my sister asked me what took me so long to get home.  See it is only a 10 to 15 minute drive.  Evidently, this time my drive home took over 3 hours.  Now from the time I saw the object till the time I returned driving home, seemed to me only maybe 5 to 10 minutes.  I told my sister what had transpired and that I was getting scared because I had no idea what happened during the time I was encircled.   She said I sounding crazy.  But then we decided, I should call the police.  I did and they gave me another number to call because they said they had other sighting reports.   I called the other number the police gave me and gave them a full report of what I had experienced, They thanked me and said they would contact me if they needed more information-they never did.  Now, I still don't know transpired during the time my car was encircled by the object.   Till this day my hair and skin tingles ! when I think about my experience.

But how could two people see the same thing not once but twice in one week.  Once with my friend and the other with my then girlfirend who thought I was crazy until she saw it her self. Me and my friend were at mellaluca lakes in port st lucie fl. at around 10:30 pm we looked toward our left ,(toward kennedy space center just north of st lucie) and we noticed something we thought was the shuttle lifting off at night, because of the orange glow coming from underneath as if it were a lift off. The strange thing is that it was acending very slow and straight up not at an angle like the shuttle does and as sure as I said that to my friend the light shot straigt up what looked to be at least 3 miles up in the blink of an eye I mean rediculously fast.Before I knew it the thing started coming our direction I had to be at least 5 miles away and was over the lake we were at within 2 to 3 seconds and when we saw it hover over the lake the whole sky reflected off of it ,it was about the size of a vw bettle and there were two lights on top long ones moving back and forth. It was very quiet no sound but the crickets and frogs man, dont know what it was but my bud s! tarted shaking and upon trying to start his car I asked him not to beacause I wanted to know if what we were seeing was real. Had him decribe what he was seeing and it was exactly what I was seeing so I know it was real.  I stepped out of the car and proceeded to walk toward the lake edge to get a closer look at it hovering( 50ft or so in air) as I opened the car door and stepped out it straighted it self out went side to side across whole lake which was at leat half mile wide, zig zagged about 7 time and shot straight toward palm beach county in the blink of an eye. Never believed in UFOs but have  since.  Saw it a week later after everyone said I was crazy. Standing out back my house was the second and last encounter. Looked over toward the lake ,( by this time my girl had already said she had enough and she didnt know if she believed me. About ten min later looking toward  the lake we both noticed a bright light which appeared to be a spot light on a small plane. Almost out! of my mind at this time because I thought I was going crazy f! or what me and my friend saw just days before. Anyway looked like a spot light on a small plane started to get brighter and brighter so I took my lighter and started flickering it just because I guess , but as I did it me and my girl noticed the spot light start to flicker as I did with my lighter. Kinda creepy my girl started to wonder at this time because the more I flickered my light the more the spot light did the same as it came our direction over the pine trees. As it got closer we heard what sounded like a prop plane single engine. At this time my girl pretty much called me crazy and said ,""see it's just a plane man i agreed and said your right. All of a sudden the plane noise changed to a helicopter sound. My girl started to weird out about this time and wanted to go inside.I told her hell no please stay i said everyone thinks I crazy. She agreed and at this time the noise coming toward us change into distinctly what sounded like a jet engine noise,but the light coming towar! d us was moving slowly. Until right about 5 seconds later there it was no sound just quiet. No more plane sound no more helicopter sound no more jet sound just hovering over a 40ft pine in my back yard. It sat at an angle with this weird  feeling we were being watched. My girl started crying and I asked her what do you see? Her reply,"" I see it I beleive"", and continued to cry. I told her to go in the house and get my mom and her husband and to quietly walk out the back door to see. She headed toward the house while I just looked in awe. I heard them come around the front of house instead of the back ,looked over to tell them to hurry, looked back up and saw it fade out of view in front of me and a little flickering light appeared and began moving so fast and in ways no plane we have could have moved with such precission and no sound. Unfortunately my mother and her husband did not see it as we did. I was still called a lier even after my girl told them what she had seen. N! ote we were not believers until these events occured. As for m! y friend he was the smart one he never told anyone and said he wouldnt.. We have not spoken since the incident nor have I ever seen it again.I know this is very old sighting but please tell me I am not crazy or else how could I remember it as if it were right in front of me now. This happened when I was sixteen and am now 36 . I know I saw something i could not explain. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2010-04-13T00:00:00,27.285686301369864,-80.36344363992173

We simultaneously observed what we thought was a shooting star streak across the sky.  As we ""ahhed"" in pleasure at the sight, the ""shooting  star"" stopped above our heads and reversed direction.  We immediately became silent and confused when another ""shooting star"" streaked back toward us crossing the path of the first object at a sharp angle.  At this point, we both confirmed that we were actually seeing the same thing.  The objects both turned and then slowly headed back toward each other and appeared to come together and turned away at extremely tight angles.  As we watched, another object streaked across the paths of the first two.   During the time we watched, these lightly glowing objects continued to streak across the travel paths of each other.  They moved slowly when they were grouped near each other and we could see that they were more or less chevron shaped with the entire shape being defined by a clear, visible glow.  The glow was about the same intensity of the surrounding stars with a greenish tint to the light they appeared to emit.    All of their movement was in straight lines or at sharp angles, creating invisible triangular travel paths as they flew past and crossed over each other.  Occasionally, they would come together for a fraction of a second only to break away quickly in different angular patterns. One of the hotel employees was cleaning the pool.  He did not speak English and my Spanish was quite rusty.  However, when I asked about what we were observing, I understood him to explain that these were birds and they glowed because of the plankton in the waters that that also glowed. The explanation seemed acceptable to a point.  That could certainly explain the greenish glow and the chevron shape.  However, I live in an area where there are a lot of hawks and falcons that fly on the thermals created in the hills of my community.  I have not seen any of these birds flying in the angular patterns that I observed.  Their turns tend to be more gentle and curved.  I have seen none of these birds come together but would allow that at night, seeing the objects seemingly meet may have been an illusion as one object could have been above or below the other.  This does not explain how the objects would consistently appear to break away from each other and travel in different directions but I feel that even some of those observations could also be attributed to illusion and vision impairment created by the night skies.   Perhaps the most extraordinary behavior that gives me pause to question the bird explanation more than any other is the fact that all of their movement appeared to be in straight lines with all turns seemingly to be accomplished only with sharp angular movement.  I have since attempted to research sea bird sightings under similar circumstances and watch the movement of other groups of birds but have found no descriptions that seem to fit my experience.    At this time, I cannot say for sure that what I saw but they were not shooting stars.  However, I have seen that other visitors to Cancun have described similar sightings at later dates.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,,

It was  at a slow pace and as soon as it got about 20 feet into the air it stopped in mid air and hovered in place with the beam still on for about 45 seconds and then it turned off its beam and started to come toward us.  As it passed over us it was only about 10-15 feet above us.  As it was paasing above us it turned a set of lights that was around the edges.  On the edges it had lights. They would go in sequence and flash red, blue, green.  While it was passing us it had a low humming sound. It passed slowly by and then! it shot off and was gone.

Hi I would like to report a sighting from yesterday 9/21/08  I was on vacation for the weekend with my Husband at my brother in law’s house, San Fernando Valley, California. At aprox 3:15 we saw in the sky, very high up a silver/chrome colored object was sitting still in the air. Very slowly it started to move in our direction. The object was moving too slow for an airplane. The object appeared to be splitting into two separate objects and then appeared to re-form. It also had almost looked like it was radiating heat as there was a slight ripple like effect surrounding it... As the object slowly moved acorss the sky we saw two jets, one in front of the other fly close to this object as if in some kind of formation to observe whatever this object was. About 30 minutes later the object was still moving slowly and we noticed a pink balloon object drift past the “UFO” in the opposite direction. So the balloon type object was following the wind direction and the “UFO was traveling in the opposite direction, thus confirming for me that the “UFO” was not a balloon and too slow to be an airplane and much to high to be either a helicopter or a blimp (which it bore no resemblance to anyways) the pink balloon type object almost looked like it was shriveling the “UFO” as were the jets. All this time the object appeared to be dividing and re-forming. We (my husband, sister in-law and myself) all observed this object for at least 40minutes in which this time it had made a slightly curved course across the sky.

I had been doing this for a couple of minutes when i was startled to see a very bright object moving overhead.  It seemed to be moving quite quickly towards the spot in the sky where I had pulsed the laser a few seconds earlier.  Thinking that it was a plane, I was worried that I might have distracted the pilot, as I am always careful to avoid pointing my laser at aircraft.  As I continued to observe the light as it moved from overhead towards the northeast, I became puzzled because the light did not look like a regular plane or helicopter.  It was much brighter than any star in the sky.  It was slightly yellow, about the same color as the sun at midday.  It made no sound.  Its motion reminded me of that of a satellite, with no obvious changes in direction or speed relative to the stars.  I watched it for about a minute until it was about 30 degrees above the northeast horizon, at which point the light disappeared.  The light appeared to go from full brightness to dark in under 2 seconds, and had the appearance of ""flattening out"" from top to bottom just before I could no longer see it.  I interpreted this as the kind of behavior one would expect from a satellite moving into the earth's shadow.

And it was going so slow that I waited for it to fall out of the sky. Nothing I had ever seen before could stay in the air going so slow, except for a air balloon. And I know for a fact that this was not an air balloon. It slowly moved over the trees and when I came to my head again I tried to chase it but it was no where to be found.   Almost one month later we saw the same thing at the same time as before. I am not sure what is going on but it has us freaked out.   Now this is not connected to the story above but it happened and I swear on my life that it is true!  When  I was around 12 years old myself and some friends were on a camping trip with our boyscout troop. Late  that night after every one went to bed four of the other guys came and woke me and my tent mate up. They were going crazy and yelling saying that we needed to hurry up and get out there. When we got out of our tentthere was a wall of light, bright light. The next thing I remember it was morning and none of the other guys would talk about it. To this day if I bring it up they walk away. Something happened and it has been almost 12 years and they still will not talk about it.  When I was about 15 I saw the same thing that I saw here recently. It was a trianlge shaped craft moving very slowly over the road that me and two friends of mine were going down. We stoped the car and watched as the craft went over the trees. We sat there for a few minuets and then we saw five jets going the same path that the craft had taken.   I know that I am starting to sound crazy by putting all this up at once, but this is the first time I have gottn up the courage to tell anyone else. Around five years ago I was asleep with my wife and for some reasone I woke up. All I remember is that there was a bright white light and I felt like a car slammed into me, knocking me down on the bed. Then it was morning, and I do not remember anything else. I swear that everything I have stated in this is TRUE! I am not just some crazy guy, but I am very confussed about what is going on.

Jets seem to be closing in on two of them. Actually I have 3 sightings. One, was in the western sky, very far away, about 9:00 high.  It was rectangular in shape, and was a faint red.  It was moving very slowly across the sky in a southerly direction.  After noticeing that one, I turned around, heading back to the house, when I noticed a very bright red light, flashing, in the eastern sky about 10:00 high, much closer than the one to the west.  I also noticed a couple of planes fliing northbound in front of it.  As I kept watching it, I noticed a couple of Air Force jets to the south of the object.  They seem to have been heading for the light.  I ran in to get my camera, and when I came back out, the light had became very dim red.  The planes were still in the area of the object.  I turned on the video recorder on my camera, and all I could see was a red ball- like object, moving around on the screen.  I will send you a copy of what I recorded.  As I turned to come in the house, I noticed another bright light to the south, coming in my direction, slowly.  I kept watching for a few seconds to see what it was, when I noticed another jet approaching that object also.  Then, all the sudden, the object vanished. I am not crazy!!

I would also like to preface my report by saying that over the past few months, I have taken more of an active interest in the UFO phenomenon and its associated conspiracy theories. I find myself looking more into the skies as my belief system is changing as more and more reliable sources and disclosers are coming forward. Also in this report, I make no speculation as to what I might have seen; it is simply a report of my observation at the time. On Friday, November 21 at approximately 7:30 pm, I and my wife were driving to Seattle from the Eastside. We were driving east on I-90 across the floating bridge between Mercer Island and Seattle. The skies were clear that evening and the brightest stars were appearing. On such on occasion, I look more carefully into the skies. I was driving and my wife was riding. I noticed the heavy flight traffic as many airliners were landing with a southerly approach to SeaTac airport over downtown Seattle. As I was watching the planes come in, I noticed that in the approximate vicinity of the airport, at about 10 o’clock from my perspective somewhere between 35 and 40 degrees in the sky, I noticed a reddish light strobing slowly on and off (at intervals of 1-2 seconds on, 1-2 seconds off).  I could make out no discernible shape, and it seemed very far away, perhaps over the airport, but extremely high in the sky (I noted the object relative to the altitude of incoming aircraft).  It was a static object and reminded me of the red strobes of construction cranes.  However, there are no cranes in that direction and it was impossibly high in the air for a land-based construction.  My impression was that it was unlikely a helicopter, because relative to the air traffic it was higher than any helicopter flight I had witnessed. The drive across the bridge, on which I had a great view (traffic was light that evening, allowing me to look around a bit).  I kept watching for the two minutes across the bridge.  Once in Seattle, we made our way (5-7 minutes) to Capitol Hill where we parked and went to a concert.  Once out of the car, I could see at one point along the streets that the red blinking light was still in place. I did not mention it to my wife as I wanted to think through it before blurting out what I saw.  Today, we happened to meet a friend and the topic of UFO’s came up, which brought the memory back.  I decided to report my impressions hoping that others might have seen the same thing.  It was early enough and clear enough skies that there would have been plenty of opportunity for others to see the same thing.  I noticed the light for at least 10-12 minutes from the time I saw it on the bridge to the time we drove into town and parked.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

I pulled the car over and looked out and up.  The UFO we witnessed was HUGE and black metallic bottom with several lights around the cross/weird shaped object.  It was smokey looking around the lights, possibly due to the cold  (40 degree) night sky.?   We watched it move slowly left and right as it went away from us at 5-10mph. (approx.) There was absolutely NO SOUND, which baffled me considering it was immense.  I decided to try and follow it.  I drove around to the main entrance of the mall and we saw the UFO again and it had picked up the speed a bit.  We watched it head parallel to Hiawatha Blvd.. slightly SE/E.

I was on the telephone at the time also, so this sighting did not get my fullest attention sorry to say because this was extraordinary!  I'm always looking up and on that day, I happened to see the most unusual and hard to describe object!  It was white with a few appendages - at first.  I thought it was very strange and told my friend about it and then had to check to see that the cat wasn't escaping over the fence.  I was trying to convince who I was speaking to of what I was seeing, and after seeing the cat was ok I looked back up at the object.  It had been and was hovering in the same NE position.  What I saw next was that the things shape had changed and was changing. I then noticed that two other smaller orbs were either coming out of this thing or were coming from behind it because I had not noticed them before.  I focused in on the biggest of the 2 smaller orbs once ! they came into view.  This orb seemed to kind of change energy fields(?) because of its appearance like a forcefield around it, then rotated clockwise 3 times and in an instant darted downward angling to the left at a remarkable speed and then stopped (between but lower below the other two objects) and they all stayed in their relative positions.  It was almost as if it KNEW it had my undivided attention! Two more times this happened- the smaller objects darted in different directions/angles.  I was excitedly on the phone giving this account to my friend but couldn't convince them of my NOT having a rational explanation of this event.  At that time I decided to get my son from inside the house so he could witness this.  I put my head in the door to yell to him then turned around but they were gone!  I did some research on this and the closest thing resembling this sighting is the ""Strange Morphing UFO"" in Mexico that is on YouTube with the exception that my object was CLOUD ! -white color, and the orbs in my sighting were making some inc! redible maneuvers.

The light had just turned red so when I came to a stop, I just started gazing at the surroundings.  I noticed what I thought to be a plane north of where I was heading.  At first, I was intrigued at how shiny this ""plane"" was.  It was so chrome that it was reflecting.  As I sat there staring at it, I noticed that there was no rear stabilizer.  Just a chrome cigar, sitting there.  I turned to see if traffic had started to move and it hadn't, so I turned back to the object and it was gone.  Just like that!  I looked all around to see if I could spot it but there was no sight of it what so ever anywhere.  I kept searching, hoping to find but the person behind me started blowing their horn because traffic started moving again.  That's when I thought to myself if I was seeing a UFO, so I came home and found this website to see if anybody may have posted something so I wouldn't think I was nuts.  Sure enough, there is a posting on the second of June of a sighting in Canton, GA around the same time, although that is described as oval.  this may have been, I don't know.  What I do know is that is was long, very shiny and if I had to scale it, I would say that it was roughly about an inch and a quarter, maybe and inch and a half in length from where I was sitting.

I stopped to see what it was. At first all I saw were the lights. There were two or three dots of light. The colors were red and blue. I stared at the object for a few seconds and then I saw the shape of it. It was like a Frisbee shaped object that was right above me. It started to move from side to side. I could tell that this was not an airplane or a helicopter right away.  It was fairly large at that time right above me. I ran back to the house and got my friend. When he came out the object moved towards the mountains a little bit and looked further away but was still fairly large. It was approximately the size of a quarter, maybe a little bigger. We watched it move from side to side quickly. It moved very fast.  The object then after a few minuets took off down the sky line at very fast speeds. It took a straight path down to the mountain line near his place. The object then stopped and proceeded to move in strange ways. It moved around the sky at high speeds that of which an aircraft could not do. My friend then ran back into the house to get his brother.  When his brother came out of the house the object moved around a bit more and slowly seemed to almost fade away, like turning invisible.  This object when it was over me made no sounds at all. It made no sounds when it moved around. I know what satellites, airplanes, helicopters and shooting stars look like and this was neither of them. When the object was over me I could make out the figure of the object, and what the bottom portion of it looked like. It was metal and had an odd shaped bottom. What we saw the other night was unlike anything I have ever seen before. I didn’t really believe in UFO’S etc but after seeing that I don’t know anymore. All I know was that it was something strange. We watched the sky for about 30 minuets after the object had disappeared but saw nothing else. What this object did was physically impossible for any other aircraft to do. We think that this is either a top secret aircraft of some sort, or something else we might not have been meant to see. There are no military bases or anything near us for probably hundreds of kilometers. Nothing else can explain what this was. I feel crazy to have even seen something like this and I’m sure no one will really believe this but I thought I might at least write somebody to just report what the three of us saw and hope to get an answer back.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

As soon as he made the statement we looked at the light and it immediately took off. The craft took almost straight off curving with the wind.  After floating to an altitude still under clouds it proceeded to travel towards the west.  We heard no noise coming from the craft, and we are well aware of the noises normal air crafts (i.e. helicopters, air planes, balloons, etc.) would make. We continued to follow the craft through the sky and it appeared to be football shaped.  All lights on the craft were white, and the two that were on the sides were blinking simultaneously, unlike and air plane whose lights will blink one after another. Soon after, the craft disappeared in the distance, but not necessarily out of the atmosphere.  Since the sighting now about an hour later, we have heard a helicopter flying around the area as well as some other lights, possibly vehicles, traveling to the top of the mountain. We are more interested in what else it could be, seeing as how Camp Pendelton is so close, but this is unlike anything we have ever seen before.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,33.2581,-116.9821

Sometime in January of last year 2009, my boyfriend and I were walking through a field at about one in the morning, in the back of a park by where we live.  At the back of the field there are woods to the left that go behind apartments but also go down a steep hill that connects to someone’s field for their horses. As we were walking closer and closer to the woods I suddenly saw the entire woods light up as if there was a giant flashlight beam over everything.  I stopped walking and asked my boyfriend, who is that?  I thought it had to be a person and when he looked at the woods he saw the light right before it disappeared. We were frozen to the spot, it was the scariest thing id ever seen and then my boyfriend noticed a light on our feet, it looked like a bluish light from one of those high powered flashlights and we thought it was the cops, we were in the park after hours, but when I looked all around me and no one was there, no cop was shouting at us and the light was a perfect circle around us like someone was above us so we looked up and of course saw nothing but that was even worse than seeing something so we ran full speed down the field. We didn’t stop till we were all the way at the other end but my boyfriend looked back while we were running and he said he saw an orb of orange light gliding down the field, when I looked it was gone but we started running again anyways because we were afraid of being chased. We didn’t go back to the park for awhile but a couple weeks later when I wasn’t afraid anymore we went back.  That night my boyfriend and I had an argument so we sat under the pavilion to talk about it.   I had my back to the field but he was facing it and he pointed towards the woods and told me to look because he saw a bright orange light in the sky.  I looked but the light was gone.  I stared at the spot for a minute and then looked away when he said it came back and this time it was there.  The light was small,  from our view point it looked like the size of a beach ball. After about fifteen or twenty seconds the light started to expand.  It just got bigger and brighter, and then the most amazing unexplainable thing happened.  It seemed to unfold and it went from a big ball of light into exactly what you would picture a UFO to look like, a saucer shaped hover craft, except the light was so bright that it didn’t have a defined shape.  It was like the sun on earth, it blurred the vision around the UFO and after five or ten seconds it started to descend behind the woods and I assume it landed in the field behind it.  My boyfriend and I wanted to get closer, to go find it but I refused to go in the woods at night.   Since then I haven’t ever seen anything like that but I honestly now believe aliens or someone not like us is out there, watching, or maybe waiting for something. What I saw has inspired me to look up a lot of information on aliens and I think when these UFO’s are seen it is by choice to determine when or if ever it will be acceptable for aliens to walk among us.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,38.807988732394364,-90.31338873239436

I will list below the year and what was going on at that time. 1985  My 1st sighting, I was in 6th grade, we just came home from food shopping, it was late, my dads friend stopped by, I went into the backyard to help with the groceries, while talking to my dads friend, I noticed lights above me, when I looked up, I saw a large, round craft that was encircled with lights, it moved so slow, I stood there watching it, as it was barely above my home, I asked my dads friend “What is that” he stated “I don’t know”. We watched it moved towards my garage, then past the alley, then disappeared out of sight. It was so strange, I never spoke of it. This sighting was in Upland, CA   1989 I was 16, while driving to pick up my friend who lived in Ontario, CA, I noticed an object moving quickly through the sky, it was cylinder in shape. What caught my eye, is that while flying, the craft seemed to be flipping, or turning, it was so strange, that I found myself watching it, suddenly just disappeared. This was in the evening, it was dark out. Summer 2000 While driving through Phoenix, AZ, it was late, I was on my way to California from Texas, the sky was changing colors rapidly which caught me and my brother’s eye. It was about dusk, when the first craft appeared out of clouds it came, suddenly there were 2, then next thing we knew, there were 5. We started to talk about the crafts and it was like they heard us. The crafts were round, and almost in formation style, when one craft lifts looked like they were signaling to the others, then the others started to signal back. The next thing we knew we were being followed by the crafts, I know it sounds strange, but they stayed with us till we reached our destination. I was so scared I even stopped at some gas station to call my husband, and mom to tell them I was being followed and didn’t know what to do, of course they didn’t believe me, needless to say, I never pulled over to sleep that night, and drove straight through to California. During the time I was driving ! they would put a light on us, then back away, they would hide behind building then pop out of know where, then they drive along side our car. I had never been so scared, and it really sucked no one believed us.  March 2009 My daughter actually seen this one, she states she was in her room, when she heard a noise, she walked to the window to see 2 crafts, one was hovering above the other. The other one was in our backyard, hovering, she states it was round with lights all around it. She states after a few minutes, it finally started moving towards the front of the house, she came running downstairs saying “I just seen a UFO it going to the front” so we all ran out to the front porch, but we did not see anything. This was in the evening after dusk, in Piqua, ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  We have invited the witness to re-submit her reports, each separately from the others.

I happened to find this site, and decided to report my observation which took place quite a few months ago while in New Mexico.  I just want to start by adding mt comment that I didn't want to bother to edit this observation report on MS format cause it's too time-consuming and rather cumbersome, though your guideline tell me to do so.  I apologize for that first^^    Here I'm in S.Korea, my native country.  While searching for UFO reports which i've also have some interest in on CNN website and I encountered this reporting site of UFOs.  And it made me to determine reporting what had taken place very long time ago and I forgot to bother to clarify the incidence by way of telling other people, researching documents-i has begun to do this only recently a little bit but not much- or contacting experts on this subject or issue.  I had many other things to take care of, or be concerned about, and Iwasn't even sure what the magnitude of my observation would be to other people, or society that's currently still skeptical about accepting this issue of UFO thing!   To be honest I'm unable to recall the exact date of this incidence, so your discretion for this part.   Actually not even certain whether it was April or some earlier months since Sandia Mountain on its peak had quite some snow accumulation around.  I was on my way back to Motel 6 Exit paseo del norte two exits donw from Tramway RD toward City of Alburquerque.  It was almost to midnight.  I was coming from Santa Ana Star Casino at City of Bernalillo, after I spent the day at Santa Fe up I-25 North.  Now below I'd say only specifics of the UFO sighting provided with as much description as I can recall now- I'm sure I can do better on this part than the date of the incidence thatI can't remember. While driving I-25 southbound to that lodge just passed Bernalillo city limit, through the front windshield I saw what appeared to be presumably a bright yellow light (front) of an airplane like a bright headlights of upcoming cars.  It was approaching closer to my direction headed up north.  First, I'd rather want to emphasize the speed of this flying object (or an airplane at the time of observation) wasn't that fast at all, rather similar to that of normal commercial aircrafts. This object was getting closer 'n closer to where I was and at a certain point it was flying, passing right above of my car and if I didn't look up to see it, I'd certainly have thought it as a usual airplane.  Before I describe how I could bend and lean my head to the right of steering wheel move my neck 'n head to look up, at that time freeway traffic was few and I just felt like to look at it, even if it were to be just an airplane. This remarkable 'n breathtaking sighting (and a short obersation) happened, therefore, starting its closer approach toward above my car just till its blocked by the roof of my car! What extraordinary about the sighting here it is.. The rear or behind of the object A BLUISH GREEN BRIGHT LIGHT AROUND LIKE CONICAL SHAPE AND ORANGE-CLORED SPARKLING LIKE WIELDER'S SPARKS, OR SOME KIDN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT FAILURE?  Judging upon its speed I doubt it was a satellite crashing down to earth, or meteorites.  And I'm quite certain it wasn't an airplane.  This odd 'n mysterious sighting happened within a period of less than a few seconds-but perhaps longer than 5 seconds! (I was crazy!  Dangerous!) I had an impression that this flying object was a crashing one due to perhaps certain causes. At the time I could've pulled over to side road to keep my eyes on this object but somehow I chose not to.  Why not?  First of all, I got scared something bad might happen to me, if not from this odd object maybe from cops or gangs!  Second of all, some whisper told me i saw enough and don't try to ask the identity of this things any further.  How?  I can't explain but it's not a physical whisper I'm taking about, but some powerful feeling or instinct that ""Let's just keep it that way"".  So I told myself 'I saw enough' and headed back to my M6 LODGE.  That's all!  Let me know your expertise about this observaation.   Waht was it??  You can contact me to my E-mail^^ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2010-02-14T00:00:00,,

I was heading south toward Southlake and as I got to Spring Creek Pkwy, I notice a circle shaped object with lots of lights on top of HWY 121. (about 6:30 am )  I thought that I was seeing things but right after that another one following each other was traveling very slowly like they were observing.   Not too many cars on the road but very few cars that were traveling in my direction were braking to watch.  It was impossible to stop so I then stopped in the nearest station and called the non-emergency police 972 941-2142.  They advised me to call FAA ( 206 722-3000 ), which I did and got a voice mail of Mr. Davenport is full.  I called the police back and they told me that was the only number they had and for me to report and also fill out form on line at www.ufocenter.com  I saw total of 4 circle shape objects traveling slowly above HWY 121 with very bright lights perhaps 14-16 big round lights.

For those that have seen something spectacular, like what I'm about to describe, it can be a particularly tedious burden.  Even your best friends and family that you trust with your life may struggle to comprehend and accept it. My Dad and I were standing by a lake behind our apartment in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio.  I was about 25.  My Dad would have been about 48.  It was late, very late.  Clear night.  Dark.  But, even though it was about 2-3AM and dark, there's a glow from all the lights in the area, which almost makes the dark night a little luminescent...  it's a little easier to make out stuff against it's background.  Not as if what we were about to see was difficult to see. This wasn't just a distant group of lights.  This wasn't one of those sightings that could have been something else.  This was an extremely close-up, almost to the point of being scary sighting. It started as I was looking up at the beautiful night.  I said in total panic/excitement as it approached, ""DO YOU SEE THAT, DAD...  TELL ME YOU SEE THAT...""! It was coming across the sky at a fairly slow rate of speed....  maybe about the same rate as a car on a backroad....  about 40mph.  Seemed slower, but I'm guessing that 40 mph looks slower at about 1,500-2000ft.  The excitement was indescribable.  As it flew from the left(going west) it nearly crossed rt above us.  You could easily see the structure of the craft.  It was like a dark black against the lit up gray nt.  It was a perfect triangle with slightly rounders corners.  Just inside the outer rim in each corner, fitting perfectly, there were perfect circle lights.  Subtle lights as in an extremely soft white light bulb.  As it got closer the lights appeared to have movement, possibly circular, almost gasious in appearance.  There was NO sound as this object came to a halt nearly right above us.  Sat hovering still for about 20 seconds, pivoted on an axis about 90-100 degrees, and then flew away in a fashion that is very hard to describe and accept. After pivoting it sta! rted to move south at the earlier slow rate of speed, only this time, within seconds, it accelerated at an astronomical rate.  Going from right over our heads to out of sight in about 2 seconds...  the first second slowly moving... and then out of sight about 1 second later. This is when the harsh reality sets in.   We both went back inside the apartment(about 60yards away), and pondered what we should do.  Our hearts were still racing.  SHould we call the cops? No Way.  The Paper? No.  It didn't take long for us to realize that our sighting, as clearly defined and unquestionable as it was to us, would sound crazy.  I think i remembered reading something in the paper, maybe the day after, that talked about multiple sightings of a simliar craft around Bellfountaine, Ohio. This sighting was something that Dad and I both took extremely serious for a long time.  But, after years of realizing that our little secret was actually better kept that way, it still haunts us in such a profound way that it has literally changed both of our views of religion and science.  What we saw WAS NOT human.  It was NOT built by humans.  It was NOT being flown by humans.  Could NOT have been flown by humans.  Could NOT have been built by humans.  It was unquestionably a craft from another world.  This is information that we have shared less and less as time has passed since the event.   It has changed our very lives, but it's not something that we bring up very often.  I think we both regret not being able to talk about it more.   We both regret that more people didn't see what we saw.  I guess for some people there's sightings that could have been something else.  This sighting was nothing else.  It was exactly what we thought it was.  It will always be.  I should ! feel very priviledged.  Not many people see something like this that is so clear and undeniable.  So unlike how the event comes off when it's told to anyone else.  Everyone else wants to explain away what we saw - if only they had been there to see there was no explaining away this 'ifo'.  That's the way i refer to it...   because I have identified it as something not of this world. My Dad was a minister of 30 years.  After the event, he stopped preaching and basically dropped religion altogether.  The event had a similiar effect on me as far as religion.  I just want to yell at the skeptics, but you can't.  If I had a clear tape of the event, and took it to the media, it would probably get dismissed away as 'such a great sighting that it couldn't be real'.  And that's the sad reality of things when it comes to ufo sightings.  The media and the government have made it so taboo.  It's crazy.  You're literally deemed psychotic if you've seen one.  We are two very normal people.  No mental health history in our family.  No reason to make up something like this.  I can only imagine that people that actually make up sightings suffer the same fate as people who actually see something out of this world - denial and rejection.   My Dad and I are about as down to earth as anybody.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,40.108822448979595,-83.14292857142857

I do not see my report, I guess I'll send again.  On two separate occasions when I was 16 years old, in the summer of 1997, I saw green glowing fireballs in the woods of Lawton, Michigan.  Something got me thinking about it again--every once in awhile when I wonder about it, I will do a search for ""fireballs"" ""ball lightning"" and ""swamp gas"" and the pictures and descriptions I find don't really describe what I saw.  I don't know what I saw.  I know it absolutely terrified me because I didn't know what it was, and it seemed to move with an intelligence, that is what really frightened me.  That it did not seem to be moving randomly or as something seen in nature, but like it was exploring and moving in a very deliberate way around the trees--up very high, down very low, close to our window, farther away.  Each time, there were 2+ balls, although I can't say exactly how many, because we were in a! cabin looking out the window and not getting a full vantage point.  Basically we were frozen in fear in our beds, watching out the window. The approximate size of the balls I would compare to an appliance like an average size washer or dryer or stove.  Even just writing about it and thinking about it makes me feel a little freaked out. I just did not get a good impression from these things.  Both times we saw it, it was sometime between midnight and 1 am, when we were staying up late talking with the lights out.  Both times we watched for awhile until we had the courage to jump up and turn the lights on (with the lights on you couldn't see out the window into the blackness).  Both times I checked the woods behind the cabin the next morning, and saw nothing but the most unremarkable leaves, trees, brambles...completely homogeneous, unremarkable woods for as far as you could see!!

I have had dreams “vividly” off and on since it happened.  Just recently,  I began experiencing these dreams again.  After searching on the Internet for the meaning of these dreams I found this site.  I am a very “down to earth” type person that usually believes in only Science and Facts.  I have heard many stories from family and others about UFO’s.  And never believed until ten years ago. It was the summer of 2000.  I was traveling down Highway 11, a country road between Weippe Idaho and Orofino Idaho.  I was on my way to Orofino Idaho after visiting a friend in Weippe.  This stretch of road is in the middle of nowhere.  It is on top of a mountain surrounded by wheat fields.  The most you might see normally is a deer in your path.  About 2130 as I entered an area of the road known as “Fraser” (Fraser is a small section of land named after a few old time farmers from the past) I was shocked to see several lights hovering over a mountain top roughly (as the crow fly’s) 25 miles away.  This particular part of the mountain has no what so ever houses or lights and barely any roads.  As I slowed to a near stop I noticed two other vehicles pulled over looking at the lights.  One was a beat-up pickup and one was a station wagon type car.  I pulled in behind them and turned off my lights.  I immediately got out my binoculars and started surveying the lights.  What I ! saw was literally “out of this WORLD”.  There was 6 lights surrounding one singular light in the middle.  The light in the middle was very strange as it was not as bright and pulsated from green to blue to red and back again.  The shape was in a perfect triangle shape just like a upright Pyramid.  The most Awesome thing about this was the size.  It had to be as big as a CITY!  Measuring the only way I knew how, I stretched out my thumb and forefinger and put it up to the sky, It was as I said a good 25 miles away and was at least 3 ½ inches between my thumb and finger in width.  That would make it at least a mile or more wide at this distance.  I and the others watched it for at least ten minutes.  The lights where so close to the top of the mountain it was over that it actually lit up the peak.  After about ten minutes the Station wagon car took off down the road back towards Weippe at a high rate off speed almost hitting me.  Just then the “object” turned slowly just so y! ou could see it’s bottom 3 lights.  Those three lights slowly ! powered up “got very bright” and the whole thing disappeared in a explosion of light.  Just like you would see on Star Trek when they went into “Warp” drive.  I then, dumb founded went over to the pickup truck to see what they had seen only to realize that there was no one in the truck at all.  I think that they all left in the other car, or the pickup was empty to began with.  I think back and could slap my self for not getting the trucks licence plate number if only to verify that I was not going nuts!  I then drove home very shaken up and tried to go to sleep with no luck. The dream that I keep having involves this craft coming over the horizon and a feeling of “impending doom” like the world is going to end.  I know this sounds unbelievable but it is true.  I am of sound mind and have never told this to anyone other than my wife.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,46.4867,-116.1268

The craft was larger than the strip mall across the street, at least two football fields in square footage, though I could not see the end points of the entire craft on all sides.  It was probably larger than an aircraft carrier.  It appeared rectangular or perhaps a very large triangular shape, but it was so large I could not discern the shape.  It completely covered the view of the sky from my window. I could see it's underside and it was slowly moving over a neighborhood of townhomes next to mine. I had woken up in the middle of the night and had a strange urge to look outside and that's when I saw it ""floating"" very slowly and very low overhead.  It was maybe a few stories above the rooftops of the hig! hest home.  It made absolutely no sound, and was a very dark matte finish (not shiny metallic), not reflective at all, with a very complex underside of infrastructure (i.e., it wasn't smooth underneath but had what appeared to be rectangular and other geometric shaped objects on it's underside protruding from underneath).  It had no lights anywhere on the craft, contrary to what a lot of reports seem to detail.  This had no lights whatsoever, and I doubt anyone would have seen it if they didn't look up because it blended so perfectly against the night sky and was completely devoid of any sound.  It slowly hovered away from my townhouse and then I saw it stop and start to move back to where my home was.  I always thought I'd be the first person to run out to something like this and be proud to witness it, but to my surprise I was literally so afraid that I couldn't continue to look out my window and went hiding in fear.  I guess when something like this actually happens to y! ou, the perspective becomes one of instinctual survival.  I ha! d a stro ng sense that my observation of this had been detected and I felt very vulnerable and exposed for about 5 minutes and then the feeling of being watched just stopped.  That's when I looked out again and it was gone.  I wish I had had the courage to go outside and observe it more closely or get some photographs.  I have promised myself that no matter what, if this ever happens again, I will do whatever I can to get evidence of it regardless of how afraid I am.

I always thought the experience was awe inspiring and that the timing of the event was extremely coincidental.  But in retrospect, after flipping backwards through my journal, ANY EVENT BEFORE 9-11 is significant.  I have searched for others' reports of UFO activity on 9-10 but have found none, and therefore find it useful to finally let this information out for the universe to chew on. Here is my journal entry:   ""Monday 10 - Nighttime...walking back from Starbucks, I see a trapazoid shaped object flying through the sky...underneath this object were [many] faint lights...about 600-900ft off ground.""   Context: I was an engineering student at the University of Texas at the time and was walking back to my dorm at the time.  I was standing right outside the University Coop on Guadalupe St., looking up above the UT Tower.  I was waiting at the crosswalk and had nothing better to do other than look up, when suddenly, I noticed these lights traveling at great speed.  At first I thought I was seeing birds illuminated by the UT Tower, but then birds don't travel that high, that smoothly, that quickly. The object was flying southbound passing nearly above the UT Tower, traveling towards the Texas Congressional building.  Now I'm no expert, but I would assume that any area above UT/Texas Congress would be restricted, a no-fly zone.  My memory may be hazy here but I would say it traveled about a mile in 5 seconds.  That's roughly 720 mi/hr.  I only say a mile because that's what I would estimate a normal person can see at night looking up.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

I was 16 years old and was studying in the second year of college. I do remember that I recorded the EXACT date and time of the sighting along with a verbal description of the nature of the UFO, but cannot find the original record anywhere. I also wish to state that the reason I am submitting this report is because of a second sighting I made barely a week ago, in the same country but a different city hundreds of miles away from the first and a full nine years later. I am 24 years old and havehad two sightings in my life thus far. Situation and description:   It was summer and I was on the terrace at our place in Bangalore, India, at around seven in the evening.  My brother had just headed back downstairs and I lingered on for a while longer as the weather was pleasant.  I lay down on the ground and stared at the sky star gazing. I don’t remember which constellation I was looking at exactly, but I spotted a bright shining light from the corner of my eye, a little distance away from the spot I was looking at.   As I first looked at it I thought it was a star because that’s exactly what it appeared to be (almost as bright as Sirius). Then I realized it was moving, albeit very slowly, to the right.   As I watched it suddenly seemed to accelerate for a while before stopping abruptly and changing direction at an angle of ninety degrees.  I sat up as I thought my eyes were tricking me, but the object did not stop and was definitely not an illusion or a trick of light.  It stood out against the pitch black sky, which ! I thought was remarkable considering Bangalore’s light pollution.  The object continued to zig-zag along a roughly linear axis,and it was this zig-zag motion at high speed that amazed me for I have never seen an aircraft capable of such abrupt change of direction at such high speeds before.  As it proceeded along its path it changed seemed to me it was changing colour, from the dull yellow, starlike tinge it originally had(at least when I spotted it) to blue and finally to a dull green flicker.  This ‘phenomenon’ lasted for a good couple of minutes, disappearing behind the silhouette of the taller building next to our own for some twenty-thirty seconds before reappearing on the other side.  It then disappeared in a matter of moments, with the intensity of light decreasing to zero and vanishing. This was all I saw. I have seen weather balloons before, and I am absolutely certain what I saw was no such thing for without adequate propulsion I think it is impossible to move as rigidly and discretely as this body did.  Same reasoning also rules out any form of burning/incandescent matter floating toward the earth.  As for the object itself I know absolutely nothing of its form, shape or even size because all I saw was a bright spot of light.  Curiously enough, this was a few months after news of the Mir space station’s ‘demise’ and its break-up in the atmosphere.  Clearly this had nothing to do with the ‘sighting’, in my opinion, considering the time-gap between the two events and the obvious impossibility of debris acquiring wings of its own and flying about.  Also, there is an air-force base in Bangalore, but I enquired about and have been told Indian Airforce crafts are NOT allowed to fly over the city airspace. And in any case I know India isn’t capable of such ‘top-secret’ flight testing programmes, yet. I have no choice but to brand this sighting an UFO.

We were in a rural community, which I would rather not disclose due to the cultural grounds close to the sighting.  But my brother, his wife, her little brother, and myself were all sitting in a broken down car while every one else was in an inipi (sweat ceremony).  My brother, his wife, and myself were smoking a cigarrette, and her little brother was staring at the horizon in a northwest direction.  And he spotted 1 dim light off in the distance that seemed real low.   It begin to move and disappear behind hills as if it were traveling over the prairie close to the ground.  As it came closer I say still around 3 miles away it split into 2 dim lights, and they both seemed as if they were slowly zigzaging back and forth.  We got out of the car by then and stood at the top of the dirt road leading to the sweat ceremony.  The lights got 1/4 miles away and came down into the valley we were in, and approached the island which is accross the creek from where we were.!  The island itself is about 1/2 mile in diameter.   Both lights then turned into 2 separate colors-one Red, one blue.  The blue light came to the closer end of the island by us.  By then that would be about 300 yards away.   They both intensified the color by getting VERY bright, so bright it lit up the valley as if it were day. I remember focusing on the blue light, but it was so bright, and we all became scared and turned and ran...   We never went back to see what it had done.  But thats the story. Also there was no sound…",2010-04-13T00:00:00,44.9338,-100.9795

My dad was driving in our truck and I was in the passanger seat.  We were stopped at a left turn signal on Indian River Rd.  While we were waiting for the light to change out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright circular object, at first i thought it was the full moon, but it was not the moon.  I looked at the object and I was glowing bright white to orange to redish colors, almost as if it was on fire.  There was also a tail somewhat like a comet's tail coming of of the back of it.  The way this object moved though could not have been a comet, or a rocket.  My dad was watching it as well once I pointed it out to him.  He is a high level navy Senior Cheif and now works in a control tower for a nearby base.  The object sometimes just floated, there seemed to be no sound whatsoever, and then it would make complex movements left to right, diagnoly, straight down, up, any way it wanted.  This lasted about 2 minutes. I looked at the car in front of us and noticed the couple in the car were also pointing to the object in the sky.  Soon after the object made some more maneuvers.  Then as if having the ability to accelerate to what I believe to be the speed of light, the orb, craft, object whatever it may have been.  Shot off at an amazing speed and in a matter of 1-2 seconds completely disapeared. This image has stuck in my head ever since and I dont think I will ever get an explanation for what we saw that night.  My father contacted Langley to see if any launches were scheduled for that day and there was nothing. My father works with many top officials now that he is retired and now a civilian working on base in the control tower.  He knows what we saw that night was nothing at least in military arsenal that has been released. This area has seen many sighting since then...

My first thought was, ""that's a very big bird!"". In a matter of seconds it was overhead and I realized it wasn't flapping or moving as a bird would, just a steady movement to the south. Graphic-2 depicts what it looked liked overhead. When it was overhead it was much dimmer and had no lights or sound whatsoever. There was some kind of disturbance or disturbed air in a short wake to the rear. It took 10 seconds to go from the skyglow to the north and disappearing in the skyglow to the south, about 50 degrees. I realized that if this was a bird at low level it would have passed to the east at just above roof top level, assuming 500 to 1000 foot altitude. This would be 30 to 60 mph, and with no flapping movement - not a bird. If it was a plane high enough so as not to be heard then it was flying without lights and would have been MASSIVE in size.
