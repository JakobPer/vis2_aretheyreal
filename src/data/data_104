Ok, so I have never came forward with my story, but it was a humbling experience.  It was memorial day weekend my junior year in high school.  Some friends and I went to lake Hartwell at a buddys camp ground.  It was set up like a circle (the campsites) and the gazeebo was at the top of a hill in the middle of all the sites.  I went to take a shower that night after a great day of fun.  And no I was not drinking at all the entire trip or on any drugs.  When I came out of the shower, I sat on the bench at the front of the gazeebo and could see boats going by on the water.  You could only see the lights in the front and back.  When I looked up at the stars one imparticular caught my eye. It was very bright and large for as far as it was.  I remember thinking that must be mars but I thought mars was red, this star was blueish.  Then I thought I saw it move so I was fixated on it.  After a few seconds it did start moving verry slow across the sky to the left.  There was nothing in the way of this entire sighting.  Then it stoped and almost imediatly disapeared and imediatly re appeard on the right towards where it first came from and did this manover three times.  It was un believeable!  On the last time it moved to the left it stoped and instead of disapearing like before it streaked in almost a figure 8 with a swirle and went straight out away from earth.  I was terrified.  And you must realise not just the speed of this thing but the distance of a foot when its so far away...  I dont know how many miles that would have been.  I even remember running down the hill to tell the guys but somthing stopped me.  I didnt bring it up.",2015-10-16T00:00:00,,

Of course you always see planes coming and going from Newark or the nyc ports, but a) you can usually easily see the shape of an airplane, and the blinking lights...the red one underneath about half way point of the plane, and then the two white or yellow one on both wings.  These lights alternate.  The typical airplane lights.  What I saw was no doubt different.  Could have been something terrestrial and maybe not even secret, but there isn't anything like what I saw that I know of.  There were three white lights making a perfect equilateral triangle.  Not a wide boomerang, and not a narrow christmas tree shape.  A 60 degree angle for each of the three angles.   This shape/distance/angles stayed 100% constant leading me to beleive it was one vehicle or three vehicles in the most perfect formation ever (definitely the former).   The object glided smoothly and somewhat slow.  I had my window down and no sound.  Maybe the sound was drained out by the noise of downtown New Brunswick, but I hear the rumble of planes all the time over the city noise.  The thing that perplexed me further was that I could only make out a very vaugue body to the craft, or even translucent.  It was at the time of evening where the sun is almost fully set but there is that residual twilight from the last bits of sunlight hitting and bouncing around in the atmosphere.  It wasn't pitch black but a dark blue sky.  A sky in which one could make out the body of a plane at the same altitude.

On the night of July 26, 2000, I was at a Bible study with 8 other friends.  We had finished the discussion and questions portion of the study and were outside in the backyard of the house we were at.  We were engaged in small talk when one of the girls asked, ""What is that?""   We all looked up at what she was looking at.  It seemed to be a large white blob in the sky that was moving fast against the background of stars.  It seemed to have color separation like a rainbow on its edges.  The effect seemed to wear off and the blob changed to an orange/amber color and it slowed down to a crawl.  When it did this, we were able to see smaller orange/amber colored glowing spheres fallowing it.   There were hundreds of the small fuzzy spheres that followed the large fuzzy glowing blob.  As we were looking at this event we saw a bright blue flash of light that seemed to light up the eastern sky.   We then turned our attention back to the objects in the sky.  They just moved slowly to the western sky from the eastern sky.  We could see, as the moved father away, that they were very high in altitude.   We began talking to each other about what they might be.  And of course this was a group of Bible belt Christians, so the discussion about what we saw lead of into them being signs and wonders from heaven(I never believed that).   A few minutes later we saw one of the fuzzy spheres flying to the south of where we were at the altitude of an airplane.  We watched it move off out of sight.   When I left the house where the Bible study took place I drove my car down the street to the east were we saw the blue flash.  I saw a local electrical company truck in the alley way working on a transformer.  So that might be where the bright blue flash came from.   The next day the girl who first saw the event spoke to her father about it over the phone about what we saw.  Her father worked as an executive of some kind at NASA.  He immediately told her to stop talking to him about the matter, and to never talk to him about it ever aga! in.  He then hung up on her.   She said that this scared her because not only did he never talk to her or their family members like that, but also he also taught them to never do such things.  So this, according to her, was completely out of character for him to do.   We never spoke of the event after that day.  I always felt uneasy about what her father did giving his position at NASA.  I thought someone like him would be excited about such a thing.",2015-09-11T00:00:00,33.54170373692077,-101.90381898355756

First and foremost, thank you, for letting me get this off my chest.  What I saw on this night, as with any other u.f.o. witness, left me changed, I saw something I couldn't unsee, and you know we are treated when we speak out to others who don't understand.  I've felt alone for so long because of this, despite this event causing me to delve deep into understanding myself, my soul, and how we are all connected with the universe.   Every night now, every night, I look at the stars, wondering, wishing for another appearance, a sign to remind me that I am not insane. I know I am not, however, this doesn't dissolve my feelings of anxiety. Sadness that something I know I saw with my own two eyes, something so massive, was hardly spoken about with sincerety among regular people.  By speaking to them about it, I often become an outcast, a freak. They think I say these things because I want the attention.  Why would someone want to fake feeling this? Why would I persist a! bout what I saw years after it happened, why continue with such enthusiasm about it?  Why would someone who was lying go on for so long.  Anyone with genuine reason would understand. I speak my pain, I have much of it. Not only have I had this one encounter, I have had several over the years, this one being the first and most significant for obvious reasons. My anguish, anxiety, and sadness have finally provoked me to try to tell this to anyone who will listen seriously.  This may never be read. maybe not for a long time, but at least I know this is a genuine attempt to record these happenings.  I thank you so much for what you do.  I am strong enough to continue with my life, but I just need to get this off my chest. The encounter started on a warm summer night in Terrell, Texas.  I was working the night shift at the Walmart there, and I was on my way home.  I always took the same route every night. A backroads country town route, quite scenic, and I was extremely familiar with my way home and my surroundings.  Most nights, I would ride with the music blasting, I was 20 at the time, young, wild and looking for adventure, on this night however, I wouldn't understand what I would see.  There's a road, that you take from Terrell, to Kaufman, and along the way, you can choose to go towards Forney, a three way divide.  The road is Highway 148, I would turn on to 987 toward Kaufman that night. As I approached the split, from about 3/4's of a mile out, I faced directly the spot where I would see the ship, driving at about 55 mph.  There was only one other car on the road that late, and I still wonder if they happened to look up and see what I saw, but as I came to a stop in the middle of the road to watch what was happening above me, the car drove on like nothing had occured. I've learned that some people are simply more keen and aware of these events than other's, however I now wish they had stopped with me, so I'd know someone else saw it.   So, as i approached the divide, I was jamming out to music, still paying attention to the road, and as I'm looking ahead to see if anyone was coming from either direction, since I needed to turn left, I notice a very peculiar, bright light.  By my estimation, it was a good 40 feet off the ground, probably more. then another 50 feet or more higher, was another bright white light, and then another at another 50 feet high above the! last.  The three, aligned straight up and down, vertically.  At first, it looked to me like a cell phone tower, but then i realized, I hadn't seen any construction crews in the area over the last few days, there was no way it was a tower, with that realization, I was shocked. so shocked that I started to slow down with the other car behind me. I turned onto the yellow median  that you would use to turn onto 987, to get out of his way, a part of me wondering if he would slow down as well. As I got closer to the intersection, to my amazement, the lights started moving in perfect unison, toward me.  As they got closer, I had to stick my head closer to the windshield to look above me, and then outside the door window. As I approached, the lights slowly went into a horizontal  position, and as I got under it, I could make out a faint outline of the ship, I could see lights were defintely not suspended on their own, they were on something very long and narrow, and as it got horizontal, it started moving quicker, completely smoothly, with absolutely no sound, no chopper noise, no jet sounds, nothing. It kept turning to my right, towards, Forney, and in the direction of Dallas, slowly but now moving along nicely. At this point I was out of my car and in the middle of the road. The other car had left, and I had stayed, the! ship eventually disappeared behind a tree line. Now, I wish I had had the wherewith of it all, to chase it down and try to get footage, but alas, I was in complete shock wondering what the hell this thing was. It looked like no plane I had ever seen before, and no jet I had seen pictures of. Immediately after, I called my buddy from the Marines, to tell him what I saw, hoping he would have an answer, he didn't. That was the last I saw of that ship, despite having other encounters, I never saw one that looked like that again. This all occured with in 3 minutes, I feel like when it realized I had spotted it, it's cover was blown and it just wanted to disappear. My question is why was I able to see it. and the other driver just kept going? Maybe they were looking at their phone at the time, I don't know. Of all the experiences I've had, that one takes the cake, I find it amazing how big the thing was, yet having read articles about the Battle of Los Angeles, and the Phoenix lights, I know there are ships much more massive than what I saw, which puts me at ease a bit. To know dozens, if not hundreds or thouands of people saw something bigger than I did. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I don’t go out looking for this stuff!  Sometime in Mid-August of 2014, I had an all-night studio session.  On the way to the studio, I called my friend to accompany me and he agreed to tag along.  When we got there my engineer was upstairs waiting and we began our night. About 2 or 3 hours into recording, I finished a song and told my engineer I was stepping out for a smoke with my friend.  It was a black n’ mild (tobacco), not weed so I’m pretty damn sure there were no hallucinations.  When we came downstairs we walked to the middle of the empty parking lot (besides my car) and lit it and started talking about things non related to the issue. A moment passed and I looked up (I like to star gaze) and far in the air was something I’ve never seen before.  I tapped my friend and pointed up, cursing.  Honestly because I was a little scared, I’ve never seen anything like that before.  We sat there well over a minute staring at whatever this thing is floating in the air. Here’s where things get technical. First off the sky was clear, nothing to mistake this for.  The moon was full and the object height wise was next to the moon.  Distance wise, it was at least 4 or 5 miles away from us.  To get a better idea of this think about a plane passing by in the sky, only this object was “floating.” If you were to look at a full moon, put your hand up and make a 3 to 4 inch gap with your fingers from the edge of the moon and that is how far the object looked away from the moon from our point of view. It was bright orange, with a little yellow. It was smoking and had an orange fog around it as if it was about to explode. Initially we thought it was an aircraft that exploded in the air. Contrary to that there were no airplanes or helicopters visible anywhere within our sight! That’s weird especially in Central Florida speaking on how we have nonstop air traffic.  One thing I did notice was that a few birds were flying in the opposite direction of this thing in the sky. It was circular, large and almost seemed like something ran into it, or hit it with something. It began to smoke heavily but the smoke was drifting to the side of it where we could still clearly see it.  As the smoke thickened pieces of it began to fly off, almost looking like it was getting shot by another aircraft. About 3 mini, non-hearable explosions took place before we started backing up. About 8 to 10 minutes went by before I finally pulled out my phone and called my engineer to immediately come outside. I don’t know why his reaction was like this but he didn’t seem pretty surprised. He actually told us it’s probably just the “military’s doing.”  I told him he was full of it and tried to take a picture.  The damn thing showed up as a blur on every single one of my pictures! I’ve always owned an iPhone which is generally known for taking good pictures but tonight it was as if something prevented my phone from snapping a picture clearly. After maybe 5 more minutes of staring, the fog around it began to consume the craft and eventually as oddly as it was the in the sky, it dissipated, slowly fell and disintegrated almost to what seemed into thin air.  Not believing what I’d just seen I looked around to see if anyone else was outside staring at the phenomenon and sure enough right in front of us was a man walking by on the sidewalk stopping to stare in the same area we were looking. As there was no way to show evidence and prove what we had seen to anyone else we shook it off, went back into the studio and honestly never spoke about it again.

It was tapered at the top and a bit at the bottom, think of a tiered cake combined with a typical flying saucer.  Closer towards the bottom, the main body of the UFO stopped, and there was a thinner ring of orange and possibly red lights?  I don't remember the exact colors, but I do remember there was a thinner ring that had orange lights that seemed to rotate, or at least flash at different colors to make it seem like it rotated.

I was at an equestrian event with our daughter and lunch was around 11:30 am.   As I was making my way to the serving area, I was taking in the beautiful, clear blue sky.  Looking north, toward Huntsville, AL, I noticed what immediately struck me as a group of 15 white orbs meandering from west to east.  They reminded me very much of the many photos I’ve seen of such orbs, meaning that they are sort of strung out in a line, and spaced up and down, in no particular pattern.   As they moved, they would sometimes be strung out in a long line, and then form into the usual “V” of a migrating flock of birds, then string back out again.  Also, while they appeared to be migrating to the east, they slowed, stopped, and started “milling about,” like they decided to stay in one spot, as if riding a thermal.   I went and got my camera (which I was using to shoot the equestrian event), and upo! n zooming in, I could see they looked like birds, albeit, none I had ever seen. As I watch, I was struck by the feeling that while they appeared to be birds, they were not.  First, they were so bright, and stark white against the sky.  The individual ones did not have that shimmery look, like one would expect if the wings were flapping.  I do remember that they would vary a little in brightness, and in looking at a zoomed-in image, I see they are white, in general, with dark trailing wing edges.  The objects moved together, much like a school of fish.  There was no apparent random motion of one object with respect to another.  They all moved in unison and seemed to be riding a thermal.  Their altitude, or range from my camera never changed, at least not to my eye.  After I had shot 34 images in about a minute (to get some clear images for later study), I stopped shooting and watched a bit more.  My observation was that the brightness of the “flock” would decrease then increase.  Studying the sight and my images, I think it was because they were quite wh! ite, but when going away from me, the dark stripes on their wings would be toward me, decreasing the apparent brightness.  As I was watching them “mill about” and darken and lighten, it suddenly appeared that there were a LOT more objeccts.  I never observed another flock in the sky, nor saw one merge in.  It was just that when going from darker to lighter, there were just more that appeared. I put the camera back on them, and fired off more images.  You can look at my images DSC_6044 and DSC_6045, which were taken 14 seconds apart.  As you can see, there were a LOT more objects in the second, (and subsequent) image.  In looking at the images, the ‘flock” increased from 15 to around 74 within seconds, as I was watchinge.  I don’t know where they came from, they just appeared.  I quit firing shots after a while, figuring they were birds, and that I just somehow missed the other huge grouping of birds joining the original group.  I don’t remember if, from here, they kind of faded out of view, or if they disappeared while I went about my business of getting lunch, but the “birds” eventually were gone. About 2 or 3 hours later, we were done and headed for home.  As we got to the intersection of Hwy 36 and 231, in Lacey’s Spring, AL, about 5 miles from the event, I again saw the same formation just north of my location, toward Huntsville, and closer, this time.  I called my wife, who was driving in the car in front of me, and she was able to see the same thing (she had not seen the original sighting).  Determined to get more, but closer shots, I watched both the road and the formation, until we got about a 1/2 to 3/4 miles closer to Huntsville, and found a good pull-off, with a broad view of the sky.  When I got out of the car, the objects were gone, vanished.  I looked and looked, both with my eyes, and through the camera, but could not see them.  That was it. When I got home, I looked at my images on the computer.  Zooming in, they did look like birds, and after doing some research, decided that I had seen a flock of migrating pelicans.  However, Huntsville, AL, is hundreds of miles from the ocean and any migratory path that I could research, and no one that I know has ever seen a pelican in town.  I totally forgot about the whole sighting after that. On Sunday 8-30-15, almost a year later, after reading the book “Messages”, by Stan Romanek, I was thinking through several past sighting experiences, and suddenly remembered this ""bird"" event (which I had totally forgotten about – odd).  I did some Googling of “UFO Birds” and found some very informative links which showed exactly the same “birds”, in Mexico!  The people who had that sighting went through the exact same though process on identification, and came up with the same results I did (pelicans).  While it is somewhat plausible, pelicans do not exactly match what I saw or the behavior I observed.  For me, this sighting is unexplained.

My husband and I were in our backyard watching Fourth of July fireworks.  All of a sudden, we noticed an oddly behaving object in the sky.   At first we both thought it was a firework. However the object began moving in an erratic and bizarre fashion.  When we noticed the object it was to the right of our home and was approximately 400 to 500 feet above us in the sky.  At first the object was moving slowly in a static diagonal pattern across the sky over our home.   Then, without warning, the object immediately gained height in an instant and moved at a right angle in a way that we know current  aircraft technology is incapable of accomplishing.   My husband grew up with two parents that were in the US Air Force and is very educated on aircraft and aircraft technology and there was no doubt about what we were seeing.  Even though I don't possess nearly the same knowledge, I immediately understood that no aircraft in our current technological arsenal could ever achieve the speed, the immediate and sudden altitude shifts, and the sharp turns exhibited by the craft we observed that evening. The object we witnessed glowed bright orange with a central mass that appeared to be a glowing orange cross.  Bright orange radial spokes surrounded the central ""cross,"" almost like the rays in a child's drawing of the sun.  We estimate that the object was around 50 feet in diameter.  We were particularly stunned over the fact that the object was silent.  Aircraft fly over our home multiple times each day- in fact, the community neighboring ours is one that is geared for small aircraft pilots- all of the homes have small hangers on the property and there's a runway down the center of the community.  Needless to say, we are very, very accustomed to passing aircraft and the associated noise.   The object we witnessed was all the more unusual for its soundless flight.

I was outside my house sitting on the porch at night, when I noticed a red-and-white flashing light flying from left to right in the sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane with the landing lights on (hence the flashing red and white lights), but then I noticed that the pauses in between the flashes were unusually long, and there was no illumination of the object in between the flashes (this was different then all of the other aircraft I have seen before).  After realizing this, I turned on my iPod Touch to try to take a video of the object. My sighting of the first object lasted for about 45 seconds  Interestingly, several seconds after the first object was blocked by the palm tree, I spotted a second object traveling in the opposite direction, with the same flashing light and approximate size as the first object. The second object traveled from right to left, for about 30 seconds, until it appeared to slow down slightly, decrease in altitude for a few seconds, and then disappear (most likely behind a cloud). Including the time in between my observation of the two objects, the entire sighting lasted about 1 minute and 30 seconds.

I was trying to stay awake, singing to the radio and looking around trying to keep moving.   I looked out of my driver's side window and I just couldn't miss it!  It was huge, just on the edge of the cloud bank.  It had been raining, very hard at times and there was lighting in the sky earlier.  It startled me enough that I took the first exit I saw off of the freeway and there just happened to be a park and ride parking lot right off that exit.  At first I wondered why no one else was pulling over.  I did consider the casino but as I watched the clouds continued to move and thicken over the lights which were stationary and I could tell the light was coming from above, not below.   As the cloud thickened, I scrambled to find my camera to get some good pictures, I always have my camera with me, I love to take pictures of the sunsets with all the glorious colors they p! roduce.  I was so flustered I couldn't remember how to take my camera off of auto focus to manual focus.  On Auto focus the sensors would not focus in on the lights and it would not let me take a shot.  At that point I was panicked and explitives were flying from my mouth, then, I remembered my Iphone and dug around my truck for that and  final was able to get some pictures of it.  At first I just got the lights, but then, I included the cars passing on the freeway to get some sense of how big this was.  I never heard sound from anything except the freeway.  It didn't seem to move at all, just hang there.  When I was standing there, I was only able to see one set of lights.   After looking at my photos and lightening them up to see what else I was able to see, Presto, there was another smaller set of lights just below and that one did seem to have slight movement as shown by the photos.  In one it seems to be more off to the side and slightly tilted and then it moves to dir! ectly underneath the other.   So keep in mind when looking at the photos, the contrast and light setting had been changed to better view the lights, because as I was looking for and eventually found the phone, the cloud bank thickened over the lights making them harder to see.  And yes this is my first ever possible sighting of anything of this sort and it did definitely keep me awake for the rest of the ride home. ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??

While driving west along Hwy 20 in Central Oregon about 9pm on the evening of September 24, 2015, I noticed two yellowish/orange lights traveling parallel to each other and to me, and also in the same direction.  They seemed fairly low, and I assumed they were the lights of a low-flying small aircraft.  (A few minutes and miles before, I had passed an accident just east of Sage Hen Rest Area, and I thought perhaps an airplane was involved with rescue, though now that makes no sense to me.)  I continued driving, forgetting about the lights for a short while…a minute, perhaps two.  When I looked again I could not see them even though I would have expected to still see an airplane.  I thought they might have been lights that reflected in my car, how sometimes the headlights of another car can reflect in strange places inside your own vehicle.  But traffic was very sparse and there were no street lights or such. Within a couple of minutes I again saw lights in the sky, maybe ten or twelve scattered within a span of about 40 degrees to the left and front of my vehicle.  My recollection of detail is not good, but I recall them going in different directions, mostly slowly.  Some blinked slowly a few times, some came on only once.  One split.  They disappeared altogether and then came back about 2 times before I pulled over.  Nothing appeared in the five or so minutes that I waited, so I continued driving. They appeared one more time, however.  Again there were a dozen or so moving about.  The last thing I was able to see was one of the lights dropping vertically and then back up to the right (northwest) in a curve in the shape of a barbless fish hook.  It blinked during the dive about 8 or 10 times, and I think the previous light would still be fading out of its glow when the next flashed on. This occurred over a distance of about 10 or 15 miles and 15 to 20 minutes.  I think I was between Riley and Hampton, Oregon.  It pretty remote and the south side of the highway appears like unoccupied land.   I was not able to determine the actual altitude and size of the lights.  They were about 30 to 40 degrees above horizon, and were always between my left and straight ahead.  Perhaps they were other places too but I did not see them. After eliminating airplane and reflection, I considered perhaps hot-air balloons because during the second round of sightings they were initially lighting up slowly and fading out like I imagine the propane flame on a balloon would do.  But their antics eliminated that option in my mind.  Remote controlled flying craft are—to my knowledge—fairly small and these were in a large area.  I do not know enough about drone devices to take a guess if the lights could have been something like that. Please note that my estimates of distance and time are approximate.  I did not think at the time to pay close attention to such detail.",2015-10-16T00:00:00,,

At 9:38pm I noticed something unfamiliar in the sky with my naked eye in the area of the Andromeda galaxy.  At first I thought I was looking at a star.  However, after looking at it for a few seconds, I noticed it was moving very slowly from East to West, it was larger (not brighter though) than a star and it was  egg-shaped.   At this point I figured it was some unique satellite so I ran to get my binoculars for a closer look.  Within 30 seconds I returned with my Bushnell 10x50 wide angle binoculars.  After focusing in on the object I was completely astonished.  It was two concentric rings of light with two bright spots on the leading edge of the outer ring.   As my girlfriend and I passed the binoculars back and forth, it continued to slow down ! further until it came to a complete stop (relative to the stars in the binocular's field of view) at 9:43pm.  We continued to take turns with the binoculars in complete amazement.   I then decided to go to my neighbor's house to show them this amazing object in the sky.  The parents were out for the evening, but their three kids, their babysitter and I went out onto their back deck.  Everyone had a couple good looks at it.  It was still frozen in place in the sky, however the bright spots on the outer ring of light were on the other side, there were more of them and a little less bright.   I then returned to my house to retrieve and set up my telescope.  I knew it would take about 5 minutes to assemble so I went back to my deck to view the object again.  Now, at 9:53pm, it had started traveling back very slowly in the opposite direction, now going from West to East.  We watched it travel slowly for three minutes, until 9:56pm.  Then we both looked down to talk to each other, ! looked back up and it was nowhere to be seen.  A minute later, at 9:57 pm, we spotted the International Space Station, traveling West to East, across the northern sky.  We continued to search the sky for the object off-and-on for another hour, until 11pm, but never saw it again. In total we viewed this object for over 15 minutes.  I would estimate it was at an altitude comparable to that of satellites orbiting the earth.

While driving home from work, I noticed a band of approximately 4 bright orange lights in the Northeast sky.  It appeared as though the lights were stretching apart from each other in a horizontal line.  As quickly as they appeared I lost sight of them.   I continued home and kept my eye toward the sky where I had seen the lights and as I pulled in my driveway (maybe 2 minutes later, at best) I noticed them again.  This time there seemed to be more lights or that the lights were multiplying as they separated.  I got my husband’s attention to have him look to see them and he did.  The lights maybe lasted a few seconds before disappearing either behind a tree line or all together from the night sky. 	This sighting comes after two other unexplainable lights I have seen in the same general direction of the sky over the last two or three weeks.  The first was probably two weeks ago, appearing as a bright red light in the sky that “burnt up” in just a few seconds. 	The second was just a few days ago, either Monday August 10, 2015, or Tuesday, August 11, 2015.   It was like a fireball that flashed and was gone.

Very fast. Changed trajectory in flight. Appeared to accelerate. I was driving south on I-94 from the Racine Modine Benstead Observatory to Kenosha, WI.  I was with my 11 year old son.  The sighting occurred at approx. 10:45 PM. The sky was completely black and clear where we were.  There were very active thunderstorms to the south in Illinois at the time, maybe 6 miles or more south of Kenosha.  The weather records for that date and time would define exactly where the storms were relative to Kenosha.  When near the Kenosha airport a spherical object appeared fairly high I my windshield and proceeded to my left (east) at a very high rate of speed.  When it crossed the left windshield pillar it was visible through my driver’s side window.  It the angled upwards and shot upwards at a slight angle and disappeared from view. It seemed to be accelerating at that time.  The object was spherical in shape and not very bright.  It also appeared to be fairly “hazy” rather than a sharply defined spherical shape.  When I first saw it I assumed it may have been an airplane coming in for a landing but noted that it was far too high and too fast to be able to land.   I then wondered if it could have been a reflection from the interstate lights or vehicle headlights.  I have never seen reflections like this before or since.  I did not see anything else like it that night and I drove the same route weeks later at the same time of night on August 21 (another open house for the observatory) and never saw any reflections on that trip either.  I also thought it could have been reflections of airport runway approach lights but never saw those lights on the ground on either trip or as reflections in the windshield or driver’s side window. I also wondered if it could have been ball lightening but the object was not nearly as bright as I assume ball lightening would have to be.  It moved far too fast to be an aircraft and it definitely changed its trajectory while being watched so it could not have been a meteor.  My son was in the ! passenger seat and did not observe the object but I did tell h! im what I saw and asked him if he had seen it.  He can verify this.  I would say that this would have to be called a UFO.",2015-09-11T00:00:00,42.58091583333333,-87.85322791666667

It was motionless, did not flash or change color, but did slightly dim on occasion, as if being covered shortly by clouds.  It was at least twice the size and brightness of Venus (when its at its brightest in the summer, but nowhere close to where Venus is actually located in our sky.)  It was directly east from us, located about 40 degrees from the horizon from my perspective.   There are stars in that region of sky and airplanes flying way off in the distance (toward Lake Michigan and IN), but this was not either of those or a meteor (40 minute observation) and huge in comparison.  I did get the impression it was quite a distance eastward and at a substantial high altitude, but I had! no reference point to be certain about those aspects.  I know the normal sky geography in that region well... I walk my dog every night between 9:30 and 11;00 PM and look out my kitchen window in that direction often several times a night between midnight and 5:00 AM.  Whatever this was, it should not have been there, was not seen days before my sighting and nothing now several days after, extremely extraordinary and not even remotely similar to anything seen in that region of sky or anywhere else!   I have no way of knowing if it could have been from this planet or not, but I can absolutely attest to the fact that it was there, and it wasn't a natural object.  Even at that time of night I'd bet other people also saw it, as it was that obvious.",2015-09-25T00:00:00,41.4632,-87.693

I narrated this one UFO phenomenon in real time to my wife as it was unfolding.  My wife says she has never experienced anything that might be considered preternatural.  I want to emphasize that in this UFO experience what I saw was a clearly-defined physical entity rather than the results of an eye pathology.  The object I viewed from the underneath vantage had some type of scribbling in its central circular area.  I have listened on Coast-to-Coast to your reports of physical sightings.  I was somewhat hesitant to send you my report because I saw the object with my eyes closed. Could it be that there is a psrapsychical dimension to my experience?  I'm open to all possibilities...even way-out bizarre ones.  Have you ever had anyone express to you anything like my experience?....

I compared them to what were obviously planes coming and leaving from SLC Airport, and noticed several differences, which lead me to conclude that these might be UFOs. The lights in question were absolutely stationary.  There was not a strong wind at the time, but planes do inch along in the sky, and there were conventional aircraft doing just that.  The navigational lights of the planes were strong and steady, while the unknown lights I was witnessing scintillated like stars.  The radiation of their lights was inconsistent; they pulsated rhythmically, and seemed to alternately glow very bright and get larger, and then diminish in luminosity and size to the point of disappearing.  Then they may – or may not – reappear!   These UFOs just hung there in the sky above the airport absolutely still while passenger planes came and went.  I didn’t think to count them at the time, but I now estimate there were between 5-8 such lights positioned at various points in the sky.  Some were as far east as to be visible in front of the mountain range just north of the city, while others were much further west.  The westernmost light was observed to get very low to the horizon in a slow, vertical descent, which made me wonder if it was landing!  There was the main grouping of lights, which formed a line of three in a diagonal. For the most part, they just seemed to hang there in the sky, with the exception of the one that moved down slowly toward the horizon.  I had to park my car at work and go in to start my day, but I did snap four pictures with my old school “dumb phone”, but even with computer enhancement later I can detect no trace of the UFOs. In one photograph, I believe the descending UFO may be visible, but I cannot be certain.  My photos reveal nothing, but even if they had, they would just be pinpoints of light in the sky above an airport; so what?  The lights my eyes saw, however, were twinkling like stars, pulsating and changing in brightness.  They were absolutely stationary. I feel fairly certain that I was witness to an early morning display of extraterrestrial craft over Salt Lake City.  Then again, they could have been something sent up by Hill Air Force Base, but they certainly caught my attention because of their odd qualities and behavior.",2015-10-16T00:00:00,40.704464857813726,-111.88213884685625

It had lights outlining the trangular object which looked like very dim, distant stars at first glance.  It only stayed put for what may have been about three seconds.  The ""craft"" seemed to be very large and moved slowly at fist towards the north, then sped up until it blended in with the stars.  I told my husband and brother to look as soon as I realized it was moving, but only my husband saw it and only for a second before it was moving away too fast for him to turn around and see it better.

I'm not sure if it was the same one or a s! econd, but it looked the same.  However, this time it was accompanied by what sounded like a flock of geese.  Coincidence or not, it was almost as if it wanted us to think that's all it was.  It even started moving south at a speed that geese would fly for a few seconds and then shot off.

About 9:15, went to the library with my dog. We had been seeing a large lop eared bunny in that area for a few nights.  My dog loves to chase squirrels and bunnies. She’s too old and fat to catch them but she enjoys the chase and it gives here exercise. Sky was dark, lots of stars, busy flight path (Sea-Tac Intl airport about 15 or so miles away). It was warm out. I sat on a curb facing the Puyallup River (could be a different river name), that runs behind the library. Noticed a white light moving in the sky very high.  I could tell that it was moving because I could see movement through the leaves and branches of a big maple tree.  I took some pics and only one showed the light and in the pic, it looks like a yellow orb but to my eye, it looked white.  I moved into a large parking area free of trees to get a better look and it looked like a planet – it was not twinkling – just a white light high in the sky.  I was thinking that if one didn’t have a stationary object to use as a reference point, it would be very hard to realize that it was moving – one would probably think it to be a planet. I watched it for about 15 minutes and tried to take a video of it but it was not visible in the camera. Decided to go across the street and walk over to the field between the Post Office and Mc Lendon’s. There had been a car parked in the library parking lot for two nights in a row while we were there and I wanted to keep distance from it.  We began to reach the outer edge of the parking lot when I decided not to walk all the way to the field because I didn’t have my flashlight.  I turned to walk back the way we came when an extremely bright white light, which appeared as a large white orb, very low in the sky, caught my eye.  It was very unusual.  It seemed to be heading in our direction from the middle of town. I moved closer into the McLendon’s parking lot and turned on the recording button on the camera.  I could see it very well and it was bright but the recording didn’t show it as it looked to me and I couldn’t see it through the screen of the camera until it was very close.  There had to be people that seen this thing! It was so low and bright, it had to have caught someone’! s attention.  As it got closer, like almost to the AM PM, it clearly had 5 super bright lights in a row – shaped like princess cut diamonds that sparkled and one red slow blinking light underneath – funny, I did not see any structure to this object for how close it was.  It seemed to have a plane sound but very quiet sound of a plane – which didn’t make sense either.  I felt like I had been standing there observing this thing for a long time and felt self conscious about it  feeling this thing may be a ‘plane’ and here I am recording it in the parking lot, so I quickly turned the camera off after it passed in front of me. If it was a plane – it was the quietest plane I ever seen but then it did not have any structure of a plane. Maybe those 5 bright white lights blinded my vision..?  I wish I would have continued recording it to see if it got into the flight path.  That’s another thing, I am an avid sky watcher in this town and have lived here over 18 years, I have seen a lot o! f things and I have never seen a plane fly the direction that ! it did…but who knows…watch the recording and let me know if you think you know what it is….Thanks.

This was a mass sighting in downtown Chicago of all places. It went viral on Facebook almost immediately.  Some crafts were seen flying close to the ground in downtown Chicago. Pictures were taken and possibly video as well.  What makes this especially unique is that parts of Chicago were cordoned off with roadblocks/traffic diversions.  The police, FBI, and military were there coordinating efforts as these objects were chased by planes and helicopters around the sky.  The areas initially involved also became permeated with men in black suits who were seen talking to the feds and were walking around everywhere. Then the police decided to tell everyone that it was just lightening which nobody could possibly believe.  Thousands of people on Facebook took to massive threads.  Some of the pictures posted disappeared from FB but some were saved by others (Some of which are friends of mine) before hand.  I don't know if this was on local news but it should have been.  The local police/feds/military response was unprecedented.  This is not a hoax. I believe the objects were orb-like.  The pics I saw were of three lights in a triangular shape, though I could not determine if they were a result of one craft or three.  I would have to go back and sift through a massive amount of posts to get more details on the craft(s) and will do so if contacted.  Please only release my first name.

I have lived in NJ most of my life, and after these incidents, I can say that I know the difference between advertising lights and - well, something else.  I am almost 100% sure that these witnesses did not see routine advertising lights, and that is the reason, amongst others, as to why I never reported these incidents.  The circular lights that a witness was able to capture on film is accurate to my personal account.  I have seen these types of light s for over a year now - 3 times in total.   I am reporting it now because the LAST time I saw these lights there was no way to explain what they were, but in fact all three accounts match the description in Minneapolis.   I will not exaggerate my claims here they are:  Prior to September of 2014 (in January just after new years -holiday lights were still up on people's property) I was travelling to work on the garden state parkway when out of my left field of vision I saw! what appeared to be lights over a condo development in Monmouth county NJ.  They DID look like advertising lights - like when you see searchlights in the sky - It was overcast and cold and close to midnight and I could see a series of whitish blue lights congregated in a dancing circle formation - - I said to myself that it was odd because they were really lighting up the sky and I could determine NO light path from the ground to the clouds above, yet I dismissed it because the span of the object was over a very large area - probably a quarter mile.  I got to work and thought nothing more of it.  The second time was in april - - this time there was a witness with me.  Same phenomenon, white lights circular large formation OVERCAST NIGHT around 9 or 10pm.  The other witness and I both noticed it, again the object was behind a cloud - but it was strange - - the other witness said it was a satellite probably doing a ""scan for a satellite imagery map"" - But it hovere! d in the area for at least 20 minutes until the lights faded i! n an alm ost choreographed fashion.  The third time I saw this was in September last year - - and I have not felt the same since.  It was about 3am and I was working late when I decided to walk out of MY HOUSE on foot to a convenience store about a quarter mile north of my house.  As I am leaving the convenience store I glance up (another hazy overcast night) to see bright lights off to the east of where I live.  I have a home on about 5000 sq feet of property, so I went into the backyard of my home to observe what this object was.  I never did see the object all 3 times but the last one seemed to move behind (or control) a slowly moving cloud.  it proceeded to travel to the south, making a slow progression west then north and then stopped almost directly over my home.  I noticed that there were no wildlife sounds as this was taking place (crickets, frogs, etc).  this object had to be thousands of feet in diameter if the lights on it were attached to it.  The lights were all bluish -! white piercing the cloud from above, not below.  they moved in a figure 8 motion for about 15 minutes, then the pattern changed to 2 isolated lights, each moving in a large circular formation against each others path.  When each light ran into each other along the path they changed direction.  At this time I was pretty convinced that this was not normal, but an extraordinary object apparently of large shape (or mass) making no sound, and apparently does not know or is unaware that it can be seen.  I was very moved by this change in pattern, as then I realized  that this was not an aircraft known by me or anyone else.  I watched as the 2 lights slowly faded away- still rotating against each other, respectively, then the cloud seemed to move eastward to the horizon.  I never reported this - I was more or less panicked by what I saw and it was difficult to leave the house for the next 4 weeks.  I did not take any pictures that night, but had more than an opportunity to do so.! I was more awe-struck than anything else, yet I could not ta! ke my ey es off of this object.  It was apparently very large, silent and very advanced - I am trying to imagine what this craft must have looked like (minus the cloud) - - If the lights are affixed to the object then it is thousands of feet in diameter.  The second pattern change makes me think that this was the case, as the rhythmic pattern (the figure 8's) in the first instance could be individual crafts, but when it changed to the second pattern, it nailed it for me that this craft was of a specific size, shape and dimension.  That is why I say it had to be very large.  I witnessed something extraordinary yet unsettling and have never reported this because until last night when I researched nuforc's site I saw nothing that really matched the description of what I saw up until now - almost exactly.",2015-09-17T00:00:00,,

First of all, my personal history is sketchy.  I could be very easily discredited.  I am a known iv meth user and alcoholic.  I have always had very vivid dreams almost every night for as long as I can remember.  I have also experienced occasional sleep walking, as well as sleep paralysis, since childhood, and as an adult.   That being said, I am also known for my honesty.  I have never met another person who is as truthful and trustworthy as I am.  People closest to me have heard the story I'm telling now and they all believe me because they know I am almost incapable of lying.  However, most of them believe I was dreaming or that obese experiencing some kind of hallucination due to my drug use.  I was not using for several days when this happened, nor had I been drinking. I have hallucinated many times from drug use and I know this was not anything like a hallucination.  Also, I know very well what nightmares and vivid dreams are like.  This was not a dream. Sleeping alone in my bedroom I woke up groggy and experiencing sleep paralysis.  I felt like there was something ""coming to get me"" and I was terrified.  I tried to move my head to see who it was but I could barely move my eyes or even open them.  I saw what I believe to be a tall grey alien in my bedroom doorway.  I did not get a very good look at him but he resembled the classic description of grey aliens.  Large head and large dark eyes, no ears and a small mouth.  He was wearing a long white or silver robe. He telepathically told me to go back to sleep and I did.  I then remember (very vaguely) just briefly standing in front of another grey alien.  I think I was still in my room but not sure.  He also looked similar to the classic description of grey aliens but with darker grey skin.  He was slightly taller than me and wearing a red long sleeve shirt or jacket with a cut out in the neckline similar to a priests collar.  We just stood staring at each other.  The next thing! I remember is waking up in my bed again with sleep paralysis.  This time I was much less groggy.  I was paralyzed but fully awake.  I am %100 positive I was awake and VERY VERY AWARE AND ALERT.  I could feel the presence of them before I even opened my eyes.  Opening them was very difficult.  When I did finally open my eyes I saw another grey alien sitting next to my bed right beside me.  There was another being standing at the foot of my bed.  I could only see him out of the corner of my eye because I could not move my head at all.  He was wearing something red and I believe that he (the one at the foot of the bed) was the same one I had previously stood in front of, but I can't be sure.  I feel like there was a third one in the room as well but ,again, I can't be sure as I did not even get visual on a third...just a sense that another was there. I did get a good look at the one sitting beside my bed.  He looked similar to the classic description of grey aliens.  He was dark grey/lar! ge eyes/no ears/small mouth etc....but with swirly kind of freckles(ma rkings similar to tattoos?)on his face near his eyes. He was wearing a black long sleeve shirt or jacket and possibly a silver metallic necklace but I'm not sure.  He stared at me for only a few seconds but I was aware of at least some of his thoughts as well as the telepathic communication between him and the others.  He told the one at the foot of the bed that I was awake and I was going to remember.  The one at the foot of the bed told him to put me back to sleep.  He stared at me a few more seconds and I could hear his thoughts, which are very difficult to explain except that they were positive thoughts.  He did put me back to sleep and that is all I remember. The next morning I found a bruise and a possible injection mark on my right arm.  I also had a tender spot on the lower left base of my skull.  For the next several nights I would wake up with sleep paralysis and a feeling that they had been there but no clear memory of it.  I have not had any more memories of encounters or sleep paralysis since. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2015-09-17T00:00:00,,

The plane had cruised from left to right and the moment after my two friends began watching it the plane lights dissolved and a split second later there were 5-6 greenish sparkling orbs of light flickering and sparkling interestingly.  They disappeared and my friends and I freaked out.  We went inside and didn't come out for a few hours, but when we did, there was a clear sky with a big bright full moon and lots of twinkling stars, as well as some strange lights hovering above the mountain ridges overlooking the ranch.  Throughout the rest of the night the lights continued, some would move, some just hover, some would illuminate in a new spot, some disappear and reappear, some would move blatantly across the sky, others would disguise themselves as the lights of a plane and then change later or just disappear.  The lights all stayed at a remarkably low altitude, hovering just above ridges or treetops.  We ended up staying awake until 6 am, when we went outside at 5.30 the light of day had chased all the stars from the sky.

I was surprised to see a criss/cross line design on the bottom of the object, almost rounded shaped.  Still the object was not moving.  I got out my cell phone, which is a Samsung Stratosphere and took several photos.  I later cropped them for a closer look at this object. (See Fig. 2 photo)   I went into the building then, asked one of the employees to come out and witness what I was looking at (she wants to remain anonymous at this time).  I pointed up at the object, then gave here my binoculars… her words; “Weird”!  She confirmed what I had seen in the binoculars and that was a strange design on the bottom of the object.  We stood there watching to see any movement from the object.  She then had to go back in, and I had wiring to attach. It could not have been more than 5 minutes when I went back out to the location, the object was gone!  That time had to be about 1:15 or 1:20 pm. Further investigation. I called NOAA in Medford, Oregon, on 16 Aug. 2015, and spoke with a meteorologist about the sighting.  I then emailed him a photo of the object and he emailed me back;  ""I have no idea what it is.  The nearest weather balloon launched near a fire that day was on the ground before 11:30am, so it wasn’t a weather balloon from the National Weather Service. Good luck!”  So, the weather balloon theory is ruled out. On 17 Aug., 2015, I checked with Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, Oregon, to see if they had anything flying that day and timeframe.  They had nothing flying that day per the public affairs office. Since the Klamath Falls Airport currently does not have commercial aircraft flying in and out of the Klamath basin, this rules out any object from that area. Both the USAF and NOAA mentioned the possibility of a ‘drone’.  I have two small radio controlled drones and this was not a drone.  There was a light wind that day from the south, maybe 5-7 mph and the object did not waiver or move. I also pulled up Google Sky Map on my cell phone for that date and time and stood at the same place where I took the photos... now Jupiter, Venus, Mercury and the Moon were in the vicinity of the Sun that day.  All the planets including the Moon were south of the Sun. Venus to the SSW and the other planets to the SSE positions.  This object was more NNE direction of all the planet locations.  It is my opinion this was not any of the planets in the vicinity during that time as it was too far north of the Sun.  (See Fig 1 photo)  Compass reading of the object was 160 degrees south. Angle of elevation was 75% off the horizon. Long/lat  42.55512 N & 121.50386 W Temp: 81 degrees Ground elevation: 4171 feet Wind direction: Coming from south, 5-7mph. Altitude of object:  Unknown. Shape: Round/Oval Color:  White Size at arms length:  About 1/6th of thumb nail. Sighting Evaluation:  The Klamath Basin has its share of military aircraft from Kingsley Field, and is in a flight path for commercial aircraft also.  (See Fig. 3 photo)  This was none of these.  Eliminating all the possibilities; weather balloon, drone, aircraft, planets, weather phenomena, natural phenomena, any other man-made object…  This witness concludes it as ‘unknown’ at this time.",2015-09-17T00:00:00,,

The distance of the light from town was initially difficult to judge, not knowing precisely what sort of craft the light was part of, but judging by the rate of its approach and estimated altitude, I am guessing that I first noticed the light 30-40 miles NE of our location and possibly at 14,000'-17,000' (very difficult to judge with any precision).   Weather at the time: no clouds were visible; the brighter stars in constellations were all visible from horizon to horizon, so I'm assuming that the weather was CAVU.  There is absolutely no possibility that this light was a planet, for Venus had set sometime earlier in the west, and the light was much too large to be Mars, Saturn, or Jupiter.  (I served as a volunteer amateur astronomer at a nearby observatory in Oakland, and can assure the reader that whatever the light was, it was not a planet, star, or satellite.)  I've flown for a intra-state airline out of Modesto for 7 years and have lived in the city NE of MOD airport for 28 years; the path of the bright light didn't match that of aircraft flying from Sacramento southbound along low-altitude airways; it didn't match air traffic flying the typical arrivals into KSFO or KOAK, where the traffic crosses the Modesto VOR at 10,000' MSL and flies outbound on a WSW radial before being vectored by Bay Approach for arrivals at KSFO or KOAK; the light did not appear to be heading to MOD airport or distant KSJC; I thought that the light might be traffic heading for MOD VOR, but the heading wasn't quite correct (it would pass west of the VOR on the observed heading), so it didn't appear that it was on the Modesto arrival for KSFO or traffic bound for MOD.  Judging by its size; the speed of its approach; angle of approach and vertical relative motion, I believe that the light was descending.  The closer that the light came, the more impressed I was by its apparent size; it was yellow-orange in color, which may have been caused by smoke from fires that had burned in the vicinity of Modesto in September, but which I seriously doubt is the case as the color had not changed to any real degree in its approach to Modesto since the time when I first observed it some 9-10 minutes before.  During this time, I didn't see any change in relative motion that might have indicated that an aircraft had leveled off.  When the light appeared to have more lateral relative motion, I looked very carefully for red and green navigation lights and white (wingtip) or red (tail, or fuselage) anti-collision strobe lights and observed none [I can almost always see the anti-collision strobe lights on commercial jets at 10,000' on the Modesto arrival -- procedures dictate that arriving flights cross the MOD VOR at 10,000' and in clear weather, I can usually detect the red, green, and white position lights of traffic overhead, though not the color with the jet being at that altitude (my vision is 20/10 or better in both eyes)].  As neither my wife (also a pilot) or I could not see any position (navigation) lights, after removing the earbuds of my cellphone's hands-free device from my ears, I listened for powerplant noise and could not detect any sound of a reciprocating engine propellor-driven aircraft, no jet engine powerplant(s); nor could I hear the blade noise from a helicopter (our home is less than 3 nautical miles E of a hospital that has EMS helicopter service, or, that of the helicopter that serves another hospital approximately 4 miles WSW of us).  Puzzled by the size of the light (at this point, much larger than any I've seen on private civil, commercial, and military aircraft); and the lack of both navigation lights and powerplant noise, I ducked into the backseat of our car to pull my professional Canon EOS 5D Mark III DSLR camera from its bag, turned the camera on, removed the lens cover (about 7-8 seconds at most), only to find that no aircraft or lights were visible whatsoever.  Usua! lly, if police or hospital helicopters are flying away from me, I can see at least one position position and two or more strobe anti-collision lights of aircraft that have over-flown my zenith -- and usually, there is just enough dust or haze in the air that a landing light will display an apparent ""beam"" down to the ground which can be seen from all over the city.  (The street that our restaurant is on is Oakdale Road, which points directly at the midfield of the MOD airport to the south of us: any aircraft landing at Modesto airport should havqe clearly been visible for several minutes more.)  I scanned the sky east through northwest several times and could find absolutely no lights in the sky except those heading to or away from the MOD VOR at an altitude of approximately 10,000' MSL; the strobe lights of commercial jets on Jet-One (""J-1"") at high altitude heading southbound; or transiting the skies far to the far south, apparently jet traffic heading into KSJC.  No lights could be seen flying left- or right-traffic in the traffic pattern for landing at MOD airport or going in to either of the two local hospitals.  The light had apparently and simply disappeared.  Any aircraft going into MOD or the two hospitals should have been visible another 2-4 minutes if landing at the airport or 1-2 minutes if landing at one of the two hospitals.  Even looking through my camera's zoom lens, I should have been able to see at least some of the usual lights aircraft display, but saw nothing.",2015-10-09T00:00:00,37.66861323741007,-120.99442244604317

Now, 2 were lower on the right just above the tree tops and glowing more yellowish as twilight was deepening towards dark.  One still seemed to be moving very slowy towards us and seemed to be with the he one furthest on the right which was lower in the sky.  That one then glowed red at the center and then the light went out completely and we could see what appeared to be a tall rectangular shape slowly drifting down toward the ground.

They looked to be over some open acreage to the east of Rte. 29.  We'd never seen anything like that before.  After that we heard what sounded like a small engine plane come to that area and circle around, but it was dark by then so we couldn't see it,  only hear it...almost as if it came to investigate.

While watching this, an object I could not identify came streaking out of the northeastern sky and flew from that side of the horizon to the southwestern sky behind me in no more than one second of time.  It was amazingly fast, so fast that I actually thought I was watching a shooting star initially.  To make this sighting more strange, this object made NO AUDIBLE SOUND, had what appeared to be dim lights like the last breath of a cheap flashlight before it completely dies, and was as low-flying as a five-story building.  Even more amazing, is that after the event, as I stood and pondered what kind of unidentified object I must have seen, I started thinking about the amazing radar or controls this object must have.  Honestly, it appeared! to be man-made, though that's really not for me to say.  What I mean is, this object could not continue at its speed and trajectory for long until it were to collide with SOMETHING, being that it was so low-flying.   Truly amazing.

At around 7:20 PM Central Standard Time I saw a red globe appear in the sky. I was siting on my porch facing North East, and a red orb appeared out of nowhere as if it had been sitting there and someone decided to turn on the lights! It hovered or sat in the same area for around 30 seconds, after which time it blinked out again. I ran in the house and called my husband to get the camera and take video. When I returned outside to see if I could view it again, there appeared what looked like plane lights, at least three of them, flying in and around the area where the red orb appeared. Several minutes later, my son and grand daughter came driving up for a visit and I had just told them all what I had witnessed, when the light show began again! The red orb appeared again in the same general area, but this time to the left of where it first appeared. It again hovered in the air with the same plane type smaller lights flashing blue, red, and white around it. My husband was trying to film it but the camera battery was dead. The orb again disappeared but the smaller lights stayed flying around the area. The larger orb appeared once again, this time to the right of it's original first sighting. My husband and son witnessed this red orb and smaller plane type lights three times. I witnessed it four. We have watched the news for any kind of answer to this sighting, but nothing. No comets', no explosions, zip! I didn't know who to contact, so googled lights in the sky over central part of the state, and came upon this sight. My son doesn't want to speak of it, but I am willing to talk with someone if needed. I've never in my life seen anything such as this. In conclusion, the large red orb would changed colors at times, with blue, green, and red, but mainly a orange/red color predominating. The smaller lights looked as if they might be aircraft as they were much slower moving than the orb. They did however, continuously circle the area where the orb appeared, each time, in each distinct area. The whole experience lasted at least 20 minutes. Again, the orb would blink on, stay on for several seconds, move a small amount in a given direction and then blink off, only to reappear in a different section of the same general area, and blink out again. This is a clear night with no clouds and all the stars shining.Also, the smaller plane type lights continue to fly around as I write this message.",2015-09-25T00:00:00,,

A neighbor friend was walking her dog and was watching something in the sky.  This person called me and requested I meet her out toward the street so I said give me a minute and I'll be out there.  When I walked up she pointed up towards the Northwestern sky and said what's that.  My first thought is that there is usually a gaseous sun/planet in that direction (the size of a pinpoint normally).  However, this was about 3 to 4 times the size of that planet and round like a planet.  It was throwing out all sorts of light, white, yellowish/orangish, red, bluish and even looked as though it moved slightly to the North but I thought the movement could've been due to the light coming off from the side of this thing.  We watched it outside for several minutes and I asked her if she wanted to a take a ride a few miles up the road to get a look at it from an area that doesn't have a lot of trees as it wasn't quite to the horizon line yet.  We both went to lock up our! homes and when we came out (not five minutes later) it was completely gone.  We took a ride due west about three miles to the tree clearing and there was nothing at all in that area of the sky.  We had some wispy light clouds in the area but you could see through them and there were no big fluffy or light blocking clouds in that direction at all.  I have been out the past two nights and have seen the usually planet in that direction but it is nowhere near the size or throwing off the colors of whatever was there on 9-9-15.

We saw a red glowing circular light (not blinking)and we assumed it to be an airplane in a holding pattern as we usually can see that type of air traffic frequently out of Sea-Tac.  The light was red & not changing but what caught our immediate attention was that it would flash a white light three times then turned back to glowing red every so often.  It came in from the east.  After several minutes trying to figure out what it might be it came to a dead stop in the sky, flashed white 3 times again then proceeded to do a straight drop decent behind the trees per our view of the horizon.  We were astonished and stayed to see if it would come back in to view and after a few minutes it came back in to our view and began moving sided to side (right/left & left/right) back & forth and flashing white every so ofte! n. It seemed to be searching for something and I witnessed several smaller glowing objects flying out & dropping down from the craft. This was watched by both of us for at least 20minutes if not longer. It was in the path of airplane traffic that night & must have come up on radar somewhere. We figured it was out towards Manchester or Blake Island/over the Puget Sound or in that general area. We watched it descend out of view again and waited another 5-10min before going back inside. This morning, today being 9-11-15 I woke up with pain in my back and have a welt with a circular scoop mark on my back and a big scratch there is no way I could have done to myself. I'm not sure if they are related but I believe I've been having these types of encounters all my life.

My advic! e,just because you don't understand exactly what someone is saying don't be quick to discredit them & say it's a hoax.If you see these orb ufo's enough,read enough reports,you will start to compare events & know the characteristics of the Ufo's being reported. Now on with my report.  What's different this time is,tonight me & my wife witnessed 3 separate very bright orbs light up right above us in the air.To see 1 orb is always a treat.The most we have ever saw in 1 night has been 2.And I'm talking about the low ones,maybe a few hundred to a thousand ft high,not the ones higher up about airplane height.The first orb I saw by myself around 7:00 & it appeared to come from the north West.I can't say for sure because it didn't get bright for me to see until it was right up on me. Note:(this is what they do sometimes,we don't always see them coming from a distance,they light up in a instant in front of you & dim out in an instant)It stayed lit up bright heading south until I could not see it anymore.  The second bright orb appeared about 15 minutes or so later about in the same spot heading in the same direction as the first orb but dimmed completely out within 10 seconds are so.A few minutes later,we saw the 3rd orb & it was directly above us & seemed to hover a few seconds as it was powered up as bright as it could be & then it stated to move,pick up speed & then continued to travel southward as the first 2 orbs.  That was it, it was a clear starry night with a slight wind until the orbs came through.About 15 or so minutes afterwards it got really cloudy & we went inside.This was the first time of seeing 3 back to back like this. What irritates me is,we can make reports until the sun don't shine but nobody can come forward & tell the public what we're seeing? If you don't believe in aliens,you can say It's U.S.Government related but these are not just in a specific area like I once thought.When I see a video from a guy in Europe,Mexico or in Egypt & I can clearly see or read that it matches exactly to what I see with my own eyes in small town Alabama then there is a lot more to it.",2015-10-16T00:00:00,34.8469594117647,-87.69097411764706

Size wise they were much smaller than the moon but much larger than a star. If the moon was a basketball, these would be golf ball size.  I cannot believe I'm even typing these words but it looked like they were just flying around, maybe looking for something..  I could come up with a million conspiracy theories, but that's just what they would be.. Theories...  No proof of anything.   I did Google some orb experiences from the Supermoon night and there's some video on YouTube showing a light.  I don't know if it's what I saw but if he's in the same area then it could be.

To Whom It May Concern:  I was traveling east on NYS Route 347 Nesconset–Port Jefferson Highway and, as I approached traffic light to make a left onto Belle Mead Rd on way home from school I noticed at first 5 orange orbs in the sky. They were very bright, more than anything in the background and more than street lights or anything else in my view.  They moved in a random way at first like up, down, left, right. Some would approach each other, and then go back to a position where they were all traveling in same direction, which appeared north; this was toward my left. There was absolutely no sound from them or their movement.  Once I realized I was seeing something I never saw before, I felt the lack of ability to explain it.   I then started to snap pictures with my cell phone. I took five in total.  Two while approaching the traffic light, and when said traffic light turned green I turned left which was the way home and they were still moving north. Once driving I tried to snap more pictures and zoom in with cell phone; I managed to get three more pictures.  There were definitely six or possibly seven bright orange orbs.  They almost flickered, like different parts or points within the same “orb” were brighter:  Orange to darker orange –red, as they were very easy to see in the sky.  This was while I was moving and so where they.  They were above the trees and power lines and appeared far away, yet brighter and so pronounced they felt close.  The size of each individual orb relative to me, is the size of the diameter of a pen cap if held at arm’s length. They were very fast as they went past my line of sight over the trees and I continued to drive home.  After a split second I thought of attempting to follow them somehow, though I was confused and not actually sure what I had witnessed.  This all happened in about 2 minutes time. This led me to search for information and this is how I found this site.  So many people have seen things which sound as if they are what I have seen.

At age 15 (currently 41) I saw a large circular U.F.O. in my old hometown of Walterboro, SC. It was the summer of 1989 (in June or July--possibly even August--b/c June 23rd was the premier of the Batman movie) and one night my brother and I decided to go outside and play w/ the glow-in-the-dark Batman Frisbee that we’d just gotten (“Bat Fever” was sweeping the nation at the time and merchandise was EVERYWHERE).  We walked out into the back yard (somewhere between 7 and 9 PM I’d guess) and started throwing it back and forth. Our town is small and produces very little light pollution, so on a clear night one can see stars in every direction.  That night was clear and moonless and I believe the only light we had on was a small flood light on the back of the house, but we may have unscrewed the bulb to make it completely dark--I really can’t recall. Anyway, we’re tossing the disc around and at one point I jumped up to catch a high toss and as I did I saw, slightly to my left, a large black flying object that had a perfectly round bottom, no lights and made no sound.  It was so black it blended in w/ the night sky, and the only reason I even saw it was b/c it blotted out the stars as it flew by.  I’m not good with height, but I’d say it was somewhere between 300 to 600 feet in the air and I judge its size to be about half the size of a football field based on the small patch of wooded area [that separated our neighborhood from the next] that it flew over.  It had to be traveling at least 100 MPH or more b/c it was gone from sight in roughly 5 seconds.  I just stood there until it was gone and I may have asked my brother if he’d seen it (I don’t think he did), but honestly that’s all I can remember after so many years.

The source seemed to be slightly behind the top of a pine tree so I couldn't get a clear view.  After the second time, I stood there and stared at the same spot, trying to see the source of the strobe.  Again, after about 1-2 minutes, the strobe flashed again.  I maneuvered my position in the yard to try to see the source but was unable to see anything in the sky.  After another 1-2 minute interval, a fourth strobe lit up the yard but this time seemed to be at a greater height than the first three because it didn't light up the entire yard like the first three.  At that point, I went inside and got my wife to come out.  Over the next 20 minutes or so, at approximately 1-2 minutes intervals, the light would strobe in the same position in the sky but each strobe was dimmer and dimmer as they progressed as if the source of the strobe were going straight up into the sky.  We stood there and watched the light until it was no longer visible.  My wife just commented that it was ""weird"" and went back to bed.  I, on the other hand, could not get my mind wrapped around what I'd just witnessed because of several factors.   1.  It stayed in the same location of the sky except for appearing to rise straight up.   2.  I never heard any sound of an engine, thunder, or anything else.   3.  The intensity of the first three strobes were about the same intensity as a bolt of lightening, lighting the entire back yard and surrounding areas as if it were very close, such as around tree-top level.   I have been a law enforcement officer for the past 28 years and, through my service, have been exposed to many strobe lights used by public safety.  It was brighter than anything that I'd seen before which also led me to believe that it was relatively close in position.

My wife was driving and I was in the right side passenger seat.   My wife turned to me and asked if what she was seeing in the northern sky were airplanes.  I took a moment and looked towards the northern skyscape.  What I observed were not aircraft but orangish-reddish orbs.  Preliminarily, there were approximately no more than 10-15 such objects at a distance of 3-5 miles.  Within no more than 3 minutes, there were approximately 30-40 such objects of the same coloration and configuration.   I called the 911 dispatcher and a male responded, indicating that the objects were Chinese lanterns from a wedding party at 52nd Street.  Since we were at 52nd Street, we saw no parked cars or residence hosting a party of any type.  Nor any evidence of Chinese lanterns. My wife wanted to get a better view and took a side-street detour.  This did not facilitate a better vantage point and we continued home, however as we drove down a side street, we noticed a young man sitting in his darkened vehicle (no more than his very early 20's) with his eyes fixed to the northern sky, his mouth agape and his eyes were the ""size of saucers"", no pun intended.  He was clearly seeing what we had seen and in retrospect we should have inquired if he was ""okay"". We arrived at our residence and took no further action nor did we see any additional objects.  Obviously, these objects-orbs were somehow cloaked and my perception is that they were most likely discoid in configuration. There was an intentionality to this sighting that was fairly obvious, but you would have had to been there to perceive this aspect of the event.  This took place on a Saturday evening, so there had to have been additional witnesses to said sighting.",2015-09-29T00:00:00,33.5422,-111.9679

We were suspicious of the object since we live near MacArthur Airport and planes stop landing at about 11:00pm each day.  This was 2:15am.

I do not believe it was a meteor or an alien craft.  I am an avid amateur astronomer who has seen many comets over the years; Hyakatuke, Halleys, Hale-Bopp, to name a few.

When I opened my basement door to let her out I noticed unusual lights coming from down the hill, over the Wishkah River, about half a mile away from the house.  I paused to try to figure out what they were coming from.  The thing was not moving or was moving very slowly, which got my attention rather quickly.  I thought to myself, “This can't be what I think it is, can it?”  I immediately ran back into the basement to grab my phone/camera to try to grab a picture.  By the time I got back out with the phone, it was floating up the hill, next to my house.  By the time I did all the necessary touching to get the camera working,  I missed the best angle and could only get the tail end as it was heading farther up the hill.  There were no wings, no signs of it being a balloon shape, as in a blimp and it made no sound until it was heading up the hill, when I heard a strange noise like a small generator motor going.  Not nearly enough to power an engine, transmission, or rotor, etc.  It actually reminded me of an old movie, the Absent Minded Professor, who drove around in a car powered by Flubber (no joke).  I had a close look at the side and partial front end, through the trees that next to my house—tall Hemlocks.  It was only about 150 feet or less from where I was standing.  It was shaped like a modern flat bottomed yacht or large party boat.  It was approximately the size of 4 to 6 transit buses bunched together.  About 30 to 40 feet long.  The front had huge window that sloped downward and had dividers between the window panels.  The front end was rounded 180 degrees and the panels were emitting red and orange light.  The windows looked like they were about 6' long, from top to bottom and maybe 3' wide.  The slope appeared to be about 20' inward on the bottom.  The top of the craft, above the windows had a structure but I was not able to get a clear enough view to see how tall it was.  The bottom also had a structure to it that ! appeared to be flat and went down about 6'.  As it went up the hill, I could see the back end, which was emitting bright white lights on either side, that appeared to be outlining the shape of the rear quarter panels.  Needless to say, I had trouble calming down that night.  I came up with a possible connection to the area and the craft as I was trying to sleep.  The old naval base, at Pacific Beach, had recently been designated the center for Electronic Warfare Games.   The kicker to the story is that I had just finished my MUFON Investigator Test that afternoon.  I thought, what are the odds?

I screamed for others to come as I had no phone.   Finally my neighbors 2 downstairs came out and argued over what it could be as it sat high in the sky not movinhg almost like mimicing a star.

I dialed and reported to no avail the local police arrived and saw the trail it left when it moved but this time it only manuvered a bit, so he said it wa a twinkle and that it was just a star ofc Slausknofski spelling??  He was German and I never took my eyes from the object the ent! ire time it was over us then after a lot  odd manuvers it slowly moved northwest toward areas known as Old Lycoming, Trout Run, Rock Run it finally crested a mountain where it painfully hoovered for 20 or more minutes before finally disappearing from our sight.   A roomate from downstairs came in at the last hour and sat with me while we called the pentagon they asked if this phenomon worried us???  They proceeded dropped our calls repeatly transferred us to the fbi, a defense something or other they dropped the call too.  I just kept calling and watching as the object seem to release the smaller white light. It udulated it zigzagged it did rt angles then made little circles.My nephew also saw these same three become one in the southside of the river.  It reminded me of surveying a job in a helicopter.

Was driving on I-16, approximately 14 miles from the exit for Statesboro, GA, when I noted an unusual light pattern on what appeared to be an aircraft approximately 1-1.5 km ahead. There was a pair of bright lights approximately 250 meters from the ground, with the left light remaining constant and the right light blinking on and off at an interval of 6 seconds.  The pair of lights appeared to maintain its position.  My best estimate for the size of the formation or object was 20 meters in length, and 10 meters in width.   As i drove under the formation or object I noted 6 extremely bright lights.  The lights were in a cross formation, with 4 lights comprising the central column of the cross, with two lights on the left and right of the central column.  The lights appeared to be, at my best estimate, 2-3 meters In diameter.  I found the absence of “shafts” of lights curious given how bright these lights were.   I attempted to pull off in order to photograph the object or formation, but by the time I had safely done so, the object had made a turn at a right angle relative to its last observed position and was increasing speed.  By the time I had my camera up, it had left my field of view. I think it relevant to note that I served 4 years as an Imagery Analyst (MOS:35G) for the U.S army, I have not seen any equipment that resembles what I observed, nor does the behavior of the lights match any Military SOP I am familiar with.

Green flashing lights: My fiance and I left a friend's house during a thunder storm last night. Bolts were shooting across the sky throughout the night, typical of this time of year.  Then, facing north (""behind love's gas station"" while headed north on 44th ave) the entire sky lit up green, like the color of a green traffic light.  It flashed three times within ten seconds, another ten seconds went by and it flashed two more times.   At this point, east of us and much nearer to us, we saw a glowing white area in the sky.  I quickly called our friend and told him to go outside.  He and his girlfriend saw two flashes that we did not see; he was east of us (near ""the beverage barn""). One of the unusual parts about it, we could see every lighting bolt below the clouds, buy the green flashing and the white orb both seemed ""behind"" the clouds, which didn't appear as storm clouds so much as just a black blanket across the sky preventing the stars from being visible.  In other words, this happened much ""higher"" in the sky than the lightning we were seeing.  Also, no thunder accompanied the green flashes.   The white orb also appeared behind the clouds/atmosphere, but was so bright that the white seemed to seep through downward (I hate to use such a stereotypical word, but now that I search for the proper descriptive words, I could only most accurately say that the light ""beamed"" down). The super white ""beam"" stayed immobile and lasted between one and two minutes, the light went straight down and didn't funnel out at all, and didn't reach all the way down to the ground (a field in between 44th ave and I-75). It was all very unusual; as a storm and science lover, and biology major, I have watched tons of storms and never saw anything even slightly similar.  In the car, we joked: ""If aliens ever truly visit us, then THAT WAS IT!""",2015-08-27T00:00:00,29.153170016207454,-82.11931701782821

I and a companion observed 2 sets of 3 lights hovering silently, then ascend and depart. Event Time:  2000-09-01, 10:00PM (22:00)   Some friends and I were hanging out at the house but not much was going on and we were getting bored.  So my friend, Mr. X, tells us a tale about some old hippy commune he had heard about and it’s relative location suggesting we go check it out.  After a brief discussion we all say what the heck and so we load up and head out.  We get there a couple hours before dark.  It's a large, tree covered, dome of a hill, just off the east side of 291 North near a bridge that crosses the Missouri River, about 20 minutes or so north of 24 hwy in Independence.   We decide to divide into pairs to seek out the rumored commune at the top of the hill, agreeing we either meet there or return to the car at nightfall. I team with Mr.X and we head out. Our search for the commune was fruitless and Night begins to fall as we make our way back.  As we descend the north face of the hill we come to some rail road tracks and follow them west as we chit-chat confident they will lead us back to the road and the car.  We follow the tracks perhaps 10 minutes, when I spot some lights just north of us.  Thing is, that’s the flood plain of the river with weeds as high as a man.  That strikes me as very odd.  I verbalize this to Mr. X, and now we are both stationary, studying these lights.  There appears to be two distinct sets, one set slightly closer then the next and just a matter of meters further west.  Each set featured at least one blue and one white light.  I would guess they were about as high over the weeds as a lamp post is over a parking lot, say five to ten meters and you could see white light cast upon the weeds. I could hear no sound or detect any movement and the weeds did not seem to be experiencing any wind turbulence that would be created by an aerial vehicle.  I moved to the edge of the embankment the tracks were on (where it dropped to the plain where the weeds were flourishing) so I could try to get a better view of these lights.  I could see no lamp post or any discernible mount the lights may be affixed to.  Mr. X joined me, and we studied the lights a few moments longer.   Curiosity getting the better of me, I begin to study the embankment and the footing at the bottom considering a trek through the weeds to get under these mysterious lights. No sooner had I considered my first steps down when both sets of lights ascend straight up into the sky with out a sound and in the span of a breath appear to reach airliner altitude.  There they pause for just an instant, before one set shoots west, while the other shoots east. Within a second, they are both out of sight.  (As they ascend you could see the lights were in fact laid out as a triangle, each light seeming to mark one of the three points though I was never able to see anything that could be a component or even the surface of a vehicle)   We shared the experience with our friends, after reaching the car, but they were skeptical, to say the least.  (Neither us thought to try and take a picture with our phones.  We were to captivated by what we were witnessing.)    The experience was fantastic and unbelievable.  If I wasn’t there, I probably wouldn’t believe it.  It's almost enough to make you doubt your sanity.  I don’t know if they we’re alien craft but they were UFO's (Unidentified flying objects), and perhaps others who have had a similar experience won’t feel so crazy if they read about the experience (encounter?) I shared with Mr. X. I was texting back and forth with Mr. X one evening and asked if he ever thought about that night.  He said he had with frequency for a couple years after the experience but had not done so in a long time.  I still think of that night now and again and to this day the experience haunts me, not with terror but a burning need to know what I and Mr. X encountered that evening.  That exchange is was motivated me to finally share the experience.  I didn't waste any time and submitted a report via my phone, which came out a lot worse then I would have expected.  The page was not very mobile friendly.  So I have since cleaned up the the grammar and added a couple details I had failed to include. As for that evening I cannot think of any terrestrial craft that could behave in such a manner, to hover silently while not even disturbing the weeds under them with the wash of their propulsion.  That in itself was seemed impossible but to shoot straight up into the sky, pause and then shoot off in opposite directions disappearing in seconds, all with out a sound?  If I reign in the wonder and amazement of my observations and consider that what I witnessed was terrestrial what possible reason could these strange, clearly sophisticated vehicles have to be hanging out over the flood plain near the south bank of the Missouri  River?  None of it adds up.  But the alternative, that they were in fact not of this Earth.....that seems to crazy to take seriously.  What the hell did we see that night, what were those things and why were they there?  I know it's a mystery I'm never to solve and that's what haunts me, the complete mystery of that encounter.  That life exists on other worlds I have no doubt.  Math alone tells us that there has to be other life out there as the universe is to large and to diverse for this one rock called Earth to be the only rock in the entire universe to support life.  The universe is so vast that the human mind cannot even comprehend its dimensions.  But to be routinely visited by aliens from another planet?  I've never bought into the idea.  The mystery of that evening though, despite my skepticism I cannot discount the possibility that I had in deed been witness to an alien visitation.",2015-08-13T00:00:00,,

A past girlfriend of mine has been evicted from her north Philadelphia apartment, with no where for her to go, I ask my grandmother, ""Can my girlfriend spend the night with us, since she has no where go?""  My grandmom replied, ""No, she cannot stay here,"" which led to me and my girl leaving the house together and getting into her 1993 Buick lasabre that was parked at the very beginning of the block.  We could not figure out where to go at that time, so we both ended up dosing off and falling asleep in her car with the seats reclined back. To my surprise I wake up from hearing an aggressive knock at the dark tinted passenger window beside me.  The knock was similar to the way a police knocks on your window at a regular traffic stop.  I turned my head towards the window, I look up and see an Asian like man with very dark pitch black eyes, both of his eyes were black like some sort of demon staring right at us.   I reach for the handle to open the door and approach this strange looking person, and my girlfriend pulled back on me saying, ""Don't get out of the car, why ((profanity deleted)) do his eyes look like that?""  In a scared tone.   So me playing the brave guy role at the time, ignoring my girlfriend I get out of the car anyway and approach this person.  Feeling slightly dizzy and drowsy like I would normally waking up out of a short sleeping session.  I'm literally standing about two feet away from this guy, directly looking into his eyes, thinking to myself, ""This is one ugly strange looking ((profanity deleted)).   His skin was so pale which made him look even weirder. He was dressed in a black tight fitting long sleeve black shirt, with black cargo pants and black footwear, and he was built like a small Asian guy with Asian like features.  The closer I'm moving towards him, the more jumpy this guy is acting but not in a aggressive way, more like a defensive way as if I was going to attack him. I ask him "" what's the problem?""  And he responded in a soft low tone saying, ""Yea, man just go home.""  I replied back wiping my dreary eyes still feeling dazed saying, ""I live on this block.""  Then he replied for the second time saying ""yea I know, just go home man,"" like he was trying to help me out.  So I asked feeling slightly disturbed and annoyed saying"" so what are you a cop or something?""  Then he replied back somewhat studdering with a slight snicker saying "" ye yea I'm a cop"".   I said ""ok"" as the guy turns his back to me and walk towards this vehicle that's double parked crookedly in th! e street I'm also stunned by the vehicle he gets in.  It's a white Hyundai, not just any average white Hyundai.  This was one of the most amazing, cleanest, spotless vehicles I've ever seen in my life at the time.  They look similar to the way they look now in 2015 but this was back in the 2007 or 2008 time period. The headlights on the car were extremely bright shining down the block opposite of me.  I mean these light were bright, and he was driving alone because I noticed no one else in the vehicle.  I got a good look of the front of the car and seen the tilted ""H"" symbol on the grill of the car.  That last how I know it wasn't a Honda, this was a Hyundai.  It was like a car in the future to me back then, and how they look now reminds me of this encounter every time I see one ride past. He then sped off down wyncote avenue and I got back in the car with my girlfriend.  She's asking me ""what did he say?  I tell her that he must've been an undercover cop and her car probably matched the description of another car used in a crime in my neighborhood.  With that said I flagged the situation away like it was no big deal and continued the rest of the night out with my girlfriend. What puzzles me about this, is the fact that no police badge was present at the time, no walkie talkies, no back up no weapon.  This guy was very gentle but intimidating.

I keep my eyes on it with the intentions of watching the balloon until it drifted away and was no longer in sight.  But this object didn't do just that, it paused in mid air.

I shot a total of 55 photos, but the first 5 showed nothing, leaving 50 clear and obvious photos of an object in the night sky.  The original 55 photos are still in my camera on the same disk, and I would be willing to share them with a knowledgeable expert or research organization.  One would need only to enlarge, as I did, the 50 photos that follow the first 5 blanks to see everything in detail, with no explanation needed.   I just recently discovered the NUFORC website and thank the proprietor for making it available. This object was above a rural area of ranches and vineyard properties, West of Santa Rosa’s developed suburban neighborhoods, where I live.  More specifically, it was one-half mile South of River Road, and less than one-quarter mile West of Fulton Road just below the intersection of Fulton and River Road on the Southwest side.  The sky was dark and completely clear with no clouds or wind. A private pilot also observed this object over Santa Rosa at about the same time, and posted it on the NUFORC the same day.  I refer to the pilot’s excellent report for my own comparison which I agree with, except the object was hovering, not traveling, when I observed and took pictures of it, and it was several miles South of Sonoma Co Airport.  The pilot describes a chevron shape which could have been, but the sky was too dark for me to determine.  From its lights alone, I estimate the object’s size would cover the width of a 6 lane freeway (3 lanes in each direction) if it were on the ground.   The object appeared to be about 500 feet above the ground as the pilot described. The craft was completely and totally silent as it hovered, which surprised me for something that large and that close.   It appeared to tilt gently from side to side (or front to rear) as it hovered and shifted its orientation, standing on end at times.  It made no fast or jerky movements. All of my photos show 2 to 4 lights which blinked slowly out of sequence and occasionally changed from red to white.   There was always one red light present that appeared to have a white-hot center which shows in the photos.   The lights reminded me of the slow blinking lights seen on the tall frame of a radio tower (if one of those huge towers was hovering in the sky, tilting from side to side). Along with those lights, some photos show lights that are turquoise and flesh-pink in color.  Toward the end of the photo sequence, portions of a tan colored, rough-surfaced body mass with no distinct shape can be seen in the dark areas between the lights.  Other photos show narrow rectangular window-like areas that the pilot also observed.  They appear to be lit with the cold kind of light produced by fluorescent tubes. Several photos show some interesting features I did not notice or simply could not see, notably patterns of radiation emitting from the craft.  Some have turquoise colored “Z” and ‘W” shaped patterns, and others look like the lightning from a Tesla globe.   I learned that this could possibly be ‘plasma” radiation, which is an advanced system that replaces metallic structures (such as antennas) with energy that can be shaped and directed as needed.   I also learned that some UFO’s can be “shape shifters,” making them difficult to describe. I took my photos from two areas and made a point to steady the camera against a sturdy surface, first a lamp pole and later a fence post.  The first set was taken on Barnes Rd near where I live, 1.5 miles East of the object, and the second set was taken on Fulton Rd, no more than a football field’s distance from the object as I looked up at an angle.  Here, I got as close as I could without going through ¬¬gates and trespassing on private property.  This is where I noticed it made absolutely no sound as it hovered. In some of the photos here, the lights of a distant ranch house can be seen on the ground below the object, which serves as a reference that made it easy to locate when I went back the following day.  I thought about showing the residents of that house a photo of the object that was above them on October 27th, but decided against it. The sighting began when my wife and I noticed from our backyard while it was still light, what we thought at first glance was a low hovering blimp approx 2 miles West of our house.  About 20 minutes later, we noticed it was still there and larger than we thought, with no “blimp” structure of any kind over what looked like a frame of lights hovering in the sky.  That was when I grabbed my camera and drove to the first location to take photos.   Later when I drove home and looked West from my backyard, the object was no longer there. My wife and I have lived for 25 years in the house we own here in Santa Rosa, and have worked for as many years in occupations that require professional licenses from the State of California.  This is the first time in either of our lives that we have seen anything that could possibly be considered a UFO.",2015-08-13T00:00:00,38.45256501240695,-122.71790012406949

As I turned around to get into the car, I saw three bright orange lights in a “V” formation and a fourth “straggler” slightly behind, moving slowly across the sky from the SW toward the NE.   My husband was already in the car and I told him to get out and take a look.  We both were watching the 4 lights, which seemed to disappear behind the thick cloud cover, but as we again turned to get into the car, there was another group of 4 orange lights, the first 3 in V-formation.  This time the 4th one was much further behind, but they all were traveling SW to NE.   Because our intention tonight was to get the grocery shopping done, we drove over to Meijer.  As we parked the car in the Meijer lot, we could still the 4th “straggler” of the second group of orange lights and we stood in the parking lot watching until the light seemed to fade behind the clouds.   My husband dismissed these orange lights as most likely “military.”  But they were not your typical air plane lights.  They were orange, with a slight yellow waver and were steady with no blinking.  The speed at which they traveled was slower than a plane, but made me think of a glider.  As far as I could tell, they made no sound.  All I could hear was highway traffic and shopping center traffic.   We saw these unusual lights flying in this formation above a busy outdoor shopping mall, with people coming and going from the theater and restaurants.  I was looking around for someone else to look up or someone close enough that we could talk to and ask if they could see these lights too, but the people we saw were too far away and/or on their cell phones!

This leads me to believe it was a small piece of debris, had it  been a space shuttle in the distance it would have taken a less steep entry angle.   Knowing that UFOs can accelerate instantaneously I assume they can decelerate just as fast.

I first observed two (2) objects and after slowly scanning the area nearby I saw four (4) additional objects.  I observed all six (6) for approximately 5 minutes before my view was obscured by the roof of my house.   The six objects moved together in a fairly uniform configuration that changed only slightly during this period.  When I lost my view, I moved quickly to find them again, but was unsuccessful in locating them a second time.  They appeared white to silver-white in color, and were all the same size in diameter.  These objects were only visible through the binoculars and not visible via the naked eye.  Having no frame of reference, I was unable to judge or estimate their size or the distance to their location.  It is possible they were balloons of some type but they would probably had to have been some type of cord connecting them together for them to move so uniformly.

It was a bright luminous mass and while I would describe it as round in shape it did not appear perfectly round or disc-like.

It gave the impression of a gaseous ball of light, in that it did not appear solid exactly.  And while you could not see through the object, it had a translucent character.

We are in the country, so being able to visualize the stars is normal.  While he was looking up he noticed two lights that were flashing red/blue (this was a continuous flashing that never changed) and moving in tandem of each other.  The movements were very precise.  They went up, down, zig-zag, and sideways but always seemed to be in tandem.  He brought me outside and I immediately saw the same thing.  Then I looked a different direction and saw another one.  They were not planes, as there was no sound.  There also isn’t any plane that could move like they did.  Then through some of the tree’s we noticed another one.  When the objects were not moving but just hovering they had a little bounce or wiggle.  If one object was moving a great deal it seemed the others stayed rather still.  This went on for about an hour.  Then they just slowly started getting farther away and disappeared. The same thing occurred again the following night on October 11, 2015.  The first 2 flashing red/blue lights we saw were in the exact same place, then we saw the third and it was in the exact same spot as the night before.  There was less cloud cover this night and we saw two additional lights.  These also seemed to move in tandem with each other. Total, we saw 5 lights but expect that the single one probably had a tandem partner that we could not see. We watched again for close to an hour. When we went inside they were still there.

I looked down, because i was busy with something, but then looked up again and saw it changed color from orange to neon pink/purple, at this time it was almost right above my head. I continued with my work and looked up once again and it was snow white.  It moved to the east and faded away as if it was going back from where it came from.

As we walked towards the swimming pool, she noticed a strange oval formation in the sky to the southwest (towards Savage, MN).  The sky was dark, but not yet dark enough where you couldn't still make out the clouds in the sky.  This stood out much more than the background clouds, appearing as a smoky white ring with at least six points of light, relatively evenly spaced around the ring. We looked at it for about five minutes or so, during this time it did appear to move, with the oval becoming ""thinner"" and then wider, it also appeared to slightly rotate. I was honestly quite awestruck looking at this, getting a feeling that this wasn't normal and didn't strike me as something that would be created by some sort of spotlights or some other ground, based light(s). Interestingly, it just sort of disappeared instead of fading away.   A few minutes later I spotted a light from a plane flying high above (I didn't feel it was connected to this phenomenon, this seemed to be a passenger plane), and its light disappeared behind the clouds.  My feeling is this ring of lights was cutting through the clouds, as the light was a sort of foggy light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights from local casino, we wonder??

It's low enough in the atmosphere that I thought it was a plane. No blinking lights, plus the entire thing emitted a glow.  It was traveling rather slowly, no trail, and it was witnessed for about one minute.  It was a giant ball of light moving from west to east.   At the end of the sighting it got to be very bright, then dimmed to red, and then faded out of sight completely.  I've seen comets and shooting stars, logically I cannot connect those dots.  It wasn't a commercial craft or drone, and it was silent.  Any other guesses I'm not considering?   Oh, also, it wasn't one of those Asian candle paper lamp thingies either.  I've seen those released numerous times and they move all about, flicker, and glow and are nowhere as large as what this was.

We have a family home there and are well familiar with the area for more than 40 years.  We arrived on the beach probably about 7:45 or 8 pm not too long after sunset.  No one in our party had consumed anything intoxicating.  The sky was still somewhat bright and just beginning to darken.   I lay down on the sand and looked up to search for the first visible star, which I quickly noticed was almost directly overhead.   There were almost no other stars out yet, so I was just mindlessly looking at this one.  At first I noticed that it seemed to be moving but slowly, not at the rate you would expect for a plane at that height.  So then I thought  ""oh that is not a star perhaps a satelite"".  To my knowledge I have never (knowingly) seen a satelite before so I took more interest in watching it.  It was then that I realized that periodically--perhaps every three or four minutes but not according to any specific regular interval--the movements were nothing like how a plane would move in the sky, they were erratic, zig zag, the light would become still and then shoot forward a short distance, now left, now right. It was strange and intriguing but not alarming to watch this, and it made absolutely no sense to me at all so I called to my 17 year old nephew to give me a reality check (ie, tell me I was nuts and there was nothing strange happening in the sky).  He started watching too and almost immediately saw the same strange things.  It was a few minutes before we realized that we were actually watching two different lights, and that there was also a third and together they formed an elongated triangle. The three lights seemed to remain equidistant and never broke the elongated triangular shape. I cannot properly estimate the area the shape occupied as it was over our heads I would guess it the size of a large parking lot.  Although the light moved around, the area they encompassed always remained directly over our heads--so that despite the erratic and unexpected movements we seemed to observe, they stayed in the same general area the entire time. My sister looked up briefly and told me it was my imagination and that ""if you stare at any star long enough it appears to be moving"".  I am certainly familiar with the general phenomenon she referred to, but what we saw was nothing like this.  My nephew and I watched intently for about 30 minutes, and we were on the beach for about an hour all together.  The lights would be still and then jerk suddenly in one direction or another left or right or zig zag etc and we would call to each other ""Holy crap, did you just see that?"" etc. Those exclamations probably happened at least 10 times, and my sister even scolded us for using colorful language becase we didn't actually say Holy Crap and there were children elsewhere on the beach. The night was windy but not overtly so.  I did consider if what we say could have been a drone at night, I have only ever seen them during the day but I could not account for how three of them would be able to maintain the shape or what appeared to be orchestrated movement between them--the wind was sufficiently strong coming off of the water and the presumed height of the object, if indeed there was one--that I would think it extremely difficult for a manually operated drone to maintain its general position in the sky let alone maintain a large shape in formation with other manually operated objects, but that would be the most logical explanation.  At no time did I ever see a hard outline to the shape, or a surface, or anything else like that.  Just the three lights moving in very unexpected ways such as I have never seen any other lights move in the night sky. But nor did I ever see other stars or any light inside the triangular area (which could be one indicator of whethe! r there was a large object occupying the space between the three lights),although the stars were still just coming out so there is every possibility none were yet visible in that area to the naked eye. At times there seemed to be smaller VERY faint lights moving to the to the 'edge' of the area and disappear, but this could have been an optical illusion of the sort my sister had previously described, but they seemed to disperse aight or air around them when they reached the edge of the triangluar space and then were no longer visible.  They did not appear to be aircraft of any kind.   Soon two planes (I assume) flew very near to the object, neither interacted with it and both seemed to travel in a straight flight path that not change as they approached the triangular area, and neither plane transversed the triangular area.  The second plane had a number of bright flashing lights on it of different colors--my nephew said aloud what I was thinking that that plane had very odd lighting on it--look there were too many lights on it and they flashed a lot more than you would expect, the night sky was very clear with little to no clouds. Since my curiosity was somewhat aroused by ! this point I did consider if at least the second plane was there for some observational purpose. I did not and do not want to make more of the 'incident' than what is was--something that seemed very unexpected and somewhat strange. My cellphone battery charge was as always this vacation nearly worn down but I don't think that photographing it would have been of any use and I sincerely doubt that the my camera on phone could pick up starlight at that distance, though I've honestly never tried.  At some point I think my sister became alarmed that I was perhaps exciting my nephew and so she called for us to drive back to the house.  I should note that there were a number of other people on the beach, there were three bonfires blazing, and no one else appeared to notice anything, nor did we attempt to involve anyone and see if they saw what we saw--that seemed pointless.  You would have to be looking closely and intently to have noticed anything out of the ordinary at all. As we left the sky was now bright with stars, and the lights were still visible.  Nothing distinguished the lights in question from 'stars' except for the intermittent but very erratic movements and that they seemed clearly linked somehow in an elongated triangle shape (for lack of a more descriptive term).  After we left we stopped at Ben and Jerry's for ice cream and did not get back to the house until perhaps 10 o'clock.  We did not attempt to sight the lights again so I do not know if they were still there.  When we got back to the house I did check myself by staring at the stars intently for a while to test my sister's theory that it was just an optical illusion but at no point did any visible light make any unexpected movement, or do anything other than 'twinkle' in the usual way, and the night was very bright with stars by then as this is a low-light area at night.  We had gone to the beach last night to enjoy the air, see some seals (there are tons of them on that beach now) and hopefully see a remnant of the August meteor showers that we have watched on that beach since childhood.  I am sure that this description I have written is very mild and boring compared to others you receive and most likely it is easily explainable by known phenomena.  It really doesn't make sense that an object large enough to cover that area would not be more visible, would not be seen by other people, and that it would appear in such a relatively populous area.  Also my sister and her husband and my niece said quite clearly that they did not see anything that alarmed or intrigued them, so in truth the majority of our party of five did not see what me and my nephew saw.  But my nephew and I were both sufficiently startled by what we saw at the time.  In the end I cannot escape the fact that I saw something that I cannot explain in the night sky, and it left me feeling slightly bewildered and slightly shocked as it happened.  I make no claim other than the fact that what I saw was inexplicable to me.",2015-08-27T00:00:00,41.8375,-69.9748

During the first second of the sighting:  I was driving alone on I-10 East about 8.5 miles due East of Kerrville, TX, (30° 02' 40"" N 98° 59' 46"" W), when I saw a bright blue UFO off to my right (SSW).  It was moving extremely fast, 3000 to 4000 MPH, at about 1000 - 1500 feet altitude.  Nothing was visible behind it to provide scale for altitude, but from previous experiences, I assumed it was an average sized UFO, 30' to 50' in diameter.  The speed I determined with Google Earth, from where I first saw it to where it changed direction was about 3 miles in about 3 seconds. The next two seconds:  As it came closer and passed over I-10 and off to my left I realized it was actually two bright blue lights. The next second:  At that point it appeared to reverse direction and come straight at me, my heart stopped for a split second from memories of previous experiences.  It was actually two of them, side by side until they split.  To me, the two lights turning different directions made it appear as if only one UFO was coming straight at me super fast for a split second. The last two seconds:  The one going north went out of sight behind me, I watched as the other one increased speed and disappeared in the distance over the hills, about 3 miles away. That's it.  As for me, I have an IQ around 150, common sense, and my hobby is knowledge of all sciences, religions, legends, myths and secrets.  Astronomy has been my favorite for over 40 years and advanced technology of any type is a close second.  I know what Venus, a satellite, etc. are. My first sighting I won't talk much about, memories start coming back I don't want.  I was 7, hunting squirrels with a semi-auto .22 rifle.  I crawled up to a clearing to watch for squirrels and there were 3 Tall Whites, almost human looking with slightly larger craniums, not huge like grays.  They were standing beside a beautiful mirror finish UFO, almost invisible in the trees.  I was afraid, all movies showed aliens were evil invaders.  In an instant they disappeared and a stick and the leaves between them and me all jumped to new positions like a piece of film missing.   I walked back to camp thinking I had shot two squirrels, but couldn't shoot the third one because of the great sadness I felt coming from him as he looked at me.  It was his eyes, like squirrels eyes that made me remember the sticks and leaves and aliens and UFO.  And I didn't have the two squirrels I shot, I would never waste meat.   Later I remembered killing the two.  They were good, I was bad.  I can't think about it anymore, I don't want to know what happened.  I have encountered them many times since then, some just passing by, some with missing time, one with a grid of geometric shaped light bruises on the back of my upper arm, I told my family they took me again, showed them what they did, it was gone the next morning.  They took me at Boy Scout camp as a child, I watched three of them rapidly switch positions as they hovered before leaving, they were triangulating, triple checking and then I watched them go until they were one point of light that faded away towards a summer star, theirs maybe. They took me at a railroad crossing with an old style wooden arm across the highway in part of west Texas where there are no railroads for hundreds of miles.  That was 3 years ago, I am 59 now.  I don't know why they won't leave me alone but I think they want me to build something I saw in a dream as a child.  The last UFO was so bright everything looked different shades of white for hundreds of yards and it was about 3 A.M.  Maybe someday I will post abou! t the tw o secret space stations I found in my telescope and the MIB taking pictures that ran from me and the unmarked almost silent helicopter that hovered over my home and pointed a mini-gun at my wife and child while I was in the house, all within a few days.

I told them (MUFON, who turned me in) I didn't really know, I hadn't looked because I didn't align my telescope properly and I was just stargazing and stumbled across ships moving back and forth between them. I am rambling now, I'm sorry.  I don't trust the grays, they are fallen angels, enslavers of mankind.  The Tall Whites are Angels.  I don't give a crap if anyone believes me and never have.

I was on my living room sofa, watching late movie with the volume down since kids were just went to bed after their summer school at Ridgecrest.   I heard humming sound with the electric current from outside.  Initially I thought it was someone is driving their EV or Hybrid, because my Optima Hybrid made similar sound at its EV mode.  However, sound seems very loud compare to any other hybrid car that I have seen.   So, I looked out the window, which was just next to my sofa.  There was nothing on the street.  But there was a triangle shape flying UFO hovering, or very slowly moving, on top of my home.  I was looking at it for may be 10 to 15 seconds or more.  I was speechless at first, but I think I said to myself,  ""What ((deleted)) is that?  What the hell is that thing???  OMG!!!  How can it hovering, without making any sound...but I can feel electric humming sound.""  These are the words that I was talking to myself during the observation.  So I was probably witnessing less than 20 seconds or so, approximately.  I need to stop the incidence report here for moment and describe my initial sighting of this object back in January 2015. I was walking outside my home on the night of January 5, 2015, approximately around 07:50 PM, I witnessed a strange flying object that does not flying like a plane or helicopter.  And it was flying at very slow speed with not so high altitude.  It was definitely higher than tall trees in PV, but much lower than conventional flying altitude of helicopter.  I went to my car and grab a binocular and saw the object and, it was a somewhat triangle shape (not the perfect triangle, I was not too sure about the perfect or not due to the visibility was not clear) with the 3 flashing red lights on each corner.  There was a center bright light on bottom and top which was on and off.  Ever since, my curiosity lead me to follow the object whenever I saw it.  It used to come up in the same area at same hours. It seems to have regular schedule of flying hours.  Then sometime in May or June, it was stop showing itself.  I was pretty much forgot about it since it did not show and had busy work schedule and with the kids... Now going back to the story that I paused for minute.  This almost perfect triangle shape was hovering very low on top of my home which is probably about at 4 story high, less than 40-50 feet high.  I was able to see very clearly..its shape, material of the body.  When I first saw back in January with my binocular, I thought it was a black color, but it was more like a silver or gray, hard describe its color, but very materialistic color, may be like graphite.  However, it was not pulsating red flash light in three corners.  It was a white flash lights in the three corners, but no center light.  My phone was at my computer desk and was charging and I did not want to miss the opportunity to witness the close up encounter with this object.   Suddenly, my cat jump up to the window and I was surprised by sudden presence of my cat and made a sound.  The object seems to notice that I was watching it at that moment.  It quickly began to emit very bright center light with the high charging electric sound which last only may be less than two seconds, then it began to accelerate toward the ocean very fast for about 50 feet then got disappeared. After I witness the UFO, I searched online and trying to find out about the object online and close thing that I discover was a flying object called TR3B.  However, it was not entirely the same from one that I saw.  If you type TR3B on You tube, then you can see video image from France, it was illuminating center light bottom and top and disappeared in front of your eyes.  However one that I saw was only from the bottom portion center was illuminate. and moving speed approximately 50 feet was just blink of an eye, less than second or so. It was not very big.  It was probably only about 1.5-2 times bigger than my Optima.  I was able to feel our window was vibrating at that time when the object was hovering our home.   Perhaps, I am exaggerating, but it seems like it was checking on me because I was following it for few months every time I saw it.  My wife told me to stop thinking about it and maybe I better stop thinking about it.  I did not expect it to show up on top of my home.",2015-08-06T00:00:00,33.7584,-118.3163

Other movements could be seen, also.  No matter which way it moved, the view did not change.  It didn't tip or bank to ascend or descend. This object (no pictures) could be described to be in the shape of a sphere with a tail (or part of the craft) that comes from the orb in a downward 45% angle to the left.

I have shown my fiancee, my daughter, grandson and our neighbor. We are all in agreement to it's actions. One night the object had moved extremely high in the sky to where it looked half it's size.

But instead, it seemed to kind of hover then cross the road again.  The last time it appeared, it crossed the road very slowly and low to the ground.  This was the first time we got a good look and realized it was definitely not a normal airplane.  It was kind of triangular in shape.  It had some white lights, and a blinking red light.  It went very slowly, like barely faster than a hover, and eventually disappeared behind the tree line.",2015-08-13T00:00:00,31.295049315068493,-89.36069520547946

It was an enormous space craft silently hovering over my neighbor's house, across the street from mine.   I told him to look asking him if he saw whatn i saw.  We both agreed that it was very real and amazing.  We stared at it.  It was unlike anything I've ever seen or heard reported.  It was a dark grey color.  And it shape was like a triangle with the pointed side facing south, then another two triangle shaped protrusions on each side of the ship pointing up towards the sky.  It appeared like it had alot of space inside like there was multiple floors inside.  There was a very large amount of window like squares with what looked like shiny redish, greenish, blueish and purpleish pearlescent squares all over the surface.  Also, many white lights next to the squares  that we're randomly lighting up. It looked like a large futuristic panel of buttons and lights. There was this wing like triangle coming out the bottom that had red lights on it. Idk what that was but maybe it was to not hit anything while that close to the ground or to enter a house . that's kinda what it seemed like.  We watched it go south bound very slowly and completely silent. We we're in awe and watched as slowly left our sight. It was so unbelievable that I didn't tell anyone for a month or two  and then when I did tell Ppl they didn't really believe me.  But I think I  found a story that was similar to mine but they couldn't explain it since they were not any where near as close as we were.

I was on my way to an afternoon appointment, and I stopped at my subdivision's entrance, which intersects a very busy street in the Stone Oak area.  It was a typical South Texas day, hot as hell, and clear blue, but for a couple dark clouds.  We're in big sky country and I just glanced up as a I waited for a break in traffic to merge and I saw plane flying from east to west. No, not a plane.  That's not a plane.  I'm used to seeing aircraft in San Antonio, with all the army bases.  I know what most large military craft look like and they also fly very low.  But this was different.  This was cigar shaped kind of like a sleek Zeppelin, silver, no lights, no visible insignia. I'm watching traffic I think.  There's no one behind me so I lose many opportunities to merge so I can continue to identify the flying object I've become so drawn to.  I wonder if anyone else can see it. It's not a plane.  It's not a military plane or drone.  It's flying low enough to see it's not a plane.  It's just cruising and I'm watching it and it flies right into the only dark cloud in the very bright blue sky and never comes out the other end. Not possible. I don't pull over.  I don't want to know.  No one is behind me still and I merge into traffic and begin to drive but keep my eyes on the cloud.  The cloud remains and the object never comes out the other end. I stop at a near light and the object still doesn't come out. I'm stopped next to McDonalds.  The object still doesn't come out. That's not a plane. It's not normal but I need to keep moving.  I know I do.  I keep my appointments, I tell my immediate family and it's just another unexplained sighting that they think is really cool but dismiss after dinner. When I was younger, I didn't know any better and would report these sightings to police.  Now I know to report some to UFO centers and keep moving.  I am surprised by this one though, that it didn't make the news, that no one saw it.  It was so huge in such a bright sky, the middle of the day.  I don't think anyone saw it.

The source of the noise turned out to be the voices of a couple walking on the sidewalk in front of the house, but I immediately noticed a large orange light off in the distance to the southeast over the couple’s heads.  At first, I thought it was the moon. The light was about as large as a new crescent moon and the color of a rising harvest moon.  Then I saw that it was moving, from east to west.  I wondered if it might be an aircraft. It’s apparent height and speed and its flight path were similar to the police plane that patrols over the freeway south of the city.  However, this light had no navigation lights and was much larger than any aircraft I have seen passing by at that angle above the horizon, near or far. I strained to listen for any sort of aircraft sound, either the propeller noise if a small aircraft of the distant roar of jet engines, but all I could hear through the open window were the voices of the couple walking by.  Otherwise, the night was dead silent.  Because the light was so unfamiliar looking, I couldn’t tell how far away it might be.  As the light continued on it’s path, reaching about south of my position, I noticed that it was pulsating or perhaps had started pulsating, going from very dim to very bright about once per second.  At its dimmest it was still plainly visible and at its brightest it was quite a bit brighter than the ISS would be. A few seconds later, it became obscured by a tree in front of the house.  By that time I had probably been watching it for about half a minute.  Although I could occasionally see the light through gaps in the branches, it took about half a minute for it to emerge back into unobstructed view.  It continued on the same path, still pulsating from bright to dim about once per second.  I watched it for about another half a minute or more, until I lost sight of it behind neighbors’ trees to the southwest.  A few seconds before it went behind the trees, I thought that it might be turning slightly to the northwest, but I couldn’t be sure. Whatever it was, it wasn’t an aircraft.  Its flight path was too steady and fast and it looked too far away to be a Chinese lantern, although I can’t rule that out entirely.  The couple walking on the sidewalk appeared to be unaware of the light.  I looked at the clock and saw that the time was 1:35 a.m.  Before going back to bed, I pushed my face close to the window to look over as much of the sky as possible.  I wanted to see if any stars were visible, because at that hour it almost seemed as if the sky might be overcast (it gets hard to tell these days as our growing city emits more light pollution).  The sky was somewhat hazy, but the brightest stars were visible overhead through our urban skyglow.  With no cloud cover, the light could have been any distance away.",2015-09-17T00:00:00,52.1078373650108,-106.66923239740821

We were close to Springfield, Ohio when I noticed a very large bright flashing white light with a small flashing red light on one side, and a small flashing green light on the other.

But as we got closer to it, the white light was bigger, and it appeared that the light was hovering in place, not moving. I then thought maybe it was a warning light attached to a tower, as there are many along I-70 West, although the warning lights are typically all white or all red. As we drove by it, it was not over the highway, but off to the side over the trees and fields.  I was able to see it briefly because I was driving.  I looked up at it and could see underneath.

I couldn't see Orion's belt or even the North Star.   I also could not locate the International Space Station.  At approximately 0530 I laid down on a couch we have next to a big sliding window that leads to the pool in the back yard.  The window faces east.  That is when I first took notice of the bright light hovering in the distance. The light was very bright and had an unmistakable sparkle to it. I was looking directly at it expecting for it to move but nothing was happening.  Around 0600 a second light, relatively dim, but with the same sort of shape and sparkle appeared far in the distance to the East.

I grabbed my iPhone and took some pictures and a short, 1 minute video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKPx65li2VU    By 0630 the original light had moved past the upper boundary of the sliding window and it was no longer visible to me from my vantage point.  But it was still there.  I know this because every so often I would get up and move my body closer to the window as I stretched my neck looking for it. I was looking at the second light, wondering what these things could be. Suddenly, I see what I can only describe as a triangle shaped ball of fire moving from south to north, or left to right of my window.  My first thought was that this was the original light I had been looking at because it was just as bright, perhaps brighter.  It moved quickly and left my field of view in a matter of seconds.  I jumped to my feet to get a better look  where it was heading.  It is not difficult to spot a bright light in the early morning sky.  I followed it attentively as it traveled north and then it simply disappeared.  Gone. Just like that.  Almost as if someone had hit the light switch. I blinked a couple of times.  It was gone.  I found myself disappointed for not having captured it on video.  The sky was starting to turn blue by this time and the two original lights I had been looking at seemed to be the only bright objects in the sky.

An Orange Sphere of intense and steady light –  My wife and I were at Cannon Beach, Oregon, for the weekend. At 11:25 PM PT, Friday, October 2nd 2015, I was looking due west over a row of beachfront motel units. I noticed a very bright, steady, orange light out over the ocean.  The moon was not in the hemisphere, and there were no noticeable clouds.  The day had clear skies. Winds were calm. When I opened the sliding door, I noticed that the light was slowly moving towards the east, towards the shore, at an even speed and steady altitude.  I would guess it was above a thousand feet. The light was not a pin-point, but a distinct round shape.  I looked for a cowling shadow or surface reflection, but could see none. The round light was intense, but not like a searchlight, there was no beam effect.  There was no strobe or flutter effect, either.  I was able to catch a smartphone video of 56 seconds.  The video shows some strobing, but that is mostly due to the auto-focus of the phone trying to maintain focus on a light source in the dark. At 3 seconds in I zoom to maximum, hence the greater distortion and apparent change in size. At 31 seconds the light moves behind the row of motel units where we were staying.  The jostling is me stepping out onto the patio deck to capture a few more seconds. I could not tell how fast it was moving since there was no background reference. From the angle shift (+30 degrees at first sighting, facing west, to +60 degrees south-southeast) and the duration, someone with trigonometric skills could roughly figure out the height and speed. There was no sound, above the sound of the ocean waves. The engine roar sound on the video seems loud, but to my ear it was a distant rumble of surf. Helicopters make a distinctive sound at the beach, whether Coast Guard or otherwise. This was not the light of a helicopter or conventional plane. There were no other lights, no navigational lights, and no other bright lights in the sky for the next half hour. Earlier in the day, around 5 PM PT, my wife and I had seen two drones flying near Haystack Rock. They had very small white beacon lights and moved in irregular patterns and changed altitude from time to time. The video isn’t very good, but it is a few seconds (56 seconds) of 'interesting' light.",2015-10-09T00:00:00,45.8918,-123.9615

Going North 2 miles on old 17 highway, off of E 1050 road.  Going approx. 45 mph, coming up to a 4-way intersection.  Just a house lot due East of the intersection, which would be NE from the intersection origin point, I saw a brilliant emerald green light that appeared to be in the back yard of this house that was on the N side of the road running East from the intersection.  The first house on that road. I believe it flashed twice, or was in the “on” position twice.  When I first saw it, naturally looking through a car windshield and right next to my rearview mirror where it came through at me, I had to do a double take like, what is that, am I seeing things and all that.  It almost seemed like a ray of its light struck me, or the vehicle.  But when I say struck I do not mean with a force.  Shined my way I guess. It was so brilliantly bright emerald green.  It looked like it was the shape of chandelier ball, the kind that have hundreds of little 1 inch square mirrors on them, but these were more like 1 foot squares, maybe 2 foot squares.  But I can’t emphasize enough how brilliantly emerald green the light was.  It was not normal light. It seemed to “come on” twice in this back yard behind this house.  In the same spot.  I wanna say just West of the green light was a smaller white light but not sure. The 2nd thing I pondered was, somebody welding.  Because when someone is welding behind a structure, it kicks out a light and shadow really brilliant.  But this was the most emerald green light or thing I’ve ever seen. So, when I got to the intersection, I turned R going E and slowed down and looked over at this house.  Went on down the road, turned around and came back.   Never saw anything at all.  Then I went on North along my route. This evening about 7:00 pm, I drove out there and asked these people if they had a welder or a light.  They were old folks.  They said no.  I was able to look in the back yard a bit to see if there were any burned spots on the grass or ground.  I looked from my truck, didn’t get out.  But couldn’t see anything out of the ordinary.  And the people looked at me like I was crazy of course.  Then I left. I cannot get over how brilliantly emerald green it was.  It was out of the ordinary.  And, like I said, the first time I saw it, it was like it flashed me.  Like one of the mirror plates flashed me in the face, and I was at least a good 3/8 of a mile from it, maybe almost a half.  It was just so brilliantly emerald bright green.  It just wasn’t normal.  So, I don’t know.  I thought I saw one several years ago one night south of Fayetteville, AR, on I-540, but it was a white light and not even close to being brilliant. One final note.  Years ago an acquaintance told us that he saw one.  The location of where he said he saw it, seems to be on the same line of latitude as this thing that I saw.  His would have been approx. 1.5 to 2 miles West of here, and then going North along the big Sallisaw Creek up to McCoy Ford.  He said he was south of McCoy Ford on the creek.  He didn’t say how far south, but rd 1050 E bisects the big Sallisaw Creek if you go straight west from where I saw what I saw last night. From the UFO shape database poster, what I saw was similar to either C5 or G9.  But it did not look like either of them, only similar.

I thought to myself, “Okay, it’s a plane, but I’ll watch for the blinking red and green lights just to be sure.”  It was heading East from the direction of the Lemoore, CA, Navy Base (NAS), which is close to 15 miles West of me.  There is always heavy air traffic in this area due to the Navy Base. As I watched this light come closer, traveling at the altitude of what appeared to be that of a single-person prop plane, it reached my proximity in about 30 seconds from a distance which I calculate to be about 5-6 miles away.  As it reaches my proximity, I notice that this bright light begins to slow down SIGNIFICANTLY.  It has NO blinking lights at all; not red, not green, NONE.  At this point, the bright light covers about a half-mile in distance in the same time (30 seconds) that it took it to travel the 5 or 6 miles toward my location.

About 5 seconds after picking back up speed, this bright light began to shrink (not dim) as it appeared to be moving rapidly away and out of orbit until I could no longer see it within 4 seconds of its initial ‘shrinking’.  And without any noise being admitted, it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2015-10-09T00:00:00,36.3166,-119.7103

Coming home from dinner on September 25th, 2015, at approximately 9:30 pm, we don’t drink or do drugs.   My girlfriend and I were driving up the hill to our house when she said to me, what are those 3 lights?  I replied, probably helicopters as I had no interest.  As we continued up the hill she said again, look, what are those lights?   At this point I looked up to see 3 bright orangish lights in a vertical pattern a considerable distance apart from each other.  I then said, lets stop and watch and see if they are moving, as they just appeared to be hovering.  As we stopped and watched I immediately could notice they were slightly moving but very slow.   Immediately after I noticed they were moving slowly in our general direction, they stopped and appeared to be hovering again.  I still wasn’t too interested until, within a few seconds,I literally blinked and the bottom of the 3 lights had vanis! hed.  Now my eyes were glued to the 2 remaining lights as the bottom light disappeared faster than anything I have ever witnessed or known to exist on earth.  The next two lights and what they did are why I am writing this and now know UFO's 100% do exist. 3  The top light in the pattern of 3 lights, which is now 2 lights remaining, I watched disappear approximately 10-20 seconds after in a directly upward and out direction at a speed not from this earth.  The large bright light I could see fade in a direction, speed and distance that is impossible to be from our planet.  Rockets and Missiles are like a turtle to this speed. It was very close to light speed, just a bit slower and enough to notice direction.  As this happened I expressed my disbelief to my girlfriend and I am not sure if she saw it disappear as it vanished completely within a second or two.  However, now both our eyes are glued to the middle of the 3 lights and last one remaining.  Within 10-20 seconds the middle and last remaining light, which was a good distance lower than the top light, began to move in that same direction at a similar speed.  As we both watched the light vanish into outer space within a few seconds, exactly like the top light, we knew what we j! ust saw together was impossible to be anything known to exist from this planet.  My girlfriend will submit her sighting report in her own words and neither of us care if anyone believes what we saw.

I saw it for perhaps 1-2 seconds and then it disappeared down into the valley behind our house. I then looked up into the sky and saw what appeared to be the remnants of a smoke trail high overhead.  The moon was a super moon so the trail was easy to see.  It appeared to line up with the path I think the object took.  However, there were a lot of jet contrails in the sky that night.  My wife and I had been talking about that, and thought maybe the bright moon was just showing them more easily than normal.  So I can’t be certain that what I saw was the trail. Perspective was tricky, and I found myself wondering if it was actually several miles away and larger than I initially thought.  It is impossible to say.

Something in the sky above Sunset Hills, MO, on March 12th, 2012, at 11:54AM. I was driving Northbound, and saw something moving across the sky.  It looked kind-of like a cloud at first.   I pulled over because it was a very clear day, no clouds were in sight, and it struck me as odd.  I was amazed when I got out of my car, immediately began filming and even tried to capture what I saw by putting my sunglasses over the lens.  It was iridescent, glittery, sparkly, and free forming, silent, non-solid, varying opacity, fluctuating size and essentially shapeless.  The form was too high up for me to gauge if the wind was affecting it or not.  The wind (on ground level) was moving South-East, and the form seemed to move East North-East.   Initially, I only saw one form, then suddenly another appeared.  The forms were offset, and near one another; however, I cannot calculate the actual distance.  The forms dissipated and reappeared a few times.  About 10 minutes after seeing it, I stopped filming (I filmed just over 7 minutes).  Once I had stopped filming it seemed to mo! ve too far out of my visual range and started moving South. It appeared as two fading, alive shapes. I filmed this from a parking lot off Lindbergh Ave/highway 67 going north between Chrisann Ln and Court Dr.  The nearest airports are 10-30 miles away.  There are no military bases within 35 miles from the location.  There is a National Weather Station about 15 mi from the location. I am a musician, photographer, artist, jewelery designer, and poet.

My friend and I were going on a walk and noticed a strange, bright, light hovering over the area of Lake Norman.  The light appeared white in color and extremely bright for the distance it appeared away from us.  Upon further examination, the light seemed to be made of four smaller lights clumped together shining bright enough to appear as one.  The light hovered in its location for roughly 30 seconds until it moved up about 20 degrees from our PoV and began hovering again.  Note, at this point it was thought that the light was a plane due to its movement speed and the way it moved.  The object, after hovering for roughly another 30 seconds slowly crept left and then began accelerating to a very fast speed which caused us to run across the road to continue seeing it.  We then lost sight of it after it went behind a line of trees that spans roughly 30 feet and then didn't appear from the other side.  I would normally be inclined to say this was a helicopter but if the lights were this bright, then it would be much closer and there would be a sound (there was no sound but the bugs at the time).

They were flying in a straight line, left to right across my direction of travel, and consisted of two silver cylindrical objects that I would guess were about the size of railroad tank cars but taller and maybe longer, and were ahead of a third object that was black, and square or rectangular in shape, and as large as the cylinders. I saw no windows on any of the objects, nor any means of propulsion - no wings or propellers - and no discernible tail features.  There was no sign of any smoke or other exhaust features. They were moving relatively slowly, and stayed in view for about 40 seconds before I drove past the point where they were off my right side and out of my sight.  If they stayed on that course, they would have passed over the Germantown area. I was in heavy morning rush hour traffic, in the center lane, and could not pull over to either side to stop for a better view. I don't know for sure what they were, and, unless we have technology that I am not aware of, I seriously doubt that they were made by man - homo sapiens. All of my life, I have believed that we are not alone.  Now, unless this can be explained away, I am very sure we are NOT alone! ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Mr. Davenport, I did report it to another site, but they never published anything on it.  I just found out about your site due to an article in the newspaper (Frederick, MD News Post).  Thank you for taking interest in it. And, yes, it WAS a dramatic sighting!  I was in heavy rush hour traffic in the middle lane of 3.  They were flying just above treetop level.  The driver in the car to my left obviously saw it also, but the look on his face was absolute terror.  I seriously doubt he told anyone about it.  I did confide in a few friends - almost sorry I did.  I don't think any of them believe me.  I only wish I could have gotten to my phone to use the camera in it.  I have ordered a dash cam, just to make sure something like this never happens - undocumented - again.     I couldn't stop to get a better view either, due to the traffic.  I even had a policeman in our church check to see if there were any other sightings.  The only thing he could tell me was, ""Yes, there were."" I was not frightened by it.  But, I must admit, I have lost a few nights sleep wondering who/what they were, where were they from, what were they doing here - so many questions I would like to ask them if I had the opportunity.  I wouldn't mind taking a ride in a ufo either, assuming I could come back from it! The cylinders were so large, I have wondered if it could have been the beginning of an invasion.  My guess is each of the 2 cylinders could easily have accommodated 2-300 or more human sized troops.  I would also guess the 3rd craft was a control unit. As I drove down the road after the sighting, a big black helicopter flew past me headed in the direction I had seen the objects going. Interesting!! I must admit I am a sci-fi devotee, and I write some under the name ((name and e-address deleted)).  This sighting WILL be going into a story I have started. I have now posted a page on my website, www.((address deleted))l detailing the encounter.  Feel free to link to it if you want to. If only I could contact them - assuming they are friendly.

I looked up, and over the neighbor's house at the 12:00 position, I saw a very large golden ball.  We had been watching for comets for the last couple weeks.  This was way,way too large, was not moving, and was totally soundless.   It hovered for several minutes, then I thought it was coming in my direction, as it was getting larger.  There was no sensation of it moving...just like suddenly it was closer.  At one point, then, it changed shape.  The only way to actually see it as a shape was to observe very black areas within the shape, and the lights surrounding it, giving it a certain depth.  While looking like a large, bright ball, at first, the small lights at certain points (the small lights were red, blue, yellow, green, and very small)  and the dark area within gave it a somewhat convex shape, but the most dramatic addition to this were what looked like 2 vertical ""grids"" composed of lines of black, with lines of bright lights between the black lines.  These, along with the colored small lights, appeared when the object got closer, and appeared to have  rotated to that more 3 dimensional shape, with the grids angled straight upwards.  I am an artist, so I was very interested in the shape when all the individual lights, and the grids showed up...the flat bright ball went from flat to 3 dimensional, and it was very apparent.  The object moved soundlessly over my head, and at some point in time appeared circular again, and soundlessly ""glided"" towards Richmond.  I went into the house and told my fiancée, who registered mild surprise.   About 10-20 minutes later, he received a call from a friend. ""I just saw something I've Never seen before"".  He described the same thing, within the same time frame.  We learned that the object he saw was just like what I saw.  He lives about 15-20 miles away from us, is a military man with a long career, (retired) and he had never seen anything like it, as well. Although I have had one ot her sighting of a UFO long ago, I never reported it.  It was somewhat similar to this sighting, but over, and within, water.  I probably would not have reported this, but for the call from this friend that makes me absolutely certain that I saw it. I was frozen to the ground the second I saw this, and didn't move until it was gone.I have a very quick sketch of how the object looked in my sketchbook, but it seemed that each second that went by, my brain was trying to forget the whole thing, so my sketch is basic, but true to form.

On this evening, I happened to look out my bedroom window because it was very cloudy and windy outside.  It was about 1:45 am and something unusual caught my eye.  A string of lights in a line formation in the sky, far enough up that I knew it could not be a helicopter, kite, or lantern.  The lights were hovering in a straight line, blinking and that's what made me realize this was not a plane or anything I have ever seen.   I am eighteen years old, and most people would not believe me, so I woke up my mother and made her come outside to see what I was seeing and she was in disbelief.  It was nothing she has ever seen before, she had no explanation.  We watched the lights for 20 minutes.   During these 20 minutes, the hovering line of blinking lights would slowly move into a diagonal formation, and when the clouds cleared up and made the formation more visible, you could see one of the lights almost look as if it was spinning.  There was also one red light that would a! ppear every now and then.  Eventually this formation of lights slowly began moving in a strange pattern up further into the sky.  The lights looked as if they moved in slightly different patterns and formations.  This is something we both can not explain.   Someone else in our city that is known to us, has a video of the same thing we saw, two nights ago, same time.  They sent in a report to this website.  Is something happening to our small city?",2015-08-27T00:00:00,46.52478538011696,-84.33508070175438

My parents, now in their 70’s, had, what they think, was a UFO sighting back sometime between August 1967-July 1971 (they are unsure of the exact year).  They do know it was during the summer (July or August).  They lived in Washougal, WA, USA.  It occurred sometime between 10pm-midnight. My parents had gone to bed.  It was a hot summer night (no AC in those days), so the upstairs windows were all open.  My brother and I (infant-toddler age) were in our own beds in our own room.  My father was asleep in bed, my mother awake in the same bed.  All of a sudden, my mom saw a very bright, white light out their second story bedroom window. She got up to look out the window and saw a perfect circle of light, cylindrical-shaped, that filled up the side roof of the next-door neighbor’s house.  Because of the way the neighbor’s house was/is situated, no on else in the neighborhood would have been able to see the shape of the light, only the brightness.  There was no sound at all.  She said the first light lasted a few seconds. She woke my dad up and then the light shone again, for a few seconds as well this second time.  They both saw it and said the light was a very distinct, perfect circle that came from the sky, down into a cylinder-shape onto the roof.  To this day, they bo! th report the exact same thing—a bright, white circle of light that had no “edging or haziness” to it.  It is still very clear in their minds. They both were trying to come up with some plausible explanation for this—an airplane?  A helicopter? But, they said there was not a sound—total silence.  My mom called the Washougal Police Department to report this and see if anyone else had seen this.  The police department said there were no other reports of this or any other kind of aircraft around that night (she said she felt crazy even calling at all, but felt compelled). Now, if you knew my parents, you would understand why they have never talked about this with anyone other than myself.  They are skeptical by nature, don’t necessarily “believe” in UFO’s, are religious, pragmatic, and not prone to “stories.”  When I asked them if I had their permission to report this sighting, they agreed. They also agreed to be interviewed.  They are getting older and I think they figure that if people are going to think they’re “crazy”, then it might as well be now.  Ha!  This is the first time I have written the story out or shared it with anyone.  I don’t know if I am even reporting to the correct agency or not, but here it is.  I don’t know if it’s “too late” or if this is anything of interest to anyone, but I feel that it’s better late than never. Thank you. P.S.--On a crazier side-note, when I was in my late thirties, doctors happened to discover that I only have one kidney.  I went my whole life (and had three healthy pregnancies) without this knowledge.  They said that on the side where there is no kidney, there is a little empty “sack”—“Most likely you were born this way, we don’t know.”  Strange.  I’m sure it’s coincidence and “stolen kidneys” are a complete myth, but it has, on occasion, caused me to say, “Hmmm.” ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

North out of Wahoo, Highway 77 turns east 5 miles, then turns north again toward Fremont.  I had just made this turn north, when my radio started cutting out.  The early winter hours made it dark by this time, and nobody was on this road. I started to fidget with the radio tuner thinking it was going out, and within 100 yards-- in front and to the left of the road--a bright craft rose up behind a row of trees flanking a run-down shed. It was a weird neon green color-- surrounded by a halo.  It rocked back and forth quickly and several times in a jerky, erratic movement.  It was in my sight for so long I was able to make out something like ""windows"", and inside these ""windows"" I saw these weird, creepy ""things""-- silhouettes of beings or something-- flitting back and forth.  The craft accelerated to the right-- over the highway to the east, and the minute it passed entirely over the road, it fizzled out like a fireworks display.

What I saw still haunts me to this day. Less than one hundred and fifty feet away, hovering near the top of the neighbors' backyard tree, which towers to 50 to 65 feet in height, was an object that I had never before seen.  My mind seemed to be scrambled for a millisecond in an effort to ""make"" the object identifiable.  I saw the ""ghosts"" of a tail section and large rotor blades on the top, but those projections quickly vanished.  There were lights toward the front, asymmetrically placed on a ""bulkhead"" of sorts, and those lights were not blinking or moving.  The colors were red, green, blue, and a singular white light. The body of this craft at first appeared to follow in a general way the body of a military helicopter, with flat sides that rolled over the top with a similar roll on the bottom.  The exterior was glassy smooth and the color was a bluish-gray, what I first called ""Periwinkle,"" certainly not exactly what I intended to suggest.  It was a Periwinkle blue-gray, but a much darker value than the color that most people understand to be Periwinkle. I am not an illustrator, and so my illustration does not depict the color correctly. In total silence, and as if acknowledging that I had spotted it, the craft quickly moved toward my house and passed directly overhead the window from which I was observing.  From the first moment of its departure, the object appeared to change its shape into a cylindrical ""oil drum"" with two rounded ends, though the leading end was ""notched out"" from about half-way up the cylinder to the top.  That ""notch"" moved back perhaps four or five feet, and then stopped at a vertical bulkhead, upon which the lights were set in recessed openings.  I did not see any pilots. Now the interesting thing is that I continued “seeing” this craft for several hours, as though it had been imbedded in my mind.  Also, there seemed to be a kind of transparent hatch cover that covered the notched out front section of the craft, which I never saw with my eyes.  But it became real and seeable in my memory image as it repeatedly slid open and closed for a very long time.  That action was very fast and it seemed that it was done so many times in order that I understand its importance.  If it actually had any importance, I have failed to realize that. The entire episode must have taken place in about two seconds, which is a very long time when you are seeing something so far removed from normal experiences. That morning I drew some rough sketches of the craft and guessed at measurements and distances, etc., and really goofed on much of that.  It was after I got out a tape measure and started taking actual measurements that I saw how erroneous my first guesses had been.  Now much of that has been corrected, though I still need to figure the height of the roof of the house next door without arousing too much suspicion. My emotional reaction to the sighting:  I felt as though there was a strange violation of my privacy. It was as though I felt that I was being watched and the moment that I discovered that, “they” fled the scene very rapidly.  So overall, I had an ominous feeling, a feeling that is related to paranoia. The following morning, September 30, 2012, I heard the loud thumps of a helicopter approaching my house, so I grabbed my camera and ran outdoors.  The Army helicopter crossed my front yard at an aerial height of no more that 70 feet, and I was able to get two photos of that black machine.  How very curious that such a visit would take place so soon after my sighting.  We rarely see helicopters in this area, aside from the occasional EMT Rescue copter. Eleven months later a photograph taken in Brazil was revealed in “Filer’s Files,” a web news letter about UFO’s.  The object in the photograph was almost identical to the object that I saw.  Since then another similar object was photographed in Pikesville, MD, and shared on the web via “UFO Sightings Hotspots.”",2015-07-03T00:00:00,37.7776,-76.5136

It was hard to judge exactly how high up in the sky this orb was, and I wasn’t in the position to stop my vehicle to better gauge its positioning from the highway.   Houston drives are horrible, so, all I could do was stare in awe and wonder.  The orb had a luminous glow around it, as the clear Houston sky that held it, showed some of the green rays permeating from it.  Have you ever been on your back in the grass at night just staring up at the sky and admiring the stars?  This is what this orb reminded me of, star gazing.  I gazed, while avoiding not crashing, almost making eye contact with the light.  And then, just like that in the blink of an eye, the orb shot downward, out of view disappearing.

We went outside to set them off.  Some sparklers, some snakes, and some helicopter fireworks that go shooting up a little over 6 feet.  We did the snakes and sparklers, ending with the helicoptors.  The first one had went up on the roof, so we waited for it to fall back down.  We lit off a few more and watched where each one went to make sure it didn't get stuck somewhere. We got down to the last helicopter, and after it had fallen, we both turned away from the house and for some reason, we looked up.  We froze there for what felt like 10 minutes.  There was a light that was bobbing up and down, slowly moving in the sky.  The bobbing motion was not too slow, but it wasn't very speedy.  The bobbing lasted for a couple seconds until I asked my friend if she was seeing it, too.  She said she saw it, and all of a sudden it shot right off.

While on a mule deer hunt, at approximately 0300, I woke due to digestive issues.  I started walking toward the bathroom which was located north of the truck I was sleeping in.  While walking, I looked up at the sky. The sky was overcast with altocumulus, turning into altostratus.  The moon was waning, about half full, which was located behind my travel of direction.  The clouds were not thick enough to block moonlight, which made the clouds very visible. While I looked up, I saw a blacked out disk silhouetted against the clouds, no lights, traveling at a high rate of speed from the NW, heading SE.  I estimated the speed at about 500MPH.  Similar to an F16 on a strafe run.  The objects altitude I guessed to be 1000ft above ground level.  After the object disappeared over the canyon rim, I looked for a follow up disk, which did not appear.  The object never made a sound. I proceeded along my way as if I saw nothing. Until now, I had completely forgot about the event.  This is what I find strange.  I am a former Meteorological Observer, trained by the US Military.  I have seen just about all military aircraft fly both in daylight and night.  This was not one of ours.  Why then, did I not act excited or scared by what I observed, or even remember the event till 6 months later?  I treated it like a mundane viewing of an A10.

I was in a room of my house that has a skylight which gives a view of the Eastern sky located directly above my home.  I was peering out the skylight when a very bright ORANGE light/orb drifted across my field of view. It appeared to be traveling at the same height and speed that a small, single-engine Cessna would usually cruise.  It had no traditional blinking red, green, or white lights.  It was a solid, non-flickering orange light/orb traveling almost exactly at a Northwest heading (coming from the Southeast).  My best judgement is that it would've flown on a diagonal vector directly over Briargate Elementary School. Once it escaped my field-of-view, I ran to another window, this time on the Western side, to try and find it.  There were a few trees obstructing my view and I had no luck relocating it.  I listened for any engine or propeller noises and could not hear any.  At the same time, for the heck of it, I scanned the entire Western horizon and did see what appeared to be a very faint, distant orange light.  However, at that distance, I can not: A) say for sure that this was the same light that I saw before nor B) categorize it as something unusual. O'Hare Airport, Lake In The Hills Airport (small aircraft), and a Flight For Life helipad are not that far from my home.  I am a pretty big aviation enthusiast as well.  Needless to say, I feel I have a pretty good handle on what normal air traffic looks like in my area.  This was definitely something unusual.  I have never seen anything like this before, not just near my home but anywhere. I did some online research and found the following could explain what I saw:   1) Satellite - I'm not too sure about this.  Again, the light was very bright and pretty close to the ground. 2)  A nearby planet - Same with above, the light was very bright, too close to the ground, and moving too quickly. 3)  Chinese lantern - This has some merit.  The orange color could explain it.  However, it was moving faster than Chinese lanterns travel and there was no flickering/glimmering to the light source.  Also, there was only one light and usually Chinese lanterns are released in clusters. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Both of my sons (ages 9 and 7) were outside camping in a tent they had setup on our deck facing East toward Grizzly Peak.  This was the third night they had slept out there alone in a row.   Around 11:30pm they came running into the house, petrified.  I was dozing off lightly on the couch on the north side of the house.  Same level.  My older son leads the way, his face is white and jaw is dropped.  He's stuttering for words telling me that a big disc flew down over their tent and around our house.  I asked them to elaborate, and they both started telling me the story in tandem and in agreement, practically word for word:   My older son was playing on a device when he saw a very bright pulsating light through the top of the tent near a small opening.  He saw it, but didn't care.  He said moments later the light became so bright that he had to investigate.   When he got out of the tent and looked up he said directly over their tent was a very bright light pulsation from a craft.  The light was alone and pulsating from an eye shaped hole.  He stared at it confused and thought for a split moment that it was a helicopter or an air plane.  He said it then started showing different lights all around its body, and he saw that it was a disc shape, and that it was much closer than he thought, just near the tree line.   He screamed for his brother to come see and shouted that it was a UFO.  My younger son now begins telling the story:  He said to my older son 'yea right --- your lying shut up', my older son insisted and stuck his head in the tent and yelled at him to come up.  The younger boy comes out of the tent and said that he saw the large disc shape object moving slowly now over their heads and down to the house, blinking multitudes of lights.  Both boys are simultaneously speaking and using hang gestures to show me how the lights were moving around the spherical center of this disc.  ""So many"" lights trailing everywhere.  Multiple colors, blue red and yellow. Then, perfectly timed they both say ""then boom!  One huge light came from the center!  Shining all over us!.""  So bright it lit up the trees.  They described the object as having a round dome on the top and bottom that the lights ran down.  The the dome being bigger on top, with a bright light going around it horizontally.  I was stunned at their reactions!  This is extremely odd, especially for my older son who does not believe in anything other-worldly, and my younger son who seldom tells a lie.  And never tells a lie without obviously displaying it with his body language. I asked them what the object looked like.  They said it was ""amazing"", ""beautiful"", ""like something they had never seen before ever"".  My son described it as metallic and struggled to find words through his emotion.  I ask him how big it was, and they both agreed it was at least the size of a bus, if not 2 buses.  I asked them if they thought maybe it was a drone or quadcopter?  My older son said it could have been but that it was huge.  I suggested that if it were a drone and were large that it would be very loud.  He immediately realized and told me that this object was completely silent but may have had a faint humming sound which came from it (my younger son did not comment on this, and only agreed! that it was extremely quiet). I began recording them immediately on my phone without them knowing so that I could replay it later.  As they are telling me, my younger son sprinted back through the hallway to my baby daughter’s room (3 years old).  Also on the north side of the house.  When I yelled for him not to wake her up, he came back out and said he wanted to make sure she was still there in her bed because it had flown that way.  Which I found heartwarming. I continued to ask them what it did and why was it here they thought?  My older son said he didn't know, but that it was ""pacifically, pacifically at our house and interested in us"" ('specifically' he meant).  They described again how this object became very active and moved down more into their field of view as if for them to watch. There is a clearing on the south side of the house that has no trees.  Where they described seeing this object was not at all hindered by trees.  It would have been completely clear of obstructions with the nights sky behind it. Using a lot of hand gestures they told me the disc started circling downward slowly on the south side of our house into the trees (the deck is on the east/south corner of the house).  I asked them how low it was they thought and they adamantly said they could have thrown a rock at it and that it was very low.  They then said in the same corkscrew fashion it went back up and directly over the top of our house, still d! isplaying the multitudes of lights and colors.  They said it went across our house slowly and headed towards our neighbors house (northward toward the side of the house I was sleeping on).  They said it then rose above the tree line and started flying away.  They knew I was on that side of the house and ran in to come tell me.  At my feet there are very large windows and my younger son insisted that I must have saw it.  When I said I hadn't seen it they were shocked and disappointed.  I asked them how long the ordeal took and my older son said at least 3 minutes.  I asked them again if they thought it may have been a plane or some other sort of craft, and they both said it looked like something they had never seen ever, and my younger son insisted that he thought they were aliens and that he was very worried.  My older son agreed and said he could not imagine it being from this planet, but that he was not scared just shaken.  He told me how shocked he was that he would ever get the ! chance to see something like this in his life.  Something that ! would ma ke him change his mind about UFOs and aliens existing. I told them that I believed them, and that I believe it to be likely that there are other beings in and around this planet and that perhaps these beings seized an opportunity to touch the minds of 2 young boys.  They were very relieved that I believed them and insisted I message and tell their mom. They also asked to sleep with me because they were too scared to go into their rooms.  This is also very odd behavior for them.  As was it for them to both agree on every aspect, and be so worked up.",2015-09-11T00:00:00,42.1563,-122.52979999999998

It was the brightest light/object in the sky.  The night sky was crystal clear and there was no wind. I pulled off the side of the road where there were no street lights and exited my vehicle to get a better look at the light.  I was facing south looking at the light over the lake.

Once the planes were out of view, I listened and could hear no sound coming from the light.   I watched it for a few minutes to see if it was actually moving.

I have seen many balloons flying, as most people have.  All that I have seen go primarily upwards, and also usually move somewhat horizontally.  They usually tend to wiggle a bit and wobble as they fly.   This object did not appear to rise upwards at all.  It seemed to maintain a completely horizontal movement, and apparently moved in a straight line toward the west.  It did not wiggle or wobble at all as a small balloon would.

From my left peripheral view I caught sight a commercial air liner descending and approaching in on its flight path for a landing into Orlando International Airport (MCO) which is approximately four miles south from this location.  That was when the craft started descending straight down at this time and it felt as if it was avoiding the airliners pathway. It slowly descended out of my view behind some tree tops and houses and I would guess about maybe three to five blocks away at most.  That was when I made a dash into the house for my point & shoot digital camera, phone and car keys and decided to search out what exactly this craft was.  My first thought was, it was some sort of expensive really big hovering drone and surely I would be able to track who ever was flying it while they were packing it away, but I found nothing so I extended my search even further out than I anticipated and still nothing.  I drove back to the main road SR 436 hoping to catch some people perhaps gathered talking about the lights but there also I found no one... Approach and descent of craft:  From the S/E sky, heading S/W.   Speed:  Slow.   Approximate size:  Ten feet plus in diameter.   Shape:  disk like.   Lights:  Four per quarter side (but could only see two sides of craft)  Color of craft:  N/A  Sound or Humming:  None (and it was a really quiet night)  Height in the sky of craft:  Just below the over cast at the time of descent. Side notes:  There was also a smaller solid blue light off to the bottom side of the craft. ((name deleted)) Orlando, FL.",2015-08-13T00:00:00,28.519246697974758,-81.35409597886704

We were outside on patio at about 10:30 or 11:00ish.  It was a cloudy night in the Northern sky.   I noticed an orange light traveling slowly NE.  I asked my bf if he thought that was one of those orange orbs like we had seen before in that same stretch of sky back on August 22, 2015.  This event had 3 distinct groups with different patterns.  He thought it was a plane with landing lights going to the airport, since it was going in that direction.   About what seemed like 5 minutes later another came and it continued on the exact same path and spaced the same at least 5 possibly more times.  He insisted they were airplanes and I was like ""no way"".   Then along came a formation which had 4 orbs and looked like a triangle with a tail (I have video).  It slowly floated across the sky going the same speed and following the exact path of the ones prior.   The 3rd set came not long after the formation cleared and these came one right after another and there were at le! ast 10 of those.  Again, they followed the same path but seemed to go faster but that might just be because they were one right after another.  Regrettably, I did not capture those on video.  Since they were behind heavy clouds, they were not sharp clear circles except for one that passed by later which was so bright I literally had to squint until it too went behind cloud.   When the formation came then it was obvious to me that those were not airplanes but my bf still insisted they were until he saw the video the next day. Again, I feel sick I didn't get the last set on video.   I hope I see them again some day!  Like I said, we saw them on August 22, 2013, at around 10:30ish.  My bf said there were 3-4 stationary in the sky and they started interacting almost playfully. He said, they would shoot off in different directions and seem to fade and reappear too.   He called me out so I wouldn't think he was crazy and I just saw one that night.  It was just sitting there in one spot for at least 5 minutes.  It was very round and bright orange. It then appeared to elongate and looked like a flame and got lighter orange. It seemed to have a white light pulsing from the right side.

This appeared to be a light source that was coming from above the clouds--not from below.  It was a diffused light, moving in a clock-wise direction and completing a circle about once every second.  The relative size of the source was about the size of a full moon.  It went on for about 20 minutes.  The circumference of the circle was hard to quantify, but I would estimate it to be about 5 to 10 percent of the overhead sky. I watched this light for about 20 minutes, as I walked the dog. It suddenly stopped--it didn't get smaller as if moving away--it simply stopped. I called it into! the Seattle Police Department and the person on the phone suggested I call the phone number for reporting UFOs. I called the number and spoke with a gentleman who asked that I submit a brief written description of the incident.  As a side note, I'm a photographer and used to observing light.

Two of the persons who witnessed this are former military veterans, with 18 years of service between them.  When I asked them what they thought it was, they could not identify the object.   The UFO was flying from the south heading north. It was a triangular shape of gold to light yellow light and it had three black dots that were at the back of the light shape.  As it traveled across the sky it became hazy and turned into a cloud.  It was by far the strangest thing I have ever seen in the night sky.   From the time that I first saw the object to when it changed to a cloud was about 20 seconds.  It seemed longer, but in reality it was not very long at all.  Then we watched the “cloud” move out of our view for about another 15 seconds.   It never entered my mind to try and video record it because we were all staring at it trying to figure out what it was.  My conclusion is a flying object with some kind of cloud cloaking device?  The time was between 1030 and 11pm.   One of the reasons I noticed this object is because I was looking up at the sky as the first part of the aurora borealis started.  This object did not move in any way, shape or form like the lights that were from the aurora borealis.  This sighting happened at Lake Arbutus, WI.  I did this little sketch to give you an idea of what I saw before it turned into a cloud.  And this is about the same size that it looked like up in the sky.

I was sitting in my office and we are on the 26th floor. About 45cms to my right are these massive glass window frames with a very open view of hard sand below us for about 1km and then there's a canal that leads on in 3 different directions, past the canal are roads and about 4 buildings under construction (They are much smaller than our buildingg), and right after that is a highway.  Basically between my building and the ones under construction there's a whole lot of space. So a few weeks ago I happened to look out my window and saw a round thick shadow that came from over my building heading in the direction of the highway.  So I quickly looked up in the sky and saw nothing.  A little shocked at first I decided to ignore it.  Then today, from the exact same spot, passing the same(if not very similar) route it came from the first time, I saw it again.  This time I decided to stand up and look properly. I stood so close to the window my face was barely an inch from it.  The sun is out, not a cloud in sight and this shadow just hovering by! I lose sight of it once it reaches the highway since it's quite far but judging by the size and clearness of the shadow, it was quite close... I personally have no clue what this means.  Looking at my surroundings it cannot be anything around me.  Especially something that passes all that way till even past the highway(Highway is about 15kms from my building) in a matter of 5 seconds.  I did not see a thing in the sky, I was in complete shock seeing a shadow formed from nothing, I could not even call people around me because by the time they reached it would be gone and they'd think I was crazy. I figured I'd share this experience with you, this has been my second sighting and I will be updating you if I see anything else.",2015-08-27T00:00:00,,

I was camping in the Boundary Waters on Bald Eagle Lake with my family.  The location was just after we passed into Bald Eagle Lake from Gabbro Lake.  My sister (age 40) and I (age 43), were lying on a big rock next to the lake looking at the starry sky.  I was showing her how to look for satellites as I had been taught to do by a friend (looking for Sputniks) when I was a kid.)   We watched what we first thought was an airplane passing across the sky and noticed that it was not creating any sound in the otherwise fairly quite night.  I pointed out that it did not have the typical, rhythmic flashing of lights like a plane, and she remarked, ""That's not how a plane moves!""  Because it was traveling at a strange angle, and at a speed that did not seem right.   Within the next 15-30 minutes we saw it two more times, passing in different directions and out of of our view (went behind the tree line behind us.)  Each time we thought out loud about what it could be, ! such as a drone? and tried to come up with an explanation for what we saw.  We did not see it again that night, nor the next as a storm came in. The lights seemed to flash across the object, rather than from the same location.  We did see satellites that night and were able to contrast what they looked like with this object, which if it were a plane, was traveling at an altitude low enough where I would think we would hear some engine noise.   I also downloaded a constellation app that night that my sister told me about to see if there was a space station or other object that might have tricked us.  I tried to take a picture and video with my iPhone but the image is just black. Also potentially of interest, is that sometime during this sky viewing (my sister may recall best if we saw the plane-type thing first) is that she saw a really bright, glowing light to the right of where we were, across the lake.  I asked her if it could have been a fire-fly, and she said she did not think so.  I asked her other details, such as if the light illuminated anything around it, and she said it did not.  The next day we looked over where she saw the light and there is a low bluff, and potentially a camping site within 1/4 mile of where she saw the bright light.  We imagined it possible that someone could have shown a light, but thought it strange that it would be a one-time lighting and nothing further. My sister and I are both health care professionals.  I am an avid coast to coast listener, very open-minded and curious, while I would say that my sister is less open to ideas about UFO's, so I was surprised that she was so adamant about this object not being a plane.",2015-07-03T00:00:00,,

I am writing to inform you of an unusual sighting I had with a friend, on June 17th, 2015. Our location is Nazareth, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of the state.  I was driving and he was in the passenger seat.  He will also be submitting a report on his perspective as well.  As I was driving, at the time, he of course got a slightly better look at the objects than I did.  However I will be submitting my perspective nonetheless. At approximately 9:25 PM, we were heading south on Blossom Hill Road, approaching a 3-way intersection with Newburg Road.  It had been a mostly cloudy and rainy day but had cleared up by this time and was a mild and partly cloudy evening.  At this point early in the evening, essentially no stars were visible in the sky.   As we approached the intersection we suddenly noticed a formation of 5 very brightly lit orange lights in a triangular or crescent formation.  They appeared to be hovering as a unit and had a certain “twinkle” to them similar to stars.  However, as noted before, there were not many (if any at all) stars visible in the night sky on this particular evening.  Although we were only approximately 8 miles from Lehigh valley international airport at this time, it was clear to both of us that these objects were very distinct from airplanes and appeared to act as a cohesive unit.  They were about as high in the sky as you would expect an average airplane to be, except appea! red to be “hovering” more so than “flying” to any particular destination.  It is also difficult to accurately size them because they were mere lights in the sky. At this point (after about 15 seconds) I had reached the intersection and put my car in park so we could get out and hopefully get a video of what we were witnessing.  At this point, the lights starting shifting into what appeared to be an “L” shape, moving together seamlessly almost as if they were a single craft.  Just seconds after they made the transition, they faded away one by one over about a 3-5 second span, almost as if they flipped a switch to turn their lights off.  Unfortunately, due to the brevity of the experience (about 30 seconds) and the limitations of our cameras on our phones we did not get the experience on video. As mentioned above, we do live close to an airport but these objects were very clearly not airplanes.  I also checked to see if there were any celebrations in my area that evening that could have had fireworks or something of the like, and there were not.   In addition, one of the most striking things about this experience is how much it mirrors many of the UFO sightings that have been reported within the past few years.   I am not implying that it was anything paranormal, but I have no way of explaining what we witnessed and it certainly demands further investigation. Thank you",2015-07-03T00:00:00,40.753,-75.3062

I again turned to follow the craft and it quickly disappeared out of sight. For the next two hours I watched as an apparent star in the sky, with a similar color, moved on a constant basis.

I work for an airline as a Maintenance Technician.  I was flying from Spokane, Washington, to Portland, Oregon, for a week of training.  We were flying at an estimated 20,000 ft (ceiling limit for this aircraft is 24,000 ft) in the vicinity of Ritzville Washington.  The date of this sighting was June 22nd at approximately 6:30 am.  The conditions were mostly clear with high level clouds in the distance.  No clouds were visible in the vicinity of the sighting. I had been taking pictures with my iPhone 6 out of the window due to boredom.  I had taken four pictures; I reviewed them and decided to delete them.  I turned my attention from the window and deleted the four pictures.  This action took me approximately 30 seconds in my opinion.  I looked back out the window and immediately saw a large gray disc shaped craft.  It was hovering, or at least did not appear to me moving, at our aircraft altitude.  I took several pictures and a short video.  From my vantage point it appeared to be the size of a shoe at arm’s length.  The height of the center dome corresponding to the height of the shoe, and the length of the craft of course corresponding to the length of the shoe. The duration of the sighting was approximately 5-6 minutes.  It slowly moved to the north east, or it could have been that our aircraft simply flew away from the object which was hovering. I cannot be certain which.  It simply dissolved as an object leaving your field of view does as it recedes from sight. I looked about the aircraft to see if anyone else had witnessed the object. No one else seemed to notice so I kept it to myself.  As I work for the airline I was flying on, I was reluctant to stick my neck out.  If anyone had looked out the window they would have saw it.  We were flying in a westerly direction and the object was to the right of use, which would be north. The pictures and videos were taken with an Iphone 6.  I will email them to you.

It was a very clear night. It did not appear to be a plane since there was no flashing lights, noise or trail and did not have the movement of a plane as I will explain in detail. I ruled out a satellite or the ISS for the following reasons. I observed the ISS at much lower elevations above the horizon, traveling in a strait path at a consistant speed and following a NW to SE orbit. this was nothing like that.  It was not a satellite or ISS because:  1.  The object was not traveling at a constant speed.  It seemed to slow down then speed up constantly as it moved across the sky   2.  At times the object seemed to wiggle or meander at times in a sense  that it shifted it's course slightly while moving very slowly then speed up again. We noticed this several times. 3.  As it moved east the light did not seem to dim as a satellite or the ISS would from loosing the reflection of the sun on the solar panels.  To me this indicated the glow of the light was powered by the object and not reflected from the sun.  4. The object was about the size as one would observe Venus but not quite as bright but more yellow/orange in color. The object was visible at that intensity for several minutes. Much longer than I have observed for anything in orbit.",2015-08-06T00:00:00,42.1695,-87.9588

When we got home I looked at the photos in their original size and noticed a few more things.  The light in photo 2 and 3 seemed also have some green that for some reason was vertical upward.

This display went on for some time. My father was a Yale graduate and a first mate on a vessel in WW2.  I asked him what he thought and a man who knew everything refused to commit on this. The discs were tri colored with lights along the rim.  I believe they were orange blue and yellow or red.  I remember thinking the colors were rather unattractive and clashed a bit. I was about 11 or thirteen.  Very young but I do remember thinking they were so close we could count the lights. I'm afraid I cant tell you an approximation of how big but they weren't small. Hawaii is a huge military outpost.  I think the Honolulu Advertiser had a small blurb the next day about venus reflecting swamp gas. etc..

I was sixteen years old at the time.  We lived on a farm on Shirk Road, west of the city of Visalia.  I was walking south along the edge of a vineyard when something caught my eye in my peripheral vision.  I turned and saw three disks flying in formation about fifty yards east of my position and only about 20 feet above the tops of the valley oak trees growing on the canal bank on the north edge of the vineyard.  Two of them were close together with the third following behind them. They were shaped like truncated cones.  They had the appearance of brushed stainless steel--a dull gray color.  They were flying silently at about 30 mph.  As I watched them, I had the distinct impression that they were also observing me.  I can't really explain that sensation. As I stood watching them, they floated over the vineyard, and then suddenly, they was a red streak in the sky, arching upwards and they were gone.  I was studying for the FAA private pilot's exam at the time.  My father was an anti-aircraft gunner in WWII.  When I was small, his idea of a fun time on Sundays was to go to the airport and watch planes take off and land.  I can honestly say that I could identify practically every aircraft I spotted in the air at the time.  These were not airplanes, helicopters, balloons or blimps.  They were silent disks capable of silent flight and incredible acceleration.   The sun was still high in the sky, and they were plainly visible.

My mom and our neighbor were living in apartments outside of Chicago at the Four Lakes complex in Lisle, IL, on Lakeside Drive.  We were at his place watching the movie and were about to go home. I can not be sure of the date, as it was so long ago, and I was quite young, maybe 6 or 7 years old.  What I can say for sure is that it was in the mid '70's (maybe '75) 'Gone With The Wind - Part 1"" had just finished airing on television when we stepped outside after the movie.  It must have been around 10:30-11pm.  We stepped outside on a cold but clear night and looked at an open field to see a large saucer shape silently move from left to right across the field and over the trees across the course of maybe 10-20 seconds.  It was no more than a few hundred meters away, and appeared to be 30-50 feet across, roughly the same altitude as it measured across.  If you held your hand outstretched and away from your body, it was easily as wide as a large hand hand, if not bigger!  I do not recall any clear features on the top or bottom, however a row of lights or windows around around it's circumference. At the time I thought I could make out figures inside, however it could also have been diffused shadows between the lights, which were ran around the edge between the top/bottom sections. It was hard to tell, as the disc appeared to be slowly rotating. It was a dark night, flying over a poorly lit field, so I can not say for sure if it was a sliver metallic finish, but that was definitely the impression I have always had. There was no wind, and it was completely silent  After it left our field of vision, we stared blankly at the empty field for a few moments before staring at each other without saying a word. We then exchanged looks and went inside. In the weeks that followed I brought it up with my mom, and we both agreed it was strange, and definitely not something conventional like a helicopter or blimp. While driving with my mom in about 2012 she asked if I remembered the 'UFO we saw'. I assumed she had forgotten about the experience, and I was beginning to wonder if I had imagined it, so it was a relief to hear her bring it up. As I never forgot the experience, and had my own clear memory of it, I got her to tell me HER memories of the event before I said anything further, and they matched my recollection perfectly. I only had to remind her what movie we were watching. I offer this in the hope that perhaps it might be 1 small report to help tell a much bigger story  note: The Good Year Blimp was active at the time, with blinking lights/signage. I witnessed it from the viewing deck of the Sears Tower only a few weeks later (at night), and it was definitely not the same. Like many teenage boys I got heavily into aircraft after 'Top Gun' came out.  Friends used to test each other on aircraft identification, sometimes based on photos from just a small sections of the aircraft.  I have also had a passion for all things aerospace, and had been to several airshows as a kid and adult.  While that is a far cry from a 'trained observer,' I have never seen anything even closely resembling what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

This is an anecdotally written description of my experience, originally posted on an internet forum.  I just clipped it in here, with dramatic flair and everything. I will try to stay as precise and clear as I possibly can.  This happened roughly two years ago.  This will be long... I have always wanted to believe, but I'm a natural sceptic to anything and everything.  I believe nothing until you can scientifically prove it, at the same time as I believe everything is possible (because logically everything *is* possible). It was fall 2013, and the Norwegian darkness comes fast when summer is gone.  When I stayed home for a few months it kind of naturally fell upon me to be the one who walked the dog.  My mom got a german shepard a few years back, and I quite like taking him for walks in the forest.  I especially prefer walking in the forest at night, when it's pitch black.  The woods are right next to our neighborhood, so I have easy access and know these woods like the back of my hand.  That's why I'm able to walk it in utter darkness. The time was somewhere around midnight, maybe later, as ((dog's name deleted)) and I went for our nightly walk.  Being night I also let him run free, as there are no chances of him attacking another dog or person.  He can be a bit aggressive (because he's nervous). Anyway, we get to the big clearing we sometimes go to, and stop there to chill out a little. The night sky is clear and the stars are shining beautifully bright.  The dog is running about doing his thing, and I'm just standing there, looking up, dreaming, wishing, HOPING, that one day, maybe, just MAYBE I'd be so lucky as to see something ""magical"".   After about ten minutes of standing like that (felt like a meditation), I suddenly notice a strong, yellowish light far, far away, just over the treeline horizon (which I'm barely able to distinguish from the black sky).  The light was stronger than any other stars - I would say it was four-five times stronger than the strongest star/planet I've ever seen in the sky. At first, it's just hovering there, and I think nothing of it.  It's a bright star at the edge of the horizon, so it gets light-enchanced due to the curvature of the atmosphere, the scientist in me tells me.  Then it slowly starts to move... The motion was fluid, small, but noticeable.  The weak treeline below it gives me a good referance point against the moving light, and it's *definitely* moving.  Back and forth a little.  Up and down a little. Just small movements, no jerking, no sudden anything.  I stand there for 20 minutes watching this, as the light slowly dances above the treeline, and I enjoy the show.  Then I get bored, and go home(!). Yes. I got bored!  Watching a moving light in the sky has limited interest value.  Who knew!?   Next day I regret leaving so soon.  I wished I'd filmed it (even though something in me told me not to), and I wished I'd stayed there for longer.  I'll just go back tonight and have another look-see, I think to myself.  And that evening, about the same time, I went back. Same procedure as last time.  After ten minutes (maybe less) standing in the open space looking up, there suddenly appears a very bright light, quite similar to the one from the day before.  Except this time it appears in the middle of the sky, right above me.  And this time the light isn't slowly moving back and forth, up and down.  This time, it's really dancing across the sky - similar to the movements of Tinker Bell in Peter Pan, or how one of those glowing fluorescent bugs move (we don't have these in Norway though). I am utterly amazed, grateful, dancing, laughing, enjoying the experience.  I swear I can feel I'm telepathically communicating with this light. We dance with eachother and I laugh at how silly I think this must've looked if someone had walked by :P  We enjoy each other's company for a good 20-30 minutes, when alas, boredom strikes again!  Can you believe it!?  I've been waiting to see a UFO my entire life, and here I get it thrown at me TWICE, and I STILL GET BORED!?! Yeah, go figure... Because boredom, I decide I want to up the ante a little.  Take it to the next level. I want MORE. I say out loud ""Show me something crazy.""   Not five seconds later the strangest sound I have ever heard begins 'thumping' from the path that leads into the darkness of the woods.  The dog suddenly becomes attentive to the sound, and stands up right next to me, utterly stiff and still.  His ears and face are peeked towards the sound, which is becoming louder and stronger. To describe it would be to utterly fail, but words are all I got.  Imagine the sound of someone jogging over gravel, and the sound of a tire across a sandy road, and the wings of a bird flapping slowly.  It was like a pulse, throbbing, thomping, swooshing, punching.  Getting louder as it was getting closer. My hairs were standing on the back of my neck, the dog was frozen, and to my frightening surprise I realize the sound isn't coming from the path into the forest.  It's coming from OVER the trees.  I begin to freak out and imagine running wolves coming to eat me alive, or a bear running towards me.  But it's over the trees? I s it a giant owl? But it sounds like someone is biking!  No one is biking in the woods in the middle of the night, c'mon!  My thoughts are quenched by the primal fear that is rising inside me.  The sounds is so intensely loud and close that someone or something is jumping out of that darkness any second! FUCK THIS! I'M OUTTA HERE!! I back up slowly, then hurriedly, then turn around and friggin' run my ass off! The dog is unchained, but I firmly tell him to run right beside me (""Walk nice"" command), and he obeys like never before. I run despite almost falling over several times. The path is known, but the ground is invisible, so each step is a step of trust. The walk back home usually takes around 10 minutes or so. We were home in less than 2.  Inside, safely at home, I shake off the fear, but I don't get much rest that night... Day after I still feel a lingering fear, and I decide I should face it and head back out tonight. At around midnight again, I take the dog and we go towards the 'entrance' to the forest. The path leads into the woods as a door in through a wall. A wall of blackness. Fear increases again as I approach it. Hesitant. Actually scared. We walk a few feet into the forest, and the dog suddenly starts squeezing himself around my legs, walking around me, suddenly stopping and looking straight ahead into the nothingness, begins to growl. OKAY HELL NO GTF OUTTAHERE! We sprint-walk back home, and I didn't walk the dog for a week.",2015-07-31T00:00:00,,

I have seen UFO's before; such as a dim moving ""star"" that would glow bright red and cause other stars to all but disappear.  I, however, never felt the need to report it, since I didn't have much of a description besides what I wrote in the sentence above and it didn't really look all that exciting either. That all changed the night before last night.  Me and a friend of mine were walking to the local gas station to buy some cigarettes, as I was looking towards my friend my eyes were drawn towards the night sky by the most surreal/gorgeous thing I have ever seen. It had white (hot?) ball that was leading the descent and that ball was surrounded in a green light -Im not sure what an aura is but thats how I always pictured one-that extended backwards into the bright green (and very long…at least 10X the diameter of the white ball/rock) tail.  I actually got a little lightheaded from seeing something so cartoonish shoved into my reality.  It looked like a moving painting with how bright and vivid it was against the night sky. The smoke trail was still visible cutting infront of the moon. Here are some reasons why it seemed strange to me: - It was so jaw droppingly surreal and incredibly larger than the meteors/comets that I would see on youtube - There was not a single sound, although it looked so big that I expected it had hit  somewhere close by, but I can't even find other sightings let alone an impact. There was no flaring up of what I assume were the green flames, instead it maintained a uniform color/burn during the couple of seconds it was in my view. I don't know if answers are given here, but if there's anyway someone know what that was or has seen something like that please let me know. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello, Thank you for replying so promptly.  It could have been anything since this is the first thing of its kind that Ive ever seen.  But I will say that that I spent a significant amount of time between then and now trying to find a picture or video similar to what I saw.  I found green fireballs and green meteors but the ones i saw all seemed to have yellow or orange flames at the tip of the tail or even along the entire tail. This one's tail was glowing green and is the part that caught my eye the most.  I'm really interested to know if its normal that meteors can appear to be so close and vivid yet make no sound?  Are there any resources that you would know of besides this website to find out who else has seen this in the area so I could try to find a photo, I already miss the view. Thank you, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",2015-08-13T00:00:00,44.0479,-93.226

It was about 9:00 p.m. and had just gotten totally dark.   I was turning the corner from the bike/jogging path, along the main highway, into my subdivision.  I was walking south, when I looked up saw this light.  It was red, white and blue, and blinking like a strobe light.  It was moving quite fast to the east towards the Atlantic Ocean.    I'm right under one of the flight paths to Miami International Airport so I see blinking lights all the time.  This light seemed to be moving much too fast for an aircraft.  This was different.  I thought must be a plane but why is it moving so fast???   It didn't make any noise and I couldn't tell how high up it was and thought..  Drone???  The lights pulsed and flashed like a strobe light.   I walked as fast as I could nearing my street which faces east trying to keep an eye on it. It was moving east and I couldn't keep up with it as it went behind the tree line.  Then standing on my street I was able to catch this extremely fast moving light. It had turned now moving more northerly.  The strobe lights had split into two sections one on the right, the other on the left going on/off alternately. What perplexed me was this was just a single multi-color strobe was now two lights alternating and seemed very wide apart.  I thought maybe a banking airplane, and now I was able to see the lights on both wings.  The lights jumped back and forth in a zigzag fashion.  They weren't on a straight line of sight, as one would see on aircraft wings.  The strobes blinked in an 8 o'clock and 2 o'clock configuration and then changed to a 10 o'clock and 4 o'clock going back and forth.

The craft was traveling south bound, just east of Hwy 521 in Indian Land, and west of Providence Road in Waxhaw, paralleling both roads.   At first, I thought it was a private aircraft, due to several airports in the area, but as I work nights, I am familiar with the regular approach and departure patterns for the airport, and this craft was low, and traveling at a very high rate of speed, much faster than a normal aircraft.   The body of the craft appeared black, and I was unable to make out any detail or cockpit.  I did not hear any sound from the craft.

The sighting time was somewhere around 21:20 because I came into my house, explained to my dad what I had just seen, used the restroom and sent my significant other a text about the sighting at 21:26.   I was driving home from work that Wednesday evening.  My shift ended at 21:00.  I was in the home stretch.  As I turned onto a back road I saw some really bright lights in front of me in the dark sky.  The light was bright white and almost like a starburst.  It was brighter and larger than a light on any airplane I have ever seen.  There were three lights clustered close together in a vertical line. The lights were hovering.  As one light went out for a few seconds the top light lit up.  Then the light that was out reappeared.  This continued a few times.  The lights would disappear and reappear randomly.  I kept an eye on it for as long as I could while I turned into my neighborhood.  When I parked in my driveway I could no longer find it.  My sighting lasted no longer than a minute and a half.  During this experience I did not hear anything.  I was so unsure of what was happening that I forgot I even owned a phone… Therefore, I have no documentation. I had brushed my sighting to the side and forgot about it until today.  My mom was listening to Coast to Coast Am talk show online when I got home from work.  She was listening to the program for August 6, 2015.  There was a segment about UFO sightings.  She heard about a sighting in Palmyra, Pennsylvania, which is not too far from us.  That sighting happened on the same day and around the same time.  This is what provoked me to look further into what I saw.  I googled “UFO sightings August 2015, PA”.

What caught my attention was the rhythmically appearing red ""ring"" that appeared every 2 seconds or so.  The red was an amazing light or ring, I can't describe it.  But the red rhythmically appearing pulse was something I'd never seen before.  It made me think of Venus' rings, I don't know why.  I wanted to use my iPhone to video it, but I was too amazed.  It disappeared out of my sight just because of the buildings that were too high to see it anymore.   I was hoping I wasn't the only one who saw it.  I was in the street among dozens of cars and I almost expected people to pull over to talk about it or video it, but maybe since they are car-people, they weren't able to see it as easily as me; a bike-person. :) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.

At about 8:45 pm, my wife and I heard a boy tell his mom to come outside and look at the lights in the night sky.  His insistence made us go outside and take a look.   We immediately saw in the southern sky 3 very bright, stationary lights that were in a large triangle formation.  The lights were much brighter than any star or planet and were many times larger than the planet Jupiter appears at its brightest.  It was hard to tell how far away they were, but they appeared to be thousands of feet high.  The lights could have been separate or part of a much larger object because their relative distances did not vary during the observation.  There was a ¼ moon in the northwestern sky and because of the proximity to Santa Barbara, most of the stars in the sky were very dim.  It was impossible to miss these 3 bright objects.  We waited for the lights to move, but they stayed stationary for over a minute, then 1 by 1 each light slowly dimmed and then went out.   Almost immediately after the last light went out, a small glowing cloud or smudge, as we called it, appeared away from the original triangle formation and started to move rapidly across the sky—heading out towards the ocean.   It dropped quickly toward the ocean and followed a long path which took it many miles away into a western part of the night sky.  In less than 10 seconds, it disappeared behind the Santa Barbara channel Islands over 20 miles away.   Each of these events occurred without any noise.

I was driving down a long stretch of straight, unlit road, myself being the only one within eyesight traveling towards St. Augustine.  I came across a truck on the side of the road with hazards flashing.  As I approached the vehicle, I noticed there was a tall figure standing outside the truck, seemingly hopeful that a passerby would stop and help.  I felt drawn to help as I got closer to the truck, though in my mind I told myself I wouldn’t be of much use because I did not have a jack or other repair tools in my car.  I passed the truck and made eye contact with the figure whose features I was unable to make out.  In the moments immediately following me passing the truck, I felt a sudden immense feeling of dread and negative energy, as if whatever scene I had just passed was hiding an extremely evil energy. 	A minute or two after passing the truck, I noticed behind me what looked to be a motorcycle light, though I knew it couldn’t be because it was too high off the ground.  At first, I was uneasy because I didn’t recall any vehicles behind me.  I continued to stare at it to try to figure out what was causing it but then looked up at the road to make sure I was not headed for a collision and looked back.  Upon doing so, I saw that the light had moved in what was literally eye-blink speed to within a foot or two of the rear of my car.    Describing the object, it was a spherical, orb-like ball of light with what looked to be a cylindrical metallic body that hung below it, similar to the letter I, where the light was the dot and the metallic body was the line.   This went on for a good 30 to 40 seconds until another car’s lights appeared around the bend ahead.  I looked to see the car and looked back and the light was gone.  Two or so minutes after the car had passed and was out of s! ight, the orb appeared again at its original position, not tailgating me.   Another car came and once again I was at a loss as the light disappeared.  As I was approaching the end of the road where it ultimately splits into two lanes that lead through an urban area, the light appeared again.  It stayed with me until I left the one lane road.  Here, the light slowed down, eventually coming to a halt at the end of the road and rising to just above the tree line where it then again disappeared for good.",2015-10-16T00:00:00,29.682126923076922,-81.6886423076923

The object left a short black streak in its wake before leaving the Earth's deep orbit. The object achieved greater than light speed due to an observable black streak or absence of light. The event did not cause silence of animals nor insects.  The event did not cause a feeling of emptiness or parole.  Only the fiery spheres cause this type of event on the ground. Based on this observation, it was a different species than the red fiery orbs.  The red fiery orbs move at an altitude of approximately 1000 to 2000 feet and much slower. I have observed 4 of the red fiery orbs over the past 2 years.  I only include that because you are most interested in the red fiery orbs.  The silence on the ground and the feeling of emptiness and/or parole seems to be a natural defense.  I have watched the trail of sightings of these red fiery orbs reported so I felt it not necessary to do so. The fact that this seems to be a different species, I felt more compelled to report the event. I felt as if it was looking for something very specific.  On a most personal note, I felt compelled to stay with it and keep watching.  I actually ran to clear the trees to keep watching.  I experienced a feeling of extreme enthusiasm and deep curiosity like a child would.  When I observed the object moving away from the area at an extreme high rate of speed I had a feeling of almost sadness.  Something close to abandonment.  The feeling was almost opposite the red fiery orbs. I have also observed other objects maneuvering in the sky in different states in the US.  The past 20 to 25 years I have observed several objects but in the past 2 years I have observed almost as many.  Activity of these objects has increased almost exponentially.",2015-10-09T00:00:00,38.21121446765155,-85.68918456444217

I'm not sure where I was en route to Toledo, OH, on I-90W, but I asked the toll guard at the Rte 75 exit -  where I could still see it straight ahead, ""What is that? Is that a BLACK hot air balloon?""  She looked out of the toll booth, looking behind her to where I was pointing and said, ""I guess it could be."" I drove off, mumbling to an uninterested, tired daughter.  On a stormy, scattered shower Sunday evening?  Pure black?  No flags, color? Never seeming to raise or lower at all, nor change direction? It had to be immense. It looked the same size and angle for miles.  I last saw it after I have exited and drove S of Perrysburg, OH on 475W/23N and it appeared to be due North, so either it moved West to North while appearing stationary, or it was over Lake Erie the whole time and I was watching it as I wrapped around from west of Fremont, towards Toledo.  My 6 y/o just assumed it was a hot air balloon - ""Can we go ride ojn one some day? but it was too huge, if it was...and seemingly stationary, and evenly pitch black. I have to think SOMEONE driving West on the busy Ohio Turnpike other than us may have seen it and wondered.  So unassuming unless you really think about the size, unchanging color, image and stationary position that made me think about stopping to take a picture, but not wanting to be alarmist or impede getting home.

Observance occurred while sitting in the outdoor patio area of the LOS ANGELES MUSIC CENTER COMPLEX at approximately 6:00pm.  I was facing east and  observed two normal commercial flight patterns.  One was a quad-jet jumbo at a fairly high altitude, probably  enroute to Europe.  The others were  a series of aircraft doing their normal circle around downtown Los Angeles on their final approach to LAX.  I think these are somewhere about 6,000 feet or so. At one point I notice something in the sky near the “whispy” light cloud cover. My first reaction was to questions the flight pattern.  It was not a normal LAX approach nor was it an approach to Santa Monica Airport which normally occurs further north.  The object initially appeared to have alternating right and left side lights, somewhat similar to landing lights on commercial aircraft landing at night.   As it traveled further west, I realized that they were not lights but seemed to be the sun reflecting off of some sort of metallic panels on either side of a vertical  cigar-shaped object.  I brought the object to the attention of my friend.  His first reaction was that it was definitely not an airplane nor helicopter, as its appearance was not in coordination with either of these type of air vehicles. I continued to watch the object for about a minute or so. I was then distracted with the screaming of young children in the area.  I went back to look at the sky and the object was gone.  I continued to scan the sky, but never saw it again.",2015-09-29T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

Since it was very cloudy throughout most of the valley, I became a little bored and started to look around the sky.  Upon looking at the mountain behind our house I noticed a couple white dots hovering over the mountain.  I thought they were airplanes at first because that is a normal route that is used when they are coming in to land at McCarran Airport.  After a few minutes went by they still had not moved any closer and stayed in the same area.  I then noticed more lights appearing next to them, there were approximately 6-8 more lights that appeared right next to each other.  I was able to see the lights moving around from left to right and a few of them would disappear then reappear for the next few minutes.  After another minute went by we had seen more lights appear closer to us, but still over the mountain.  As this was happening we noticed what appeared to be lights comi! ng down the side of the mountain.  There were probably at least 30 objects moving down alongside the mountain.  As this was happening my wife started to freak out and pulled me inside of the house.  She started to have a panic attack so I had to tend to her for the rest of the night.  Where we viewed the objects moving down the mountain I did not know that there was trail that high up.  I had found this out the next day using google earth and verified that these lights were moving down that same trail.  We live approximately 300 ft. away from the mountain and will normally hear vehicles or off-road vehicles driving on the road below the trail.  There was no sound at all and the lights appeared to be hovering over the ground.  I also thought that they may have been people walking/running on the trail, but that didn’t explain the lights hover above the mountain.  All of the lights seen were large and very bright; they were definitely bigger than a flashlight and probably bigger! than the size of a headlight.  They were definitely not flares or any other type of aircraft,   I was in the military and I know how planes and flares move.  The mountain I am referencing is called “Desert Hills” right in the corner of Blue Diamond Rd.  and Fort Apache Rd.",2015-09-29T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

I'm 16 years old and I have seen shooting stars before.  This was nothing like one.   And in my opinion I believe there is life else where.  I'd just never thought I would be reporting something like this.   I don't know how to any more explain what I saw.

We left the restaurant at 8:15 to go back to her residence and started walking south on South Sandusky Street.  We made a right on Spring St. towards South Franklin where the car was parked.  We passed a paint store and came to an open lot with a relatively open view of the sky.   As we were walking, I noticed a red, almost pinkish, light through breaks in the northerly cloud bank.  A front was passing the area and cloud deck was low over the city and I thought that a Chicago flight was descending through the clouds to land at Port Columubs 30 miles south.  There is always heavy air traffic over the city.   I directed my girlfriend's attention to the light and we saw that it was descending through the cloud in an unusual manner.  The light suddenly disappeared and in its place was a jet black disk that slowly moved south.   We both had, pardon the expression, a WTH moment.  The disk was the size of a half dollar piece, held at arm's lenth, and silent.   Now this is where it gets eerie.  As the disk moved south I half joking said, ""Why don't you stop.""  As if it heard me the craft immediately stopped and hovered, maintaining its altitude.  The craft was tilted slightly to us and we could see that it had a spinning band around the middle.  We could also see that the upper portion of the craft was lit and illuminating the cloud cover above it.   We had an uneasy feeling that whoever was in the craft was observing us observing them.   It hovered for two minutes and then resumed a south eastern direction over the Ohio Wesleyan campus and was gone.   We also saw the disk was wobbling as it left.  Delaware is a growing bustling city with heavy retail traffic on Friday and Saturday.   Surely someone else should have seen this.   Thanks for reading my entry.",2015-07-17T00:00:00,40.2827,-83.0559

We live in North York, Toronto and we are very close to the Pearson International Airport. We see hundreds of airplanes flying over our heads on a daily basis. At around 21.31PM, we saw from the basement window an orange oval craft that was flying mid-air through the sky. We were surprised to see something flying at such a low altitude, and of such a distinct and luminous color. I promptly jumped off the couch and started following the orange light as it was moving left from my point of view.  I have followed the movement of the orange craft as long as I could before it went off sight, as I wasn’t able to look past my neighbors’ trees.  I started running upstairs and left my bungalow and, once in the driveway, I could still see the orange light moving towards the Goddard/Waterloo intersection (which is north from where my house is). The orange craft kept this very peculiar, almost fluid motion in the sky for about other 20 seconds. When I got closer to the Goddard Street/Waterloo Avenue intersection, I have noticed, as always, two airplanes flying in opposite directions.  One was on its way to landing at Pearson International Airport; the other one, instead, had just taken off from the same airport.  In between them there still was the orange oval craft.  Compared to the two airplanes, it was pretty amazing to notice how the craft did not present any other lights that could possibly resemble an airplane or any other known aircraft. My wife was still able to see the orange craft from the driveway. The craft stood there for a few more seconds before it disappeared before our eyes in the dark, blue sky.  The other two airplanes were still following their trajectories.",2015-08-27T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

The thing that interested me was it's size and speed.  Once it got closer to town its light turned off completely but you could still vaguely see its outline.  While that was moving without lights, an even larger but much quicker light appeared to my left some distance away from the original light object.  It traveled away from me until coming to a point and stopping, which it stayed there the remander of the night.  After awhile, I saw #1s light come on again, and at this point it stopped.  Then moved diagonally to the left, then straight up, and then continued into the town, it was at this point I saw 3 more lights come from the same direction and do the same.  It was a minute or so inbetween. A short while later, I saw abother large light coming in the direction the others had just went.  It turned from a giant yellowish white mass to a very small blue moving dot in an instant and with the change traveled much much faster.  When it was out by the fields it became large.  And seemingly mimicked a star.  At this point I decided I should walk towards it to get a better look.  It didn't seem to be going anywhere, and I had noticed other large moving objects around the fields suddenly stop and look like stars.  It was kind of unsettling. After awhile of walking towards the object, I saw that it was above an overgrown field I could not walk into.  Besides this was another field that was mainly dirt and dying remainders of plants.  I saw a smaller object come from the direction of the light and head towards another of the once moving lights that was above the dirt field.  It was extremely low to the ground.  So much so that even with it being night time I could easily make out an outline which was reminded me of a flat skipping stone.  While the smaller object headed for the second light, I noticed the first light ""danced"" every so often.  It made motions up, down, side to side, diagonal, and loops and circular motions.  It really didn't seem to have any reasoning behind the movement. I started to leave feeling uncomfortable and as I walked back I noticed in a 3rd field another dancing light that was growing very large, then dimming to my front and left, then to my front right I saw a massive moving light that I believe to be a meteorite.  It was very bright blue and was only in sight for a second before disappating.  On my way home (less then 2 blocks) I also saw two shooting stars.  The reason I bring this up is because my feeling at the time was the lights had an interest in this stuff.  Anyway I ended up sitting outside watching these lights dance about and periodically set themselves in different spots in the sky till almost 3am.  They would move sometimes just bluntly to a new spot then all the sudden stop and stay in the new spot awhile or would make the dancing motion and stop in a different spot.  When the second way happened it was always shorter distance change but still very obvious.  For most the night I took note of four main large lights but du! ring that time I spent my energy mostly observing the closest one, which was very active.  It moved in the same line, up down, u shape movements as before. It also would dim greatly and then get very large.  It changed color from blue, red, white, and yellow. Moving lights would come seemingly from nowhere underneath or around the big object usually all at once then with a cool off period.  I saw both a beam and smaller floating objects come from the 4 large lights.  The beam came from a light behind my house that had been moving to the fields.  The beam went straight ahead of the object and then another to its side. During this time I also saw three more shooting stars, one looked like it almost hit the object in the sky, and it promptly moved out of the way.  I saw another meteor as well which was also abnormally large and also was out of sight in a flash.  It had a green tail instead of blue.  There were several lights of red that flashed a lot that seemingly paroled the area the entire span of these hours as well.  They would make circles around moving slowly and one in particular on three separate occasions got so close to the big light object I thought they would hit each other.  Each time the ball of light would move.  This red light object looked like a normal plane. I made an observation. And an experiment took place, at which I could get a reaction from the light, and it's behavior changed completely.  I would like for now what took place with that to be kept to myself.  But I think it's important to say I did experience the object react to certain things someone did on the ground. I am 28 years old. I don't have a degree, I'm a cook at a restaurant.  I have no photographic or video evidence to back this up.  But I also have no history of mental illness.  I also have nothing but redicule to gain as well as lost time writing this.  So, I assume this won't help anyone figure out anytime soon what these objects were, aliens, atmospheric stuff, easily explained things etc.  But that's my account of what I saw around my house.",2015-08-27T00:00:00,,

Filed by Melinda Leslie, Director of UFO Sighting Tours, Sedona. At approximately 10:00 p.m., or just before, my 6 clients and I (7 people total) were out on a UFO Sighting Tour with Military Night Vision Goggles when we all saw 2 large amber colored triangle shape objects with our naked eyes.  These traveled from the northwest area of the sky beyond Airport Mesa in a southward direction toward Cathedral Rock.  The 7 witnesses were standing together on Chavez Ranch Road turnout area.   The 2 objects then made an arching turn as they headed easterly toward the Chapel of the Holy Cross area and then disappeared to the North over Munds Mountain.   All witnesses were absolutely astonished and continued to discuss sighting event for duration of the tour. 4 of the witnesses clearly saw that these were 2 distinct structured, hard edged, dark triangle shaped craft each with 3 amber or orange colored lights on the bottom, one light at each corner.   Both craft were seen by the 4 witnesses with their naked eyes, without the Night Vision goggles.  2 other witnesses saw them at close range, but initially thru the goggles and could not make out the shape, only that they were huge lights.  One of these witnesses is a retired airline pilot with over 40 years of professional experience.  He stated emphatically that these 2 objects were remarkably faster than any plane he’d ever seen and that they were very low, much lower than commercial aircraft.  When these 2 witnesses lowered their goggles, they and I together saw that these were 2 very large amber colored lights, but unfortunately we did not see the distinct triangle shapes, each with 3 lights, as did my other 4 clients.  All 7 of us saw the 2 objects make an arched turn while banking and continued to watch them as they disappeared over Munds Mountain.  Please see the diagram below. Additionally, when these 2 craft were on initial approach, at the same time, a military jet at very high altitude passed over us and then another one did again as these 2 objects headed northeast.  All 7 witnesses commented that the 2 UFOs were considerably lower than either of the 2 jets.  It is difficult to judge the distance from us, but all the witnesses expressed that the UFOs were at most a few thousand feet, or less above us.  All 6 clients expressed that they are willing to be interviewed. Unfortunately we were so caught up in the event that none of us grabbed our cell phones to get a photo of the UFOs or take a video.  Darn it!  I did create a computer diagram drawing that I will email as instructed by you below.

My cousin has worked in military and is familiar with helicopters and other aircraft.   Neither me nor him heard any noise, nor did his aunt, but another witness said they heard  a noise such as an aircraft.  We as well as other saw 2 to 3 different lights hovering, blinking off and on.  Sometimes pulsing off and on.  Sometimes solid colors and sometimes changing colors, mostly white lights, but also red, blue, and other colors.  I believe a witness or two call the union police depth and some other organization, not for sure if local airport, etc., and said there were no planes or helicopters reported in area.  One of the lights would be the brightest, brighter  than any aircraft or planet,  I did not witness any other days, but on June 24 the next night 2 lights were back.    I also saw about a week before that the St Louis news channel called fox2now.Com had a reports from many witnesses of strange lights around the union and at Louis area a week before all of this.  On other occassions, I have seen lights before that hover over the past few years.  I have memories from my child hood from ages as early as 5 to 12 years old of missing time and also sleep walking multiple times,  I grew up in my grandparents home, and my sleep walking going getting out if bed and going outside got so bad, sometimes they would stay up to watch me and also add extra locks on doors so it would cause it to be harder for me to get outside.  And I also remember stories that my grandmother told about seeing a strange light and entity while her, my grandpa v and their kids were in the car.  And in the late 1980s there was a documented report that my grandpa's broth! er my great uncle had a crop circle on his farm, he told pepol! e he had seen a craft and also an entity and talked to them, but alot of people on our town made fun of him and he never spoke of it again, my grand parents are no longer living, but my great uncle is.  I just know for years I've seen things I can't explain and with my sleep walking and missing time I would like to find out what has went on for all my life.  When I was a child, I would sometimes have bruises or marks on my chest arms and legs that could not explain, a few in my adult life. I've done research over the years and heard about hypnosis.  If a person could put me in contact with someone who done that I would be willing to do that if I could possibility find out answers to make sure I'm haven't lOSS my mind or dreamed things up.  I know this a lot of information over my life, but once I started reporting the recent sighting I thought I never say or report anything. I thought I would get all this off my chest.

Obviously as we talked we had casual glances away from the sky but at one point one of the guys pointed to a “really bright” star that wasn't there earlier. We were discussing whether or not that was the case and that we probably just didn't notice it before when all of a sudden and as we were all looking at it, it looked like 6 “stars” came “from” this bright star and made a evenly spaced pattern or formation around it. NOW we were all focused on this what ever it was. The 6 “stars” nor the brighter center star moved for awhile as we watched then, the 6 “stars” sped off at very high speed in different directions as the larger “star” remained. High speed in this case means from standing stop to ZIP across the entire sky in a split second or actually less and GONE. Now we are suggesting and discussing that these aren't “stars”.  LOL  The larger … craft disappeared. Like the lights were just shut off. Some time later, the larger craft “came back” as we could see the bright light again and at the same location. It sat there for awhile by itself then all of a sudden all of the other 6 craft at very high speed, reformed around the brighter craft, stayed at those positions for a brief period of time then, all at the same time, at very high speed became one with the larger craft. The larger craft then stayed for a short period of time, maybe about 20 minutes, then it just disappeared like the lights were shut off. The lights of the smaller craft were not as bright as the larger craft. The lights of any of them flickered. The coloration of the lights were the same which was what I will call typical star light white. This was my first UFO sighting and experience.",,40.5641,-81.4836

Our neighborhood was having fireworks displays and we were watching fireworks go off in sky.  There was a break in the fireworks and all 3 of us noticed a rounded, reddish orange shaped object moving in a straight line from south to north.   When we first saw it, we thought 2 things--it was a piece of a firework, yet it did not ignite or dissolve the way a firework should.  It remained intact and moved mechanically straight.   Second, we thought it could be the ISS which we track sometimes in the night sky through Spaceweather.com, but the ISS was not scheduled to be seen in our sky this night.   We observed the object make a sharp, sideways motion, then it appeared to ascend into the sky.  My daughter captured this on her cellphone.    Approximately ten minutes later, we another same shaped, colored object again moving south to north in a straight line.  This time I told my daughter to go get my binoculars, just in case we saw another one.    Ten minutes later, we saw another identically shaped, same colored object moving again from south to north in a straight line and we visually tracked it this time with my binoculars.  She tracked it approx. a half block through the binoculars into the night sky, continuing in a north trajectory, straight line.  She said it was ball shaped in configuration, no lights on the object.   As I said, we reasoned it could be fireworks, but the movement of these objects were straight line, with one making a sharp straight line movement, and they were not attached to any firework.   Also, they were all ball shaped, as my daughter clearly described using binoculars.   In all we saw 3 objects, all identical.

My husband and I were asleep in our king size bed, we sleep very close together.  However, it felt like a dream.  I woke up on the far left side of the bed, with a grey type alien at the foot end of the bed, probing around my stomach area.  My body was very heavy, it took all I had to lift my arm towards my husband.  I didn’t feel any pain, but I remember being so scared and trying to scream and reach for my husband.  I couldn’t open my mouth to scream so I was screaming with my mouth closed and my husband was out of my reach, which is extremely unusual for us to be so far apart.   That is all that I remember, but when I actually woke up, I opened my eyes and reached for my hubby and he was out of my reach and I was at the far side of the bed.   Later that day, we went to Tulum, Mexico.  We were taking alot of pictures, as my camera shoots 7 frames per second.   When we got home after reviewing our pictures closer, we realized that we believe we got a picture of the UFO.  It is only in one frame and it is almost in the middle of the frame.  I blew it off as a bird, but it is not in any other pictures.  The more I look at it, the more I think it is a UFO.

After seeing the HUGE number of reports of objects similar to what I saw I felt I needed to report this. I was at Gas Works Park for the fireworks display last year and I had my iPhone out to try and take pictures of the Chinook helicopter that carries the American flag on a lap around Lake Union before the fireworks start.  As I was looking around the sky I noticed three bright orange lights moving around slowly making no noticeable noise.  I took three photos of the lights over the course of 1 or 2 minutes while I was pointing them out to my friends. There were aircraft in the air and skydivers coming down from them as part of the show, but I am convinced these lights were something different altogether.  I have gone skydiving and live next to a small airport and I know the sound of those small planes fairly well. As bright as these objects were they would have been making some kind of sound if they were small planes or helicopters.
